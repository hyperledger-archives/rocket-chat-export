Earlier we have been using hyperledger fabric v0.5 and v0.6 with vagrant and successfully developed various sample applications. Now we want to switch to v1.0. Though we are following the steps given on "http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-setup/devenv.html", but somehow we are facing issues while setting up development environment. Is membersrvc.yaml file replaced with fabric-cop? Thanks in advance.

</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 15:27:20 GMT):<br/>
@SyneBlockChainTeam i suggestg going to the fabric-crypto channel and asking your question for now
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 21:28:12 GMT):<br/>
@SyneBlockChainTeam , fabric-ca is the right channel.

Hi, I'm Computer science (in Software languages) student in my final year. I was discussing my thesis project with my professor and I want to do something with blockchain. I thought to create a debugger that allows to debug the state and the smart contact. Is this feasable? and with whom can I discuss this?

@JoVercammen hi.  Just a thought.  With respect to fabric, @greg.haskins has does some very interesting work wrt to higher level concepts on top of chaincode ('contracts').  Perhaps he could give some guidance with respect to your desired topic as it pertains to fabric.

I have been looking into the v 1.0 architecture. One question is not clear. Is there one communications infrastructure that the ordering service and peer are concurrently on (so that the all see all messages) or is there an instance of the communications infrastructure for the peers and a separate instance for the ordering service?

Identity WG Call April 19, 2016 at 12 EDT. Details in wiki link https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/identity/identity-wg.

Proposed Agenda:

Welcome new comers into the group and get reasons for participation.
Work on short term goals, identify volunteers for the following items in the paper and a timeline (we will aim for a draft of some of these items by Monday the 24th to continue work at the hackfest)
a. Current Interfaces: Description of Indy, Fabric, Iroha, Monax, STL.
b. Extract the common elements from these interfaces to describe an “ideal” Identity Interface
c. Read the Requirements WG paper and map to Identity requirements
d. Description of CA vs DiD- i.e. Central Authority vs Distributed Identity and their interoperation and how Identity component will operate in the context of Legacy systems and heterogeneous DLTs.
e. Read and get data from Architecture Working Group on Identity to incorporate or link to in our paper

Tentative Volunteers from what I remember are: Jan Kamenisch, Nathan George, Drummond Reed, Sean Bohan, Daniela Merella
If there are any I am forgetting, please speak up if you are on the call.
I will cross post this on tsc chat and architecture wg chat as well as the technical-discuss and tsc mailing lists.

Hyperledger Fabric (GO or Java) question - (1) how to get Ethereum like "msg.sender" in chaincode (smart contract)? (2) When chaincode A calls chaincode B, will the msg.sender be address of A (like in Ethereum)?

@Rupertredding This channel is for the Architecture WG which is independent of any specific framework, so this is the wrong channel for your question, try #chaincode-dev or #fabric-java-chaincode instead
</p>
<p><strong>Rupertredding</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 16:32:15 GMT):<br/>
@lehors Thank you. I posted #chaincode-dev earlier. No response. Answer to this query is very critical to our decision on use of Hyperledger as our blockchain. Is there any other forum/group-email where I can get some response?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 17:26:56 GMT):<br/>
@Rupertredding first you need to be careful not to confuse hyperledger and fabric
hyperledger is the consortium and it now hosts several projects, several of which are blockchain framework among which is fabric
there are others though, including sawtooth, iroha, indy, burrow and the list keeps on growing

@here ,

Since our collaboration and hence interaction has increased with work on the Identity WG Paper and other work products, we have established a mailing list for Identity WG (Thank you Tracy) which is open to all. Please subscribe. We aim to avoid cross-posting to other mailing lists for continued work on Identity WG related matters. Meeting announcements and other general announcements will continue to be relayed though cross posts as we need to get the word out to as many interested people as possible.

Thanks,
Vipin

The new mailing list is at https://lists.hyperledger.org/mailman/listinfo/hyperledger-identity-wg it is open for subscription

However, if you do meet, the UberConference is scheduled and should start automatically

<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 14:51:34 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt Thanks, we will stick to my Webex for today, and switch to UberConference from the next session. Would like to make sure everyone is OK with it.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 14:55:20 GMT):<br/>
@rjagadee : we ran the PSWG meeting this morning with UberConference. It seems to have resolved the problem people were having with Linux.

<p><strong>stanliberman</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 15:38:17 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 21:09:59 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt we did try Uber conference and we did get it working. Issues: No Voice/Audio on Safari, and no screen sharing support on Firefox. Sounds like Chrome is needed for full features.

</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 14:43:26 GMT):<br/>
Looks like they are aware :  http://help.uberconference.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000456446-Supported-Browsers.  Now I will see if they have plans to support the other browsers for screen sharing.

@rjagadee : np.  Hoping that we can talk about it in our next WG session; however, if you have thoughts of things that we should change, I am happy to do that discussion offline.

Hey everyone, hope all is well. I had to ask you guys, what do I need to learn in order to further my knowledge as far as developing, deploying, and understanding the mechanics of the blockchain technology? All I really know is Linux Sys Admin stuff and some bash scripting. But I've fallen in love with this concept and willing to learn anything that helps.

After our meeting this morning, I put together the following image (https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1cwsioulqDuv8N24o8xvtI6KKBmy7uefZYKcOrvZVDvs/pub?w=1221&h=1254) that lists the different components of a blockchain architecture. This removes the layers from the diagram, and also provides short descriptions for each of the components.  I also added it to the Architecture document.  Let me know if this is a better way of presenting.

Dear friends of the Hyperledger Architecture working group,

Could I ask for your review of the document "After-the-fact mandate changes" (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1psJc9UWuteSzOqIG0VLIdzdlxFb9kq-Csw-dxcjPzEo), please?

The documents describes use cases that require the authorization over a smart contract to be changed after-the-fact without the smart contract getting executed. The document contains the following requirements
Requirement 1: A user (“anchor”) shall be able to sign over its authorization over a smart contract to another user (“guardian”) after the fact. 
1a: The original user (“anchor”) loses its authorization over the smart contract.
1b: The original user (“anchor”) maintains its authorization over the smart contract.
Requirement 2: A blockchain consortium shall be able to sign over the authorization over a smart contract from one user (“anchor”) to another user (“guardian”).
Requirement 3: It should be possible to re-assign the authorization over multiple or all a smart contracts for a user (“anchor”) to another user (“guardian”) in a single action.
Requirement 4: It should be possible to re-assign the authorization over a smart contract back to the original (“anchor”) user.
Requirement 5: The solution to requirements 1-4 shall not require the handing over of private keys.
Requirement 6: The solution to requirements 1-4 shall not require mutability of the blockchain.
Requirement 7: The introduction of a solution to requirements 1-4 should be backward compatible, such that they also apply to smart contracts that predate this introduction.
Requirement 8: The solution to requirements 1-4 may be programmable.

The document has been developed in the Hyperledger RequirementsWG for a month now, and it is close to getting finalized. So this would be a good time to ask for your review.

Looking forward to your reviews, comments and suggestions. Thank you!

Best regards,

Oskar

No PIN needed 
Regional dial in numbers can be found here: https://www.uberconference.com/international

1. Eligibility for electors for tsc, identity working group participants.
2. An analysis of confidentiality & privacy topics as it relates to identity: We will use the base paper https://www.r3.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/survey_confidentiality_privacy_R3.pdf, this is a public paper from the R3 site.
3. Legal & regulatory underpinning for Identity- we will continue the discussion with reps from the Government sector (infrachain) and possibly a legal expert, may not happen until next meeting (August 9)
4. Verifiable claims (possibly with help from our friends from Indy/Sovrin)
5. Hope to have reworked material from our prior meetings as well as other contributions into the White paper. (mainly biometrics, Legal, use case around key management presented by Oskar DV)
6. Please take another look at the biometrics paper that Danny Bathen @berserkr  produced. He presented four weeks ago. Please enter comments for https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YaQo5Yd2ooDurKhL_iGWkHO5KuNFA9L50GkXCs3LqeA/edit We need to aborb the salient points into our whitepaper.

@rjagadee : Nice work and good place for starter like me to understand architecture of the project. Couple of questions.
1. How can I know next similar document releases ? Any place we need to keep eye on ?
2.  One overview question on high level architecture. How consensus established in parties ? Is it completely upon to the application which build through SDK or is there a high level agreement framework which people can use in their applications (with something like policy language) ?

Hi I want to run a blockchain POC on Hyperledger but not totally sure of the infrastructure requirements. Say there are 3 companies which will have a copy of the Blockchain according to PBFT there should be 4 nodes (3f+1) how does this translate to validating,non validating peers, ordering peers, endorsers etc ?

Hi, i'm quite new to hyperledger fabric, although i've been reading some articles on how to setup a blockchain network, i cant find anything that show how to setup without using docker images.
we would want to start with our own network setup, from the scratch in order for us to get our hands dirty to fully understand how the hyperledger fabric network works
is there any guide or channel about this?

Hey , I had a query, because the node SDK keeps all the certificates and keys in artifacts. So I think we need to have one node app for each and every organization(or pehaps every peer), that only have certificates for their organization's peer?? 
</p>

@CodeReaper best answered in a fabric rocket chat "channel" The little I know, the ledgers are separate and isolated cross channel.

<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 17:56:27 GMT):<br/>
@nage perhaps we can merge it back with the Arch-Doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bdr4MdnpUvv_3jN5DYSNp1ctjKGPH7K_yiMSQYcwBBo/, so that we have one place to go
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 17:58:41 GMT):<br/>
I am not opposed to that.  At the time we wanted to explore the structure of the doc and make sure the right parts could be written by the Identity WG.  I’m not sure if those document structure issues have been sufficiently resolved, but I like the idea of consolidation generally.  If you have time to try merging it back in, let us know how it goes.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 18:00:09 GMT):<br/>
It probably makes sense to have a position paper like the smart contract and consensus papers on system identity, perhaps this paper should remain as the start of that topic-specific doc?

@nage : We could definitely use the paper as a position paper for system identity. Is that the next paper that we would like to work on when the smart contract paper is finished?

@nage @rjagadee I am all for keeping it separate at least for now and merging back salient parts into main doc. This way we can work on these separately-this seems to be a workable solution for big docs as we concentrate on specific sections. In the Identity WG docs we have Biometrics and now GDPR in separate docs.

Hi everyone. i hope you can help me with a doubt. If for instance I deploy a channel with two nodes, each of them running the network locally, how is exactly the connection to Hyperledger Fabric and what happens if Hyperledger Fabric becomes down?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 20:57:15 GMT):<br/>
@maaar1234 There is no global Hyperledger Fabric.  That channel you are running locally is *your* fabric network
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 20:59:16 GMT):<br/>
Also #fabric-questions is probably a better channel to ask questions about Fabric

Hi All - have a question around scalability of a HL network. Say, I have 5 peers in the network and one of them passes IOT stream like transactions. This involves around 500million transactions(blocks) writes to the network. Can you please comment if the nodes for the specific peer can be auto-scaled. If so, do you have an example reference architecture for it
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 20:08:57 GMT):<br/>
@ArchanGanguly 500m txns/day or /hour or /year - the way I have seen iOT streams handled is to put some kind of aggregate or breaches on the blockchain; if you are talking about HL Fabric in particular please post on the Fabric channel- this is a general purpose architecture WG dealing with all the DLTs under incubation...
</p>
<p><strong>ArchanGanguly</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 00:38:31 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @VipinB - have posted in the fabric channel. Btw, the 500million is for initial load of data(transactions) when the peer joins the network - all of these are pre-existing data to be written to the network to start with. Then subsequently there can be 1million per/hr that can be written to the network.

There is also an extensive writeup on the supplychain use case in the Requirements WG documents- approach that through the wiki please. Also they have a channel on RocketChat

Hi - new to the channel and have a business logic question re use of blockchain. Would it be appropriate to track, say technical specifications of a software development project in a blockchain. Because specs are not executed transactions, are likely to change, will require history of the updates. But will be eventually completed

For those who have pending work items on the Smart Contract draft (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BKyxyMbSu-I0vjwC-OicLGZyWEPPLbparEkJOGeksh0/ ) - it would be great if you can complete by the next meeting on 17th Jan.

Here's the link to WAVE... a system for decentralized authorization building on blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:23:29 GMT):<br/>
https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2017/EECS-2017-234.html
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:23:42 GMT):<br/>
its a very nice mirror for identities
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:27:24 GMT):<br/>
I usually separate these in my head as verifying that a user "has permission to do action A" and then "what the user proposed is indeed a valid action A".
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:27:34 GMT):<br/>
does anyone know of a contract language (or any programming language) that has explicit support for authorizations?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:30:44 GMT):<br/>
I typically interpret what we are talking about as a performance issue (and one that has security implications).
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:32:46 GMT):<br/>
performance?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:36:39 GMT):<br/>
It wouldn't change the overall behavior of the system (i.e., input and output) if you did it all at the smart contract layer.  But doing, as you put it, "filtering" at each layer dramatically improves performance in the face of malicious actors.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:45:42 GMT):<br/>
i was also thinking that there might be ledger-wide policies
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:46:25 GMT):<br/>
and also about how to construct authorization that is "correct" (how easy is it to re-use common authorization)
</p>
<p><strong>stanliberman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:47:10 GMT):<br/>
is that the "middle" box?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:48:03 GMT):<br/>
@stanliberman that's what i thought... like i said... this is not my area so i'm not sure if that layering makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>stanliberman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:50:40 GMT):<br/>
I agree - [feels like] the highest level common functions would belong in this bucket, with the highest layer sticking with applying the authorizations.
</p>
<p><strong>stanliberman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:51:49 GMT):<br/>
My question is really with the lowest level and whether it's worth it to separate the signature validation from authentication function

Hi there, I am struggling with the following issue any help would be much appreciated. When the ledger is shared among the participants they have the copy but not everybody can decrypt it. Does this mean that all the blockchain members have the encrypted copy of the BIG database like 1TB?

<p><strong>srujana_k</strong> (Fri, 16 Feb 2018 11:11:51 GMT):<br/>
Hello,

Regarding Hyperledger Consensus, I have some doubts ...

From the Document( https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Hyperledger_Arch_WG_Paper_1_Consensus.pdf) it is mentioned "we ensure that any Hyperledger framework can work with any Hyperledger consensus module. " 

so is it possible to use "sumeragi" of Iroha's consensus model in Fabric for ordering of transaction(i.e at Orderer)  ?

As sumeragi is a chain based consensus, how can we use for Fabric consensus ? please share your thoughts and opinions on this..

Thank you!

Maybe better asked in Fabric as well as Iroha, From what I understand, Sumeragi is a optimistic BFT

@srujana_k Maybe better asked in Fabric as well as Iroha, From what I understand, Sumeragi is a optimistic BFT and could be compatible with Fabric. Although if you delve deeper and find the answer- we would certainly be interested in this WG

<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 14:03:42 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, I am not sure whether I can ask this here. I have gone through the architecture WG volume 1 doc, is it possible for me to get some ideas on how the consensus for hyperledger frameworks has selected? Any pointers. Like why Hyperledger does not use other distributed systems consensus algorithms like Raft and others? 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 15:22:24 GMT):<br/>
@indirajith Most of the algorithms used are variants of the standard distributed systems ones, except for PoET which is based on leader-election based on a random number (a timeout) from an unimpeachable source. In fact there is a progression and a tangled relationship Paxos->RAFT->(S|P|R)BFT->-Sumeragi (Optimistic BFT) more to be found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01873.pdf which is a survey

@indirajith Hyperledger Burrow uses Tendermint a BFT that can only tolerate up to a 1/3 of failures, but those failures can include arbitrary behavior - including hacking and malicious attacks. It does not specify a particular application, like a key-value store, but instead focuses on arbitrary state machine replication.

</p>
<p><strong>snowy13</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 12:54:01 GMT):<br/>
Well, regardless of whether it makes sense or not, I find the paper lack specific parameters of an implementation, too many "if you" or "you can". From what I understand...the current nodes are under the devs ownership so....

the article is rather timely given our discussion this morning
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:29:05 GMT):<br/>
an interesting quote from the article: Mr Vanderveken told the Financial Times that the test had showed there would be significant “operational challenges” to using blockchain technology for all of its 11,000 members. This is not least because the 28 banks that ran tests on the system required the creation of 528 sub-ledgers to avoid confidential information being seen by rival banks. To roll it out to all of Swift’s members, Mr Vanderveken estimated it would require 100,000 sub-ledgers to be created, making them extremely unwieldy to maintain, upgrade or configure.

@hartm @bbehlendorf The steering committee shows IC3, QED-it, IBM, ZCash(Tromer), Ligero a very influential and academic group of people (https://zkproof.org/index.html). I got an invitation and I am registered.I am in a wait and watch mode regarding the possibility of creating standards in such a fashion. Maybe this will be the start of such an initiative. I know many DLTs are incorporating a ZK or MPC layer for enhancing privacy.

</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 16:02:38 GMT):<br/>
@hartm One thing to note is that in Fabric there isn't really a notion of a main channel, at least as far as I know.  @binhn can verify that for sure.  Channels are largely just a logical and potentially physical partitioning of the network, each representing an independent ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 16:03:34 GMT):<br/>
Sure.  I think it's just easier to handle inter-channel communication if there is some "main" channel keeping track of everything.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 16:03:59 GMT):<br/>
Which is a supported but not necessary model
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 16:05:04 GMT):<br/>
right, there isn't one (main channel) built in, but a network can set up a channel to function as main 
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 16:10:47 GMT):<br/>
I think the interesting part is that we can treat Fabric channels as completely independent ledgers, however they may share resources (compute, network,etc.) with other channels via the peers that participate in the channel and definitely the ordering service the channel was created on.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 16:13:47 GMT):<br/>
Does it make sense to create a Venn diagram showing the relationships that exist or might exist in a blockchain network?

zoom tells me that the meeting has not ended
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 15:02:43 GMT):<br/>

Hey @hartm @MicBowman , sorry if I came on too strong. 
I did not hear points made by @stanliberman  as I got cut off during that.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 16:21:11 GMT):<br/>
No, that's fine.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 16:21:22 GMT):<br/>
Main points I made (if it got lost in the shuffle)
Bank thoughts are evolving re: Privacy
Many more solutions are coming that a. use a. ZKP or variants layered on top b. Trusted hardware c.architecturally designed around privacy (Includes, Symbiont, Corda, DAH, Kadena etc.)

There is no monolithic bank view around privacy (at least not in our bank)

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 23:48:57 GMT):<br/>
Hey, all...sorry about Zoom this morning. Please give the Fabric maintainers hell.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 23:49:09 GMT):<br/>
They forgot to leave their meeting and it ran for 259 minutes. 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 23:49:15 GMT):<br/>
I have already given them hell
</p>
<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 18:06:14 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt can we work on getting independent conferencing sessions. This is bound to happen again.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 18:07:17 GMT):<br/>
@rjagadee : I just got a second account today. I am thinking about not setting up separate numbers for each meeting, but using the main call so that if this does happen, you just take over an ongoing meeting.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 18:07:37 GMT):<br/>
This will also allow me to give the working group leads a pin so that they can take on host role.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 18:08:32 GMT):<br/>
And any back-to-back meetings setting up on alternating accounts
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 18:08:56 GMT):<br/>
Look for changes to dial in numbers starting soon.

hi everyone - we finalized the Smart Contracts paper based on yesterday's call. The plan is to publish it Tuesday May 1 at 9 PT.
</p>
<p><strong>gtewallace</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 19:18:41 GMT):<br/>
9 am that is
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 21:11:24 GMT):<br/>
I prefer the one number method, so that not leaving will just expose you to the new meeting
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 21:11:41 GMT):<br/>
Can also be an opportunity for one WG to know the next
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 21:13:07 GMT):<br/>
Even if you have two channels, someone could capture the meeting for a long period of time (259 minutes++) and hence block the meeting

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 15:45:25 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt, just reread your post and it does seem to say- One number for one channel which will be the main channel- with protections: back to back meetings use another number and meeting leads have the pin. I still think just have one number for main channel used for all meetings and another emergency channel with a number for any eventuality that might arise. Unless meetings coincide which can happen with the proliferation of WGs.

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 15:48:56 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB : I am leaning towards same number for all meetings. It may mean recordings become a nightmare. But will ensure that meetings can always happen. We could just use the second account as a backup. I am glad to hear that you would be in favor of that approach. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 20:27:19 GMT):<br/>

Here on the references I posted in our Zoom meeting earlier 
on Identity, Trust, Data etc

Identity, Trust, Data, ZKP etc
Next week I'm going to a Hyperledger meetup at MIT Media Lab.  Thomas Hardjono is the director of Trust Data Science --- has very interesting projects on trust - identity here -- https://www.trust.mit.edu/projects/

He also has a book that I've started: 
Framework for Identity and Data sharing
https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Data-Framework-Identity-sharing/dp/153911421X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1526663241&sr=1-1&keywords=9781539114215
</p>
<p><strong>jmason900</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 18:05:34 GMT):<br/>
IBM is a sponsor of the MIT Media lab now so there's already a relationship there as well.

#training-and-education-wg includes volunteers available to edit, test and contribute to tutorials and learning materials. Feel free to post possible collaboration in the wg or @KellyCooper. We have many volunteers for beginning projects and some volunteers for advanced. One way we can support your efforts is as users/consumers to comment on clarity, strengths and gaps in your documentation/materials. Your request(s) will be viewed by the group every Monday and we can track/manage on our end. Thanks, Kelly

For today's privacy & confidentiality discussion .. if there's time in the agenda I'd like to discuss a simple definition of each:
Privacy: Conceals the "who"
Confidentiality: Conceals the "what"

I'm about to embark on a blockchain project for supply chain, and am investigating Hyperledger Sawtooth (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBebFQM49Xk) and Hyperledger Fabric (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OsIoPtlv5X2PWyOAlDn1FCnHCZPyrF57/view) at the moment. it appears that the abovementioned frameworks are capable of "thousands" of transactions per second (tps).

My question has to do with my planned use case. if i'm planning to track metrics of a certain supply, and i need it to be updated every minute, and there are hundreds of thousands of this supply at any point in time, how can this scale? i'm assuming that as things are queued latency increases. At 150,000 event reporting per second (which seems to be conservative based on our calculations), we would incur tens to hundreds of seconds of delay.

is my simple math usable? are there any mechanisms to work around this?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 15:22:00 GMT):<br/>
@lawrenceong I would suggest you ask these questions in the #sawtooth or #fabric channels
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 15:22:42 GMT):<br/>
and yes... your math is correct... it will be difficult to process 150K events/second through most (all?) blockchain platforms today

Agreed.  The definition needs to be fleshed out 
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 16:32:34 GMT):<br/>
agreed @nage they assume some basic operations (e.g. escrow)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 16:32:52 GMT):<br/>
and then build a protocol around those assumed primitives
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 16:39:55 GMT):<br/>
Transaction interoperability essentially requires everything else to be interoperable (to some degree, at least).
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 16:41:24 GMT):<br/>
Or some sort of transformation or translation for effective interoperability without guarantees of "sameness"
</p>
<p><strong>stanliberman</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 16:45:54 GMT):<br/>
SQL does that, right? But that sounds like an equivalent to smart contract interoperability. I think we're trying to go for a lower level capability.
</p>
<p><strong>stanliberman</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 16:47:45 GMT):<br/>
Technically seth+Burrow chaincode with the same contract code match this definition, but it doesn't allow for transactions which cross the boundaries with atomic guarantees.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 18:46:13 GMT):<br/>
Some of the primitives needed are HTLC (Hashed Timelock Contracts), Cross Chain Routing Protocol (ILP or COMIT based protocol), and in the case of payments you need (LP) Liquidity Providers. We should be able to list some primitives similar to this for HL Interoperability- if we want to generalize for state we need the equivalent of LP.

@lawrenceong As others have said, handling 150K tps is likely to be a stretch for any blockchain.  I would think the only viable option would be to add these events in batches, such that a single blockchain transaction hold 100s if not 1000s of individual events.  Alternatively you could store the events off-chain and only store a hash of a block of events on the blockchain.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 17:51:13 GMT):<br/>
Burning crypto is not the issue; how does it ensure interoperability? Almost all the references I see are related to creating value by creating scarcity on the same chain even if it is a different crypto (paying dividends, creating money supply, mining etc. etc.)- case can be made for proving identity on one chain and observing from another chain by burning a few satoshis; this can be achieved in many other ways.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 20:12:04 GMT):<br/>
its a good way to move value from one chain to another permanently
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 20:12:11 GMT):<br/>
that's the bottom line
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 20:12:28 GMT):<br/>
its just one of a set of interesting primitives that could be used for multi-ledger operations

@unlimited : You will get more responses if you ask in one of the Hyperledger Fabric channels ( #fabric #fabric-questions etc.)

Greetings. I have a question about architecture and Hyperledger. Any feedback is welcome. 
Suppose that there is some Hyperledger blockchain running, with its nodes. Suppose that there are a few companies participating.
Suppose that these companies use some software for their daily business - ERPs behind the firewall, custom software behind the firewall, cloud based software, etc. Assume that some of this software now wants to integrate with the blockchain. Is it common, or is it advantageous to conceive a broker piece that "translates" data flowing through a REST interface from these existing software to the blockchain? I would think so, but I would like to hear what people have been doing in projects.

This offchain "Oracle" interface has been a topic of increasing interest see interactions on IPFS on the HL Fabric specific email lists @GustavoFrederico . I believe this might merit a paper or thought in the context of all HL DLTs, what are the solutions they employ, how is security preserved in these interactions etc. DO not know whether this comes under general interoperability.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 13:59:25 GMT):<br/>
In addition concrete implementations or architectural from each of these DLTs should be welcomed.

@VenkataY : You should ask in the `fabric` channels. Maybe #fabric channel would be best place to start. Also, I am sure you have seen the tutorial here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/private_data_tutorial.html

Hello everyone and @rjagadee. Thanks for all the work you've done so far. I'm looking to contribute to the body of work. I've read the two white-papers. If it's OK, I can contribute to the identity and privacy/confidentiality drafts 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:52:02 GMT):<br/>
@phaniac : It is definitely okay. Feel free to join upcoming meetings and begin contributing your thoughts.

@ArchanGanguly There are some efforts to go the other way (i.e. from BPs to smart contracts), notably clause.io's work and their recent efforts using Coq. There has been a body of work in this area for generic program generation from logic, TLA+ for example. Here the business process is seen as the primary driver.

Decentralized Private computation (DPC). might be of interest to both the cryptolib and the Privacy and confidentiality group here. #zexe. Slowly but surely we are witnessing the push toward tractable privacy in Decentralized Ledgers. This time _function privacy_ in addition to data privacy. The birth of a new primitive, Decentralized Private Computation (DPC) can lead to 
a. Increased Privacy 
b. Succinctness (the additional load is 968 bytes) 
and allow for provable off-chain computation, we can separate execution from consensus and ordering. This paper also demonstrates an implementation as well as some metrics as well as a pathway for others to incorporate this as extensions into other ledgers.

https://www.housingwire.com/articles/47193-accenture-develops-two-blockchain-integration-solutions
Their custom applications supported both atomic swap ( token exchange ) between 2 different types of blockchains as well as a query use case for a second blockchain from the first blockchain.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/architecture-wg?msg=nbNZfKkR9ECKKkCP4) @TimOBrien dont do it in chaincode ,,please try random number in SDK side or UI side ..if you will generate random number in chaincode then it will produce different read right set at every peer 
</p>
<p><strong>TimOBrien</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 09:06:17 GMT):<br/>
Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>TimOBrien</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 09:06:35 GMT):<br/>
can you tell me what you mean by "SDK side" 
</p>
<p><strong>TimOBrien</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 09:06:43 GMT):<br/>
does this mean outside of Fabric 
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 09:07:00 GMT):<br/>
any REST API ..like Node sdk ,Java SDK
</p>
<p><strong>TimOBrien</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 09:07:07 GMT):<br/>
yes 
</p>
<p><strong>TimOBrien</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 09:07:52 GMT):<br/>
So there is no temp storage or private communication channel in Fabric I can use ?
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 09:08:32 GMT):<br/>
we can do that at fabric-SDK level..not in chaincode level...
</p>
<p><strong>TimOBrien</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 09:08:54 GMT):<br/>
ok

@alex.yakovlev perhaps you should provide some context -- who presented it on what subject and where? I never heard of hyperledger token standard but Fabric is implementing some token support
</p>
<p><strong>alex.yakovlev</strong> (Tue, 11 Dec 2018 14:10:39 GMT):<br/>

The Learning Materials Development working group is in need of contributors for our 2019 objectives: edX Fabric update, edX Sawtooth update, edX Iroha tutorial. At this time, over 133,000 learners have participated in the edX courses. If you, or someone you know (university student, freelance developer, researcher, etc) is interested in contributing, please see the worksheet: 2019 Team and Individual/Small Group Objectives, Key Results, Participants and Tasks - https://goo.gl/1HzKaD  The worksheet has two tabs, one for contributions to the group's 2019 OKRs, and a second that notes individual contributions.  Feel free to message or reply with any questions. Thank you, Kelly

@VipinB thanks for presenting the idea in the meeting.  I'm sorry I missed it.  If anyone has comments or questions please let me know.  I'm hoping to get back to a group meeting (and the documents where Gordon and I were "thinking out loud" soon)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:52:22 GMT):<br/>
@nage the Arch WG decided to continue with the system ID paper in the short term, but your thought experiment is extremely helpful for the Identity WG paper. We may need to combine them, even after publication...

@MicBowman @hartm  So I changed my travel plans and will be staying in the Bay area until Friday afternoon.  Unfortunately when I went to register for the Stanford Blockchain conference, I was informed the conference is at capacity and I'm on a waitlist.  :-(   So if you guys want to meet, let's pick a place and a time.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:01:14 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal Email the organizers.  They may allow you to come if you specifically email them (there are a lot of no-shows typically).
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 18:12:31 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal i'm also officially "on the waitlist" but it sounds like they are taking everyone from the email that i got with the logistics
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 20:11:57 GMT):<br/>

Hi, Interesting write-up on privacy. 
 
a. That there is no empirical data about some of these attacks
b. Creation of thought experiments to surface some of the risks
c. Explanation of certain types of attacks in public chains (Flashlight, overseer, tainted dust)
d. Transparency and analysis of the current solutions and publishing the expectations of privacy around any solution, preferably from the builders and their agents. 
e. Of course (no surprises here) ZKP as increasing the privacy

My own question(s) are:
How can we conduct such thought experiments in the Enterprise Blockchain world?   
What recommendations can we make to the HL DLTs about publishing expectations of privacy? An analysis of their own privacy envelope a la Grin or ZCash. (links in the piece below)

As our interoperability discussion goes forward; it might behoove us to look at cosmos- specifically at IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) https://cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper - cosmos mainnet is live today

@binhn thanks for the input in the Fabric section - we reviewed and added some comments - specifically wanted to see how the CA's, MSPs are bootstrapped on the ledger and how system identity functions are tied to the ledger via transactions.

Hello guys! I have a question about dissemination/distribution of private data. Not sure, if it's right place to ask, but I believe it's a right place to find a expert to help me solve the problem I am facing.

So, I have a collection with assets of the same type that is shared among several organizations. However, some organizations should have access only to some of the assets in this collection. That should be decided at run-time based on custom logic. For example, some of the assets should not pass through because they don't have a suitable status or they are not related to a required organization, and so on.
Moreover, the organizations should not be able to access that data directly from their peers as well. So, doing this in chaincode is not a solution. 

Obviously, the private data in the collection should be distributed based on a custom dissemination policy since the existing one is not enough. My question, is there any way to extend the current dissemination policy implementation with custom logic? I found these code https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/gossip/privdata/distributor.go#L160 and I feel it should be somewhere nearby. I'd appreciate if anyone from experts in this part could show me right direction and explain me how this can be achieved. 

I'll be thankful for any useful info in this regard.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 16:28:57 GMT):<br/>
@ivorobioff suggest you ask that question on the #fabric channel as well, there are two labs projects that are specifically targetted at the capability you're describing... private data object and private chaincode

Hello guy, Do you know if its possible to have a required Endorser that is not part o PDC collection?   I have a case here where the endorsers should agree on the transaction data, but agreement on Private Data is not required for who isnt on PDC policy. Im trying to achieve that by plugging a customized vscc, but i think this could be interisting for other businnes.
</p>
<p><strong>rodolfoleal</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:53:32 GMT):<br/>
I work in a Brazilian bank and that would be a great feature, that would meet our Central Bank requirements, If needed I could specify this better in other to figure out if its suitabble.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:57:06 GMT):<br/>
@rodolfoleal please ask this on #fabric 
</p>

From Besu:
is there specific information you're looking for? I can organise for someone to look at the paper if you point me in the direction of it.

Here's links to the privacy and Orion documentation (the Pantheon documentation will be rebranded as Besu documentation shortly):

@MicBowman - I believe you're running the Architecture WG meeting on Friday?  I'm looking for the agenda and was wondering if the Besu presentation can be in the second half of the meeting? 
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 17:33:45 GMT):<br/>
@madelinemurray are you planning to do the besu presentation tomorrow? i had not heard back from vipin or bihn about scheduling
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 17:33:53 GMT):<br/>
would be very happy to have you join
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 01:03:30 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman - I won't be on the call but @iikirilov can present on Besu.  It would be great if that would be in the second part of the call so another one of our PMs can join. 
</p>
<p><strong>iikirilov</strong> (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 08:11:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes I will be joining - it is not so much a presentation but rather a walk through of the content I added in the privacy and confidentiality doc

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 14:58:52 GMT):<br/>
@timbeiko did the call happen? @MicBowman did not realize I was supposed to run the call and make the announcements. May be in another two weeks then....
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 15:02:51 GMT):<br/>
@timbeiko that would be great
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 15:03:14 GMT):<br/>
and @madelinemurray just a walk through would be perfect
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 15:04:19 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman is the call happening now?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 15:04:33 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 04 Oct 2019 16:21:20 GMT):<br/>
Great talk! Like any non-trivial solution goes to the basics of many issues... Data segregation, data replication,  blockheader/transaction formats, deterministic execution of code etc etc. Thanks FPC contributors (Michael and Bruno) and of course @binhn @MicBowman  and @hartm and others including the mysterious James  
</p>
<p><strong>iikirilov</strong> (Sat, 05 Oct 2019 11:26:20 GMT):<br/>
Any chance the call was recorded?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 13:23:01 GMT):<br/>
@iikirilov No, because the host key was captured by some called James who was not on the call. This is a problem with community calls today.

<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Tue, 15 Oct 2019 23:22:50 GMT):<br/>
and... i will be traveling friday morning & will not be able to attend the P&C meeting. I would recommend that we cancel this week and ask the Avalon team to present at the main AWG meeting next week

I read about the problem of blockchain interoperability that many researches are trying to solve. Is this problem only being faced between heterogeneous blockchain networks ? We don’t need to connect homogeneous networks like fabric to fabric network ?

</p>
<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:05:37 GMT):<br/>
I got a pop up asking for host code
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:06:53 GMT):<br/>
can you start?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:07:03 GMT):<br/>
i'm on hold waiting for host
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:07:15 GMT):<br/>
but my login doesn't give me host access
</p>
<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:08:12 GMT):<br/>
Somethings changed, it's asking for a zoom sign-in!
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:08:25 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:08:41 GMT):<br/>
and whoever needs to sign in for host... i'm not it
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:08:47 GMT):<br/>
i have the host access code from silona
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:08:55 GMT):<br/>
but no place i can put it
</p>
<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:11:12 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps the new process has been turned on already - I saw an email yesterday - but didn't think we've set it up yet
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:12:00 GMT):<br/>
maybe... but this is for zoom which seems different from the calendar updates on groups.io
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:12:05 GMT):<br/>
though... who knows
</p>
<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:12:55 GMT):<br/>
Same here it's asking to sign-in as host as opposed to previously entering host code
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:13:39 GMT):<br/>
i've sent a note to both ry and silona asking for help
</p>
<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:16:12 GMT):<br/>
OK, I pinged Ry on chat, lets see if we get some help
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:20:00 GMT):<br/>
i'll go through the rest of the conversion steps that dave posted
</p>
<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:34:02 GMT):<br/>

but i still don't see any way to own the zoom meetings
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:52:21 GMT):<br/>
The backup works with claim host and the new code (at least it did for me at 1:40 pm) but the community took me to a login screen asking for a login and password (since the host was not on the meeting)- no way to go beyond that. Sorry to have missed the meeting
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 19:08:46 GMT):<br/>
i cannot get to "claim host"
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 19:08:52 GMT):<br/>

The Linux Foundation’s CommunityBridge engineers are working on a tool to measure the health of critical open source projects and one of the key areas identified is QA Testing.  They request that our communities provide  honest and detailed information on testing tools and methodologies you use in your projects for us to come up with a detailed analysis, which they will share with all respondents and projects. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9H5G2GV. It’s only 5 questions long.

<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 22:58:40 GMT):<br/>
Tomorrow/Wed 9 AM PT Arch-WG call will feature a presentation by @MicBowman titled: "Breaking Data Silos: Smart Contracts for Data Access and More"
</p>
<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 22:59:04 GMT):<br/>
Sharing data is challenging. As it stands, when we share data we generally lose all practical control of it. With the ever-growing pool of data available for interesting computations, we need a way to share data appropriately. Private Data Objects is a technology that combines hardware-based trusted execution and a distributed ledger to wrap data with a smart contract that handles all access and update policies. In addition to protecting the confidentiality of the data (or rather the appropriate use of the data), executing the smart contract code in a trusted execution environment means that the policies stick with the data no matter who or where it is stored.

While the Private Data Objects project in Hyperledger Labs is clearly a research prototype, concepts and code are the basis for both Hyperledger Avalon and the Fabric Private Chaincode projects.

@rjagadee hopefully it will be recorded and made available on the notes page

Federated Wiki has a plugin architecture for wiki social data. I think plugins could also be useful in social blockchain interop. Because plugins enable open source contributions at the edge of projects for robust decentralization. Wiki uses Miller's Caja to sanitize JS in plugins and Van Jacobson's CCNx for discoverability. Wiki already has adoption in federated scientific and writer circles.  Ward and friends recently created a Deno version using Rust and Wasm. We planned to chat today but got Zoom-boomed. We'll probably discuss 10 am pst next Wed. https://twitter.com/WardCunningham/status/1247929565164589057

</p>
<p><strong>cliveb</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 22:52:25 GMT):<br/>
Plugin architecture for decentralization came up in discussions today. Federated Wiki has a fine grained capabilities-based plugins that sanitizes malicious code and social data on other servers. Wiki doesn't have privacy sensitive protocols. Based on findings by DAML published in ACM and the Cosmo white-paper I think plugins could be useful to look at the edge to make open source contributions more extensible and re-usable, because the plugins are tiny.

Plugin architecture for decentralization came up in discussions today. Federated Wiki has fine grained capabilities-based plugins that sanitizes malicious code and social data on other servers. Wiki doesn't have privacy sensitive protocols. Based on findings by DAML published in ACM and the Cosmo white-paper I think plugins could be useful to look at the edge to make open source contributions more extensible and re-usable, because the plugins are tiny.

Various 'health code' apps in China are developed by local authorities — most famously, by the city government of Hangzhou, home of Alibaba. https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3074319/national-version-chinas-controversial-health-code-isnt-ready

Additional insight from journalist in Beijing: Many apps use the telecoms carriers’ data to list cities it thinks you have been in over the preceding fortnight. But transparency is a major issue for some other apps on how that data is processed. i.e. what other forms of data are combined with it to produce a color code — isn’t explained. Apps can flip from green to red with no obvious explanation -- nor recourse for errors. Important since your health code color can bar you from your workplace.

Quickly developing a privacy sensitive mobile app was discussed yesterday. Flutter developed by Google for Android, iOS and the mobile web apps is based on cross-platform Dart programming lang.  Echos more the ArchWG efforts to foster reusable efforts. https://dart.dev/

<p><strong>cliveb</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 20:24:49 GMT):<br/>
google/apple like PACT apparently also using bluetooth. I imagine both firms will create a native app for android/iOS. Taking a framework approach hopefully implies they will also open source for app developers.    

 The quickest way I know to create a cross-platform app is by using Flutter https://flutter.dev/ (based on Dartlang). 

Flutter is not best for cross-platform components. BradFitz on the android/golang team worked out a gradle build in docker for android. I think the same docker pre-build approach could work for iOS. A docker approach the likely path to use components from HL projects and HL labs https://github.com/perkeep/perkeep/tree/master/clients/android

Look @cliveb everyone else, unless you have scale you cannot achieve real results. PEPPT-PT says 60 % adoption (at least locally) - experiments are great, but to see real results we have to get behind scalable apps. There are three as I see now PEPPT-PT, PACT (East coast), and maybe one more. They all have real privacy protection. The fragmented approach will not yield real results. Let us track adoption and real backing. Everyone is scared of scaled apps by people like Google and Apple which can achieve scale, but no real privacy protection. @MicBowman @rjagadee

 I'm uncertain we can attain scaled apps. I also imagine folks at large campus workplaces, office buildings or even traveling by air might use peer pressure to insist on some type of localized health app for risk management. Before Corvid we saw truckers, including independents and FedX use Intrix ( inrix.com ), who does not have a FANG like social network to reduce risks of traffic congestion by sharing data via an app. If one of the tracing apps projects you've helped to highlight is ready to scale, I'd say go for it. If not I think there are clever ways to build apps that operate at the edge to help foster reuse components of HL projects. One is Perkeep where the golang team worked out a gradle build in docker for Android, if I was starting from a clean sheet for cross-platform scale I'd look at it. Reusing HL components in other programming languages is harder (generally need to work out a docker pre-build like Perkeep). https://flutter.dev/

Bluetooth apparently used by PACT and google/apple. Taking a framework approach implies they will both produce a native app and also make open source available to app developers. The only way I know that Google and Apple could produce a cross-platform mobile app for Andriod and iOS is by using Flutter https://flutter.dev/ (which is based on Dartlang). 

 HL components from projects and lab could perhaps be used. BradFitz on the golang team worked out a gradle build in docker for Android. https://github.com/perkeep/perkeep/tree/master/clients/android

@MicBowman the google/apple and PEPP-PT are platforms which you can build on top of. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 11 Apr 2020 01:38:57 GMT):<br/>
In the case of PEPP-PT they already have 8 countries and 130 institutions. They combine cryptographers, bio-scientists, programmers, mobile device engineers and cyber security guys. They will have a certification program for GDPR compliance, cyber security and mobile engineering and they are testing. Trust and governance frameworks are as important as engineering. They could achieve scale in Europe. Will they be able to convince others to build on top and port it to Americas and Asia? Dont know! They brought up the subject of Google and Apple in their press conference of April 1. They would rather the companies built on top of their protocol. However, it seems unlikely as Google/Apple announced their own protocol and platform today. It is remarkable that most of these protocols are converging on the same features, functions and design for privacy.

Read an analysis (albeit on twitter) from Moxie Marlinspike on Apple/Google protocol which did raise the troll issue. The other issue Moxie raised is amount of data to be downloaded to check for exposure, once someone is diagnosed (of course the troll issue will magnify this)- Hopefully they will fix some of this  or just adopt one of the other protocols and provide their expertise as OS experts so that the power drain and other factors are properly handled.

do you have the reference to moxie's response? and... i think a number of people have been concerned about the amount of data to be downloaded (some of the work from UW was focusing on ways to communicate generators that would make transmission of the infected list as compact as possible)... and i'm concerned about how the "query" is sent and what it exposes (as in "give me updates since time T0" would make it possible to correlate my earlier request)

After watching Moxie's talk on The Ecosystem is moving and challenges for distributed and decentralized technology from the perspective of Signal. Worth noting is the Android OS is difficult to update, this points to other ecosystem approaches. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj3YFprqAr8

<p><strong>cliveb</strong> (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 19:56:29 GMT):<br/>
Unlike Apple few Android phone vendors update the underlying OS; few even provide monthly security patches. Created such an issue, that about 3 years ago Android separated privacy capabilities out from the OS into play services. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms&hl=en_US  e.g. any new phone capabilities for contract tracing will need to be provided via Google Play services to have an impact at scale. Like Signal, I think this points Apple/Google toward centralized services, such as HL projects discussed.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 20:56:29 GMT):<br/>
(sending some kind of daily keys- DP-3T has rough calculations on countrywide - for Europe volumes) 4.3 MB seems like a number that I remember for a 14 day situation. All derivation of the broadcast keys are on the device. This along with some hyperlocal sharding (due to the server that it points to)- it is fine balance between keeping data compact and keeping it unlinkable. 
DP-3T has country info embedded inside the report and troll protection.  ZCash guy Henry Valance has done detailed comparison between DP3-T and CEN (TCN)- I have the link in my slides.
Moxie is not the ideal interlocutor for this, since he is invested in Ratchet and Signal. Inevitably rapid contract tracing will have some privacy concerns. But we have to say that people have rapidly advanced from the singapore TraceTogether App. 
My points still stand:
a. This is just one tool
b. Not everyone has to install it in a locality (60% or even lesser)
c. Puts control in the hands of the populace (opt to upload in case of diagnosis, and opt to agree to test/follow up/quarantine when warned) - presupposes a large percentage of civic minded people.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 20:58:02 GMT):<br/>
This was Moxie's initial reaction, searching on twitter brings up the tweet (there are 10 tweets in all in that thread). 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 21:00:28 GMT):<br/>
CEN has optional troll protection through the use of a free-form memo field. Data gets destroyed from the phone and the server based on a time limit. The app itself shuts itself down (and remves itself?) when the critical period is over and that gets communicated. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 21:01:02 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 21:21:29 GMT):<br/>
There is no "query", the infected user controls the dissemination- i.e. an upload of generator keys (with a from-to), in DP3T there is an activation key held by the diagnostician. All phones (that share a server-which is one way of sharding) download this payload (multiple times a day).  They then generate the broadcast keys locally and search their contact list, if matches then they are warned. Infected user can opt not to send this, the warned user can choose to ignore warning. Needs a 60% opt-in of civic minded users in a locality.

I came away disappointed with today's identity WG presentation. Feeling cold water was thrown on contract tracing apps and HL projects. Currently distributed computing suffers from ecosystem insecurity--leading to data leaks. Interoperability requires privacy sensitive protocols to secure data. Fostering diverse app developers to build with HL projects drives inclusive contributions from the edges nearer to customers and toward resilient secure distributed computing. This should lead to better architecture for more connected social business. Good for all concerned.

Sanofi is teaming up with Silicon Valley start-up Luminostics to develop a coronavirus test that patients could do themselves using a device plugged into a smartphone. Patients could take a sample from the back of their nose, insert the swab into a small device containing a chemical including the nanoparticle and clip it into the adapter. The nanoparticle would glow when it comes into contact with the virus. The signal would be captured by the camera and processed using artificial intelligence. The results would then be displayed on an app and users could connect with a doctor by video call to discuss them.  The test would not be ready until the end of 2020 at the earliest.

65 percent of Britons are in favor of letting the government use mobile phones to track coronavirus sufferers and inform others that they may be at risk. Ipsos Mori polled just over 1,000 adults in Britain aged between 18 and 75 last weekend.

Support for the idea rose to 73 percent among 55 to 75-year-olds and fell to 59 per cent in those aged 18 to 34. 

Gus Hosein of Privacy International, a campaigning group, said he was relatively relaxed about contact-tracing apps in which data is anonymised and well-regulated.

Regarding privacy/confidentiality with permissioned blockchain. I imagine if people are given controls over their own personal data, such as the data is forgotten, after a sensible period, more people will trust the system. This is perhaps where novel architecture in HL projects comes into play. I imagine smart contracts could be set up to remove data as a ToS. I think I can recall Richard Gendal Brown - CTO at R3, giving a talk at Hyperledger NYC conference in early 2017, describing how Corda came to add to RTBF feature because of EU or UK data laws.

Looks like the PEPP-PT is having its Theranos moment; in the absence of any publicly released documentation, code, testing, DP3T, previously a member of the coalition have severed all ties to the org. DP3T is from ETH and they have released a paper, source code etc. and have remarkable similarities to TCN, West and East coast PACTs and "Gapple" protocols. Now the main challenge is to put together a decentralized solution that can work with the Gapple protocol. Since Gapple can provide support at the OS level and help scale. This is the latest in the contact tracing saga.

Hi all,
I am looking how to work and contribute to several topics: 
1. Deletion on Blockchain: are there any initiatives here? 
2. Performance analysis among different implementations of HL
3. Network partitioning: Any initiatives, data, etc.? 
How do I look for the available work on the topics?

https://www .apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/ @cliveb @MicBowman Latest version from "Gapple" on April 24. The latest effort a. rebrands the effort as "Exposure Tracing", an ancillary to contact tracing. b. Introduces AES (for speed) + encryption into the mix (for storing some metadata) c. Makes it clear that there has to be strong local public health involvement d. makes the rolling identifier even more un correlatable by resonating with Bluetooth MAC address change.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 26 Apr 2020 16:20:24 GMT):<br/>
1. Deletion on Blockchain: Some initiatives seem to be a. Pruning & archival (fabric has some work in this) b. Do not put data just proofs on the BC (including hashes) there are many initiatives in this. c.There was chameleon hashing from Accenture which do not seem to have had any HL based implementations.
2. Performance Analysis among different implementations of HL. The performance and scale WG is focused on this. Caliper is a tool that can be used. The metrics across various BCs that are objective and shared are not shared in the open. There is no independent agency like TPC to publish this. But there is some work especially from Hungary focused on this
3. Network partitioning: Depending on the consensus algorithms this can deal a blow to finality and or forking behavior. We have had some conversations about this. Since these are permissioned blockchains, it is felt that independent monitoring operations could bring this to light. Shutting down and reconciling blockchains across network partitions need some thought behind it.
All of these are felt to be advanced operations and topics and need more investigation and work, especially with more blockchains coming into production. 
We may need to pull together threads from multiple production or quasi production implementations to handle these eventualities properly.

I believe the US and UK have prioritized privacy above contact tracing so the designs I've seen for contact tracing so far will probably be of limited value
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:59:25 GMT):<br/>
Give them one more month and let us see how the attitudes change. All of this rush to judgement of privacy concerns have not studied the privacy guarantees  of the solutions properly, they also have not seen how there is no privacy guarantees today. Except it is private companies (cell towers, capture of behaviors etc.) that are doing this all the time. In what way do the designs for contact tracing that you have seen today violate the warnings of the "experts", including "the chaos club.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 03 May 2020 18:55:37 GMT):<br/>
What if you do not have to give up privacy and opt-in and it is totally up to you to report your positive status, which is also anonymous? For it to be effective locally and to limit data transfers; it has to be locally hosted (either as a central server-or decentralized servers which connects the uploads to the local populace) to download to the target population. 
</p>
<p><strong>jmason900</strong> (Mon, 04 May 2020 11:56:13 GMT):<br/>
The proposed contact tracing designs I have read do provide a lot of privacy guarantees in general. They are opt in, optional reporting and more. For many reasons, I suspect those solutions will have very limited practical value in helping control infection rates

It wont be just the app, the app is a helper, perhaps-Italy and Germany are going ahead with these apps- decentralized and with privacy built in, from Apple and Google (who they do not trust). It is good to be skeptical, but we have to be open to new approaches. I think they are doing it out of desperation, since without rapid response a classic contact tracing setup cannot work with this level of infection.

we certainly need to consider carefully threat models though there is nothing new about that. for SGX those who are deploying software must be cognizant of the mitigations (and the attestation infrastructure can help to identify platforms that have the mitigations applied).

Vint Cerf spoke at the Cardano summit on July 2.  He isn't convinced blockchain can scale, although mentions Google is using for certificate mgmt (at 24 mins). Nor convinced about SSI, third-parties always required to authenticate claims (at 48 mins). He sees blockchain in the application space, not in the protocol space. https://youtu.be/20pJTiPzi1s

Folks,

Dr. Michael Kuperberg, Chief Blockchain Architect at DB Systel (Deutsche Bahn), will be our guest speaker on Wed Nov 18th 9 AM PST Architecture WG meeting.

Where:
https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community?pwd=STZQd0xMZU9xRVVOVnpQM3JNQ2dqZz09
 
Meeting ID: 403 498 3298
Passcode: 475869

Deletion is interesting, especially for GDPR and other privacy regulatory compliance. Network partitioning tolerance is a core requirement for correctness of DLTs.

Please see the abstract and attached papers on the two topics from Michael.

Please forward to anyone else in the community who may be interested.
Deletion: 
Abstract: 
Conventional blockchain implementations with append-only semantics do not support deleting or overwriting data in confirmed blocks. However, many industry-relevant use cases require the ability to delete data, especially when personally identifiable information is stored or when data growth has to be constrained. To solve this challenge, we present a novel architecture for the blockchain ledger and consensus, which uses a tree of context chains with simultaneous validity. The resulting context isolation enables consensus-steered deletion of an entire context without side effects to other contextes. We show how this architecture supports truncation, data rollover and separation of concerns, and how the GDPR regulations can be fulfilled by this architecture.
PDF: I attached the preprint of the underlying paper ("Towards Enabling Deletion in Append-Only Blockchains to Support Data Growth Management and GDPR Compliance") - the conference paper PDF (which I recently presented) has not yet been made public  on IEEEXPLORE...
Partitioning:
Abstract: 
Both permissioned and unpermissioned blockchains are designed to tolerate and to overcome the failure of individual nodes, which need to update themselves once they reconnect to the blockchain network. At the same time, it is important to avoid accidental network partitioning, since partitioning can lead to inconsistent “multiple truths” and violate the shared consensus about the global state, which must be maintained across all active and re-emerging nodes. Given the differences in design and implementation across ledgers and blockchains, a systematic analytic approach must be established before partitioning prevention in specific products is studied. Therefore, we perform a foundational analysis of enterprise-grade consensus protocols, including design recommendations for partitioning avoidance for Proof-of-Authority in Hyperledger Fabric.

HI all. I know this channel has been quiet for a little bit, but I've got a topic that might help perk it up, if you are all OK with it happening here. There's been a thread on private email regarding the two projects at Hyperledger, Cactus and Weaver (Labs) that address systems for integrating and conducting transactions across multiple ledgers - sometimes referred to as "interoperability" though I know the preferred term is "integration". There is a third project inbound into the Labs from a company called Datachain who have built an IBC integration suite across Fabric, Corda and others, IBC being the protocol behind Cosmos etc. I'd love to see these three projects more tightly coordinating, at the very least to clearly distinguish themselves from each other, but also hopefully find ways to combine code and teams such that we have more eyes and users on less overlapping code. Can we bring that private thread here and invite the participants to have it here, and have the Architecture WG kind of oversee this conversation? It feels very related to the scope & mission of this WG and better to have here than on one particular project's list or another.

Or, we could move this to the architecture-wg mailing list, if folks prefer that over RocketChat. May be better for diving into more thoughtful deeper issues, and also handling folks involved in this who are in many different time zones

@bbehlendorf Both of these options work fine for me, thank you for the idea! I prefer chat/email to meetings because I get to bisect everything that's being said (written) on my own time and respond in detail instead of being on a call where only a single person can talk at once and then I'm stuck choosing between being polite or interrupting people if I want to say something. 
Personally I wouldn't mind if we had the proposed call here on the chat instead too, stretched out in time compared to what a single one hour call would take.
Between the mailing list and the chat I'd probably prefer the chat, but only by a small margin really.

Let's just be careful about communication channel overload.  We already have a lot of people who don't follow all of our communication channels.

Your points are also incredibly valid when it comes to the varying levels of English language proficiency among the crowd involved in this conversation, who I think will be more comfortable responding to things written (and asynchronously) than speaking over an audio connect & zoom.  On reflection I think I'll recommend that this conversation happen on the architecture-wg mailing list; I'll cc the list into the current thread and then ask people to subscribe to the list directly. Then people can come back here to RocketChat if they want to do something more real-time but still written rather than spoken.
