{"msg":"Dear friends of the Hyperledger Architecture working group,\n\nCould I ask for your review of the document \"After-the-fact mandate changes\" (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1psJc9UWuteSzOqIG0VLIdzdlxFb9kq-Csw-dxcjPzEo), please?\n\nThe documents describes use cases that require the authorization over a smart contract to be changed after-the-fact without the smart contract getting executed. The document contains the following requirements\nRequirement 1: A user (“anchor”) shall be able to sign over its authorization over a smart contract to another user (“guardian”) after the fact. \n1a: The original user (“anchor”) loses its authorization over the smart contract.\n1b: The original user (“anchor”) maintains its authorization over the smart contract.\nRequirement 2: A blockchain consortium shall be able to sign over the authorization over a smart contract from one user (“anchor”) to another user (“guardian”).\nRequirement 3: It should be possible to re-assign the authorization over multiple or all a smart contracts for a user (“anchor”) to another user (“guardian”) in a single action.\nRequirement 4: It should be possible to re-assign the authorization over a smart contract back to the original (“anchor”) user.\nRequirement 5: The solution to requirements 1-4 shall not require the handing over of private keys.\nRequirement 6: The solution to requirements 1-4 shall not require mutability of the blockchain.\nRequirement 7: The introduction of a solution to requirements 1-4 should be backward compatible, such that they also apply to smart contracts that predate this introduction.\nRequirement 8: The solution to requirements 1-4 may be programmable.\n\nThe document has been developed in the Hyperledger RequirementsWG for a month now, and it is close to getting finalized. So this would be a good time to ask for your review.\n\nLooking forward to your reviews, comments and suggestions. Thank you!\n\nBest regards,\n\nOskar\n","username":"Oskar_van_Deventer","ts":"2017-07-05T09:04:03.434Z"}

{"msg":"Hello guys! I have a question about dissemination/distribution of private data. Not sure, if it's right place to ask, but I believe it's a right place to find a expert to help me solve the problem I am facing.\n\nSo, I have a collection with assets of the same type that is shared among several organizations. However, some organizations should have access only to some of the assets in this collection. That should be decided at run-time based on custom logic. For example, some of the assets should not pass through because they don't have a suitable status or they are not related to a required organization, and so on.\nMoreover, the organizations should not be able to access that data directly from their peers as well. So, doing this in chaincode is not a solution. \n\nObviously, the private data in the collection should be distributed based on a custom dissemination policy since the existing one is not enough. My question, is there any way to extend the current dissemination policy implementation with custom logic? I found these code https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/gossip/privdata/distributor.go#L160 and I feel it should be somewhere nearby. I'd appreciate if anyone from experts in this part could show me right direction and explain me how this can be achieved. \n\nI'll be thankful for any useful info in this regard.","username":"ivorobioff","ts":"2019-05-08T17:46:03.513Z"}

{"msg":"Sharing data is challenging. As it stands, when we share data we generally lose all practical control of it. With the ever-growing pool of data available for interesting computations, we need a way to share data appropriately. Private Data Objects is a technology that combines hardware-based trusted execution and a distributed ledger to wrap data with a smart contract that handles all access and update policies. In addition to protecting the confidentiality of the data (or rather the appropriate use of the data), executing the smart contract code in a trusted execution environment means that the policies stick with the data no matter who or where it is stored.\n\nWhile the Private Data Objects project in Hyperledger Labs is clearly a research prototype, concepts and code are the basis for both Hyperledger Avalon and the Fabric Private Chaincode projects.","username":"rjagadee","ts":"2020-01-28T22:59:04.961Z"}

But transparency is a major issue for some other apps on how that data is processed. i.e. what other forms of data are combined with it to produce a color code — isn’t explained.

Performance Analysis among different implementations of HL. The performance and scale WG is focused on this. Caliper is a tool that can be used. The metrics across various BCs that are objective and shared are not shared in the open. There is no independent agency like TPC to publish this. But there is some work especially from Hungary focused on this\n3. Network partitioning: Depending on the consensus algorithms this can deal a blow to finality and or forking behavior. We have had some conversations about this. Since these are permissioned blockchains, it is felt that independent monitoring operations could bring this to light. Shutting down and reconciling blockchains across network partitions need some thought behind it.\nAll of these are felt to be advanced operations and topics and need more investigation and work, especially with more blockchains coming into production. \nWe may need to pull together threads from multiple production or quasi production implementations to handle these eventualities properly. \n","username":"VipinB","ts":"2020-04-26T16:20:24.940Z"}

{"msg":"Folks,\n\nDr. Michael Kuperberg, Chief Blockchain Architect at DB Systel (Deutsche Bahn), will be our guest speaker on Wed Nov 18th 9 AM PST Architecture WG meeting.\n\nWhere:\nhttps://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community?pwd=STZQd0xMZU9xRVVOVnpQM3JNQ2dqZz09\n \nMeeting ID: 403 498 3298\nPasscode: 475869\n\nDeletion is interesting, especially for GDPR and other privacy regulatory compliance. Network partitioning tolerance is a core requirement for correctness of DLTs.\n\nPlease see the abstract and attached papers on the two topics from Michael.\n\nPlease forward to anyone else in the community who may be interested.\nDeletion: \nAbstract: \nConventional blockchain implementations with append-only semantics do not support deleting or overwriting data in confirmed blocks. However, many industry-relevant use cases require the ability to delete data, especially when personally identifiable information is stored or when data growth has to be constrained. To solve this challenge, we present a novel architecture for the blockchain ledger and consensus, which uses a tree of context chains with simultaneous validity. The resulting context isolation enables consensus-steered deletion of an entire context without side effects to other contextes. We show how this architecture supports truncation, data rollover and separation of concerns, and how the GDPR regulations can be fulfilled by this architecture.\nPDF: I attached the preprint of the underlying paper (\"Towards Enabling Deletion in Append-Only Blockchains to Support Data Growth Management and GDPR Compliance\") - the conference paper PDF (which I recently presented) has not yet been made public  on IEEEXPLORE...\nPartitioning:\nAbstract: \nBoth permissioned and unpermissioned blockchains are designed to tolerate and to overcome the failure of individual nodes, which need to update themselves once they reconnect to the blockchain network. At the same time, it is important to avoid accidental network partitioning, since partitioning can lead to inconsistent “multiple truths” and violate the shared consensus about the global state, which must be maintained across all active and re-emerging nodes. Given the differences in design and implementation across ledgers and blockchains, a systematic analytic approach must be established before partitioning prevention in specific products is studied. Therefore, we perform a foundational analysis of enterprise-grade consensus protocols, including design recommendations for partitioning avoidance for Proof-of-Authority in Hyperledger Fabric.","username":"rjagadee","ts":"2020-11-16T23:42:50.753Z"}

{"msg":"HI all. I know this channel has been quiet for a little bit, but I've got a topic that might help perk it up, if you are all OK with it happening here. There's been a thread on private email regarding the two projects at Hyperledger, Cactus and Weaver (Labs) that address systems for integrating and conducting transactions across multiple ledgers - sometimes referred to as \"interoperability\" though I know the preferred term is \"integration\". There is a third project inbound into the Labs from a company called Datachain who have built an IBC integration suite across Fabric, Corda and others, IBC being the protocol behind Cosmos etc. I'd love to see these three projects more tightly coordinating, at the very least to clearly distinguish themselves from each other, but also hopefully find ways to combine code and teams such that we have more eyes and users on less overlapping code. Can we bring that private thread here and invite the participants to have it here, and have the Architecture WG kind of oversee this conversation? It feels very related to the scope & mission of this WG and better to have here than on one particular project's list or another.","username":"bbehlendorf","ts":"2021-05-04T16:18:05.339Z"}
