Hi everyone. Thanks for the call today. I just wanted to ask about the UX/UI, which is also kind of related to the name. If it should be a production-ready user-facing app, the UX/UI is an important part of it but not technology-specific. Do you have any UI design or idea of how to approach it?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 21:35:47 GMT):<br/>
@jakubkoci we've got some UI elements built out already within the project, however I'd like to dedicate additional time and involve UI designers more to refine or replace those elements. Indicio participated in a DHS UI/UX design competition, and that design is the direction we've been heading towards internally in our app development. 
So we could use those designs as a direction to head in or as a base point--However, I would love to hear other directions and input and suggestions from the community in this.
In terms of the actual branding though, we threw together some quick logos and colors for the name Aries Bifold. I'm not exactly sure what we would do for the default branding if we named the project Aries-Mobileagent-React-Native (which is where I lean naming-wise due to its descriptiveness and conforming with the current pattern). The default app branding could simply be named AMA-RN?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 12:56:08 GMT):<br/>
Sounds great James! Are you able to share the designs you made for the DHS UI/UX design competition? Interested too see how they look, and if it's something that aligns with our thinking
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 13:11:46 GMT):<br/>
During the Aries Framework JavaScript call this morning we shortly discussed the Aries Bifold project and its relation to AFJ. The meeting is currently held at 11:30AM CET, which is not very accessible for the American timezones. If there is interest for people to attend we can reschedule the call to a more suitable time. It is a bit of a puzzle because we'd like to accommodate Indian, European and American timezones. We came up with a proposal for 14:00 UTC. See here for an overview of different times: https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20210226T140000&p1=1310&p2=325&p3=204&p4=44&p5=75 For everyone interested to join could you let us know if this works, and if not possibly do a counter proposal for another time
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 13:13:56 GMT):<br/>
If we can't make it work we could see to do alternating weeks with different times
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 20:29:55 GMT):<br/>
I am glad this was discussed, since I'd like to help contribute on that side of things as well. I personally can make the proposed time work. 
Is the intention to have the call be bi-weekly and alternating with the Aries Bifold users group call?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 20:30:11 GMT):<br/>
Yes! I will work on getting those posted here.

Great work on this! I was able to run the project on an Android emulator. Was curious after watching the previous Aries WG recording, regarding iOS support, are there native modules that are being utilized in the Android application that have just not been developed/setup yet for `rn` and iOS?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:26:12 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:52:42 GMT):<br/>
Hi Lohan! Currently, there is a UI in place, however I'd like to have some discussions around the UI design that the community wants to build as we go forward. 
There is some good code the Animo put together for using Aries-Framework-Javascript in a RN project, and Indicio is currently in the process of merging the two pieces together. So, from my perspective, it's not yet practically deployable, but this should change shortly.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 01:39:08 GMT):<br/>
Awesome! I am glad you were able to get it up and running.
The current Aries-Bifold code that Indicio has contributed only is working in an Android context, however the intention and work in progress is to shift to using Aries-Framework-Javascript, and this would rely on rn-indy-sdk (https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk), which implements the necessary native modules for both Android and iOS. 
So, the short of it is that it's in progress and I expect to be able to use Aries Bifold from within an iOS context soon.

Nice work on the app update! The QR code seems to be scanning now but a promise is being rejected (I'd be happy to look into that). Only thing that should probably be noted in the docs is the requirement for `aries-framework-javascript`. Need to reference that to build the app now.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 20:20:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes! Good note @amanji. There's some finicky pieces in actually running successfully and/or some additional documentation that would be beneficial--which is partially why we didn't do a release quite yet. As of right now you will also need to create a .env file, containing something like the following:
MEDIATOR_URL=https://dd652a260851.ngrok.io
GENESIS_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Indicio-tech/indicio-network/main/genesis_files/pool_transactions_testnet_genesis

If there's other stuff you find or have troubles with, I am all ears.

<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 23:04:53 GMT):<br/>
We followed the instructions referenced in Animo's docs for starting up the mediator here: https://github.com/animo/aries-mobile-agent-react-native
That will provide a ngrok tunnel so that it can have a public IP address.
We'll get those docs moved over to bifold soon

</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 17:51:30 GMT):<br/>
So, there's some additional steps that has needed to do happen to share this that I was not aware of previously. So, working on getting this shared soon, and I will keep you updated! 
One of my thoughts was to tackle some of the UI/UX conversations in this next User Group call, and this will be relevant/available in that process. Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Wed, 17 Mar 2021 21:11:09 GMT):<br/>
Hey, thought i'd give an update here. I'm able to load the app and scan a QR code (which is great) and currently running a mediator locally with docker and ngrok. I tried scanning a QR code to obtain a credential and I'm getting a `503` error:

```

```
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Wed, 17 Mar 2021 21:11:37 GMT):<br/>
I am likely missing an additional setup step somewhere
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 19:33:08 GMT):<br/>
Awesome! I am glad you've got it up and running--the more people who use the project the better! 
I think the 503 errors are unrelated actually. They occur with the current AFJ mediation implementation--I think the polling method is happening too often with Ngrok, and Ngrok returns a 503. So, this will be addressed with our current work on mediation, which utilizes Websockets instead of HTTP.

As to the actual issue, the connection actually got to state "complete", and is awaiting issuance. The UI is in a state in which that hasn't been made super clear. The UI/UX decisions is my primary suggestion of conversation for this next user group call.

<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 21 May 2021 23:10:29 GMT):<br/>
Fortunately that error looks more familar! :laughing:  So, I think downgrading likely addressed that first issue.
Question--are you trying to run on an iOS simulator? The indy-sdk doesn't work on iOS simulators--which is unfortunately a larger problem to tackle there. So, for iOS, you must test on-device.
If not, I _think_ I've seen that error most in relation to it not pulling in the Indy.Framework.. but since you cloned it, it should be fine.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 21 May 2021 23:14:33 GMT):<br/>
Happy to communicate on git or here--just wanted to provide here as an option too. Sometimes here can get slightly faster response times for error troubleshooting. But probably continue the conversation primarily in that issue. :)

Hello guys, I was facing a problem while initializing Bifold, as the screen shot, the async polyfills are missing. However I solved this problem by installing the missing polyfills, should I contribute to the project, maybe fork and create a pull request with the solution
</p>
<p><strong>moosops</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 06:47:46 GMT):<br/>
I created a pull request with the fix
</p>

Hi Devs
I can't seem to solve the following stubborn issue
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/issues/59
</p>
<p><strong>moosops</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 05:29:47 GMT):<br/>
Another enhancement (Which I find important) is adding some alerts to the user when initializing Bifold. If something goes wrong I should have a popup that addresses the issue or at least tell me something went wrong. I have enhanced the loading experience a little bit, if you find its a good idea I'll create a PR with the enhancments
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 09:20:27 GMT):<br/>
Hi @moosops, I created a (possible) fix for your issue in AFJ: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/pull/339
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 09:20:43 GMT):<br/>
PRs with improvements are always welcome!
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 09:21:40 GMT):<br/>
Aries Bifold is still in early stages so whenever something is missing it's just because we didn't work on it yet.
</p>
<p><strong>moosops</strong> (Fri, 02 Jul 2021 07:09:06 GMT):<br/>
Hi @TimoGlastra Things are moving quite fast in AFJ any chance to update bifold with the latest framework soon? 
I'am preparing some minor changes though that makes a better UI experience even for developers. something like alerting based on exceptions. am also working on some missing documentation
</p>

Hi @moosops, I have been ill recently, so, sorry for the delay, but this is something Indicio could help with--I don't think the updates _should_ be too significant here.
</p>

Hi @JamesEbert wish you are doing well now. This issue "341" was resolved now, it should be closed

Hello. I have the Aries Bifold app running on my Android phone, but I could use some help to proceed beyond this point. Is there a walkthrough on forming Connections and acquiring Credentials, that goes beyond the Readme doc in the repo?  I need to help connecting to a mediator and a network. Any help or pointers appreciated. Thank you.

Hi, i am using Aries bifold Android Studio Emulator. I was able to deploy the app, what is the best way to scan a QR code from the emulator?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 15 Jul 2021 17:13:05 GMT):<br/>
Awesome! I've found that the best way is if you can use a correct emulator (I believe the Google images work this way), then you can use the camera in a virtualized scene and attach images, such as a QR code. 
You could also use a webcam and use that as the source, but that would require an external way to display that QR code.
</p>
<p><strong>madhugoundla</strong> (Thu, 15 Jul 2021 17:20:21 GMT):<br/>
I just tried IOS Physical device as well, for some reason, the QR code is not getting scanned. i am using https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/ and pasting my invitation URL from my aca-py agent. Am i doing something wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>madhugoundla</strong> (Thu, 15 Jul 2021 19:13:45 GMT):<br/>
@JamesEbert I double checked, i cannot scan any QR codes both from IOS and Android. Even https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/ QR code.
</p>
<p><strong>madhugoundla</strong> (Sat, 17 Jul 2021 01:36:34 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra would you know the answer by any chance?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Sat, 17 Jul 2021 06:28:30 GMT):<br/>
Odd--I can give this some testing on my end to see if I can replicate. I assume there's no associated errors?
</p>
<p><strong>madhugoundla</strong> (Sat, 17 Jul 2021 14:04:17 GMT):<br/>
No errors that i see @JamesEbert
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 07:02:13 GMT):<br/>
Can you make a screencast of scanning the QR? And maybe share the logs from the app? It's really hard to debug the problem without anything
</p>
<p><strong>madhugoundla</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 15:39:22 GMT):<br/>
Where can i check the logs? Is it on the terminal where i run “npm run start”for andriod emulator? I don’t know how to look for logs for ios as its installed on physical device. @TimoGlastra
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 16:28:27 GMT):<br/>
You can set the logger:

```
import { LogLevel, ConsoleLogger } from 'aries-framework'
```

and then in your config:

```
new Agent({
  // ... other config ...
  logger: new ConsoleLogger(LogLevel.trace)
})
```
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 16:28:48 GMT):<br/>
This should print detailed  logs to the terminal
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 16:29:07 GMT):<br/>
Could you run with this and post the logs?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 16:29:14 GMT):<br/>
That will make it easier to help you
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 16:32:05 GMT):<br/>
The Bifold app should have the logger already configured--and yes, you should be able to see the logs in the terminal that you ran `npm run start` in.

</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 20:29:18 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK Android does block http by default--but React Native enables it via setting the cleartext, which is also required for the Indy Nodes IIRC.

@JamesEbert
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 20:31:28 GMT):<br/>
It could be worthwhile restarting your mediator--ngrok will time out fairly aggressively sometimes.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 20:32:34 GMT):<br/>
And it seems like the issue is related to your mediator, vs the QR code you're scanning, since the network error we're seeing is happening at agent initialization vs at time of scanning as far as I can tell.
</p>
<p><strong>madhugoundla</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 20:34:24 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good, @JamesEbert. @TimoGlastra , i think it is my internet connection issue from my emulator. I thought it was on but looks like it is not.

Ngrok doesn't work really well with our polling strategy. If you update the app to the latest version you can use our public mediator (https://mediator.animo.id) for development
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 12:05:52 GMT):<br/>
@JamesEbert what is the timeline for updating AFJ to the latest version in the mobile agent?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 12:06:32 GMT):<br/>
(I'd like to offer to do it myself, but I would rather not promise things I won't get to)
</p>
<p><strong>madhugoundla</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 13:21:56 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra Just to make sure, you meant latest version of bifold correct?
</p>
<p><strong>Audrius</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 14:29:05 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 15:19:08 GMT):<br/>
No I meant the latest version of AFJ. Bifold still depends on an old version of Aries Framework JavaScript under the hood (currently using version 0.0.9-unstable.0, ~50 releases made since)
</p>
<p><strong>madhugoundla</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 16:27:53 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra do you have documentation on how to spin your own mediation agent on a VM?
</p>
<p><strong>madhugoundla</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 16:28:16 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @TimoGlastra let me try with your mediatior and let you know.

I think we could update Bifold by sometime next week--potentially before the next Bifold call. If there's immediate pressure might be able to do it sooner.

Hi everyone,

I have just started exploring the Aries React Native project (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native). I have done the following so far by following the video here (https://youtu.be/AomoHvw4lgc)

- Start the Mediator Agent (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/blob/main/docs/MEDIATION.md)
- Configure the React Native project (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native#running-the-app)
- Run the app on an Android device. The app launches without any issues

In the logs, I noticed an error when the app tries connecting with the Mediator Agent
```

Hey, seems to be a problem with the mediator
</p>
<p><strong>mateussousa</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 13:50:16 GMT):<br/>
the recommended mediator is not stable
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 03:04:12 GMT):<br/>
If you are using `bifold`,  I faced this too. I am using aca-py. I solved it by the following:
1. Create an accessible web to hold two endpoints
    - `/` holds `verkey`. Something like `{"verkey": "agent verkey"}`. This must be string. 
    - `/invitation` holds `invitation string`. Something like `http://your-host?c_i=eyJAdH...`. This must be string.

2. Ledger url
I notice that I can't use my own ledger url. I can only use the provided ledgers from the repo: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native. `Pool Timeout` error will appear if I call my own ledger but it would be fixed if you use those provided ledger. 

As I know that bifold project doesn't support aca-py yet. Maybe it does, now. I also don't understand why it supports only provided ledger but not newly installed ledger. Still need to dig into this as well.

`connections` undefined is because the agent is not started. From my above solution, it would work but I see `provisioning` doesn't work. I am not sure what the provision is but the mobile agent can still connect to the mediator and make a connection.

After connected to the mediator, there is a return error `Message parsing failed: Unrecognized message type https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/1.0/batch-pickup, sending problem report`
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sat, 21 Aug 2021 13:11:57 GMT):<br/>
Which mediator did you connect to?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sat, 21 Aug 2021 13:12:47 GMT):<br/>
There are multiple ways to retrieve messages from a mediator. It seems like you're using the explicit method (using batch-pickup) but the mediator only support the implicit method
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sat, 21 Aug 2021 13:13:06 GMT):<br/>
If you can give some context I may be able to help you get a working setup
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sat, 21 Aug 2021 13:16:15 GMT):<br/>
Ah I see in the #aries-cloudagent-python channel you're using ACA-Py. We're almost there, but the mobile agent first needs to be updated to the latest version of Aries framework JavaScript
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sat, 21 Aug 2021 13:17:35 GMT):<br/>
After that you can enable the implicit method by setting the following config parameter:
```
  const config = {
   mediatorPickupStrategy: MediatorPickupStrategy.Implicit
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Mon, 23 Aug 2021 15:23:28 GMT):<br/>
Let me try. Thank you
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Mon, 23 Aug 2021 15:28:23 GMT):<br/>
But in which file I should put the above lines?
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Mon, 23 Aug 2021 15:31:55 GMT):<br/>
I also have another issue with ledger url. Once I call my own setup ledger, I always receive the following error:
```
Object {
  "indyBacktrace": "",
  "indyCode": 307,
  "indyMessage": "Error: Pool timeout
  Caused by: Pool timeout
",
  "indyName": "PoolLedgerTimeout",
  "message": "PoolLedgerTimeout",
  "name": "IndyError",
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Mon, 23 Aug 2021 15:32:45 GMT):<br/>
It works just fine when call the provided ledger urls from the repo.
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Mon, 23 Aug 2021 15:47:48 GMT):<br/>
Just found out another solution. You can switch to version: 0.0.60-unstable.0 (AFJ)
</p>
<p><strong>SahilK 6</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 05:32:45 GMT):<br/>

if we are thinking of an e wallet app, how should i configure the mediator?

Hi all, I am trying to setup the AriesBifold app to run on an iOS emulator but I can't shake off this exception when building: could not find module 'Indy' for target 'x86_64-apple-ios-simulator'; found: arm64, armv7-apple-ios, arm64-apple-ios, arm, armv7. Has anyone seen this?
</p>
<p><strong>moisesja</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 12:27:33 GMT):<br/>
Did you execute the instructions here? https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/blob/main/docs/MEDIATION.md
</p>
<p><strong>moisesja</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 12:28:35 GMT):<br/>
The mediator is essentially a proxy to your mobile wallet. It is meant to be deployed to a public IP (thus it uses grok).
</p>
<p><strong>moisesja</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 12:36:08 GMT):<br/>
Please disregard, apparently the Indy module is not supported for the emulator, only to the device.

Hi All, tring to run the bifold.
Have the following confusion 
(a) mediator sample latest repo doesnt seem to have (GET::/) handler. Only has (GET::/invitation
(b) RN code suggests that mediator is handling the queing and fwding of messages meant for each individual mobile agent which are sharing connection with it. The mediator code file seems to have no such logic in code.
Any comments regarding the above would be really helpful :)

<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 12:58:16 GMT):<br/>
The logic for handling forward messages it actually part of the Aries JS framework. So you can't see it in mediator sample code.
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Fri, 03 Sep 2021 16:57:11 GMT):<br/>
Switch to this release `0.0.60-unstable.0` you will be able to access both / and /invitation
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Mon, 06 Sep 2021 23:34:40 GMT):<br/>
Is there a recommended version of AFJS to use with AFRN? Currently AFJS referenced is `0.0.9-unstable` in AFRN and I seem to have issues getting the mobile agent to initialize particularly in regards to connecting to the mediator. One of the connection endpoints returns a 404 and the agent context is not set past this point.

@phearaeun , thank you so much 0.0.60 works perfectly in the regard.
Another follow up question though - AMARN uses 0.0.9 as dependancy and has the syntax in accordance to it.
While trying to process a VC (forwarded by the mediator) from an external agent it is showing the following   
`Error: No handler for message type "https://didcomm.org/issue-credential/2.0/offer-credential" found`

This I suspect is because issue-credential-2.0 is not handled in version 0.0.9. 
Also cannot move to higher version  for AMARN dependancy (liek 0.0.60) since Aries bifold code is written with the outdated AFJ syntax is mind.
Any suggestions on this would be helpful.

In terms of the current, I was able to build bot the Android and iOS apps using AFJS `0.60.0-unstable.0` for the mediator, all other packages being the same in AMARN. Where I do get stuck at in both cases is connecting to the cloud agent (which I'm running in the browser with Play with VON). Wondering if anyone else had the same issue and was able to get past it. Perhaps it's a network issue on my part.

Are you still using `0.0.60-unstable.0` for the mediator?

Hey. Somewhat new to the hyperledger world. Does Bifold talk to Aries, Indy, or Both? I see both SDKs are built in.

I've pulled the latest code and I'm seeing this error when running the build:
```
LOG  Running "aries-bifold" with {"rootTag":1,"initialProps":{}}
 ERROR  Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app
See https://reactjs.org/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.

Hey, I'm curious, has anyone evaluated doing a wallet as a PWA? I'd be curious what makes something native preferable (maybe the ability to reuse libraries or UI/UX or speed)?

<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 17:04:30 GMT):<br/>
Use v1 to issue credential `/issue-credential/send-offer`. Bifold doesn't support `.../2.0/offer...`
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 17:50:38 GMT):<br/>
Correct--we have intentions of adding issue-credential v2 support, but we've not gotten there yet. :)

<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 17:51:23 GMT):<br/>
As of the most recent PR--yes! https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/pull/75
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 17:52:23 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Anasalamin, one of our most recent PRs that was merged would allow you to use ACA-Py as a mediator (since we upgraded AFJ), so you would now be able to use the Indicio Public Mediator if helpful to help reduce issues you're encountering: https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:04:01 GMT):<br/>
Any insight @NeilMyers ^?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:13:43 GMT):<br/>
I think the biggest challenges I see first is the long term reliable storage, storage capacity, security (as native has more inherent/available security than a web based application), and processing speed (given some of the intensive crypto operations). 
Also we've primarily relied so far on Indy credentials, which given that the indy-sdk is written in Rust and wrapped into other languages makes it quite difficult to be able to use in a web context AFAIK. We want to be able to use JSON-LD with BBS+ in the future, so Indy may not be a full concern here long term. 
I may be missing some relevant thoughts or nuances, but so far it doesn't seem it meets some of the required needs. I would be interested to hear other's thoughts here too.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:35:41 GMT):<br/>
Hi folks! As discussed in our last Bifold call, we're looking to change our meeting time to a more friendly hour for our European folks. The currently proposed time is Tuesdays at 11 AM EDT, which would mirror the proposed ACA-Pug time change. Does anybody have concerns on this proposed shift or other proposed time slots for consideration?
</p>
<p><strong>NeilMyers</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:45:15 GMT):<br/>
ya, gotta delete the node modules inside the aries-hooks folder.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:46:27 GMT):<br/>
Is this something that was fixed in our PR #75, or is this something applicable to every person who is installing the project?
</p>
<p><strong>NeilMyers</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:47:53 GMT):<br/>
it will probably be a problem until it's living in its own space like it's supposed to
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:48:32 GMT):<br/>
Hmmm--we should probably accelerate our efforts to move it then.

<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 02:06:15 GMT):<br/>
Turn on `debug` and use `--aip 10` at aca-py. If you create your own aca-py instance rather than the demo, please pay attention to the endpoint.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-bifold?msg=zkMuJZSvLkiGdKBMf) I'd like to share with you how I backup and restore the mobile wallet. I am not sure if it is the correct way to do. However, it seems work fine. If it's not, please advise me.

Backup:
1. On real device (Android), the bifold creates a default agent at `Internal Storage/Android/data/com.ariesbifold/files` named `.indy_client`
2. So I backup the entire `.indy_client` into `mywallet.zip`. You can name anything.

Restore:
Note: You should disable where the bifold creates wallet id automatically and create another function to revoke the instance. It's good if you can make some connections and issue some credentials so that you can see the old transactions after you restore.

1. Delete `.indy_client`
2. Restore and extract `mywallet.zip` into `/Internal Storage/Android/data/com.ariesbifold/files`
3. Revoke instance

Everything above seems work fine but I still have no idea how to backup and restore wallet key. Hope you'll have something to share with me too.

Thanks

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 13:27:05 GMT):<br/>
I think the latest version of Bifold is now updated to work with the latest version of AFJ again
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 13:27:20 GMT):<br/>
So you can use the sample mediator from the current main branch of AFJ
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 13:28:23 GMT):<br/>
Or use one of the public mediators (e.g. https://mediator.animo.id/invitation )
</p>
<p><strong>Anasalamin</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 13:29:07 GMT):<br/>
i see, thank you for the insight

<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 16:24:03 GMT):<br/>
As @TimoGlastra said the latest update of AFJ and bifold is now available. You can check it out. I've not tried that yet.

i established a connection from my ACA-Py agent and to my mobile agent. then i tried to send a credential request using Aries-toolbox but i'm not getting anything from the mobile side!
what am i doing wrong?
PS: my mediator is the public one from https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/

Is it possible to allow `auto accept request` on bifold? Say, I want to request proof. I've tried to send request from aca-py but nothing updated on the bifold.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:25:30 GMT):<br/>
M1 is always giving us issues... @JamesEbert does anyone at Indicio work with M1 macs? If not I can ask Berend to give it a go
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:27:55 GMT):<br/>
Yes that's possible! In the agent config you can specify the `autoAcceptCredentials` and `autoAcceptProofs` properties. `ContentApproved` means you have to accept the credential offer, but the rest will be automated. You can also use `Always` which will always accept credential offers/proof requests no matter what

```
{
  autoAcceptCredentials: AutoAcceptCredential.ContentApproved,
  autoAcceptProofs: AutoAcceptProof.ContentApproved,
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:51:52 GMT):<br/>
@NeilMyers this might be relevant to the issue you're looking at ^
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:54:37 GMT):<br/>
Yeah.. @david.clawson does, but Berend's assistance definitely would be appreciated, David is fairly knees deep in another project at the moment.

Just a reminder that the Aries Bifold call is happening right now!
</p>
<p><strong>karimStekelenburg1</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 19:06:15 GMT):<br/>
Hi all! In the call that is going on right now we have agreed upon moving the bi-weekly meeting to Tuesday 3PM GTM (5PM CEST). The ACA-Py bi-weekly also moved to this time, so this way we'll stay on the other end of the bi-weekly Bifold-ACAPy schedule (if that makes any sense). This rescheduling will take effect starting the next meeting.

If anyone objects to this rescheduling, let us know here and we'll look into other options!
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 08:14:01 GMT):<br/>
OK. Thank you very much. Let me try the options.
</p>
<p><strong>Anasalamin</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 07:54:31 GMT):<br/>
that's most likely to be from the mediator which it's not forwarding requests. i'm facing the same problem and i couldn't find a workaround for it

Hey team, who is the Bifold gatekeeper? Lots of useful PRs awaiting to be merged. I created a PR only to find I've done duplicated fixes already done in pending PRs. Lets get that wallet a good example for AFJ
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 06:35:02 GMT):<br/>
Hi folks, we've been working to resolve any issues with mediation (@anasalamin), and I'm going to look to work with @karimStekelenburg1 tomorrow on some PR reviews, since a number of them have been my own. 
I will look to post a follow-up status update here tomorrow. Thanks!

Hi All,
I have fired the sample mediator of AFJ up with a custom VON ledger that I have running in an EC2.
Now, I also configured the Bifold app to use the same ledger by providing same geneissPath. 
This gives timeout when attempt to open indy connection is made from AFJ. Any insight on this, why this might be happening?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 01 Oct 2021 05:15:52 GMT):<br/>
Is this a URL or a genesis path? Right now Bifold is configured to auto download the genesis from a url for the genesis file--however I think we should move this download into AFJ, so that would offer the greatest flexibility to a developer. cc @TimoGlastra 
If it's a local path you're passing that _could_ potentially be causing issues? That give any insight @AniketDhar?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 01 Oct 2021 05:21:56 GMT):<br/>
Hey folks! We have a pending PR for addressing mediation and workflow issues. @karimStekelenburg1 has communicated he will look at the PRs, but prior to being merged you can use the branch `fix/polyfillsIntl` with an ACA-Py mediator. The README has also been updated in these PRs to help with the setup process. 
If you run into any issues with the branch or documentation, please reach out!

The above issue occurred after I added `autoAcceptProofs`. Removed it and now it works. But there is another issue with the mediator invite url.
```

}
 ERROR  Aries-Hooks: ERROR IN SET_INITIAL_STATE: [AriesFrameworkError: InvitationUrl is invalid. It needs to contain one, and only one, of the following parameters; `c_i` or `d_m`]
```
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:12:35 GMT):<br/>
My mediator invite is `https://5e2d-103-14-250-129.ngrok.io/invitation`. Do I need to change this?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:16:51 GMT):<br/>
Heya! That looks like an AFJ mediator url? Right now Bifold is specifically configured for an ACA-Py mediator, so by default I'd recommend using Indicio's public mediator invitation: 
http://mediator3.test.indiciotech.io:3000?c_i=eyJAdHlwZSI6ICJkaWQ6c292OkJ6Q2JzTlloTXJqSGlxWkRUVUFTSGc7c3BlYy9jb25uZWN0aW9ucy8xLjAvaW52aXRhdGlvbiIsICJAaWQiOiAiYjE5YTM2ZjctZjhiZi00Mjg2LTg4ZjktODM4ZTIyZDI0ZjQxIiwgInJlY2lwaWVudEtleXMiOiBbIkU5VlhKY1pzaGlYcXFMRXd6R3RtUEpCUnBtMjl4dmJMYVpuWktTU0ZOdkE2Il0sICJzZXJ2aWNlRW5kcG9pbnQiOiAiaHR0cDovL21lZGlhdG9yMy50ZXN0LmluZGljaW90ZWNoLmlvOjMwMDAiLCAibGFiZWwiOiAiSW5kaWNpbyBQdWJsaWMgTWVkaWF0b3IifQ==
This can be configured differently in AFJ of course, but I haven't done any configuration with AFJ as a mediator in Bifold as of yet.
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:19:37 GMT):<br/>
Inside the .env file we have to include this full url for the mediator?

<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:55:29 GMT):<br/>
This might be a red herring here from ACA-Py's side, but I'm not necessarily the ACA-Py expert. One thing to check is to make sure your genesis url is on the same ledger as your ACA-Py is on. I'd also recommend an uninstall and reinstall of Bifold to ensure you are starting from a clean state.
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:55:57 GMT):<br/>
Sure, the ledger is the same.
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:56:35 GMT):<br/>
It's an old demo app which works fine with old bifold. It supports only aip 10.
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:57:12 GMT):<br/>
Let me try again, however.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:57:32 GMT):<br/>
Also, did you receive any messages on the app side, or it never got that far?
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:57:40 GMT):<br/>
I did.
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:58:39 GMT):<br/>
Let me review my aca-py. I used different instances and probably multitennacy involved.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:59:09 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good! :thumbsup:
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 06:04:49 GMT):<br/>
The error still persists
</p>
<p><strong>phearaeun</strong> (Sat, 02 Oct 2021 06:06:49 GMT):<br/>
I think it's not bifold issue. It's aca-py side.

Are you able to use the Sovrin Builder Net? Or another public ledger? I wonder if there's an issue here with your specific ledger? Is your issuer able to use it?
</p>
<p><strong>AniketDhar</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 18:37:25 GMT):<br/>
My issuer (with ACAPY) is able to use it perfectly
I had also changed the sample mediator impl which comes with AFJ to use this genesis. This also worked fine.
I have also tried pool create and pool connect from indy-cli with this specific ledger. 
All above seems to work except Bifold.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 18:40:16 GMT):<br/>
Interesting.. to confirm, is your phone in a position in which it actually can communicate with the ledger? If the ledger is running locally there could be issues connecting to it due to ip addresses/ports.
</p>
<p><strong>AniketDhar</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 18:44:03 GMT):<br/>

AFJ running in another EC2 able to access the ledger.

</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 19:01:28 GMT):<br/>
No it shouldn't, as I'd expect your phone would be able to access your EC2 Ledger. @TimoGlastra any insights here?
Also, if you want to send me your genesis file @AniketDhar, we can see if we can recreate the issue, if that's helpful. :)
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 08:39:24 GMT):<br/>
@AniketDhar Is it able to download the genesis file just fine and is it storing the correct genesis transactions? By default you can't fetch HTTP (over HTTPS) urls, which may be the case with your genesis? If so having the genesis transactions locally (using `genesisTransactions`) could bypass that limitation
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 08:39:49 GMT):<br/>
If that's not the case, you'd need to provide a lot more info and logs on what's going on
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 08:40:17 GMT):<br/>
Have you also verified that you phone is connected to the internet?

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 08:40:55 GMT):<br/>

> however I think we should move this download into AFJ, so that would offer the greatest flexibility to a developer.
I'm not too keen on adding this to the framework. I wouldn't necessarily recommend fetching the genesis file on startup. Especially on mobile devices I'd recommend bundling the genesis files with the application itself
</p>
<p><strong>AniketDhar</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 12:54:56 GMT):<br/>
Being able to get the mediation request granted.
How are handling the inboundTransport for the mobile agent. There seemed to be a Polling module for the previous version of the Bifold app, which this version does  not.
Neither am I seeing batch pickup messages in logs.
Which angle am I missing here @JamesEbert . Please comment.

@TimoGlastra yes, the correct genesis info Json is being fetched and stored in local file storage of mobile. That confimred.
Also, now I am doing things with other public ledger like http://greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io/genesis. 
It is working :)
As to why the custom hosted VON ledger was non-responsive only for the mobile is still mystery.

<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 19:00:27 GMT):<br/>
Good point @TimoGlastra--I'm not sure where this functionality came from honestly. I was previously having the transactions locally.. Probably could be a good idea to switch our functionality here.

``I'm not too keen on adding this to the framework. I wouldn't necessarily recommend fetching the genesis file on startup. Especially on mobile devices I'd recommend bundling the genesis files with the application itself``

This came from our original mobile agent to make it easier to switch between ledgers. That was before the genesis transactions parameter existed

Hey, I'm from the BCGov. I think we mentioned before about us leveraging and contributing back to Bifold. We have a meeting at 2-2:45 PT today. If anyone from the Bifold team wants to join and chime in feel free. We're going to go through some of the challenges of picking up the project and how we might address them before we decide to go all in. Also, I think we'd like to get a leg up on how data flows up/down through the stack. DM me if you're interested.

@TimoGlastra et al. The TL;DR for Bifold in BCGov is we are going to lean into it. Our current plan is to shore it up by: getting the pipeline building again; decouple the UI so its ez to drop your own UI on; get more ppl involved in administration (PR review etc); update packages (especially AFJ - we need latest and greatest); and a longer term goal of chipping away at greatly improving automated test coverage.

I think the above has wider implications that will make Bifold more usable to a few other provinces in Canada looking to leverage a common infrastructure. I think, an ideal outcome would be for Bifold to be something we can continuously pull in for updates but drop our own UI in with little to no effort.

Anyone notice the iOS build takes forever? Even on my MBP it take exceedingly long compared to Android. Almost like its re-compiling everything when I do a build and not leveraging artifacts already build (without any changes)?

<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 20 Oct 2021 23:37:44 GMT):<br/>
As a note on AFJ--we're not too far behind on updates here. I don't think there are any large/significant breaking changes from our current version. I definitely agree though, but this fortunately means any lift here should be pretty light.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 20 Oct 2021 23:39:48 GMT):<br/>
Having a common UI base/packages to work from would be an awesome thing to help make Bifold more useful and maintainable, and I agree this would be a very good next step to tackle.
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Thu, 21 Oct 2021 17:28:03 GMT):<br/>
I think I fixed the local prob. GitHub Actions takes forever still. Issue seems to be on GH macOS the Podfile.lock hash for
```
-  FBReactNativeSpec: e72d4225cc9c573e3cf0e0078973b29f31e82272
+  FBReactNativeSpec: 09a348614adf99e2f45ab1c4be8a1edece56b6f3
```

Which invalidates any derived data so it does a fresh build.  Or perhaps it's just not using the cache. Still looking...

Hi folks! We've had a bunch of additional people jump into help on the Bifold project. I would like to propose adding @Jason.Leach, @amanji from the BC Gov team, and @NeilMyers from Indicio as maintainers for https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native. 
Are there any current maintainers, @TimoGlastra, @karimStekelenburg1, or any community members opposed to these additions? Thanks!

<p><strong>cvarjao</strong> (Mon, 25 Oct 2021 17:29:16 GMT):<br/>
I've noticed a few imports have import statements don't use relative paths.
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/blob/main/App/screens/CredentialDetails.tsx#L7

Should we adhere to always use relative path when using local files? This will help potentially distributing bifold as re-useable UI components. Otherwise the naming resolution process may think that `components`  is a dependency package
</p>
<p><strong>NeilMyers</strong> (Mon, 25 Oct 2021 17:32:57 GMT):<br/>
Na, I think aliases are a very common accepted practice. And it improves DX, it'll allow devs to restructure their files as needed too without having to ever change import statements
</p>
<p><strong>cvarjao</strong> (Mon, 25 Oct 2021 17:40:00 GMT):<br/>
I will read more about that. As I am trying to refactor the "App" folder to be a reusable package, those import statements break the build process.

I Haven't been able to setup babel to resolve the modules correctly when using bifold as a dependency. I could be wrong, but aliases might work better when producing bundles of javascript files. Is there anyone with more experience that might be able to help? Or if the team is not strong around aliases, removing them is the most easy straight forward way to get it working right now. And we could re-introduce in the future. Thoughts?

The credentialId was initially pulled from the notification object passed to the route params in `CredentialOffer.tsx`. It should now be passed directly to the route params but the Notification Component needs to be updated

oh cool. Those things will be fixed here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/pull/88
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 16:27:13 GMT):<br/>
I see this also. I think it's because `credentiaId` is undefined in `acceptOffer` or `rejectOffer` and somewhere lower in the stack (Indy SDK Maybe?) it's not happy. I was considering spending some time to track it down so its dealt with better (so the app does not just crash but rather we get an exception).
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 16:28:59 GMT):<br/>
Do we think it is worth digging deeper to better deal with this condition in (presumably) the Indy SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 16:29:14 GMT):<br/>
Or better to deal with it in AFJ?
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 16:29:41 GMT):<br/>
I think if the ID is undefined the app should not crash and quit. Better to deal with it gracefully.
</p>
<p><strong>NeilMyers</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 16:38:27 GMT):<br/>
ya, I thought trys would stop that from happening? there's not a lot of response from asynchronous functions in AFJ
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:28:45 GMT):<br/>
I'd agree ^
If this is an error from AFJ, I'd definitely think this would be smart to address in AFJ. Thoughts @TimoGlastra?
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 18:49:13 GMT):<br/>
There probably needs to be some improvement from bubbling the errors up from the SDK to AFJ
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 18:50:07 GMT):<br/>
Although I have never gone deeper than AFJ (even that I have superficially looked at)

@NeilMyers Do you build on an M1 mac? Seeing this in the new Podfile `__apply_Xcode_12_5_M1_post_install_workaround`
</p>
<p><strong>NeilMyers</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 18:52:51 GMT):<br/>
na, that's just part of the RN upgrade.
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 18:53:25 GMT):<br/>
K. For some reason a cli xcode build does not like it.
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 18:53:45 GMT):<br/>
Seeing if one of the other solutions in the issue fix it.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 18:54:07 GMT):<br/>
It's worth noting we've had issues with M1's in the past--especially from an Indy perspective. @TimoGlastra & @Beri would have the most recent experience looking into this.
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 19:35:47 GMT):<br/>
Ok, its not that. The Podfile says target iOS 11.0 but the project says target 10.0. Will do PR with a fix if testing works out.

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 20:13:42 GMT):<br/>
Agreed. TBH the react native indy sdk probably needs some good work, but we’re mostly focussing our efforts on the new shared components libraries
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 20:17:30 GMT):<br/>
We’ve finaly nailed down the installation process of indy for M1 macs, if you ever need it: https://medium.com/@AnimoSolutions/how-to-install-libindy-for-macos-with-apple-silicon-to-use-with-aries-framework-javascript-ffe9719ab2e

<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 15:00:40 GMT):<br/>
Makes sense to me ^ The shared libraries should in theory also be able to replace the indy-sdk, right?

Yes -- with that we don't need the indy-sdk anymore

I think it would be nice to have an "automatically answer this proof request in the future" option when responding to a proof request.  Right now, when you get a proof request, all the wallets I've used will present the request and ask you to confirm to send the requested data (and potentially pick the credential(s) to present).  If we have a task that the user has to do regularly (for example presenting their COVID vaccination status, or presenting a credential to log into a web site) then automating the confirmation step will make the interaction as simple as tapping your bus pass when you board a bus
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 17:43:46 GMT):<br/>
(For most requests we want to get user confirmation but if it something they do regularly they should have the ability to automate that step)
</p>
<p><strong>NeilMyers</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 17:53:49 GMT):<br/>
ya, just like a "Always Approve Requests From This Verifier" button
</p>
<p><strong>cvarjao</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 17:55:55 GMT):<br/>
I am aware that our user experience folks have been looking into that flow from both "trusted verifier" (always approve),  and from a "trusted/known request" (regardless of the verifier)

Do you think this should be an AFJ or Bifold level feature? We definitely need some work on the UI, but I think it may be nice to add this to AFJ so all wallets can automatically adopt this by setting a property on the connection record

</p>
<p><strong>cvarjao</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 18:51:46 GMT):<br/>
I see it as both. My assumption is that some ideas/features may be quicker to test and get feedback from the UI/Bifold level, and as it matures, it influences changes to AFJ as well, and features can move down the stack. Whether it starts at AFJ or Bifold, I guess it is a matter of which one has the time to get that implemented quicker for feedback

Hey after the most recent Bifold updates, we're seeing a failure to retrieve cred defs from the ledger:

</p>
<p><strong>timbl</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 22:15:26 GMT):<br/>
```There are two scenarios here:

1. Same proof different verifier "trusted/known request" as per cvarjao - i.e vaccine credential
2. Same verifier and same proof - i.e. I present proof of age at the same liquor store on a regular basis. 

For item two, there is some risk if it is just the verifier that is trusted.

<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 22:15:54 GMT):<br/>
I think its because the app is now configured to use IndicioTestNet which the cred def wont be on
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 22:16:22 GMT):<br/>
I can see we no longer read in the `GENESIS_URL`
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 22:22:45 GMT):<br/>
I was able to resolve the issue by swapping out the IndicioTestNet genesis blocks with Sovrin Staging
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 29 Oct 2021 07:00:36 GMT):<br/>
If we update to the latest version of AFJ, we can support multiple indy ledgers at the same time and switching won’t be needed anymore

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sun, 07 Nov 2021 16:41:04 GMT):<br/>
Hi @bhathiya , welcome! Currently Bifold doesn't support `did:key` or `did:web` methods, only `did:sov`. Bifold is built on top of Aries Framework JavaScript (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript) which would first need to get support for this. It is on our roadmap to add these to the framework

Been having a bit of a fun time trying to figure out how to capture a redirect (302) from an HTTP request in RN. From what I've been able to find, RN's implementation of the `fetch` API doesn't support the `redirect:manual` config option (which is exactly what I'd need to handle the redirect. The second option is `Axios` however I haven't been able to handle redirects using the `maxRedirect` config option. This becomes relevant when using credential based authentication workflows such as `vc-authn-oidc` which uses the redirect header to specify connection-less protocols. Does anyone have suggestions on which request library supports redirect handling? Or is this something at the native layer that needs to be implemented?

Hi, i have one question regarding supported Indy ledgers in bifold.....I don't want to use 'Indicio' or 'Sovrin' test ledgers...will it work if i provide GENESIS_URL property in .env that's pointing to some other Indy ledger? 
Or, i can 'workaround' it by providing the ledger config in configs/ledgers/indy/ ?
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Tue, 16 Nov 2021 17:14:21 GMT):<br/>
It no longer uses a URL. Now just remove the ledgers from `configs/ledgers/indy/` and add the one you want to use.
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Tue, 16 Nov 2021 17:14:42 GMT):<br/>
It will work just fine without the two ledgers you mention.

Is there a way to install `indy-sdk-react-native` as part of the `npm install` lifecycle? I think it would be nice to have that as a dependency instead of vendoring it. I can easily write up a `post install`  script to download and setup the binaries for Android, but I am not so sure about how to do that for iOS. The `indy-sdk-react-native` readme is very vague on the iOS setup, it just says "copy Indy.framework into that directory". If that `Indy.framework`  is available for download, I can use post install script to setup same as android. Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:10:18 GMT):<br/>
I think it would be great to have that. What I see most project do for android is create an `.aar` file that contains everything needed.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:10:45 GMT):<br/>
However I'm not sure of what is needed for iOS. In the past you were able to install libindy through the pod but this has been broken for a long time
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:11:09 GMT):<br/>
Therefore you need to manually copy the `Indy.Framework`
</p>
<p><strong>NeilMyers</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:13:55 GMT):<br/>
I'd say if you have time to work on it, go ahead. But I can also do this if you'd like
</p>
<p><strong>cvarjao</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:19:25 GMT):<br/>
Is there a copy of that `Indy.Framework` published somewhere? I am looking in this readme which doesn't say where to get a copy of that folder:
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk-react-native#ios
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:22:39 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:22:49 GMT):<br/>
It's in the aries-mobile-agent-react-native repository
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:23:16 GMT):<br/>
I was able to build it a few months ago and since then we've just been copying it between project :sweat_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>cvarjao</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:24:45 GMT):<br/>
I was hoping there was something published like the android ones:

https://repo.sovrin.org/android/libindy/stable/1.15.0/

https://repo.sovrin.org/ios/libindy/stable/libindy-core/1.15.0/ ?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:25:09 GMT):<br/>
Not something you can directly use
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:25:13 GMT):<br/>
There is no framework published
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:26:00 GMT):<br/>
Our strategy for now is to keep this setup until we can migrate to the shared components libraries
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:26:37 GMT):<br/>
We'll be working on wrappers for React Native in the coming months and we'll make sure the setup will be as easy as possible

<p><strong>cvarjao</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:27:05 GMT):<br/>

I've been able to get connection-less requests working by calling (`agent.receiveMessage(inboundPackedMessage)`, which is a good step forward. Running into a weird error after the proof has been accepted by the verifier. It looks like the mobile agent attempts to send another outbound message but the request is aborted and an error is thrown. I'll make a video of the entire workflow but wondering if anyone has run into this issue?

So the verifier is sending a message to the wallet?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 19:00:01 GMT):<br/>
I've seen that in Trinsic a bunch of times.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 19:00:19 GMT):<br/>
Not always -- probably because the timeout may not be consistent.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 19:00:35 GMT):<br/>
And perhaps esatus always ignores it.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 19:00:56 GMT):<br/>
Interesting to know what the verifier is doing if the verification is complete...

Which version of AFJ is the wallet using? I've run into some problems recently where ACA-Py would hold the http connection if `return_route` was included resulting in a timeout even though nothing was really wrong. Fixed in this pr https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/pull/512 (which should be approx version ~295+ of AFJ)
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 23:40:31 GMT):<br/>
Seems to be an issue specifically with this AFJ call:

        proof?.requestMessage?.indyProofRequest,
        undefined

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 22 Nov 2021 14:00:34 GMT):<br/>
This is on our to do list.  The one from Indicio is intended to be that one, but not confirmed.  @JamesEbert , is Indicio willing to have that repo become "aries-mediator-service"?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Mon, 22 Nov 2021 17:08:35 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran yep! We're on-board with contributing the infra-mediator repo (https://github.com/Indicio-tech/infra-mediator) for this service!
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Mon, 22 Nov 2021 17:10:12 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 22 Nov 2021 21:02:07 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Mon, 22 Nov 2021 23:30:53 GMT):<br/>

For the discussion today about caching and Trust Registry/Machine Readable Governance the presentation we gave a few months back may be helpful - https://www.continuumloop.com/trust-registries-webinar/

In particular towards the end we cover off many of the primitives that are needed and the overlap with the machine readable governance file approach is reasonable. The issue I find is that there are >1 providers of that data so building a virtual governance map/graph will be required.

What do we think of installing expo-modules. They've made it a lot lighter, and it'll allow us to exchange some current libraries for expo's that'll improve DX and possibly lighten the app size too. https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sun, 28 Nov 2021 14:29:14 GMT):<br/>
We are using expo modules for our current app and I'm quite happy with it. Expo makes stuff a lot easier and once you have the setup done it works the same for all packages. One reason I'm also in favour of using expo modules is that it works with the new EAS service. We intend to make the new shared component libraries integrate with the new expo plugin system and would eventually like to make sure all dependencies support autolinking. This would mean you don't need the `ios` / `android` directories anymore and using AFJ in React Native becomes a lot easier. So I'm fully in favour of using as much expo libraries as possible! :thumbsup:
</p>
<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 13:56:40 GMT):<br/>
As discussed in one of the Mobile Summit meetings Ontario has added some security guidance documentation to Bifold. PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/pull/153
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 18:51:23 GMT):<br/>
I'll disclaim this by first saying not an `expo` expert by any stretch. 
We've found Expo wasn't overly suitable for use in our Enterprise environment. When one of our apps used it it (appeared) to require our certificats and profiles to be uploaded to remote servers for the build. This is probably fine if you're a scrappy startup but made our security pros raise and eyebrow.
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 18:52:43 GMT):<br/>
It's generally not Ok for us to upload a sensitive credential to remote servers. We also have limits on what we can upload and where based on privacy legislation. For example, if the servers are outside of Canada some things can be and issue and generally forbidden if they'r in a place like Russia.
</p>
<p><strong>NeilMyers</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 18:53:01 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense, we won't use the service, just making it possible to using their libraries
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 18:53:03 GMT):<br/>
When I ejected the app from expo it was a bit of a headache to get it to build.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 18:53:15 GMT):<br/>
I think what you’re referring to Jason is the managed workflow. You also have the bare workflow
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 18:54:09 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I think so long as we don't add too much magic to the build so that it's hard to grind one out.
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 18:55:30 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra Do the `iOS` and `Android` build dirs go away?
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 19:02:29 GMT):<br/>
Wondering because that's where custom fonts and app icons go.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 19:11:22 GMT):<br/>
No they don’t
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 19:11:58 GMT):<br/>
We use expo in all our of wallets — and for one we also manage certificates ourselves
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 19:15:23 GMT):<br/>
I think it would be mostly fine then so long as it doesn't' burden enterprise with complicated builds.

Feedback welcome on this PR. It adds an on-boarding carousel screen. I think I'll put it in the app for now, then once its tested a bit extract it to an NPM package like `@bcgov/bifold-on-boarding` to make it ez for teams to remove or customize. Uses SVG graphics and a short blurb of text for each screen.

How does bifold connect to a mediator?  Is there a configuration somewhere with the mediator invitation?

The Ontario digital identity team has been looking at various options to secure the wallet and wallet encryption key. Biometrics is fairly straight-forward via react-native-keychain. Falling back is not so easy and requires native IOS and Android code.

The Ontario digital identity team has been looking at various options to secure the wallet and wallet encryption key. Biometrics is fairly straight-forward via react-native-keychain. Falling back to a wallet pin/password is not so easy and requires native IOS and Android code.

Timo provided another option to use  key derivation with the PIN via PBKDF2. The derived wallet key is stored on the keychain and accessed via biometrics. If that fails the wallet key can be derived from the PIN as a fallback. Still re-searching the security implications.

The problem is that crypto on react native is messy requiring polyfills, shims and other hacks - see https://github.com/mvayngrib/react-native-crypto. It is much easier to just implement PBKDF2 as native code, which has been done multiple times. The problem is that there is not much motivation to keep the implementations current with react native versions as the underlying codes is so simple. The native IOS/Android code is just a call to existing crypto API's

Is there any interest in a PR that would implement the PBKDF2 algorithm as native code in the bifold repo or the AFJ Extensions repo? I think it would be more likely that the code would remain up-to-date.

Hi everyone, from now if you want to install the latest version of AFJ use the `@alpha` tag. I'm in preparation of the first `0.1.0` release which will be the version installed if you run `npm install @aries-framework/core` (after it has been released) while the latest commit will be installed if you run `npm install @aries-framework/core@alpha`.

Two options for salt. Looking for feedback

1. Generate a random number and store in the keychain - perhaps react-native-get-random-values polyfill with uuid?

2. Use a device identifier - react-native-device-info with getUniqueId() which returns the IDFV for IOS and ANDROID_ID for Android
</p>
<p><strong>cvarjao</strong> (Wed, 15 Dec 2021 18:32:00 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra , @JamesEbert , any other comments with regards to PR 139? This is really initial work of providing the indy-sdk as a dependency instead of including a copy. If that is the wrong approach, is there any other alternative?
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Wed, 15 Dec 2021 21:34:39 GMT):<br/>
Once this :point_up_2: is shored up I can look to do the iOS version also via a pod (assuming its needed).
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 16 Dec 2021 10:16:09 GMT):<br/>
I'm not 100% sure still I understand the approach. In my view Bifold is an app, and thus something different from a template or a library you would consume. If that's the case I think we should split out the components / reusable parts form the app
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 16 Dec 2021 10:17:48 GMT):<br/>
I don't have any objections to merging, you're way more involved with the project and infrastructure than I am
</p>
<p><strong>cvarjao</strong> (Thu, 16 Dec 2021 17:05:04 GMT):<br/>
I think we can leave the template/component approach as another topic. The main thing is removing the vendored-in dependency to a declarative way.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 Dec 2021 18:33:26 GMT):<br/>
The idea is more about collaboration than technical perfection.  What we want is to be able to work on Bifold (commits that repo) and have any easy way to deploy a Wallet version to stores for testing that looks like it is the BC Wallet (or Indicio, Ontario, Animo, Quebec, etc.). That way, the focus is on Bifold, but when we show it to our stakeholders, it has our own skin.

That will constrain the "big" variations we can have per deployed wallet, but allow us to work together in the Bifold repo, with minimal technical overhead.

Eventually, perhaps when really going to production, the copy-and-forget approach may be needed. But let's put that off for as long as possible.

Of course -- things that really are components MUST go into AFJ and AFJ-X.

We've had a decent meeting hiatus from the holidays + mobile agent summit, it looks like we're going to be kicking meetings off again next Tuesday, Jan 17th. Are there things people would like to add to the agenda for discussion? 

One item that could use discussion sooner though is transitioning Bifold to using Out Of Band (OOB) invitations in the Aries Transition RFC (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0496-transition-to-oob-and-did-exchange). We're most concerned with step 1 as of today. I _think_ that there was support added in AFJ for OOB processing--is this true, or did I miss something? If so, would someone be able to implement that functionality to Bifold, or potentially point me in the right direction for doing so? Thanks folks!

Generally i would like to understand what direction, aries-bifold is going, attend the meetings and see if we have something to contribute.
As for predicates, the ProofRequest screen only takes care to show requestedAttributes but not requestedPredicates, and i wanted to ask why it has not been done, to better understand the scopes of aries-bifold.

Yes! Currently AFJ does not support creating proof of non revocation, however this is something that I have been working on, and is nearing completion (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/pull/592). So once that PR is merged, this should be functioning as expected.

Hello @JamesEbert , for this meeting, is the zoom url referenced here https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings still the right one ?

As of right now predicate proof display is not supported, but is on the development roadmap we started putting together on this morning's user grouo call. I intend to work on this fairly soon, as we've done so in other projects, so it shouldn't be a super challenging work item.

Is Indicio's test mediator down?
</p>
<p><strong>regiseloi</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 16:18:31 GMT):<br/>
https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/ seems to be up, is this the one you meant?
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 16:19:07 GMT):<br/>
I think so. It's the one referenced in Bifold
</p>
<p><strong>regiseloi</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 16:23:32 GMT):<br/>
That webpage is up, but I can't complete the invitation process, so some of the services may not be running at the moment?
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 16:24:11 GMT):<br/>
Possibly. I'm having a similar issue with the invitation
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 19:02:17 GMT):<br/>
Also should we switch to AFJ 0.2.0-alpha in Bifold?
</p>
<p><strong>Jason.Leach</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 19:03:27 GMT):<br/>
What's changed?
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 19:04:50 GMT):<br/>
I haven't specifically looked but noticed that 0.1.0 has been released and I'm guessing 0.2.0 is where newer changes are being incorporated

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 19:50:31 GMT):<br/>
Probably obvious, but for a more stable experience I suggest moving from stable to stable version. We're making some breaking changes between alpha versions that may not work well when migrating (especially with storage). The only commits since the 0.1.0 release that adds value at the moment is this one I think: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/commit/61695ce7737ffef363b60e341ae5b0e67e0e2c90 It lazily connects to pools after startup which speeds up the first ledger interactions significantly. For bifold it may be fine to use alpha releases (and test out new features!), but we should discourage it outside of that

@JamesEbert . do you have any target date for that work? Is there anything we can do to help?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 15:43:38 GMT):<br/>
I can confirm that we had an outage, but the service should now be running as expected. Please let me know if there's any further issues.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 22:41:43 GMT):<br/>
Hey @cvarjao! I expect the PR to be merged into AFJ within the next day or two. There's a couple of things to work out based off of the results of the AATH integration. We're still working on revocation notification (Draft PR https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/pull/579), which is important from a UI/UX perspective. I expect that to be wrapped up by this coming Tuesday at the latest, unless we run into serious interop issues with ACA-Py.
We haven't scoped the work out for building out the UI portions in Bifold as of yet, so that may be an area that some discussion/splitting of work could be helpful.
</p>
<p><strong>cvarjao</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 22:42:48 GMT):<br/>
Yes! We can definitely help with implementing in BiFold!
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 22:43:07 GMT):<br/>
As a note @cvarjao we'll need to move to an 0.2.0-alpha AFJ version for revocation support, once that's merged.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 22:47:17 GMT):<br/>
Awesome, we could spend some time discussing this in the coming Bifold call?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 15:45:49 GMT):<br/>
Here's a PR for Bifold: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/pull/200

I would tend to agree with @TimoGlastra about sticking with stable releases, however we would like to support revocation in the wallets so for now we may have to stick with 0.2.0-alpha even if there's a risk for breaking changes. Once 0.2.0 stable is released we can stick to stable releases from that point onward.
