{"msg":"Hi everyone. Thanks for the call today. I just wanted to ask about the UX/UI, which is also kind of related to the name. If it should be a production-ready user-facing app, the UX/UI is an important part of it but not technology-specific. Do you have any UI design or idea of how to approach it?","username":"jakubkoci","ts":"2021-02-24T20:25:12.374Z"}
{"msg":"@jakubkoci we've got some UI elements built out already within the project, however I'd like to dedicate additional time and involve UI designers more to refine or replace those elements. Indicio participated in a DHS UI/UX design competition, and that design is the direction we've been heading towards internally in our app development. \nSo we could use those designs as a direction to head in or as a base point--However, I would love to hear other directions and input and suggestions from the community in this.\nIn terms of the actual branding though, we threw together some quick logos and colors for the name Aries Bifold. I'm not exactly sure what we would do for the default branding if we named the project Aries-Mobileagent-React-Native (which is where I lean naming-wise due to its descriptiveness and conforming with the current pattern). The default app branding could simply be named AMA-RN?","username":"JamesEbert","ts":"2021-02-25T21:35:47.875Z"}

We intend to make the new shared component libraries integrate with the new expo plugin system and would eventually like to make sure all dependencies support autolinking.
