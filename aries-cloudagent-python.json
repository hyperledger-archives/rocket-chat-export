{"msg":"Hi, I am wondering if there is any effort (or if it even make sense) to make stateless agents that are decoupled from wallets so that we can have multiple agents servicing the same wallet (stored in database) when demend is high; or have few agents servicing multiple wallets when demend is low. From the configurations of the ACA-py, it looks like an agent is bound to a given wallet and we would have to start another agent to service a different wallet even if our storage is postgres?","username":"pengyuc","ts":"2020-01-09T05:41:27.869Z"}
{"msg":"@pengyuc It may be possible but it's not that easy to implement. At the moment we open the wallet once at startup and keep it open, as that operation is slow and doing it on every request would kill performance. You could (probably) implement a more flexible wallet provider that kept the wallet instance open while it was being actively used, but there's still the issue of unpacking received messages. The agent can only look in the current wallet to identify the sending verkeys and find private keys for unpacking the messages, so it would have to know in advance which agent is meant to be active","username":"andrew.whitehead","ts":"2020-01-09T16:26:23.169Z"}

{"msg":"FYI: Aries Cloud Agent - Python Release 0.4.1 has been tagged and posted to PyPi. Release notes can be found here - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.4.1.\n\nThis release has a change that impacts interoperability with other agents in the handling of forward messages (RFC 0094). We'll upgrade our deployed instances of ACA-Py immediately after the public availability of the Streetcred mobile agents in the app stores to retain interoperability. Others should do the same. A list of other changes in the release are in the release notes. We're particularly pleased that the code base now has just a shade under 90% code coverage in unit tests. w00t!\n\nCode reference documentation has been generated to ReadTheDocs - https://aries-cloud-agent-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-01-31T22:16:09.842Z"}

Could you give me examples of data to persist in that database?\n\nOn the other hand, does the aca-py model support the \"peer\" method for the pairwaise did? Because I see, those generated through the services of the api, correspond to the \"sov\" method.\n\nThanks as always for your help.","username":"sebastillar","ts":"2020-02-13T03:05:14.175Z"}
{"msg":"Our feeling is that any data that is not related to keys, connections, held credentials and currently running Aries protocols should be managed by the controller - persisted or not at the discretion of the controller. For example, when an issuer issues a credential, the controller should save whatever is needed to be saved about the issuance.  Another example might be a basic message.  If the agent (e.g. the ACA-Py instance+controller) wants to save the message history of the agent with another connection, the controller should save that, not ACA-Py. \n\nACA-Py implements pairwise DIDs for communication using peer exchanged DIDs not stored on a ledger.  So while that is not full \"did:peer\" method support, it is along the way to that.  For example, I don't think the current implementation generates the DID string in the way \"did:peer\" requires, and there is currently no way to rotate the keys with the current support.  It is expected that the full \"peer:did\" support will come about as a result of the DIDComm standardization at DIF.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-02-13T03:22:14.531Z"}

{"msg":"Interesting question.  To prove a credential, you must have access to the \"Link Secret\" that was used during the issue process.  To this point, the Link Secret has been created in agent storage (aka Indy wallet) and never moved to another agent.  That prevents the scenario you mention above.  We think that such movement could be done, but it is definitely a dangerous activity.  Evernym has done some testing of a \"device authorization\" mechanism that might make that possible, but that's not on the horizon AFAIK.  Obviously, to be able to make a proof based on the credential, the credential would also have to be available on both devices. But that is not as risky a move.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-02-18T20:34:56.026Z"}

{"msg":"@blockLedger - a point about the `register_did` issue you ran into.  We're learning that a good pattern, especially for production is to have a provisioning process that:\n\n- looks in the wallet and ledger\n- makes sure that everything that is needed is exists or is created, and\n- exits\n\nThen, there should be the full agent that on startup:\n\n- looks in the wallet and on the ledger\n- makes sure that everything that is needed exists and errors/quits if not, and\n- runs to do all the agent-y things\n\nThat is partially because it isolates provisioning things that can be tricky to do on different ledgers (e.g. the TAA and endorser process on Sovrin) and allows the full agent to operate the ledger as read-only for the most part.\n\nThere could be exceptions, but we think it's a good pattern.

{"msg":"Hi Swcurran, I went through the OpenAPI demo, and I see that in that process, after invitation, we need to trigger one request, then response to complete the connection process. Then I follow the instruction of the aries controller demo, in this demo, after Alice controller(Angular) accepted the invitation from Faber, there is one active connection on both Faber and Alice, there is no additional step to request or response for the connection, and from the code, it only invoked the receive-invitation service, so I suppose there should one auto request and response for the invitation. As I want to only use Angular API for the controller practice, so I created one test VON network, and setup two aca agents, and use two Angular agents interact with the agents, I just make a copy of the Aries controller angular code, but when I tried to use controller B to accept the invitation generated from controller A, I only can see one active connection in controller B which doesn't have a DID, and there is no active connection in controller A.

{"msg":"hi, I am not sure on which condition the connection's status will be changed from \"response\" to \"active\", I manually executed one connection process from invitation -> request -> response, and the last state is \"response\", but from the OpenAPI document, after Faber response the connection request, when we check at Alice's agent, the connection state should be \"active\", but it didn't mention what action conducted to make this state changed from \"response\" to \"active\", anyone can help on this?

{"msg":"First, is it Alice or Faber that is still in \"response\"? I'm guessing it is Faber.  But regardless, this is because the connection protocol does not have an \"ack\" message, so Faber can't know for sure that Alice got the response.  The solution is for either side to send a trust ping message.  That acts like an ack and triggers the transition to active.  That said, you can send any message while in the \"response\" state, so you can treat it like \"active.\".  There is a risk that the second message will arrive before the \"response\" message, so you might want to delay a bit before sending the follow up message -- trust ping or other message.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-05-23T17:21:41.888Z"}

{"msg":"One more thing for tomorrow's ACA-Pug meeting.  We're also going to have a brief discussion about multi-tenant wallets in ACA-Pug and how the Aries Storage work being done can help with that.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-06-23T22:32:49.162Z"}
{"msg":"So RFC0095 explicitly places Attachments out of scope, however I had assumed that attachments would be very useful in messages to handle concepts like MMS ?  I also assumed that the attachment handling would be based on the Mime Type specified ?  In terms of handling it, from a Relay or Mediator point of view they would only see it as part of a single encrypted package and only have to deal with it in terms of possible Large size implications (i.e. they don't know there is an attachment).  From an Edge Agent point of view the best approach would be to signify an attachment exists even if they don't support rendering it ?  It does raise the case that maybe another RFC would help define richer basic messaging.","username":"jcourt","ts":"2020-06-24T01:18:04.082Z"}
{"msg":"Am I correct in assuming that ACA-py currently has no \"discovery\" capability in terms of searching the Ledger for matching Schemas or Credentials ?   I note that you can fetch these by exact Id, and the Issuer Wallet can fetch all the ones that they have created.  Is the intention that any Potential Holder must obtain an Id out of band to initiate the \"Propose Credential\" message in RFC0036 ? Thanks.","username":"jcourt","ts":"2020-06-24T01:50:34.801Z"}
{"msg":"One other question, sorry for being a pain, the \"action-menu\" concept in ACA-py,  I am trying to get my head around how that would be used ?  Is there an example anywhere that might explain its purpose ?  Thanks again.","username":"jcourt","ts":"2020-06-24T01:52:53.270Z"}
{"msg":"It's not so much ACA-Py as Indy Node that does not support that. We are talking about ways to support that in indy-vdr in the future.  For now, you can create your own or use a service like indyscan.io or https://sovrin-mainnet-browser.vonx.io/ to query the ledger.  Each of those read all the transactions, put them in a database and allow you to search them in a browser or using an API.  Once you have the transactions of interest, you should still check them on the ledger -- especially if you get them from a service you don't operate.  Having said that, there is little to be gained from anyone putting up fake info...","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-06-24T15:25:24.302Z"}
{"msg":"The idea of it is that it works like an interactive voice response (IVR) system.  Your mobile wallet app connects with a service.  The service sends you an Action Menu of the services offered.  The mobile wallet displays the list and you pick the one you want.  That goes back to the service, which kicks off the process associated with that action.  At the end of the process, repeat.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-06-24T15:27:35.903Z"}

{"msg":"Walking through the credential issuance steps with ACA-py, I can't see that it implements any ability to negotiate in the proposal -> offer credential phase of RFC0036 ? I say that because there is no ability in the POST /issue-credential/records/{cred_ex_id}/send-offer to enter anything other than the Credential Exchange Identifier.  Is this an accurate interpretation or is there something I am missing and maybe the negotiation part is done using POST /issue-credential/send-offer ?","username":"jcourt","ts":"2020-06-26T03:39:05.291Z"}

I have few doubts regarding this :\n\n*1.* As per your inputs, does that mean that all attributes mentioned under `requested_attributes` in a proof request will have to be revealed to the verifier? If yes, then what is the significance of `revealed` flag while sending the presentation ?\n*2.* If we (holder) don't want to reveal the credential attribute, then as per your inputs, it should be present under `requested_predicate`. But for that, there is also a validation to have `p_type` & `p_value` while sending the proof request. What if the attribute is in string format (like: Address) and holder does not want to disclose the exact address to the verifier, then how to handle `p_type` and `p_value` conditions ?\n*3.* Also want to understand that which entity (verifier or holder) has control to decide whether to reveal or not reveal the credential attribute from a holder's wallet? I think it should be in control of holder, but this condition is set by the verifier while sending the proof request , right ? Or am I missing something here ?\n\nWhat I want to implement is, verifier can ask for certain set of credential attributes from a holder (with/without restrictions like cred_def_id, schema_id, schema_issuer_did etc.) and holder should have control to either reveal or do not reveal these attributes to the verifier but at the same time, proof presentation should be verified successfully if it meets the restriction criteria. \n@swcurran","username":"HLFPOC","ts":"2020-07-03T12:44:15.527Z"}

However, the \"persons enrolled\" is generally not public information, so that may not be a good use case. If such a VCR is only open to authorized individuals, it might be a valid use.

Many call a framework an \"agent\", and it's stuck, but it's not accurate IMHO.\n\nIf each student has there own agent, then yes, there will be 100 instances of a framework+controller, plus one instance of a framework+controller for Faber College.

For such implementation of 100s of students, there are two choices\n\na) use Aca-py multi tenancy - which as suggested is currently work in progress. this approach will be unsecure as well as wallet key is in cloud\n\nb) use mobile based framework to have Agent (=Framework+Controller) in Mobile device itself. this approach is secure as wallet (and wallet key)  is in student's mobile. though currently only available framework to implement this approach is c# (i.e. aries-mobileagent-xamarin). all other mobile based framework (such as in react native) are work in progress","username":"discoverer","ts":"2020-07-21T02:58:50.332Z"}

{"msg":"Hey all, my team has been working on verifiable attachments and we’re interested in getting some feedback. Our use case is for an issuer to issue a credential which has a person’s photo (and some other data), the holder to be able to store that photo, and for a verifier to be able to verify that the photo was indeed issued by the issuer. More generically we want to support verifiable attribute attachments of any kind (image, file, etc). This is similar to the attachments RFC (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0017-attachments) but applied specifically to attributes. A few approaches that we thought through are: (1) base64 encoding the image and including directly in the credential, however this breaks the underlying indy crypto when the size is too large (2) using an image url, however due to privacy concerns we don’t want the images available publicly (3) a custom implementation which takes a hash of the image and puts that in the attribute field, and the image itself is stored as a wallet record. If there is another simpler approach that we haven’t thought of we are all ears. For now I’ll go into more detail into (3).\nThe way this could work is that a credential would have an attribute name with a ‘~attach’ at the end (eg face_photo~attach). When sending a credential, the issuer controller/user would base64 encode the face photo and set that as the value for face_photo~attach attribute. On the issuer’s agent, it would detect the ~attach key word in the attribute name, take the sha256 hash of the image, replace the attribute value with the hash, and then send the base64 image in the attachments section (credentials~attach). When the holder receives the credential, it would take any values in credentials~attach and save them as wallet records (ie non_secrets.add_wallet_record) where the key of the wallet record is the image hash.

{"msg":"Hey all, my team has been working on verifiable attachments and we’re interested in getting some feedback. Our use case is for an issuer to issue a credential which has a person’s photo (and some other data), the holder to be able to store that photo, and for a verifier to be able to verify that the photo was indeed issued by the issuer. More generically we want to support verifiable attribute attachments of any kind (image, file, etc). This is similar to the attachments RFC (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0017-attachments) but applied specifically to attributes. A few approaches that we thought through are: (1) base64 encoding the image and including directly in the credential, however this breaks the underlying indy crypto when the size is too large (2) using an image url, however due to privacy concerns we don’t want the images available publicly (3) a custom implementation which takes a hash of the image and puts that in the attribute field, and the image itself is stored as a wallet record. If there is another simpler approach that we haven’t thought of we are all ears. For now I’ll go into more detail into (3).\nThe way this could work is that a credential would have an attribute name with a ‘~attach’ at the end (eg face_photo~attach). When sending a credential, the issuer controller/user would base64 encode the face photo and set that as the value for face_photo~attach attribute. On the issuer’s agent, it would detect the '~attach' key word in the attribute name, take the sha256 hash of the image, replace the attribute value with the hash, and then send the base64 image in the attachments section (credentials~attach). When the holder receives the credential, it would take any values in credentials~attach and save them as wallet records (ie non_secrets.add_wallet_record) where the key of the wallet record is the image hash.

{"msg":"Usually what happens is:\n- frontend has authentication (e.g.: OIDC)\n- an API (controller) receives calls fro the frontend.

Is that the way to go?\n\nOr could it also be possible, that the agent that sends me a credential just acts as a relay and forwards it to me from the actual issuer?","username":"severus-sn4pe","ts":"2020-09-01T14:33:34.777Z"}
{"msg":"The credential contains a CredDef for the credential and the CredDef is linked to the issuer.  So if you have the CredDef, you have the DID for the issuer, and you can go from there. You might also want to connect it to the connection from which you received the credential.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-09-01T18:01:11.315Z"}
{"msg":"This is an interesting question around the whole ToIP space though.  The Credential is securely tied to the Credential Def and the Credential Def is securely tied to the Issuer DID.  The issue of trust between the Verifier and Issuer DID though is the crucial information to make the whole space worthwhile.  That trust seems to require out-of-band organisational mechanisms that I can't yet see how it has been achieved.  A credential needs to eventually identify the issuers \"Authority\" to issue and that seems to require identification of the Authority through their DID ?  Maybe some protocol over the Issuers DID Endpoint could achieve this in some way by identifying the Issuer through their CA registration, I don't know but it feels like this is a missing piece still.  What am I missing that makes this all so obvious to others :-)","username":"jcourt","ts":"2020-09-01T21:48:15.093Z"}

{"msg":"It is kind of like following a CA chain, but far more context specific (this chain for education, this chain for business registries, etc.).  The use of Verifiable Credential Reqistries in the context of a Governance Framework can provide that shortcut to a set of \"authoritative\" DIDs.  E.g. the BC Gov might have a repository (that you trust for some reason) of all the DIDs  of issuers in BC Gov departments.\n\nBut ultimately, it does come down to human trust.  That's why there is a technical and a human trust component in the ToIP stack.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-09-01T22:23:17.074Z"}

{"msg":"Hi, we are working on use cases where Aries agents of organisations are interacting. We think those organisations should have stable public identifiers and the organisations should exchange them. Quite some time ago I opened the following [issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/35) but discussions stalled. Now I'd like to revisit this issue and I'm open to contributing code. But I'm wondering:\n1. Is using the connection/didexchange protocol with a public DID a total antipattern that should not be allowed?\n2. Should we have an additional \"Proof I control this public DID\" protocol?\n3. Should every org register a credential definition for just issuing itsef 'this is me' credentials (feels strange)\nOr are there other solutions?","username":"domwoe","ts":"2020-09-17T14:23:56.243Z"}
{"msg":"1 is not an anti-pattern and will be common. Go for it!  We talked about it some on DIDComm v1 (what we are using today) and tons on DIDComm v2.\n\n2. By using the public DID in sending a DIDComm message, proof of control is provided.  I don't think anything else is needed.\n\n3. We think an organization should get a credential from the authority over creating organization -- e.g. BC Registries in BC, which is legislative authorized to issue Certificate of Incorporation documents, etc.  They should be the issuer of that. But that is may be a bigger issue\n\nBinding of the DID to the organization might be done for now using something like DNS and the \".well-known\" mechanism.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-09-17T14:57:13.188Z"}

{"msg":"Lots of things here:\n\n1. von-network is a repo that is built based on Hyperledger Indy that makes spinning up HL Indy ledgers easy and fast.  It is a GitHub repo owned by BCGov and dependent on Hyperledger Indy Code.  Anyone can use von-network to run an Indy network and they would be the governance authority over that instance of a ledger.\n\n2. Aries open source code is managed in repos in Hyperledger.  The images that BC Gov builds and publishes on hub.docker.com are created using artifacts from Hyperledger repo.  The dockerfile that is used to build the images is managed and owned (if you want to call it that) by BC Gov.  Hyperledger could do the same thing, but doesn't to this point -- the maintainers haven't seen the same need.\n\n3. This statement is way off.\n\n- Aries provides protocols that allow business applications to be created as Agents for communicating and exchanging credentials.  So the business logic is add on top of Aries.\n\n- HL Indy software can be deployed to create an instance of a ledger.  For example, Sovrin operates an instance of Indy using Stewards -- companies that operate nodes of the Sovrin network.\n\n- Data about credentials is NEVER written to the Indy network.  Indy is used to publish DIDs with public keys and ways to communicate with the DID owner, and metadata about Credentials.  The credentials themselves are issued by an issuer to a holder and a holder can use those credentials to prove claims to verifiers.  Nothing about issuing or proving is ever written to the ledger.\n\nClear as mud?\n\nIf you want to know more about how this all fits together, we put together some edX courses on this:\n\nhttps://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-hyperledger-sovereign-identity-blockchain-solutions-indy-aries-and-ursa\n\nand\n\nhttps://www.edx.org/course/becoming-a-hyperledger-aries-developer","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-10-06T23:49:06.011Z"}

{"msg":"Hi everybody! Not sure if this is the right channel for the following question. I have set up manually a 4 node indy network in a docker environment on mac os. Each node has its own container ip address and is in the same docker network. Now I would like to start an instance of ACA-PY on my docker host (mac os) and connect it to the indy node network within my docker environment. This seems to be an issue (on mac os), because of the fact, that the indy genesis file has to contain the internal docker ip addresses of the nodes in order to make the nodes able to see each other within the docker network. But from the docker host / ACA-PY perspective on my docker host (mac os) those ip addresses provided in the genesis file do not exist or at least do not route to the indy nodes within the docker network. The \"default\" way of accessing docker containers from host on mac os is via port forwarding. Since in my indy network every node uses an unique node and client port, this should be possible. So the question is: Can I provide a different genesis file to my ACA-PY on my host than is used by the indy nodes within the docker network?

What is the solution / best practice here? I saw that von-network uses ngrok for bypassing this issue, which seems a bit inconvenient to me...","username":"ArturPhilipp","ts":"2020-10-08T09:53:28.944Z"}

Those implementing wallets will have to think carefully about how to balance UX with supporting the full range of capabilities.

This is easier with \"Present-Proof\" because it only has the QR code and the single DIDComm prove message, whereas there are more messages with Issue Credential.\n\nTo be added for ACA-Py is how to initiate the process on the Admin side and how to manage the threading when there is no connection object to associate with the protocol.

{"msg":"Hi,\n\nI'm trying to use aca-py to create an issuer agent on Sovrin BuilderNet. As I learned in the course \"Becoming A Hyperledger Aries Developer\", there is a separate command for provisioning a wallet (aca-py provision). The provisioning only succeeds with the seed `000000000000000000000000Trustee1`, as that is the \"magic\" seed for the DID of the trustee. It will of course always say: \"Created new public DID V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f\". When I run the provisioning step with any other seed value, it fails obviously.\n\n1. Does this mean that to create a new public DID for my issuer, I first need to provision a wallet with the magic seed, and then use `aca-py start` and register a new public DID using `/ledger/register-nym`?\n2. With `--endpoint` being required right now, after running `aca-py provision` with `--endpoint`, it updates the endpoint for `V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f` in the ledger: https://indyscan.io/tx/SOVRIN_BUILDERNET/domain/2405 Is this desired behaviour?\n3. I have registered DIDs using the method in the linked Google Doc at https://selfserve.sovrin.org/ as well. libsovtoken seems to be unavailable when I follow the step `sudo apt-get install -y indy-cli libsovtoken`. Is this outdated? I am using Ubuntu 18.04. libindy is installed though.","username":"ldej","ts":"2020-10-22T06:14:33.072Z"}

{"msg":"Hi Wade, thanks for the response.\n\nI have been working with von-network for the past two months, and I wanted to figure out how to get it working with Sovrin BuilderNet and a postgres database. I got the postgres database working with both indy-cli and aca-py and confirmed that they use the same wallet, so that's good. I was just a little confused on what the order of operations was when just using aca-py.\n\nSo, to get it straight:\n1. (indy-cli) Configure a local wallet that is configured for the BuilderNet ledger\n2. (indy-cli) Generate a DID\n3. Register the DID and Verkey for the BuilderNet ledger via https://selfserve.sovrin.org/ (no payment address required)\n4. (indy-cli) Receive DID metadata using `ledger get-nym did=`\n5. (indy-cli) Set the DID as the public DID using `did use `\n6. (aca-py) Start aca-py using the same wallet and connecting to BuilderNet\n\nWith this it means that my local wallet has the keys for my DID and it registered in the BuilderNet ledger.\n\nNow to get to the part that is unclear, is it possible to do this without indy-cli, and just with aca-py?\n\nI have registered a DID on BuilderNet using the steps I listed.\n\nI understand my endpoint needs to be a publically accessible URL, I am about to deploy to get that.\n\nYes I am pointing aca-py to the right network using `--genesis-file ./pool_transactions_builder_genesis`","username":"ldej","ts":"2020-10-23T05:09:36.987Z"}

{"msg":"You are looking for a proof request, not a credential definition.  Proof requests are not too well documented in indy :-(.  I keep meaning to get some documentation together on it, but I don't have the time.  \n\nYou can find a number of examples in this test file: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/tests/anoncreds.rs  --- search for \"restrictions\", as that is the key component of a proof.  The basic concepts:\n\n1. You have an array of referents --  claims from credentials that you want to prove.  If a referent has multiple names (array) -- all of the names are of claims and must be from the same credential.\n2. A referent can have restrictions in any combination of: schema, issuer DID, credential definitions (issuer DID and schema), schema attribute name, or schema attribute value.  So that means you can do things like:\n- request just that it be from a schema, and it can come from any issuer\n- request just that it be from a credential definition which locks it to an issuer and a schema\n- request that it be from a specific named claim and it can be from any schema with that name from any issuer\n- AND'd combinations of all of the above, OR'd as well.\n3. Predicates can also be requested, also with restrictions.  Predicates are logical expressions with a supplied value against a claim using \">=\", \"<=\", \">\". \"<\" operators only.  In the file above, search for \"requested_predicates\" for examples.\n\nThat's the shortest description I can come up with.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-10-25T19:50:03.936Z"}
{"msg":"Thanks for that description of a proof request! I'm working on a toy demo where I'm converting the Faber/Alice example into a different thing, and was hitting an error from the *aries_cloudagent.verifier.indy* where a presentation could not be validated due to missing essential components--in this case, a missing requested predicate '0_age_GE_uuid' that I'd forgotten to remove. \n\nI'd absolutely love some additional documentation when it becomes available. At the moment, though, I've really just got one question: is there a plan for equivalence ('=' or '==') to be included in the logical expressions supported in the predicate functionality? Or is it really only intended for numerical evaluation in relative terms? I'm new to ZKPs, so I'm not even sure if that's a foolish question. :slight_smile:","username":"deas","ts":"2020-10-26T00:25:02.050Z"}

If you want to verify that the \"STATE\" is equal to \"CA\", if the value of the predicate is \"TRUE\", then you know what the value is in the credential.  So, instead of using a predicate, you just use a restriction on the value.\n\nClear as mud.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-10-26T00:33:10.473Z"}

{"msg":"Interesting catch.  I wrote that and like you I'm not finding it easy to come up with solid examples.  Here is the rational for the statement.\n\nFirst, the most obvious point is that agents don't have to talk to ledgers at all - they can be used for messaging only. For example, a mediator might never have to deal with a verifiable credential and so might never need to use the ledger for issuing, holding or verifying. Even if they do have to resolve DIDs, they could do so via a DID resolver (such as uniresolver.io) suing HTTPS.  IOT devices might fit that category as well, where their connectivity and resource constraints might limit their role to secure messaging.\n\nA more general thought is that with agents, exceptions to absolute statements can always be found and I was leaving room for that.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-11-26T16:13:34.805Z"}

{"msg":"Greetings everyone. I wanted to explore the ACAPy (have played before with Aries) and I hope this is the right place to start: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python#resources   My question also would be , if we create a wallet (a cloud one, we could call it a custodian wallet) and I would like to link it with a biometric hash from a biometric device, would be there a possibility to add more security? For an example to separate the private keys from the VCs , in case someone hacks the wallet but then could not sign the transactions , since the private keys would be on a separate location? I was thinking to link a biometric hash with the wallet via a VC that has an attribute type like #hashname ? Also maybe a possibility to name a wallet like the biometric hash, that can be lookuped easily later ?","username":"ultimo2020","ts":"2020-12-05T19:20:09.366Z"}

{"msg":"Hello everyone! Can we use ACA-Py as a message queue for mobile agents (that maintain their own edge wallets)? I am familiar with your ongoing work regarding persistent queues and the mediator protocol (saw the recent PR for that - awesome!). Basically, we are trying to figure out if we can combine the Xamarin mobile agent framework with ACA-Py for this functionality. Ideally we are wondering if we can use one instance of ACA-Py (one process) that multiple Xamarin mobile agents can use for this purpose.","username":"RazaDen","ts":"2020-12-24T09:23:26.642Z"}
{"msg":"Hi @RazaDen, with the new mediation features merged in ACA-Py you'll be able to use a single ACA-Py instance to mediate multiple mobile agents. However AFAIK Aries Framework .NET and the Xamarin mobile agent don't support the mediator coordination protocol atm. So you'll either need to implement those in the .NET framework, or you'll need a way to setup the mediation between the two agents in another way. The .NET framework currently makes use of a public `.well-known` agent configuration that is hosted on the mediator agent and downloaded by the edge agent (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/a18bef91e5b9e4a1892818df7408e2383c642dfa/src/Hyperledger.Aries.Routing.Edge/EdgeClientService.cs#L97). This contains an invitation and the required parameters to indicate messages should be routed via that agent (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/074dd0c14ee1bf50613523c55c3c2031a9046a21/src/Hyperledger.Aries.Routing/AgentPublicConfiguration.cs). If you want to go this route you'd need to modify ACA-Py to support this behaviour. However this is not the \"standard\" way to configure mediation between agents, so I think it would make more sense to update Aries Framework .NET to support the mediator coordination protocol","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2020-12-24T16:50:35.565Z"}

Basically what I am asking is whether it's better for us to use the Mediator RFC (will this be changed in the immediate future?), or the code already in ACA-Py.

{"msg":"Hi @GuilhermeFunchal, when multitenant is enabled, most operations are restricted for the base wallet. This is a design decision we made along the way, to keep a more clear hierarchical separation between base and subwallets. You can create new wallets from the admin api (and swagger) in the `multitenancy` topic. This will return a `token` that you can use in an auhtorization header to authorize for that subwallet (`Authorization: Bearer {token}`). You can set this in the swagger ui using the `Authorize` button","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2021-01-05T12:50:15.985Z"}

We're currently working on a way to set the webhook urls to be used per wallet: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/884\n2. The base wallet acts as a relay and indeed routes the messages based on the keys. We're currently working on integration with the mediator functionalities. It's interesting you bring this up, because I ran into your use case yesterday and wasn't exactly sure how to handle all cases. Currently whenever a local/public did is created for connections, or an already existing did is used for creating an invitation it will be registered to route the key. However when you manually create a did and then use that as an implicit invitation ACA-Py won't know which wallet to route the message to.

This is for the 'managed' mode. in 'unmanaged' mode the keys are not stored in the base wallet, but must be provided periodically to the agent. For now using a JWT token, but we'd like to make this pluggable eventually. So yes there is a database behind multitenancy ACAPy instances (either local sqlite or remote postgres) but this is also the case with non multitenancy. I'll try to cover everything in the documentation","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2021-01-09T19:32:37.992Z"}
{"msg":"Regarding the scalability and redundancy, this is not specific to multitenancy I think. BCGov has multitple ACA-Py instances running next to each other, all using the same wallets under the hood. This allows for horizontal scaling. All wallet data is stored encrypted in an postgres database. If one agent shuts down, other agents could resume the tasks. With multitenancy you can do the same. you could start 10 aca-py instances in parallel (e.g. using openshift) and expose a single endpoint. Openshift will divide the requests between the different aca-py instance.

In my case of ACApy this is the base wallet, with which I start an instance. I suppose in multitenancy mode of ACApy this wallet creates the schema and performs ledger operations? I was wondering when I create a sub-wallet, it does not create automatically a public DID on the Ledger-Sovrin (like I tested before with Indy wallets and did.create_and_store_my_did). Am I missing some rest calls here or the subwallets cannot get an endorser role on the Sovrin Ledger (in managed mode)?

The connection protocol will simply never finish as ACA-Py won't be able to reach the mobile agent ever. Is there something that I am missing here?

Aries Toolbox is an example (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-toolbox). It sends an empty string `\"\"` as endpoint to ACA-Py and can receive messages over either http or websockets by making use of the return route decorator (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0092-transport-return-route/README.md).

{"msg":"Hello @TimoGlastra , thank you again for your prompt response, it's very much appreciated! Well, we are looking into using the Xamarin agent, which employs the .NET sdk. What we want to do is to basically decouple the \"builtin\" mediator that it has and do everything with ACA-Py instead. We are actively looking on what modifications we have to do in the code base for this, but this is our general plan. To your point, we thought of using the standard connection protocol flow, i.e., mobile agent scans the connection invitation message (e.g., as is provided in the public indicio mediator), and then you know we do the entire flow, which obviously without a public endpoint is not possible. I've seen the transport return route decorator in the RFC and I've seen that it's implemented in ACA-Py but what I don't understand is how we can enable it. Ok, so basically an edge agent that has no public endpoint, sends a connection request message to the (soon to be) mediator ACA-Py and leaves the endpoint as an empty string \"\". Then ACA-Py will respond synchronously (in the same HTTP call context) with the connection response message or we need to query some other endpoint of ACA-Py (at whatever future time) to get the response?

{"msg":"The issuer agent would (likely) respond with a credential offer message.  On receipt of the proposal message, I think the protocol state object would be created by ACA-Py and then the controller notified by a webhook about the proposal. The controller would then decide what to do -- e.g. send an \"offer\" message to continue the issue flow.  The controller uses the business logic based on the use case, so presumably there would be some sort of checking that an issuance should happen following the proposal.   If the proposal was not \"normal\" -- the controller could choose to ignore the message, send a problem report or send a credential offer for an entirely different credential type.  It all depends...","username":"swcurran","ts":"2021-02-02T18:43:00.812Z"}

{"msg":"That is the role of the controller -- the application business logic.  ACA-Py is the framework that does the actions related to DIDComm, protocols, verifiable credentials and so on.  It has a couple of places that it \"auto-\" processes some steps -- e.g. in handling a connection, or in handling all the messages in an \"issue-credential\" process. However, other than those few cases (and some might not be used for other than testing) the expectation is that those decisions are left to the controller -- the business logic.  ACA-Py allows the controller to initiate an action, and notifies the controller when an event occurs (e.g. a message from another agent).  The expectation is that ACA-Py will just sit there until the controller tells ACA-Py what to do next.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2021-02-02T21:45:05.830Z"}

I promised a more detailed write up from my point of view. I would love some feedback on that stuff. I will move it over to github a bit later so I potentially can add it to the repo, but probably need a couple of rounds of feedback on it first.\n\nIm building the document out as I go through getting familiar with Aca-PY, and in the following doc there are some questions labled questions under some of the titles. Would love some insight and comments on those. As I have only touched upon the connection and issuance for now, I feel that it is a good place to not overwhelm the feedback session\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJzy8vIJ0bRVVSG-7Z3uC9lEay_mbIw4mSSoJbdhEmo/edit?usp=sharing","username":"vongohren","ts":"2021-02-25T20:37:59.764Z"}

{"msg":"Hello all and @swcurran , I've got a question regarding the public DID for an agent. I understand practically, I need to register an DID for an agent on the Indy ledger (even though it's a dev one) before running an agent, because the agent needs a proper seed associated with the DID to run properly. However, conceptually, a DID in the SSI world should represent an end user, so I'm confused how I should create DID for each end user. For a one-one mapping between an agent to an end user (e.g. each agent represents an individual end user, this one-one mapping follows the concepts), but Q1. if I want to turn on multi-tenancy feature in an agent to represent many end users, how can the DID of an agent represent each end user? Q2. I understand a public DID is stored in the Indy ledger, is the public DID of an end user also stored in the agent's wallet ? Q2 comes from an API available to agents named \"/wallet/did/public\".","username":"Yunxi 3","ts":"2021-03-01T10:21:04.201Z"}

Regarding GCP: if your controller lives in the same (internal) network as the agent you do not need to expose that port/route to the internet and should be able to make the two components communicate internally. If you need to expose the agent admin api so that you have more than one controller being able to call the agent you would then likely need to come up with a reverse-proxy configuration that allows you to route requests to the right endpoint based on the incoming request path - as an example (e.g.: `/public` proxies to the public port, `/admin` to the admin port)","username":"esune","ts":"2021-03-04T17:52:20.116Z"}

{"msg":"I think that using ?id instead of ?oob is not something the controller can deal with. It seems that the greatest benefit of using the OOB protocol is that the connection invitation and credential issue or proof presentation can be initiated in a single step, with the possibility to fully automate the rest of the flow, on framework level, without the need for any additional asynchronous steps and correlating connections and credentials or proofs. To achieve one step credential issue or proof presentation when there is no existing connection, the connection must be bootstrapped out-of-band, but it would be very nice if the acapy flow can continue automatically through the new connection, sending the attachments specified in create-invitation, without the need to ever send the attachments out-of-band. I am developing a Medical Pass controller, and 99% of the user interactions can be just a single scan of a QR code, both when receiving a credential and when receiving a proof request.

{"msg":"Hi all, I had a question about the \"/issue-credential/records\" endpoint which we're using to display to an issuer the credentials that they have issued. The problem we're experiences is that we have a lot of very large credentials that have been issued, so trying to fetch all records like that causes aca-py to crash. We'd like to introduce some pagination, eg by providing a limit and offset to that API call. It looks like under the hood that endpoint calls the indy-sdk function indy_fetch_wallet_search_next_records(), that takes a \"count\" argument which would solve the limit part of pagination. The offset part seems a bit trickier because even though the underlying DB supports offset (we're using postgres) the indy-sdk doesn't (from what I can see). This means we'd probably need to do something hacky like iterating through multiple indy_fetch_wallet_search_next_records() calls (explicitly garbage collecting the results each time to avoid the crash), until we reached our offset. \nIs there another way to solve our use case that we're missing? Is there a better solution to the problem than the one outlined? Thanks for any feedback :)","username":"jacobsaur","ts":"2021-03-10T11:23:12.012Z"}

In theory, it's the same problem, with the added difficulty that the VC standard is very clear about where you find the identifier for the Issuer.  It's not standard where you would find an identifier for others involved in the issuing.\n\nMy first guess would be that the credential have claims that are defined to be identifiers of the \"others\" in the process, and that the value for each be a public DID.  With that, the same techniques can be used with the Issuer to determine the authority for the \"others\" to issue a credential.\n\nAn alternative would be to have a verifiable proof that shows that authority as the value of the claim. That would still have an identifier in it for the subject.\n\nThe hard part for both approaches is standardizing the process.

(so `did:sov` will be prefixed). I didn't want to automatically prefix all indy dids with `did:sov` as that doesn't make sense for local dids + if you're not using the sovrin mainnet. Then the full prefixed `did:sov` could be used for the VC `issuer` property and allow to issue using public `sov` dids.

{"msg":"Hey channel, I’m working on the aca-py Java client library: https://github.com/boschresearch/aries-acapy-clients/tree/main/java This project slowly evolved with our demo code since aca-py 0.4, so I did not much bother about keeping it in sync with a specific aca-py version. But as things now need to be more enterprise ready, I was looking into swagger-codegen to keep the libraries models in sync with aca-py. But a quick check showed that aca-py’s swagger definitions are not really 100% in sync with reality. Most of the generated models need to be adjusted. I guess I’m not the only one facing that issue. So, my question is how to fix this best. As there are many small, and big changes necessary to fix this, simply opening an issue for each and every one does not make sense. Should I open a ticket where everyone with swagger issues can comment? Or should this be a pull request?

{"msg":"I'm currently testing our code against the 0.7-pre version of aca-py and i believe there is an issue with json-ld sign and verify. I will go through the flow to explain this:\n\nFirst sign the absolute minimum\n\n```{\n    \"doc\": {\n        \"credential\": {\n            \"@context\": [\n                \"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"\n            ],\n            \"type\": [\n                \"VerifiableCredential\"\n            ]\n        },\n        \"options\": {\n            \"verificationMethod\": \"did:sov:123#key-1\",\n        }\n    },\n    \"verkey\": \"myKey\"\n}```\n\nPreviously the options had a type, this one has been removed, which makes kind of sense as Ed25519Signature2018 is the only available method anyway. The signed document that is returned looks like:\n```\n{\n    \"signed_doc\": {\n        \"@context\": [\n            \"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"\n        ],\n        \"type\": [\n            \"VerifiableCredential\"\n        ],\n        \"proof\": {\n            \"verificationMethod\": \"did:sov:123#key-1\",\n            \"created\": \"2021-05-05T13:54:07Z\",\n            \"jws\": \"...\"\n        }\n    }\n}```\n\nIf i now unwrap the signed doc and put it into the verify method I will get the following error: \n\nerror\": \"in proof, {'verificationMethod', 'created', 'jws'} attributes dropped. Provide definitions in context to correct.\"\n\nThis makes kind of sense as there is now context validation in place and the proof is missing the type to be valid json-ld , so if I add a type to the request\n\n\n```{\n    \"doc\": {\n        \"@context\": [\n            \"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"\n        ],\n        \"type\": [\n            \"VerifiableCredential\"\n        ],\n        \"proof\": {\n            \"verificationMethod\": \"did:sov:123#key-1\",\n            \"type\": \"Ed25519Signature2018\",\n            \"jws\": \"...\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"verkey\": \"myKey\"\n}```\n\nThe request is successful, but unfortunately this is not the document that was signed any more so the validation fails.","username":"etschelp","ts":"2021-05-05T14:19:10.082Z"}

It was initially designed so we could interact with ACA-Py from juypter notebooks. Obviously only useful if you are using python.\n\nCode now lives here - https://github.com/didx-xyz/aries-cloudcontroller-python\n\nAlthough best place to learn how to use it is probably here - https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDentity","username":"wip-abramson","ts":"2021-05-21T11:03:05.639Z"}

Once set up all people need to do is write business logic in a juputer notebook interface.\n\nBecause we only have 15 minutes, plus it's in the EU morning, I created a configuration walkthrough video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swiA2op3PiQ \n\nAnyone who wants to run an ACA-Py agent and use it throughout the HGF to interact with others (including any external agents people are demoing) should be able to do so by following the instructions in the video. We are kind of modelling this as a mini hackathon see what people come up with, so if anyone wants to get involved feel welcome.

Detail regarding changes we have done is found in this thread. It bit strange that the API structure is not the same for VON and Sovrin networks.\n\nDo we need to change the code to make it work?

ACA-Py then waits for the controller to respond.\n\nIn \"--auto...\" mode, the framework skips asking the Controller what to do and just sends a response based on the credentials that could work.

So, from the architectural side I see three main challenges ahead: 1. Interoperability 2.  Support for upcoming protocol/transport changes 3. Modularity (enterprise readiness). To come back to your original questions. It’s always better to do one thing and do it well, as this reduces complexity and hence test effort. Breaking the stack down into libraries that wrap transport, aries-protocols, storage helps a lot to tackle the mentioned challenges. Where I’m not sure is the relation between aca-py and aries-vcx.

{"msg":"Dear Hyperledger Aries community,\nWe are trying to verify a connectionless proof which state has been set to “presentation_received”. We are using the release 0.7.0 of aca-py (also tried with 0.6.0) to spin up an agent, accompanied by the tails server for revocation functionality.\n\nWe use the following startup params:\n`--endpoint http://<IP_ADDRESS>:8020\n--label Hyper42MandateService\n--auto-ping-connection\n--auto-respond-messages\n--auto-accept-invites\n--inbound-transport http 0.0.0.0 8020\n--outbound-transport http\n--admin aries-cloudagent-runner 8021\n--admin-insecure-mode\n--auto-provision\n--wallet-type indy\n--wallet-name <somenamehere>\n--wallet-key <somekeyhere>\n--seed <someseedhere>\n--preserve-exchange-records\n--genesis-url http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/genesis\n--webhook-url http://mandate-webhook-service:8022/webhooks\n--tails-server-base-url http://docker_tails-server_1:6543\n--trace-target log\n--trace-tag acapy.events\n--trace-label localAriesCloudAgent.trace`\n\nHowever, we are receiving a 400: Record ID not provided when we try to verify a connectionless proof request (when calling POST /present-proof/records/{pres_ex_id}/verify-presentation).\nLogging which we found in the agent has been added as an attachment (agentlogging.txt).\nWe looked through Aries agent code on how it handles presentation verification (present-proof v1.0, file routes.py, method presentation_exchange_verify_presentation) and it seems that it tries to fetch Presentation Exchange by given pres_ex_id, which should be fine, and it doesn't actually fail right there. But on line 820 it wants a connection ID, and then it tries to fetch a connection record, and it fails, which seems to result in a Bad Request error. Present-proof v2.0 seems not to differ too much in this regard, but we have not tested that yet.\n\nSo our question: is this the expected behaviour? Are connectionless proof requests not able to be verified at this time or ever, or could it be something else?\nThanks in advance for the reply.","username":"KevinKerkhoven","ts":"2021-08-17T11:44:11.892Z"}

My agent times out waiting for the HTTP response.\nI assume this \"long poll\" is done to make more efficient use of connections, but I would expect that to only be done for the \"no-op\" message type.

{"msg":"Ok so that's something I mis-understood.  Thanks for the info.  That leads to the question though on size ?   I thought when I specified the `revocation_registry_size` at credential definition time, that was the ABSOLUTE limit on the number of credentials that could be issued for that definition.  Your explanation seems to suggest that is not the case ?  Is the registry updated with multiple tails files for a single credential definition so that the actual number of credentials is unlimited ?

{"msg":"Ok, a little bit of playing with my ACA-py UI and the answer was obvious :-) I had assumed that the credential definition bound the REVOC_REG_DEF in a 1:1 relationship. That is incorrect, the REVOC_REG_DEF is bound to the credential definition but each Issued credential from a given credential definition can be bound to a a different REVOC_REF_DEF.  So the revocation_registry_size controls how large the tails file is that each prover has to download.  It does NOT limit how many total credentials can be created for a single credential definition.  The counter point is the smaller the tails file, the more updates that must be done to the ledger to add new REVOC_REG_DEF entries ....... well that's MUCH more scalable than I was thinking whew !\nAlso ACA-py stays one tails file and REVOC_REG_DEF entry ahead of currently issued credentials.","username":"jcourt","ts":"2021-09-20T03:34:37.258Z"}

{"msg":"Hi everyone. First of all, great job working on ACA-Py! Keep up with it :-) One question: we see that it is possible to issue W3C VC (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0593-json-ld-cred-attach/README.md) via ACA-Py and the VC is retrieved via /credentials/w3c endpoint. However, can one use this VC during the Present Proof Protocol 2.0? We don't see this among the supported attachment formats (indy, dif) for this protocol. We are aware of https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ntLZGMah8iJ_TWQdbrNNW9OVwPbIWkkCMiid7Be1PrA/edit#, but currently it is not clear to us whether this is possible or it's part of ACA-Py roadmap.

You could take a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/UsingOpenAPI.md for some details on that.\n\nIf the question is more on the later (i.e. the open-api/openapi.json) output file.

I would not be using that for further wrapper code generation as it isn't maintained tightly enough atm.  \n\nIf you want something that is likely to be kept up to date and provides infrastructure for code generation you could start here https://github.com/sudoplatform-labs/sudo-di-cloud-agent-js.  \n\nCurrently IMHO ACA-py isn't claiming to provide tools for wrapper code generation, if that were to change then I would be happy to see how we might help but we would need to understand what the goals/scope was such as languages, testing (a big effort given all the interfaces) etc.","username":"jcourt","ts":"2021-10-17T23:22:57.856Z"}

Nevertheless, this is a valid approach, but still I’m asking myself if this is not better addressed on the diddoc level in the long run (or addressed as well). As a diddoc can have multiple services each sub controller could have an own entry here. Like this both (controller and did) could be bound together on a cryptographic level, and you will lose this with the proxy approach. So, my thinking goes a bit into the multi controller diddoc direction. \n\nAlso, you probably need to exclude all use cases where a client wallet initiates a request as you do not know where to route it, except for maybe credential requests where you could do a routing by credential definition id, which would require an internal registry/mapping.","username":"etschelp","ts":"2021-11-03T12:53:22.441Z"}

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-cloudagent-python?msg=wCRCV8yXSrUt0v9Cn) I think what is currently missing in ACA-Py is a generic did registrar interface. There is a did resolver that allows for any did method that has a resolver class in ACA-Py to resolve the DID. Only thing that needs changing when a new did method needs to be supported is implementing the resolver interface for that specific method (this is trivial for e.g. did:web). A universal registrar is a bit more complex, as you actually need to work with private keys and decide which keys should be in a diddoc and where they should be located. Currently the `Wallet` class in ACA-Py concerns with both DIDs and keys, the approach I'd take here (and what we're heading towards for AFJ) is that the `Wallet` shouldn't concern about DIDs anymore and only about the cryptographic keys used in did docs. Basically ACA-Py is missing an abstraction for did registration and each key has a 1-1 relationship with a did currently which makes it quite hard to support new did methods. We can learn from this spec to see what it takes to build a generic did registration interface: https://identity.foundation/did-registration/\n\n@swcurran I think it would be good to spend some time during one of the ACA-Pug calls on this topic","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2021-11-15T09:43:31.549Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-cloudagent-python?msg=wCRCV8yXSrUt0v9Cn","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-cloudagent-python?msg=wCRCV8yXSrUt0v9Cn","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

{"msg":"Hi there, I'm currently still struggling a bit with out-of-band invitations. If I understand it correctly: If I want to use the `use_existing_connection` flag in the invitee, I will need to use the public_did in the inviter. When using `public_did=true` in the inviter, the inviter will create a connection with `invitation_key == public_did.verkey`. When providing multiple of those invitations, the inviter will have multiple connections with this `invitation_key` in its database. When the inviter receives a request from one of the invitees, it will try to find the corresponding connection (or invitation), but find multiple connections and fail with a `StorageDuplicateError`. Is it currently possible to provide multiple invitations with oob using the public_did? If not, is this something which should be possible in the future?","username":"ffendt","ts":"2021-11-25T12:37:28.679Z"}

{"msg":"The big issue you will face AFAIK is that Trinisic is not yet supporting the 2.0 APIs for credential exchange.  @tomislav might be able to give you more info on that.\n\nIf you are continuing to use just AnonCreds, then the change should be pretty light.  I think what you want to do is add support in your controller for both and then use a feature flag or some logic to determine which you will initiate a new exchange. \n\nIf you are going to the W3C VC format, there is a lot more to do.  ACA-Py has support for W3C VCs, but we have really only used them in test environments.  Once we had them implemented, we began to see challenges in trying to use them in a broader context and basically decided to stick to AnonCreds.  There were just too many unknowns and the loss of capabilities vs. AnonCreds was too much.  At this point, our efforts are focused on AnonCreds.  I'm not aware of any mobile apps that use W3C format VCs.\n\nBack to anoncreds - a good place to look at code changes is to look at the Alice/Faber code which supports both models.
