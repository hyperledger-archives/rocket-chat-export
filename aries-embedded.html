Here are some resources people have been using/following:
- [Collaboration: Raspberry Pi Indy Agent](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Collaboration%3A+Raspberry+Pi+Indy+Agent)
- Zeng Zixuan's related code can be found here; [Raspberry Pi Indy Agent Internship](https://github.com/zzx02/Raspberry-Pi-Indy-Agent)

People have been having trouble standing up agents on bare metal.  For example; https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/88

Needless to say getting this all running on a bare metal embedded system can be a challenge.  For the Raspberry Pi (at least) I've been working with a fellow on a containerized solution.  I'm hoping to drag him over here to share the experiences and progress.  That way others can benefit and collaborate.

Here is what I tried so far:
- The tutorial of the Zeng is kind of outdated so I didn't bother following it step by step all the way thorugh (there are new versions of libsodium, indy-sdk, indysdk-python and rust) <-- using the old indy versions require a downgrade of rust....
- I went with the BC guys and build the aries-cloud-agent docker image for armv7 (but an old version as it wasn't very clear to me how to build the lastest version) - https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/eorituz/aries-cloudagent
---> Building worked fine, however running my docker-compose setup that works on AMD64 gave me a segmentation fault... 
---> By running the container manually I got the same error as mentioned by zzx02 and arner here https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/88
I wasn't able to figure out what causes the crash so I compiled and installed all the requirements on the pi directly which led to the same error.

@haniavis, have you been able to get further with your containerized environment.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:27:35 GMT):<br/>
@eorituz, yes, and unfortunately the solution was never really documented for that issue.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:27:54 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead ?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:27:59 GMT):<br/>
I think that error suggests a mismatch between the indy-sdk version and aca-py
</p>
<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:29:36 GMT):<br/>
My `python3-indy` version matched the indy-sdk release. Can it be that there should be an offset in versions?

How is the arm image being built?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:30:55 GMT):<br/>
For the container images, there are 2 levels:
- [PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-image](https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-image), which builds all of the indy dependancies.
- [bcgov/aries-cloudagent-container](https://github.com/bcgov/aries-cloudagent-container), which adds aca-py.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:31:34 GMT):<br/>
The first will give you a guide on the versions of all of the dependancies.

<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:33:20 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately happens with manual installation as well.
I built the bcgov von image on the pi: https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-image
And afterwards the matching bcgov aries: https://github.com/bcgov/aries-cloudagent-container

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:34:27 GMT):<br/>
There's a make_image script which sets variables to specify the dependency versions
</p>
<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:35:40 GMT):<br/>
yep, I posted a brief how-to on my dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/eorituz/von-image
Not sure if that satisfies you... I didn't intend to show it to anyone else :D

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:38:15 GMT):<br/>
That helps, thanks. So looks like you were basing it on 1.14.1 which should be right I think
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:38:23 GMT):<br/>
What's the aca-py version?
</p>
<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:39:07 GMT):<br/>
`py36-1.14-0_0.4.2`
</p>
<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:40:34 GMT):<br/>
Mhhh I think you're on to somehting there my conatiner names state that I build on `py36-1.14-0` not sure if that's the issue
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:40:37 GMT):<br/>
I'd try updating the aca-py dependency to 0.5.1
</p>
<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:44:16 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thanks. That's my next step. (However, I ran in the same issue when installing & compiling everything for `aca-py==0.5.1` on the pi directly)
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:46:12 GMT):<br/>
The von-image build creates the python3-indy python package from the same repository as the indy-sdk build, so it's important not to install the one from pypi as well
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 16:01:04 GMT):<br/>
@eorituz, @haniavis, I'd recommend working on forks of [PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-image](https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-image), and [bcgov/aries-cloudagent-container](https://github.com/bcgov/aries-cloudagent-container) so you can contribute the results back to these repos for the benefit of all.  Then we can look at publishing the ARM images with the rest of the images.
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 16:09:44 GMT):<br/>
Until now I have managed to build the aries-cloudagent image for the aca-py 0.3.5 (py36-1.11-1_0.3.5). I already had a controller for this version, so I needed to use v0.3.5. Unfortunately my code was based on the demo examples and I didn't manage to use the py36-1.11-1_0.3.5 image with my demo-based code, so I am now trying to port to a "proper" controller code like [this one](https://github.com/bcgov/aries-vcr-issuer-controller) (sent by @WadeBarnes ). Also I am not sure if the py36-1.11-1_0.3.5 image I have satisfies all the dependencies, since I commented out some of them that I believe I don't need e.g. the indy-cli in the von-image. Here is how I did it:

</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 16:14:30 GMT):<br/>
I also commented out the indy-cli, I don't need it since I am running the ledger on another machine. And the postgres_storage, for which I am not sure if I need it.
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 16:15:48 GMT):<br/>

So I looked at it again and realized that the error was an "out of memory error" during the make_image.py of the von-image. This wasn't fixed even when I increased my swap memory, but it was fixed when I disabled the experimental features of my docker. Now the indy sdk and the indy-cli are built successfully and I get the error that @eorituz describes in his dockerhub.

@haniavis The postgres issue can also be "fixed" with replacing the trouble making `i8` types with `libc::c_char` (however I have no clue about rust and only figured out by googleing that there are some flaws with `i8` and some arm architectures... The build accepts this fix but I don't know if it breaks something later on)

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 12:46:08 GMT):<br/>
That's easy to change.  When you update the endpoint on the agent side it will detect the change and write the new endpoint to the ledger.

The fact that the message is logged at `INFO` level makes me wonder if that's even an issue.  There are many messages from indy (even ones logged at `ERROR` level) that can be ignored.

</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:32:15 GMT):<br/>
I suspect the error is something to do with the FFI and/or python wrapper for FFI. It passes in the timestamp as a c_int64
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:32:52 GMT):<br/>
c_timestamp = c_int64(timestamp) if timestamp is not None else c_int(-1)  <-- but why revert to c_int for the default value
</p>
<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:33:40 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for pointing it out. The issue we're facing atm happens before we run into trouble with seeds and 
not registered/ publicly available endpoints.

</p>
<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:36:56 GMT):<br/>
So yes, I will need to specify a seed an register it (I also tried to run my container with doing all of that, but ran into the same issue)
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:36:59 GMT):<br/>
It does the same in build_txn_author_agreement_request a couple times
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:38:16 GMT):<br/>
So the registrations above are not from you agent?

Nope at least it's not from the RPi I guess it is from the run I made on my local machine to test my docker-compose setup
</p>
<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:40:51 GMT):<br/>
Good point @andrew.whitehead Do you have a direct channel to the indy devs? Or should you or me open an Issue?
I'm fine with doing it but since you found it the honor is yours :D
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:41:40 GMT):<br/>
For this I'd probably just open a PR :)
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:41:55 GMT):<br/>
Maybe you can test out the change though
</p>
<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:42:54 GMT):<br/>
I will. So your best guess is that `c_int64` should be the right?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:44:09 GMT):<br/>
Yep. I would try this to avoid the issue: c_int64(-1 if timestamp is None else timestamp)
</p>
<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:54:51 GMT):<br/>
Ok, building it atm. I'll let you guys know on monday. (I'm in CEST --> I'll call it a day now)

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Sun, 28 Jun 2020 02:33:50 GMT):<br/>
Why are you building such an old version? In any case, I think that requires a very specific version of ed25519_dalek, like alpha 2 instead of alpha 3
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Sun, 28 Jun 2020 02:36:30 GMT):<br/>
because I have controllers which are based on this version of the agent

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Sun, 28 Jun 2020 14:57:20 GMT):<br/>
@haniavis, Would it be easier to upgrade the controllers to the latest version of `aca-py`?
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 05:16:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I will try to port the controllers code to the latest version of aca-py. @eorituz did you face any other issue when building the von-image except from the const i8 in postgres_storage?
</p>
<p><strong>eorituz</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 09:47:32 GMT):<br/>
@haniavis Yes there is the issue with the buggy python wrapper (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/2210) just manually add that pr to your indy fork (justl ike the i8 thing)

The aries container could use some optimization as I just blindly added a random USER and installed the missing dependencies (I didn't spend much time thinking about why that doesn't work out of the box on the pi).
Also i used a RPi4 with 2GB ram and the von-images took 1h, aries 10minutes.
Just that you know: on a pi zero it will take ages :D
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 16:03:22 GMT):<br/>
I know, I use a RPi3B+, the von-image takes 1 and a half hour to build so I have to spend a lot of time to fix any issues. I probably have to buy the model 4. Thanks for the info!
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 16:28:52 GMT):<br/>
It sounds easier to just install the dependencies without using docker

Hi all, has anyone here considered implementing the bare minimum for DID and DIDComm on an ESP8266 or ESP32 device? It would be interesting to see how much we can squeeze out of those, as a prototype for IoT

I am able to build libindy.so file and run the ACA-Py agents on the Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian 32-bit OS. Use the following link to build libindyl library https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Collaboration%3A+Raspberry+Pi+Indy+Agent.
</p>
<p><strong>ManojTaleka</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 04:51:40 GMT):<br/>
Then add the path of libindy library to ~/.bashrc file. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH= $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:path to your lib file

Following changes need to be incorporated in Agent.py file of Raspberry Pi 3 if you are exchanging the credentials and messages between desktop and Pi agent```
import socket```
ip_address = ' '```
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_DGRAM)```
s.connect("8.8.8.8",80)```
ip_address = s.getsockname()[0]```
s.close()```
change self.admin_url = f "http://{ip_address}:{admin_port}"```
self.endpoint= f "http://{ip_address}:{http_port}"
``` 
``` 
``` 
``` 
``` 
``` 
```
