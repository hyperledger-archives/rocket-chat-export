Hi All, I have one problem when I tried to response one credential request via await _credentialService.CreateCredentialAsync(context, model.CredentialID);, there is one error returned:
```Hyperledger.Aries.AriesFrameworkException: legalName mime type of  not supported
   at Hyperledger.Aries.Utils.CredentialUtils.FormatCredentialValues(IEnumerable`1 credentialAttributes)
```

Then I found the reason, when I initially create the credential offer use below code:
```
var values = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<CredentialPreviewAttribute>>(model.CredentialAttributes);
values.Add(new CredentialPreviewAttribute("issuer", issuer.Owner.Name));
```

The values passed from the form, their MimeType is null, but the issuer's MimeType is CredentialMimeTypes.ApplicationJsonMimeType, I am not sure where this default MimeType is assigned, but when I set the form values MimeType to CredentialMimeTypes.ApplicationJsonMimeType, this issue was resolved. So whether this is something we can change in the sample code?

But below error happened:

```
Hyperledger.Indy.InvalidStructureException: A value being processed is not valid.
   at Hyperledger.Aries.Features.IssueCredential.DefaultCredentialService.IssueCredentialSafeAsync(IAgentContext agentContext, DefinitionRecord definitionRecord, CredentialRecord credentialRecord)
```

I am not sure whether I am using the correct process for the credential request. Kindly advise. Thanks.

Similar to @lijiachuan query. When a value is not valid, how do you know which value? Is there verbose logging in Indy?

Hi @lijiachuan, sorry for late response. 
https://github.com/Yoroitchi/AriesWebApp -> This is a fork of aries-dotnet, a complete Web Agent with 3 branches for different roles (Issuer, Holder, Verifier)

Credential Controller for Issuer: https://github.com/Yoroitchi/AriesWebApp/blob/Issuer7000/AriesWebApp/Controllers/CredentialsController.cs

Credential Controller for Holder:
https://github.com/Yoroitchi/AriesWebApp/blob/Holder5000/AriesWebApp/Controllers/CredentialsController.cs

Explore this repo and hope it helps :)

Hi @davidd and @tomislav , I followed that sample code, but still encounter that error, below are details of my information, could you please take a look and suggest your ideas? Thanks a lot.

The credential issuer retrieved:
```
{
    "schemaId":"MhMyTTDoxJptn2YtHF1s7j:2:CorporationSchema:1.0",
    "createdAt":"2020-06-15T14:54:23.3610216",
    "state":1,
    "credentialAttributesValues":[
        {
            "name":"legalName",
            "mimeType":"application/json",
            "value":"MyCorp"
        },
        {
            "name":"POCEmail",
            "mimeType":"application/json",
            "value":"test@aa.bb"
        },
        {
            "name":"issuer",
            "mimeType":"application/json",
            "value":"CorpReg"
        }],
    "credentialID":"eb53b4d5-99a4-499f-93f9-e240a33cc6a4",
    "issuedByMe":true
}
```

I used below function to response a request raised from the holder
```
[HttpPost("ResponseCredential")]
public async Task<IActionResult> ResponseCredential(CredentialModel model)
{
    var context = await _agentContextProvider.GetContextAsync();
    var offer = await _credentialService.GetAsync(context, model.CredentialID);
    var connection = await _connectionService.GetAsync(context, offer.ConnectionId);
    var (request, _) = await _credentialService.CreateCredentialAsync(agentContext: context, credentialId: model.CredentialID);

    await _messageService.SendAsync(context.Wallet, request, connection);

    return Ok();
}
```

But when execute `var (request, _) = await _credentialService.CreateCredentialAsync(agentContext: context, credentialId: model.CredentialID);`, below 500 error returned:

```

and @tomislav is the one u should ask, he wrote this.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:39:33 GMT):<br/>
You don't need to populate the `mime-type` field. I'm not sure what the support for this is.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:39:56 GMT):<br/>
Are you on the correct ledger for both agents?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:40:17 GMT):<br/>
Look through https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/3b500302c989b69790f0dc63ce15633017008126/src/Hyperledger.Aries.TestHarness/AgentScenarios.cs#L102 and see how these tests differ from what you're doing
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:40:25 GMT):<br/>
All in all, what you're doing seems to be on the right track

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:41:13 GMT):<br/>
Are you talking about Credential Proposal? No, it would be great to add this feature
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:43:15 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately, libindy errors `Hyperledger.Indy.InvalidStructureException: A value being processed is not valid.` don't communicate what was wrong exactly. There's no way for us to know, other then to turn on Indy logging or doing some guess work.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:43:34 GMT):<br/>
Can you debug all the way through the call that fails?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:43:57 GMT):<br/>
Are you passing all credential values present in the the schema? If any are missing, it will be problem
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:52:43 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav trying to issue credentials from web agent to osma, and I'm receiving the issued-credential encoding data in VS Code, but unable to show that in osma. any thing missing ?
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:58:15 GMT):<br/>
Below is the schema object I used:
```
{
  "attr_names": [
    "legalName",
    "POCEmail"
  ],
  "name": "CorporationSchema",
  "version": "1.0",
  "id": "MhMyTTDoxJptn2YtHF1s7j:2:CorporationSchema:1.0",
  "ver": "1.0",
  "seqNo": 8
}
```

Regarding credential values, the attributes in the offer are:
```
{
            "name":"legalName",
            "mimeType":"application/json",
            "value":"MyCorp"
        },
        {
            "name":"POCEmail",
            "mimeType":"application/json",
            "value":"test@aa.bb"
        },
        {
            "name":"issuer",
            "mimeType":"application/json",
            "value":"CorpReg"
        }
```

And these properties should be retrieved by `await _credentialService.CreateCredentialAsync(agentContext: context, credentialId: model.CredentialID)` where I just need to passed in the credentialID parameter. The only difference I can notice is the issuer which is not in the schema's definition.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:59:17 GMT):<br/>
Why is `issuer` part of the submitted values? It's not part of the schema
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:00:00 GMT):<br/>
This was referred from the sample dot net core code in the aries framework
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:00:32 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:00:45 GMT):<br/>
the submitted values, must match the schema

</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:02:39 GMT):<br/>
whether we should remove this issuer value from the sample code? Am not sure why we added that previously, any special purpose.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:08:48 GMT):<br/>
That works if I removed the issuer property, so just would like to know is there any special reason to have that in the sample code.

Hi All, when we try to request a proof, whether we should specify which credential definition should be used for the proof? In the sample code, seems it only specified what are the proof fields but not specified which credential definition should be used. Whether this is required? Kindly advise.

```
public async Task<RequestPresentationMessage> CreateProofNameMessage(ConnectionRecord connectionRecord)
{
    var agentContext = await _agentProvider.GetContextAsync();
    var name = connectionRecord.Alias?.Name ?? connectionRecord.Id;
    var proofRequest = new ProofRequest
    {
        Name = "ProofReq",
        Version = "1.0",
        Nonce = await AnonCreds.GenerateNonceAsync(),
        RequestedAttributes = new Dictionary<string, ProofAttributeInfo>
        {
            {"firstname-required", new ProofAttributeInfo {Name = "firstname"}}
        }
    };

    (var msg, _) = await _proofService.CreateRequestAsync(agentContext, proofRequest);

    return msg;
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 03:44:14 GMT):<br/>
Hi All, when we request a proof, except the credential fields, whether we should also specify which credential definition should be used? In the sample code, it only specified the proof attributes name.

<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 10:08:02 GMT):<br/>

I am working on building mobile based agent using aries .net framework and want to understand the approach to enable backup and recovery of the mobile wallet.
1. Is there any standard process/apis available for taking the wallet backup?
2. As mediator agent also stores the copy of the wallet, is it possible to export it from Mediator agent into mobile agent in case of recovery?
3. Any open-source implementation available which demonstrate backup/recovery feature ?

hi, I followed the sample code to send one proof request with below method:
```
[HttpPost]
        public async Task<IActionResult> SendProofNameRequest(string connectionId)
        {
            var agentContext = await _agentProvider.GetContextAsync();
            var connectionRecord = await _walletRecordService.GetAsync<ConnectionRecord>(agentContext.Wallet, connectionId);
            var proofNameRequest = await CreateProofNameMessage(connectionRecord);
            await _messageService.SendAsync(agentContext.Wallet, proofNameRequest, connectionRecord);

            return RedirectToAction("Index");
        }

        public async Task<RequestPresentationMessage> CreateProofNameMessage(ConnectionRecord connectionRecord)
        {
            var agentContext = await _agentProvider.GetContextAsync();
            var name = connectionRecord.Alias?.Name ?? connectionRecord.Id;
            var proofRequest = new ProofRequest
            {
                Name = "ProofReq",
                Version = "1.0",
                Nonce = await AnonCreds.GenerateNonceAsync(),
                RequestedAttributes = new Dictionary<string, ProofAttributeInfo>
                    {
                        {"firstname-required", new ProofAttributeInfo {Name = "firstname"}}
                    }
            };

            (var msg, _) = await _proofService.CreateRequestAsync(agentContext, proofRequest);

            return msg;
        }
```

But there is one question that, the name defined via `var name = connectionRecord.Alias?.Name ?? connectionRecord.Id;` is not used by any code, and after this request was submitted, the retrieved proof information's connectionID is null, also there is not one indicator/property which can let me know whether this proof is requested from my side or not. Can anyone provide some suggestions about this? Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:50:47 GMT):<br/>
There are multiple overloads of `CreateRequestAsync`, one is used for connectionless proofs, the other is for sending to connections.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:51:51 GMT):<br/>
ok, so for the type of connectionless proof request, how to know whether this is from my side or not?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:52:34 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean?
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:53:39 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to based on one indicator to know whether one party is the requester or the prover, but in current returned proof information, there is no such indicator property, so I am not sure how to determine whether I am the requestor or the prover.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:54:14 GMT):<br/>
If you create the request, you are the requestor.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:54:49 GMT):<br/>
Connectionless proof can be encoded into a URL and shared with the holder
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:55:13 GMT):<br/>
but imagine from the prover side, there is also one proof request record, but from the proof information, there is not a property to determine whether this is requested from the prover side or not
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:55:35 GMT):<br/>
You can set a tag and track that
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:58:08 GMT):<br/>
ok, whether this is not one must have property for a proof request?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:59:58 GMT):<br/>
you set the tag on the proofRecord, which is your own local record to track the state
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:00:02 GMT):<br/>
In ACA-Py, there is one `initiator` property which value could be either `self` or `external`, so it's easy to know whether this request is from which side.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:00:51 GMT):<br/>
if this property can be one embeded property which doesn't need user specify manually, I think that would be good, not sure whether you are agree.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:00:53 GMT):<br/>
```
(var msg, record) = await _proofService.CreateRequestAsync(agentContext, proofRequest);
record.SetTag("Initiator", "Self"):
```
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:01:27 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, we need to let each developer set it manually
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:01:55 GMT):<br/>
Sure, this can be added in the framework
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:01:57 GMT):<br/>
but the problem is this value would be the same for both sides
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:02:13 GMT):<br/>
No, it won't. The record doesn't travel around
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:02:20 GMT):<br/>
the message does
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:02:41 GMT):<br/>
ok, let me have a try
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:03:05 GMT):<br/>
You must save the record after you add a tag, btw. `recordService.UpdateAsync`
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:06:02 GMT):<br/>
btw, in the sample code, I saw there is one input box to let user type the connection id, but it is using a connectionless proof request, shall we change this to a connection proof request?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:06:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes. It shouldn't misguide the user
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:07:04 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:23:35 GMT):<br/>
There is another disadvantage to use manual added tag for this purpose, which is after I use `_proofService.ListAsync(agentContext)` retrieved all proofs, then I need to loop this proofs, and get this tag and format a new objects array to the controller UI.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:42:39 GMT):<br/>
Isn't there an overload to use SearchQuery?
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:44:27 GMT):<br/>
I would like to retrieve all proof requests related to me, I am not sure whether the SearchQuery can help, as I don't want to add any filter by default.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:50:00 GMT):<br/>
that's what the search query is for
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:50:50 GMT):<br/>
SearchQuery.Equal("Intiator", "Self")
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:51:36 GMT):<br/>
I mean I don't want to query all my initiated proof requests, but would like to get all the proof requests related to me, no matter whether I am the initiator or not.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:52:06 GMT):<br/>
what is "related to me"?
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:52:11 GMT):<br/>
But this would be the workaround before we have the initiator indicator property
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:52:29 GMT):<br/>
I requested, or someone requested to me.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:52:59 GMT):<br/>
so it's not built in, but it's easy to add it in your application
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:54:30 GMT):<br/>
You mean separate the UI to two pages, one is showing all my initiated proof requests, the other one is showing all the proof requests which I received from others, right?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:01:55 GMT):<br/>
Whatever you choose, yes.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:02:09 GMT):<br/>
I'm saying you have the ability to track and filter them
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:03:16 GMT):<br/>
ok, got it. So do you think this initiator property would be one enhancement?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:03:48 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, it seems to be an easy and useful addition
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:04:14 GMT):<br/>
great to know this. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:22:55 GMT):<br/>
hi, may I know why do we defined two credential structures, one is `CredentialInfo`, the other one is `CredentialRecord`. I raise this question is due to I am trying to response one proof request, initially I plan to use `_credentialService.ListAsync(agentContext)`  to retrieve all my credentials, it would be `CredentialRecord` type, so I can choose one credential for the proof request, but when I checked the sample code, it is using `await _proofService.ListCredentialsForProofRequestAsync(agentContext, request, requestedAttribute.Key)` to retrieve all credentials and use the first one for the request response. And this function returned `CredentialInfo` type. So this might be one question about the design of the credential data structure. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 17:23:52 GMT):<br/>
`CredentialInfo` is a data model that indy uses internally. A consumer can iterrate over them and retrieve the corresponding `CredentialRecord` to display on UI.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 17:24:26 GMT):<br/>
We could do that in the framework, that's a good point
</p>
<p><strong>syngin</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:56:57 GMT):<br/>
For connectionless proof request, how does the holder return the proof response to the verifier? Does the controller need to store the routing keys, recipient keys and endpoint somewhere? Or is it handled within Aries?
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 12:25:22 GMT):<br/>
hi @tomislav , do you mean there could be one change in the framework that will return the same type of credentials in these two methods `_credentialService.ListAsync` and `ListCredentialsForProofRequestAsync`?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 12:37:48 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 13:22:37 GMT):<br/>
Hi, there is a new question about using connection less proof or not, actually there are different structure requestJson generated, below is one sample requestJson generated by connection less proof request via
`(var proofNameRequest, _) = await _proofService.CreateRequestAsync(agentContext, proofRequest);`
```
{
    "name":"06170905",
    "version":"1.0",
    "nonce":"580318057034241599988458",
    "requested_attributes":{
        "legalName":{
            "name":"legalName",
            "restrictions":[
                {
                    "cred_def_id":"MhMyTTDoxJptn2YtHF1s7j:3:CL:8:CorporationCredential"
                }]
        }
    },
    "requested_predicates":{
    }
}
```
And below is one generated proof request from one connection required proof request via
`(var proofNameRequest, var proofRecord) = await _proofService.CreateRequestAsync(agentContext, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(proofRequest), proofRequestModel.connectionID);`
```
{
    "name":"06170914",
    "version":"1.0",
    "nonce":"1192058500544631938939603",
    "requested_attributes":{
        "legalName":{
            "name":"legalName",
            "names":null,
            "restrictions":[
                {
                    "cred_def_id":"MhMyTTDoxJptn2YtHF1s7j:3:CL:8:CorporationCredential",
                    "AttributeValue":null
                }]
        }
    },
    "requested_predicates":{
    }
}
```

There are two properties(names and AttributeValue) with null value in the later case, my question would be for connection less or not, whether the only difference should be whether we need to specify the connection or not, but for the generated proof request, the only difference is one has a value for the connectionId, the other one value is null? For other part of the proof request, they should have the same structure?
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 13:30:00 GMT):<br/>
What I want to implement is require the proof is based on one specified credential definition.

Hi, I tried to use `_proofService.VerifyProofAsync(agentContext, proofRecordId)` to verify a proof, I can receive a `true` if the credential's definition meet my expected definition, but when I used one different definition's credential for the verify, it didn't return a `false` but it returned below 500 error, is this a correct behavior?

hi @tomislav , I just noticed that there is a default created tag for a proof, which name is `role`, and value could be either  `requestor` or `holder`, if we could add one `IsRequestedByMe` property for the proof object, which value is based on this tag's value, that would be helpful, otherwise, developer needs to add this indicator manually. This would be the same for the credential object, if there could be one `IssuedByMe` property which value is based on the tag `role` value.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:53:08 GMT):<br/>
Like a read only field?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:53:24 GMT):<br/>
My only concern with that is that it implies this field is query-able, which it isn't
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:53:33 GMT):<br/>
the field `Role` is

Can anyone please share the approach on enabling backup and recovery in mobile agent?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:52:55 GMT):<br/>
There's no sample done yet, we should create one. It is however very simple to use. You want to call CreateBackup on the mobile side, and then using the same phrase, call RestoreBackup
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:53:51 GMT):<br/>
There's a unit test for this - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/3b500302c989b69790f0dc63ce15633017008126/test/Hyperledger.Aries.Tests/Routing/BackupTests.cs#L107
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:05:15 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the inputs @tomislav . Where does this backup is stored after calling the CreateBackup ? Is there any document which explains the whole process ?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:05:55 GMT):<br/>
It's stored on the mediator's filesystem. You can set the backup location in the agent options
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:06:02 GMT):<br/>
There's no document yet
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:08:10 GMT):<br/>
okay, and is there any option to change the storage type from filesystem to a db for mediator agent ?

@tomislav actually in our web agent there is complete functionality for Issuer, Holder, Verifier to issue, receive, verify, proof of credentials. but i was asking is there any implementation in osma (holder) to receive/store credentials in wallet (which is issued by issuer) ?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:40:13 GMT):<br/>
I believe there is, but it may not be available to respond to proof requests
</p>
<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:42:08 GMT):<br/>
in osma app, for now I just want to receive creds and store it in wallet
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:42:15 GMT):<br/>
@sukalpomitra has had it working for holding and proving.  He's gotten the BC Gov uses cases working.  He has using his own mediator.  You will need a mediator to do it.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:42:29 GMT):<br/>
FYI - it's now Aries-MAX and is part of Hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:42:54 GMT):<br/>
the issued creds to holder (osma) can be visible in app
</p>
<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:43:27 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran yes i know about Aries-MAX, and as I said, Web Agent is working fine, mediator is running
</p>
<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:44:54 GMT):<br/>
we have 3 web agents, for issuer, holder and verifier and mediator and it's working perfectly
</p>
<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:45:28 GMT):<br/>
now we just want to add the osma app in that circle, means that issued creds can be store and visible for user (holder)

Hey ,

Hope everyone is doing well.

I am having one query and would like to convey- We are running mobile agent in xamarin using the mediator connection but when we are requesting credential we are getting an error like this - "Hyperledger.Indy.PoolApi.PoolConfigNotCreatedException Message=The requested pool cannot be opened because it does not have an existing configuration."

Our cloud agent is in python, mobile agent is xamarin and we have also setup the mediator.


Thanks

Hi, I always encounter the first time failed issue, below are two common happened scenarios, does anyone also encounter this before?
1. The first time when I create a new schema, then it returned `Ledger operation rejected` 500 error, then when I create again, then it is success. 
2. The first time when I retrieve all schemas, then it returned `The ledger message is unknown or malformed.` 500 error, then when I refresh the page, the schemas were returned successfully
</p>

Hi all, I've made a first pass implementation of the [Propose Presentation](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof#propose-presentation) message exchange for the Present Proof aries protocol. This will let wallet holders to propose verification of their credentials to verifiers, and let verifiers to create a proof request from the proposal. Feel free to review [the PR](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/pull/101) and leave feedback. Happy to chat more about it here or in the comments

Hi All, am trying to create one automatic credential request after received the offer, below are the codes I am trying to use, but it had an error as `The ledger message is unknown or malformed.` when execute `await credentialController.RequestCredential(se.RecordId);`, the RequestCredential function is defined in the credentialsController. Can anyone help on this? Thanks.

```
// Automatically request credential when receive credential offer
var credentialOfferSubscription = _eventAggregator.GetEventByType<ServiceMessageProcessingEvent>()
    .Where(_ => _.MessageType == BasicMessageTypes.CredentialOfferType)
    .Subscribe(async se =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Received Credential Offer Message:" + se.RecordId.ToString());
        await credentialController.RequestCredential(se.RecordId);
        Console.WriteLine("Requested Credential Message Sent");
    });
```

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 22 Jun 2020 15:44:35 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 01:09:18 GMT):<br/>

hi @tomislav , may I have your suggestion about how to create one automatically request and response for a credential? Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 01:27:26 GMT):<br/>
You want to do this in the credential handler
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 01:27:43 GMT):<br/>
You can either override the default one, or write a new based on the same code
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 01:29:14 GMT):<br/>
So this is not from a subscription of the receiving message, right?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 01:30:39 GMT):<br/>
That's one way of doing it, but I can't confirm that specific implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 01:32:07 GMT):<br/>
"Do this in the credential handler", do you mean in a credential controller function?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 01:32:27 GMT):<br/>
No, I mean DefaultCredentialHandler.cs
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 01:32:33 GMT):<br/>
you can write your own handler
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 01:34:26 GMT):<br/>
ok, will check it. Thanks for the guidance
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 01:35:08 GMT):<br/>
It would be nice to get this in the framework. AutoAcceptCredential option in agent options

Hi all, when I tried to create a new wallet then get this wallet's issuer information, I encountered one problem.

I use below codes to create a new wallet
```
public async Task<IActionResult> CreatWallet(WalletModel model)
{
    var config = new WalletConfiguration { Id = model.walletName };
    var creds = new WalletCredentials { Key = model.walletCredential };
            await _walletService.CreateWalletAsync(config, creds);

            var wallet = await _walletService.GetWalletAsync(config, creds);

            var issuer = await _provisionService.GetProvisioningAsync(wallet);

            return Ok();
}
```

When execute the step `var issuer = await _provisionService.GetProvisioningAsync(wallet);`, it returned `Provisioning record not found` 500 error. Any suggestion?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 13:26:00 GMT):<br/>
creating a wallet on it's own doesn't create the agent required configuration. You need to call `ProvisionAsync` in the service to have this record created.

Hi, actually I didn't get a root cause for this, both in indy channel and here. I posted in indy channel also but there is no good news, they are asking what framework am using.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:26:57 GMT):<br/>
hi @tomislav , thanks for your feedback. but I am not sure whether this `ProvisionAsync` will also provision a new agent. My purpose is to support multiple wallets in the agent, so I can have one wallet for one user/party, their credentials can be stored in separate wallet. I am not sure whether am on the correct direction to implement this. Could you please suggest on here? Thanks a lot.

thanks @sheru for ur response,
actually the issuer is using offer-credential feature (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0036-issue-credential#offer-credential) to offer creds, and it's working fine, i'm getting on holder side (VS debug logs).

Here is an example of receiving and previewing the offered credential for holder -> https://github.com/Yoroitchi/AriesWebApp/blob/Holder5000/AriesWebApp/Controllers/CredentialsController.cs

but still i'm stuck there, no luck.

Hi everyone i want  to receive  a basic message from the mediator on my mobile agent with hyperledger aries. Can anyone help me out of this problem ?
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 01:18:29 GMT):<br/>
hi @x0axz , in my practice, after use `_credentialService.CreateOfferAsync` to send one credential offer to the holder, this will be stored in holder's wallet by default, then in the holder side, I use `await _credentialService.ListAsync(context);` to retrieve all credentials received. Hope this can help. I also paste more code in the private chat.

</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 12:58:41 GMT):<br/>
It is possible, as the postgres plugin can be plugged in independently. You want to register the plugin first, by making a native call to the C library, and then you can use the storage mapping in `WalletConfiguration.StorageType`, for example when you call `RegisterAgent(AgentOptions)`
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:15:35 GMT):<br/>
Hi All, does anyone implemented or tried to have the automatically issue a credential when the issuer received the credential request from the holder? Any direction or suggestion about how can we do this? Many thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>sheru</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:20:04 GMT):<br/>
if you are using aca-py then as per my best knowledge `--auto-respond-credential-request` need to set while you start aca-py.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:21:04 GMT):<br/>
thanks @sheru for your reply, I am trying this with dot net framework, as there is no such function exist, so just want to know anyone tried about this.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:23:06 GMT):<br/>
And this will also be helpful for the proof request, when received a proof request from the verifier, if the holder also can automatically select one proper credential and return back, then the verifier automatically verify the credentials, this would be great.
</p>
<p><strong>sheru</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:25:17 GMT):<br/>
Yes this can be also automate. I used aca-py as the cloud agent. Not sure how it can be done in the dot net one.
</p>

no.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:29:41 GMT):<br/>
That might also helpful to make some level of automation
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 17:39:22 GMT):<br/>
Can be implemented very easy. Add option in AgentOptions to toggle this setting. In credential handler inside the credential request block, check the setting, if automatic is on, issue credential
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 17:39:37 GMT):<br/>
Same principle as automatic connection acceptance

Hi all,
When we offered creds to holder, it is by default stored in holder wallet, next we have to "Create a credential request on offered creds" (*CreateRequestAsync*) and in response (from issuer), we will get the Issue Status (*CreateCredentialAsync*).

Now, I'm on *CreateRequestAsync *step, I created a button in osma, to '*Accept Offer*', which calls this *ProcessOffer()* function (https://github.com/Yoroitchi/AriesWebApp/blob/509d6556b8cb0f0584505a6ece5e38acf415e966/AriesWebApp/Controllers/CredentialsController.cs#L48).* In response I get this Error.*

It looks like your pool configurations didn't get created. Try running the service, or verify it gets executed, `PoolConfigurator.ConfigurePoolAsync`. This should execute on startup, but you can also run it manually.

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 13:02:42 GMT):<br/>
if youre using the default configuration, you should already have basic message handler
</p>

you are receiving messages
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 13:03:26 GMT):<br/>
you can list them using `recordService.SearchAsync<BasicMessageRecord(wallet)`

Hi all, in `DefaultCredentialHandler.cs` `ProcessAsync` function, 
in `case MessageTypes.IssueCredentialNames.RequestCredential`, it has one checking as 
`if (request.ReturnRoutingRequested() && messageContext.Connection == null)`, does anyone know what does this checking mean? Only meet this criteria then it will create a credential, otherwise nothing will be created, I didn't get what this checking is for. Anyone has idea about this? Thanks

Hi, this issue still happen when I use the core sample project, for the first time I create a new credential, there is one ledger message error, but I think this operation should not interact with ledger, and the strange thing is when I back to the creation page and submit again, then it went well, so not sure why this error happen, anyone have an idea?

Is `_credentialService.CreateCredentialAsync` the corresponding action for a credential request from the holder?
</p>
<p><strong>x0axz</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 18:08:57 GMT):<br/>
`CreateRequestAsync()`, create a credential request by the holder for the given record on a previously received offer. The credential record must be in state "Offered".

`CreateCredentialAsync()`, Create a credential based on an offer message. If successful, this method will return a credential record in "Issued" state.
</p>

<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 18:13:00 GMT):<br/>
thanks for your reply, but my remain question is why `CreateCredentialAsync` only happened when `if (request.ReturnRoutingRequested() && messageContext.Connection == null)` is true. Any idea?
</p>
<p><strong>x0axz</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 18:41:42 GMT):<br/>
I don't know what u mean by that, but this is the function I'm using to Send Credentials to Holder.
		
		```
            var agentContext = await _agentContextProvider.GetContextAsync();
            var credentialRecord = await _credentialService.GetAsync(agentContext, id);
            var connectionRecord = await _connectionService.GetAsync(agentContext, credentialRecord.ConnectionId);
            (var cred, var credentialRecordIssued) = await _credentialService.CreateCredentialAsync(agentContext: agentContext, credentialId: id);
            await _messageService.SendAsync(agentContext.Wallet, cred, connectionRecord);
		```
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 18:50:08 GMT):<br/>
ok, I am adding automate features for credential handler, which can enable:
- Holder automatically request a credential after receiving an offer
- Issuer automatically issue a credential after receiving a credential request

And this change is in `DefaultCredentialHandler.cs`. If you check the code, there is one part about how to handle credential request message, as below:
```
case MessageTypes.IssueCredentialNames.RequestCredential:
{
    var request = messageContext.GetMessage<CredentialRequestMessage>();
    var recordId = await _credentialService.ProcessCredentialRequestAsync(
            agentContext: agentContext,
            credentialRequest: request,
            connection: messageContext.Connection);
    if (request.ReturnRoutingRequested() && messageContext.Connection == null)
    {
        var (message, record) = await _credentialService.CreateCredentialAsync(agentContext, recordId);
        messageContext.ContextRecord = record;
        return message;
    }
    else
    {
        messageContext.ContextRecord = await _credentialService.GetAsync(agentContext, recordId);
        return null;
    }
}
```

So there is one check `if (request.ReturnRoutingRequested() && messageContext.Connection == null)`, I am not sure what this check is for, seems only meet this criteria then it will create a credential, otherwise, nothing will be created.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 18:58:33 GMT):<br/>
And this is the line of code which I am not sure the checking purpose.

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/e2a99e7bd3c4d77c3c765b2a4b37470d075f4cb6/src/Hyperledger.Aries/Features/IssueCredential/DefaultCredentialHandler.cs#L76
</p>
<p><strong>x0axz</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 19:02:17 GMT):<br/>
sorry, don't have any idea, but it looks like they are checking for, either they get the Request from Holder, to Issue them credentials.

States of Credentials:
Offered -> Issuer to Holder
Requested -> Holder to Issuer
Issued -> Issuer to Holder

ReturnRoutingRequested() -> https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/master/src/Hyperledger.Aries/Decorators/Transport/TransportDecoratorExtensions.cs#L28
</p>
<p><strong>x0axz</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 19:04:09 GMT):<br/>

It is used for return routing support. If you specify return route in your request, the result will be given in the http response, isntead going over peer connection
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sun, 05 Jul 2020 09:16:14 GMT):<br/>
so if we specified the return route, one `CreateCredentialAsync` will be invoked, if not specify the return route, it won't create credential. As this is for `MessageTypes.IssueCredentialNames.RequestCredential` this type of message, so does this mean, if received a `RequestCredential` message and there is not specified return route, then we don't need to create a credential for this request, is this correct?

<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sun, 05 Jul 2020 14:29:10 GMT):<br/>
From your description, you are still a verifier role, I am not sure what's the reason that you don't want to initialize a proof request but want to verify a credential which requested from others. I think verify a credential doesn't need to hold/save the credential data, just need to verify the result, so whether a normal proof verification process can work?
</p>
<p><strong>x0axz</strong> (Sun, 05 Jul 2020 20:15:57 GMT):<br/>
Here is our system design:
We have multiple Issuers and every Issuer has their own user base (Holders). We want to function as Verifier, to verify the Proof Request on behalf of Issuers.

Issuer wants to verify a holder, the issuer will first sent a proof request to Verifier (us) (we won't store/hold it). We will then forward this request to holder, they in response will sent us the proof (again, we don't want to know anything about it, we want to apply ZKP). We will verify the proof request.

As the Credentials are stored in Holder Wallets, when Issuer sent us request to verify the credentials of Holder, we (verifier) don't want to store/hold/log the credentials in any way.

you may be trying to use a pool without creating it first. It probably works outside docker because the config is already stored somewhere on your local in ~/.indy_client. Use Pool.CreatePoolLedgerConfigAsync to create and provide a genesis file.
</p>
<p><strong>syngin</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 02:12:57 GMT):<br/>
i think with proofs, the credentials are never sent. and with ZKP neither is the actual attribute. The verifier doesn't have to be the issuer. As verifiier I think you can make your own proof request.

Hi all,
On web agent, I created Input field to ask for holder's passport number in plaintext. Will hash/encode this value with same algorithm, which was used at a time of credential issuance.
To validate both hash values (one stored in wallet, issued at a time of credential issuance AND second, the generated hashed value on web agent).

This is the function which encode the credential attribute: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/10c89e4938deb386bf9ec013e383e3c7bb7ffcc6/src/Hyperledger.Aries/Utils/CredentialUtils.cs#L54

But now I can't use this method because it's an Internal method.

any help on how to implement this functionality?

The verify function already compares the hashed values for encoding. Can you just run verify?

Else, we can make the method public, just not sure that would have common use

</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:18:45 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for that.. here is what I want.

Both of hash values will be provided in two different parts.

Credentials are issued in two forms, Raw & Encoded.

Holder has to enter Passport Number in Raw form on web agent, it will be Encoded and then store in wallet.

Holder will separately provide the Passport Number in Encoded form (which was stored in wallet on Phone), which will then be verify with the previous encoded value.
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:18:54 GMT):<br/>
I hope it make sense
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:19:59 GMT):<br/>
who is the issuer?
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:20:46 GMT):<br/>
a third person (identity provider), in this flow Issuer won't be involve.
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:21:23 GMT):<br/>
it's just holder and verifier
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:21:54 GMT):<br/>
I just want to encode the passport number, which is in raw form and store it in wallet!
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:22:20 GMT):<br/>
later, will validate it with hash value provided by holder
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:22:43 GMT):<br/>
so why the verifier need to verify it, that value is provided from the holder self, what should be the criteria to say, this is an expected credential or not
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:24:20 GMT):<br/>
just want to encode the raw data.. that's it. is there any solution for that?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 13:13:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes, make the method public
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 13:14:10 GMT):<br/>

Hi @tomislav @lijiachuan 

I made a method `public string EncodePassportNumber(string passportNumber)` which takes a plaintext passportNumber as input and convert into hash and return the hash value.

Now in `public async Task<IActionResult> HashedPassportNumber(string EncodePassportNumber)` i'm trying to store this hashed value in wallet and fetch it whenever and wherever I want.

But as for that we have to create a model, for proof there is `ProofRequest`, for messages there is `BasicMessageRecord`, `BasicMessage` e.t.c.

I just want to store `passportNumber in plaintext`, `hashed value of passportNumber` and `status`.

how can I achieve it. thanks

Hi All,
My scenario is Connectionless Proof Presentation with Revocable Credentials. My error is "A value must be provided. (Parameter 'masterSecret')". 

It seems agentContext.MasterSecretId returns null. 

Questions: 
1. Where did I go wrong?
2. When does the mastersecret get set? During wallet provisioning? During credential accept?
3. I tried to get as mastersecret using AnonCreds.ProverCreateMasterSecretAsync(agentContext.Wallet, null); and use that in my verification presentation but it was accepted as not valid. Why? Does being a connectionless scenario factor into it?

<p><strong>syngin</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 09:06:31 GMT):<br/>
To answer my own questions.
1. Somehow the wallet was created without a MasterSecret. 
2. It gets set when the wallet is created. A MasterSecret is created with every wallet. To be sure, run _provisionService.ProvisionAgentAsync(); And check the MasterSecretId of the newly created wallet.
3. No, its not related to the conenctionless scenario. 

When in doubt, update indy and aries to the latest versions, and clear all old data. I found other annoying but not showstopping bugs were eliminated when upgraded to the latest indy and aries libraries. Maybe the bug where master secret is not generated was part of an older aries/indy version. Clearing the old wallet data also helps I guess.

The `IEventAggregator` helps you hook into specific events. Additionally, you can implement `IAgentMiddleware` to intercept the agent message processing pipeline.
</p>
<p><strong>syngin</strong> (Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:11:06 GMT):<br/>
i think there's potentially many master secrets identified by Ids. For proof presentation (in aries), i believe it uses the default master secret. I suppose you could work at the indy level to use a different master secret. I've not explored this topic further since I was able to get a successful proof verification.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 15 Jul 2020 14:21:19 GMT):<br/>
Master secret is created at wallet provisioning.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 15 Jul 2020 14:21:56 GMT):<br/>
You can have multiple master secrets, but you won't be able to link the credentials against the same master secret if you use multiple
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 15 Jul 2020 14:22:26 GMT):<br/>
I don't know of a codebase that currently works with multiple master secrets. It's definitely possible

Hi all, I'm working on Presentation Proof. Everything is working fine, Verifier is able to sends a Proof Request to Holder. Holder sends back a Proof Request with Credentials. But I want to verifiy these Credentials blindly (without knowing anything about it).

*A Method which verifies the Request*
	```
	public bool VerifyNamedAndrie(PartialProof proof)
        {
            var name = proof.RequestedProof.RevealedAttributes.First();
            if (name.Value.Raw.Equals("Andrie"))
            { 
                return true;

            return false;
        }

The Problem is with this last Method (*VerifyNamedAndrie*) is that *Verifier* has to know what's the *FirstName of Holder* is. How can I verify the *Attributes *(first name or anything) *blindly* (without knowing anything about it)?

I think if you don't want to reveal the attributes, you would use predicates. However for strings, it doesn't really make sense, since you have to compare against a known string. If it matches, then you know what the attribute is - indirectly. It still protects the privacy of people not named Andrie. Maybe that's enough.

Any suggestions please ?

<p><strong>syngin</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 00:44:48 GMT):<br/>
not familiar with macOS dev, but one of the issues I had with indy was forgetting to set the environment variable 
"You need add the path to lib folder to LIBRARY_PATH environment variable."
I'm guessing either this issue or the other sub libraries needed e.g. libsodium, zeromq, openssl. 
Maybe a configuration program could be included to advise which libraries are missing.
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 02:54:30 GMT):<br/>
@ajayjadhav I have only been able to get aspnetcore to recognize Indy by putting the libindy.dylib directly in the bin/debug/netstandard2.0 directory 
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 02:55:04 GMT):<br/>
Something to do with how the build links to a version of libsodium

@ajayjadhav I am still just copying the dylib manually for each project I run, when I use MacOS. I think there's a way to set `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to where your libindy.dylib is, but for me it's not working right. It used to, but not anymore
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 16:27:20 GMT):<br/>
I've sort of given up trying and just copy the static lib for now
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 16:29:04 GMT):<br/>
As @mboyd pointed out, if you copy the library in the `bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1` output of your application, it should find it. As far as building it, you can just use the script in `indy-sdk/libindy/mac.build.sh` to build it
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 17:38:48 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @tomislav & @mboyd, I will give it a try
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 17:55:14 GMT):<br/>
Great, I am able to run the `aspnetcore` sample now after running `mac.build.sh` and putting the `libindy.dylib` in the `samples/aspnetcore/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/` directory..

Hi @tomislav, we are to using `aries-framework-dotnet` for setting up a cloud-based shared agent to manage custodial wallets. My colleague @RinkalBhojani is able to do it by making some changes to be able to create & manage multiple wallets. 

Do you think we can raise a PR for these changes to go into master?
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Fri, 24 Jul 2020 18:58:27 GMT):<br/>
BTW - ACA-Py has it coming in this PR - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/624

What is the way to replace a default service? I can't get it to work. I've tried using the following two lines, both separate and together in the   `ConfigureServices` function in `Startup.cs`, but it keeps using the `DefaultCredentialService`:
```
services.AddExtendedCredentialService<CredentialService>();
services.AddSingleton<ICredentialService, CredentialService>();
```
`CredentialService` extends `DefaultCredentialService` and only overrides the `ProcessOfferAsync` function. Any help is appreciated!

Hi For StreedCred devs,  Is there a limit to the size of an attribute? I was able to encode binary data as base64 in the attribute, but at a certain size, the SC API refused to accept it.

@syngin For Trinsic (formerly Streetcred ID) specific questions you can ask on our forum here: https://docs.trinsic.id/discuss
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 18:00:12 GMT):<br/>
The answer is that the limit is not based on the size of an attribute, but on the total credential payload. At about 40,000 characters in the whole offer, you shouldn't have any issues. Anything above 45,000 characters and the API will reject it.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 18:06:22 GMT):<br/>
Is that because of an Indy limit or because of checking done in Trinsic?
</p>
<p><strong>syngin</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 01:57:46 GMT):<br/>
@rileyphughes  thanks riley.
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 03:09:44 GMT):<br/>
Not based on checking done by us. We're not sure if it's an Indy thing or an Aries thing, but it's something lower level.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 03:41:11 GMT):<br/>
Thanks - I've had questions about how big a credential can be and I've wondered.

64kb, this is limitation of Azure Table API
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 11:59:28 GMT):<br/>
Did you do this after you added core aries services? It should work, it's just the .NET Core DI
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 12:00:40 GMT):<br/>
It's the custom wallet storage limitation, not indy.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 12:35:41 GMT):<br/>
I did it before the `AddAriesFramework` and inside the `AddAriesFramework` call. Haven't tried doing it after `RegisterAgent` or `AddAriesFramework`. Not sure why I haven't tried that yet. Thanks!

I tried to find the line between Aries as an agent to Indy as a ledger, if I want to integrate another ledger where is the package to change? It's only there https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/tree/master/src/Hyperledger.Aries/Ledger? 
</p>
<p><strong>Moshe7</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:06:57 GMT):<br/>
also, I read that there is a plan to make Aries Dotnet agnostic to the ledger and support another blockchain project besides Indy, it's started?  where I can see the progress?

Hi, anyone can help?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 11:49:27 GMT):<br/>
Are you asking about adding another Indy ledger or a different type of blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 11:49:56 GMT):<br/>
Yes, there are plans, and these will generally be driven by conversations and initiatives in the community.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 11:50:15 GMT):<br/>
So far, there hasn't been any specific work planned or outlined
</p>
<p><strong>Moshe7</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 12:53:47 GMT):<br/>
Different type of blockchain
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 16:45:00 GMT):<br/>
So that's a more complex task. You would have to write custom services to provide full support for that. ILedgerService, ICredentialService, IProofService, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 16:46:24 GMT):<br/>
However, the way all Aries frameworks are implemented now is they rely heavily on Indy wallets for storage. If you were to use Aries with a different credential signature scheme, you probably want your own storage too.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 16:46:45 GMT):<br/>
I'd be happy to help with efforts for this
</p>
<p><strong>Moshe7</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 20:58:27 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, this is what I thought, I wanted to know if the link of Aries Dotnet's in my first post is the only package relevant to Indy ledger?  my thinking is to use another type of blockchain only to create DID for entities, so regarding the storage in Indy wallet, it is a problem to use a Credential signature scheme of Indy for another type of ledger, for example, Ethereum?

Thank you for your kindness to help, I'm actually thinking on port Aries also to Dart, I understand that the Aries dotnet is the most Aries mature project to learn from.

Hi @lalchandran You'll want to put the libindy.dylib into your bin/Debug/ directory of our mobileagent project There is a bug with the path environment that causes the linking to break unless it is in this directory.

Do I get it right that you are suggestion to build indy sdk locally as described here? https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/build-guides/mac-build.md

Hello there,
On Ubuntu 18.04, I guess libindy seems to be throwing the error below on rare occasions.
Does anyone has seen this error message? A little help would be appreciated for me to trace the origin of it.
```
// relevant code section in my controller (_walletService is injected via DI).
var wallet = await _walletService.GetWalletAsync(new WalletConfiguration { Id = agent.walletName }, new WalletCredentials { Key = agent.walletKey });

// occasional error log message
2020-08-28 02:59:51.8474||ERROR|*.Controllers.AgentsController| The SDK library experienced an unexpected internal error. 
2020-08-28 02:59:51.8538||ERROR|*.Controllers.AgentsController| at Hyperledger.Aries.Storage.DefaultWalletService.GetWalletAsync(WalletConfiguration configuration, WalletCredentials credentials)

Good Morning all. I have gone through this https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc and this is awesome to me we can verify proof and login into a web application. I am very much curious about How can I login into an mobile application same like the oidc-django. Please guide me to proceed with the concept of login to a mobile application. Thanks in advance.

Hi, I am trying to issue  below credential
{
  "connectionId": "feb3eb81-aec0-4932-934d-af00999f60ff",
  "credentialDefinitionId": "3LteGaZHa3RTpxG1EYXsuT:3:CL:719:TestEducationDegreetag",
  "credentialPreviewAttributes": [
    {
      "name": "subject",
      "value": "Maths"
    },
   {
      "name": "marks",
      "value": "30"
    }
  ]
}

Both issuer and holder is running as web agent

Credential gets issued to the connected party, but after that at issuer side, when I am trying to get all Credentials using "Lists the credentials" API(which in turn uses, await CredentialService.ListAsync(agentContext)) then I am getting an exception as ,
System.InvalidCastException: 'Cannot cast Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject to Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JToken.' at CastAttribute method of CredentialUtil class.

When I tried calling get all Credentials for holder to which I issued the credential, it works fine.
What I noticed is, record is not getting saved properly in issuer's wallet, below is the data saved in wallet

*Holder's wallet:*
{"CredentialDefinitionId":"3LteGaZHa3RTpxG1EYXsuT:3:CL:719:TestEducationDegreetag","CredentialAttributesValues":[{"name":"subject","mime-type":"text/plain","value":"Maths"},{"name":"marks","mime-type":"text/plain","value":"30"}],"OfferJson":"{\"schema_id\":\"3LteGaZHa3RTpxG1EYXsuT:2:TestEducationDegree:1.0\",\"cred_def_id\":\"3LteGaZHa3RTpxG1EYXsuT:3:CL:719:TestEducationDegreetag\",\"key_correctness_proof\":{\"c\":\"107797846073719709242298172610699517659217050167000924804258619008787422036651\",\"xz_cap\":\"13878489754831867500........

*Issuer's wallet:*
{"CredentialDefinitionId":"3LteGaZHa3RTpxG1EYXsuT:3:CL:719:TestEducationDegreetag","CredentialAttributesValues":[{"name":"subject","mime-type":"text/plain","value":{"ValueKind":3}},{"name":"marks","mime-type":"text/plain","value":{"ValueKind":3}}],"OfferJson":"{\"schema_id\":\"3LteGaZHa3RTpxG1EYXsuT:2:TestEducationDegree:1.0\",\"cred_def_id\":\"3LteGaZHa3RTpxG1EYXsuT:3:CL:719:TestEducationDegreetag\",\"key_correctness_proof\":{\"c\":\"107797846073719709242298172610699517659217050167000924804258619008787422036651\",\"xz_cap\":\"13878489754831867500646404168430810392.......

Hi all, I have one question about how can I prove one DID is mine? The reason why I asked this is I am thinking about a scenario that, one service can be accessible only if you have one valid DID and you can prove that DID is yours, but I am not sure how can implement this. Anyone can help? Thanks.

You can use the indy API to export the wallet. `Hyperledger.Indy.Sdk.WalletApi.ExportAsync`

hi all, is there any document about how to setup the "routing" agent with the mobile agent? As mobile agent doesn't have one endpoint which can be found by others, so I think there should be a "routing" agent which will be used by the mobile agent, but not sure how should I setup that. Anyone can suggest, is the "routing" agent the same as one normal agent(python or dotnet)? Thanks.

<p><strong>sheru</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 11:32:27 GMT):<br/>
@lijiachuan https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin here you will find a mediator directory which have the code for the mediator agent. Its build on .net. 
from inside the mediator directory run `dotnet run` to run the mediator service for the mobile applications.

I suggest looking into updating to latest Xamarin Forms
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 17:38:50 GMT):<br/>
As a rule of thumb, the Xamarin team keeps the API compatible with Apple's guidelines in terms of stripping internal and unused symbols.
I'm assuming your build also has linker stripping support.

hi, I found there are 4 genesis files in the Android project's Assets folder, may I know why there are 4 genesis files? I have one test Indy network created, but there is only one genesis file content I can use, so which genesis file should I update in this Android project's 4 files? A little confuse here, hope can have your clarify here. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 13:57:20 GMT):<br/>
From that pool configurator code, seems it tries to dump these 4 genesis file content into one cache folder's genesis.txn file, and each time it goes to the exception
```
catch (PoolLedgerConfigExistsException)
{
  // OK
}
```
I checked the file name is "/data/user/0/com.osma/cache/genesis.txn", I am not sure whether this is due to there is no such folder or other reason to go to the exception part.
</p>

ok, this is helpful, but may I know why in this PoolConfigurator.cs, it will dump 4 files' content into one file? If my understanding is correct, only the last genesis file's content will be kept in the genesis.txn file, am I correct?
</p>
<p><strong>sheru</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:05:47 GMT):<br/>
No its add 4 genesis with 4 different genesis file.
if you want to add your own

@tomislav Need your comment here.:grinning:
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:17:45 GMT):<br/>
There are 4 configs defined in the code as below
```
private Dictionary<string, string> poolConfigs = new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            { "sovrin-staging", "pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis" },
            { "sovrin-live", "pool_transactions_live_genesis" },
            { "sovrin-builder", "pool_transactions_builder_genesis" },
            { "bcovrin-test", "pool_transactions_bcovrin_test_genesis" }
        };
```

So 
the first time it writes pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis content to the genesis.txn and generate a pool configuration, 
then it writes pool_transactions_live_genesis content to the genesis.txn and generate a pool configuration,
then it writes pool_transactions_builder_genesis content to the genesis.txn and generate a pool configuration,
Lastely it writes pool_transactions_bcovrin_test_genesis content to the genesis.txn and generate a pool configuration
</p>
<p><strong>sheru</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:18:30 GMT):<br/>
Exactly.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:19:20 GMT):<br/>
Is this for testing purpose? Or whether we should only keep one genesis here?
</p>
<p><strong>sheru</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:20:10 GMT):<br/>
This is for support multiple ledger in one mobile app.
</p>
<p><strong>sheru</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:20:50 GMT):<br/>
you can change the default pool one at runtime.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:21:23 GMT):<br/>
ok, got it, so maybe it's due to I could not connect to any of these 4 pool from my local, so it failed
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:21:47 GMT):<br/>
let me add my own test indy network and genesis
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 15:03:22 GMT):<br/>
hi @sheru , this issue still happen even with my test Indy network's genesis file content, I followed your instruction, added a new genesis file in Android Assets folder, then updated Android's project file with the new asset item, also changed my default pool name in the App.xaml.cs. But I think the problem is it still goes to the exception part with my own test network's genesis file. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/cb56d53f4e8a3da45cefa65503960b9e52e71099/src/Osma.Mobile.App/Services/PoolConfigurator.cs#L56
```
catch (PoolLedgerConfigExistsException)
{
  // OK
}
```

I am not sure what does this "PoolLedgerConfigExistsException" exactly mean, does it mean the genesis file is not usable or the network could not be connected, any thoughts? Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 15:05:17 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/cb56d53f4e8a3da45cefa65503960b9e52e71099/src/Osma.Mobile.App/Services/PoolConfigurator.cs#L48

before this line of code, I added one output to know whether the content is the same as my genesis content(`var fileContent = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();`), and it's true, the content is the same, but when create the pool config, it still goes to the exception.
</p>
<p><strong>sheru</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 15:07:04 GMT):<br/>
can you please share the genesis file content here
</p>

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 12:54:14 GMT):<br/>
`Network subsystem is down` is not an exception thrown by Aries. It's a communication issue. A quick search indicates this is related to achieving connectivity.
</p>

Incredible. Please post a link of the app once it's published

hi @tomislav , I could not figure out what is the issue. I would like to know what is a correct steps/process to learn about how to build up a mobile app with xamarin and aries framework. I see there is one indipendent project https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin, and there is also one sample folder in the main aries framework dotnet project, which one is a better start point for learning? Kindly advise.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 14:22:51 GMT):<br/>
The github repo is the codebase you want to learn off of. The sample was created very early on.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 09:08:58 GMT):<br/>
I got the root cause for this issue, which is due to `localhost` didn't work in the Android emulator, after I change it to the local IP address of my laptop, then it worked. I am not sure whether that only happened for myself, whether we can add anything into the documents.

After I click "Create Wallet" button, althought there is one item with "Connected" status, but the loading icon is keeping showing. Then if I clicked that item, in the mediator command window, below error was shown
```

      An unhandled exception has occurred while executing the request.

<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:05:54 GMT):<br/>
For the mediator project, seems there is no any specific class/function defined, only some initial configurations in Startup.cs, is this correct? So how could this mediator know how to handle different type of messages?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:10:08 GMT):<br/>
That's correct. Mediator can only handle `forward` messages (from the standards family) and the internal mediator specific ones, which are not standardized
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:11:21 GMT):<br/>
ok, so normally the mediator should just looks like what is in this example project, right?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:11:24 GMT):<br/>
```
protected override void ConfigureHandlers()
        {
            AddConnectionHandler();
            AddHandler<MediatorForwardHandler>();
            AddHandler<DefaultStoreBackupHandler>();
            AddHandler<RetrieveBackupHandler>();
            AddHandler<RoutingInboxHandler>();
        }
```
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:11:54 GMT):<br/>
Yes, for the usual case
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:12:11 GMT):<br/>
We should actually add the discovery handler to the default configuration, it doesn't hurt to do this
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:12:13 GMT):<br/>
Ok, that's good, we can use one common mediator program
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:12:48 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's added in the Startup.cs

`app.UseMediatorDiscovery();`
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:13:08 GMT):<br/>
But @tomislav, may I have your idea bout the issue I encountered?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:13:28 GMT):<br/>
no that's different, in the `MediatorAgent` should be `AddDiscoveryHandler()`
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:14:31 GMT):<br/>
I am responding to the issue
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:14:48 GMT):<br/>
The mediator doesn't support discovery messages by defalt
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:14:56 GMT):<br/>
I don't know why the mobile app asks for it
</p>

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/cb56d53f4e8a3da45cefa65503960b9e52e71099/mediator/Startup.cs#L43
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:15:52 GMT):<br/>
In the mediator's Startup.cs, there has one line of `app.UseMediatorDiscovery();`
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:16:25 GMT):<br/>
That line is about something completely different than the issue you're seeing
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:16:35 GMT):<br/>
that's discovery is about well known configuration middleware

</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:16:58 GMT):<br/>
you issue is related to the discovery protocol, which is different
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:17:04 GMT):<br/>
just a coincidence on the same name
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:17:22 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:19:39 GMT):<br/>
To resolve this issue you can do one of these things:
- Either remove the code in AMAX that calls for discovery on pull down
- Add Discovery ability to your mediator, but making custom class same as `MediatorAgent` but with `AddDiscoveryHandler()` added. Then register that class `AddMedaitorAgent<CustomAgent>()`
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:20:05 GMT):<br/>
I'll submit a PR to add this to default config
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:32:33 GMT):<br/>
In mobile agent's ConnectionViewModel.cs, is uses `protocols = response.GetMessage<DiscoveryDiscloseMessage>();` to get a protocols list, and has one specific checking for `TrustPingMessageType`.

<p><strong>horacionunez</strong> (Thu, 01 Oct 2020 13:07:48 GMT):<br/>
{protected,iv,Ciphertext,tag} is the format.
</p>
<p><strong>horacionunez</strong> (Thu, 01 Oct 2020 13:08:06 GMT):<br/>
Is there any existing abstraction that deals with this type of message?
</p>

@daruru did you resolve the problem? Sounds like you are missing the indy binaries in the iOS/Android specific projects.

I was able to resolve the problem. I had to unpack the package, but I did using internal classes on the framework.

Hi, I am trying to use my own domain URL to setup the mediator, I changed below line of code to `options.EndpointUri = "http://mydomain.com";`

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/cb56d53f4e8a3da45cefa65503960b9e52e71099/mediator/Startup.cs#L23

But after that change and when I use `dotnet run` to start this mediator in my local, when I browse http://localhost:5000/.well-known/agent-configuration, the content is still showing `ServiceEndpoint` is `http://localhost:5000` but is not `http://mydomain.com`. May I know whether this is correct?
</p>
<p><strong>horacionunez</strong> (Thu, 01 Oct 2020 16:30:38 GMT):<br/>
Is there a particular reason why the dotnet-agent doesn't support more mime types for Credentials? Looking https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/master/src/Hyperledger.Aries/Utils/CredentialUtils.cs#L38 cc @tomislav

hi @tomislav, I would like to continue disucssing about this discovery message issue.
In https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/cb56d53f4e8a3da45cefa65503960b9e52e71099/src/Osma.Mobile.App/ViewModels/Connections/ConnectionViewModel.cs#L70, it defines `DiscoveryDiscloseMessage` type's variable `protocols`, and use https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/cb56d53f4e8a3da45cefa65503960b9e52e71099/src/Osma.Mobile.App/ViewModels/Connections/ConnectionViewModel.cs#L75 to get `protocols` values. And from https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/cb56d53f4e8a3da45cefa65503960b9e52e71099/src/Osma.Mobile.App/ViewModels/Connections/ConnectionViewModel.cs#L94 seems it has a special logic to handle the `MessageTypes.TrustPingMessageType`.  Is this some special functions for a connection? Do you have any idea about the purpose of this section of codes? Thanks.

I tried to scan a invitation QR code generated from ACA-Py, and click accept button on the mobile, but the connection's status is keeping as `Negotiating`, I am not sure whether this is related to above issue/
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sat, 03 Oct 2020 11:40:43 GMT):<br/>
This is not a message type that the mediator can process
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sat, 03 Oct 2020 11:42:25 GMT):<br/>
These are limitations of indy-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sat, 03 Oct 2020 11:43:11 GMT):<br/>
Currently, all credential values must be string, so you can encode anything in the credential value, as long as it's serialized to text or json

<p><strong>horacionunez</strong> (Sat, 03 Oct 2020 16:33:10 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is that not all mediators accept the same commands, but if I read you correctly, there is a set of commands that mediators can handle by design, and this one isn't one of them.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 04 Oct 2020 12:59:59 GMT):<br/>

Hi all, regarding a personal mobile agent scenario, whether one associated mediator agent is efficient to interact with another agent? Is there any other type of role in a mobile agent process. Because I am reading the Edx.Org's training, and there is one "agency" concep introduced there, but I am not sure whether that agency is one required role in a mobile agent process. If anyone can help on this? Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 15:35:36 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure what your goal is, but Aries is extremely flexible about how to organize agents.  All sorts of configurations are possible. For example a mobile agent could use a mediator and agency for one set of connections, and a different combo for other connections.  Of course, the more options/variations, the more complexity in managing.  But underlying DIDComm makes the actual routing of messages through a whole range of configs really easy.

hi all, I have been exploring writing my custom agent and I found an interesting case where when I use `ListCredentialsForProofRequestAsync` on a wallet with matching credentials but nothing gets returned.

So only with one mediator is not enough to be able to interact with another agent, correct? For example, if Alice wants to use her mobile agent to interact with Bob's mobile agent, she needs to have one mediator PLUS one agency then she can interact with Bob, or she could interact with Bob only with one mediator.? I am not so clear about this, so hope can make it clarified. Thanks.

Ah...just one mediator is fine. As long as it is addressable on the Internet it can be used.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 17:36:25 GMT):<br/>
Often the one mediator IS an agency.  It handles many mobile agents.  It can't read any messages sent to the mobile agents, but it can recognize to whom the message is for and can forward the message on.
</p>
<p><strong>horacionunez</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 23:52:18 GMT):<br/>
I realized the problem here, and it was that the original code was conflating stored credentials with stored credentials offers :)

Would it be too much to ask if I want a few virtual keywords in the framework code? I need to extend a few methods of the default proof service for my use case. Since adding the virtual keywords won't likely to affect anyone else, I would appreciate it if you allow my PR#135.

Hi, I am trying to use the debug mode for the sample mobile agent(https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin) in my Android phone, when I tried to use the scan/connection function to scan one invitation QR code which is generated by an ACA-Py agent, which URL is `http://13.78.88.99:8000?c_i=eyJAdHlwZSI6ICJkaWQ6c292OkJ6Q2JzTlloTXJqSGlxWkRUVUFTSGc7c3BlYy9jb25uZWN0aW9ucy8xLjAvaW52aXRhdGlvbiIsICJAaWQiOiAiOWIzYjRmNDMtOGE4ZS00MDA1LTkwNWQtMWMyN2I3MTNkZTNlIiwgInNlcnZpY2VFbmRwb2ludCI6ICJodHRwOi8vMTMuNzguODguOTk6ODAwMCIsICJsYWJlbCI6ICJDb3JwUmVnIiwgInJlY2lwaWVudEtleXMiOiBbIkRyN0o3QTE4ekhmWGNQTVUxemlVcmJBQ2FFTFBwQ1BYUVMyb21Xa1VBVnhnIl19`, then select accept the invitation, then I can see the ACA-Py agent log reflected the interaction, but with below error:

Whether this is one compitability issue between ACA-Py and Xamarin mobile framework? Kindly advise. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 15:36:27 GMT):<br/>
ACA-Py expects the `label` field to be present in the invitation. You can do this by either setting the `AgentName` parameter in the agent config (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness/blob/master/aries-backchannels/dotnet/server/Startup.cs#L50) or by passing the `MyAlias.Name` parameter in the `InviteConfiguration` when calling `CreateInvitationAsync`. I'm not 100% sure about aries-mobileagent-xamarin, but I think you should add the `AgentName` parameter in `builder.RegisterEdgeAgent` function here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/master/src/Osma.Mobile.App/App.xaml.cs#L62-L89
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 16:24:50 GMT):<br/>
thanks @TimoGlastra , adding an agent name resolved that error, currently the connection state is `response`, and from the mobile app, it is shown as `negotiating`. I am not sure what is pending to make it as active connection. Do you have any idea?

This was resolved finally after get a new version of Aries routing package, as previous version could not support discovery protocol, so I removed related function which related to trust ping operations, so there is not one trust ping between two entities. After add back the discovery related functions, the connection can become active finally.

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sat, 17 Oct 2020 12:50:26 GMT):<br/>
You can issue a credential without a connection, by calling the corresponding methods in the CredentialService that deal specifically with connectionless transport. See this unit test - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/ed219524e99c4fb30ad5529debe9abc6d4dade72/test/Hyperledger.Aries.Tests/Protocols/CredentialTransientTests.cs#L22

Hi @tomislav, thanks for your reply. Currently what I am doing is I used ACA-Py created a presentation request not bound to any proposal or existing connection, and I format one QR code based on a URL as `http://myVONIIP:8080?c_i=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`

And I can retrieve the Base64 actual content after scanning this QR code from mobile app, and I can also retrieve all my credentials from wallet, but I am not sure how should I reply one credential specifically for the presentation request. I think I didn't store the presentation request in the wallet, but what I want to implement is my mobile app will use my selected credential to reply the initial presentation request.

Hi, I'm getting `System.NullReferenceException: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.'` in aries-mobileagent-xamarin (OSMA).

This line is throwing exception. => https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/master/src/Osma.Mobile.App/Services/NavigationService.cs#L243

The Problem seems to me, is with ViewModel Bindings, but don't know exactly why? and how to solve it?

Yes, that's an accurate representation of how a mobile agent would communicate with cloud agents in different codebases (python vs dotnet) and a common ledger

Hi Everyone. I was working on the Xamarin mobile agent project which I cloned from https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin. I was implementing the backup and restore feature and was successfully abled to do that. But the issue is that, I have to restart the app after restoring the backup. Else the credentials in restored wallet is not available . Can anyone guide me on how can I restart the service written in https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/2f222a3b72169cfac94f494c54f306172f7ecf99/src/Osma.Mobile.App/App.xaml.cs#L62 without restarting the app. thank you.

The problem is that the linker is stripping unused references. You don't need Linking set to All in a Debug build
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 20 Nov 2020 23:21:24 GMT):<br/>
Try changing it to SDK only

Hello, I can't seem to find a way to initiate a issue-credential operation from the holder. I am using dotnet libary with the xamarin mobile agent. I am using this RFC https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0036-issue-credential as my reference when asking this question. The RFC states that there are two ways for Holder to initiate issue-credential protocol:
1) Holder sends proposal
2) Holder sends request
There is no method about propose-credential in the ICredentialService interface of the dotnet library and CreateRequestAysnc method states that the credential has to be in the state "offer" in order to create the credential request. My question is this; How can we initiate a issue-credential process from the holder using dotnet library ?
</p>
<p><strong>anil_helvaci</strong> (Tue, 24 Nov 2020 07:34:44 GMT):<br/>
Thanks in advance

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 24 Nov 2020 09:23:53 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately, there's no propose credential flow yet
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 24 Nov 2020 09:28:13 GMT):<br/>
I've added it as part of the aries-agent-test-harness a while ago, but it'd need tests and some cleanup before it can be merged in aries-framework-dotnet

Hi everyone, in my company we are developing a ssi mobile client using xamarin mobile. The current xamarin-mobile project is using the aries-dotnet-framework version 1.2.9. This is the version of the static library from the link(https://hyperledger-org.bintray.com/aries/) given in Readme file of the aries-mobileagent-xamarin(https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/). But current version of aries-framework-dotnet(https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet) in Nuget is 1.4.0. My question is this, can we migrate nuget packages to static libraries ? If we can, how? Thanks in advance

Hey everyone, I'm trying to issue a credential from a aca-py web agent to a xamarin-mobile agent. My problem is the state of the credential is stuck in the state "issued" and I cannot seem to find a way to convert it to state "acked". Any help would be appreciated :pray:
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Mon, 30 Nov 2020 01:18:06 GMT):<br/>
I don't think the aries framework sorbet contains an ack state. Issued or revoked are the two possible end states

Hello, thanks for the response. So what you are saying is that it is impossible to make ACA-PY web agent fall into state acked because there is no ack state in the aries-framework-dotnet?

Hi,

I have the following setup and need help with the issue I'm facing.

- Xamarin Forms app for iOS
- DotNet mediator
- ACA-Py Agent

The connection between the mobile app and the ACA-Py agent is established and active. The ACA-Py agent wants to issue a credential to the Mobile agent. Below are the steps being followed.

1) ACA-Py sends a Credential Offer to the Mobile agent
2) The state of the credential in ACA-Py is `offer_sent`
3) The mobile agent gets the offer with the state `Offered`
4) The Mobile agent invokes the below method
`credentialService.CreateRequestAsync`
5) The state of the credential in the Mobile agent is changed from `Offered` to `Requested`
6) The state of the credential in the ACA-Py agent remains `offer_sent`

*Expected behavior*
The state of the credential in the ACA-Py agent should change from `offer_sent` to `request_received` (after step 5), however, it doesn't change

*Note*: This seems to work fine when two ACA-Py agents exchange credentials with each other
</p>
<p><strong>marc0olo</strong> (Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:58:09 GMT):<br/>
is there somewhere an overview about what protocols of the Aries RFCs the dotnet framework supports?

Hi,

I have two agents, Issuer and Holder. 
1) Issuer Offer Credentials to Holder
2) Holder Accepts the Credential Offer
3) Issuer issues the Credentials

Everything works fine, but in last step I'm getting an error.
There is a Function `ProcessRequest()` which takes **credentialRecordId** as a Parameter. But it returns an error 
```{
    "success": false,
    "error": "A value being processed is not valid."
}```

and if I give it a wrong value, then it return this error.

```
{

Hello everyone, I want to send push notifications from my dotnet mediator agent to my mobile agent when a credential-offer or a proof-request arrives. Is subscribing to InboxItemEvent which is published from MediatorForwardHandler.cs is enough for notifying the mobile agent about the message type that has arrived or should I insert another middlware into the request pipeline? Any answer would be appreciated :pray:  @TimoGlastra @tomislav

Hi, Aries .net Mediator is giving me this error on Credential Issuance. Credential is Issued successfully. State is Issued (2) on Web Agent, but on Mobile Agent, state is still stuck on 1 (requested). Anyone has any idea, why?

There might be a problem in the connection between mobile agent and mediator agent. Try shutting down the mediator agent and deleting its wallet. Then start over issue-credential process

When accepting a Credential offer, the error *The requested pool cannot be opened because it does not have an existing configuration* is thrown on executing the below code

`(CredentialRequestMessage credentialRequestMessage, CredentialRecord newCredentialRecord) = await credentialService.CreateRequestAsync(agentContext, Credential.Record.Id);`

On investigating, I found that the PoolConfigurator.cs (https://bit.ly/3mKx0KQ) gets an exception (*An IO error occurred*). Below is the stack trace

`at Hyperledger.Aries.Ledger.DefaultPoolService.CreatePoolAsync (System.String poolName, System.String genesisFile) [0x0002d] in D:\a\1\s\src\Hyperledger.Aries\Ledger\DefaultPoolService.cs:59 at SSI.Services.PoolConfigurator.ConfigurePoolsAsync () [0x0023b] in /Users/sahil.khanna/Documents/VisualStudio_Workspace/ssi-mobile-app/SSI/Services/PoolConfigurator.cs:54`

*Note*

- The above scenario works fine on iOS. The problem is on an Android emulator and a device.
- The READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions are granted

Hello, I'm working on Credential Revocation. Everything is working fine, am able to Revoke the Credentials and the status changed to '4'.
I have two questions.

1) On Issuer side, the Credential Status is 4 (Revoked), but on Holder/Prover side, it's still 3 (Issued). Why?
2) When Verifier Creates a Proof Request, I also added the `Nonrevoked` Time Interval. Like normally, Prover sends a Presentation Proof response, and the credentials verified normally. Why?

```
NonRevoked = new RevocationInterval
{
	From = 0,
	To = now
}
```

Hey @RazaDen There's no dedicated call for the .NET stream. Contributions are welcome - there are no strict guidelines, other than DCO requirement that all commits must be signed.
In terms of code contributions, it all depends if you intend to introduce breaking changes, in which case we can discuss a strategy here on the channel.
</p>

<p><strong>RazaDen</strong> (Sat, 16 Jan 2021 13:53:56 GMT):<br/>
Hello @tomislav , thanks for your response. I think the best strategy would be for us to sync in a short offline call so that we can avoid duplicate work and generally work out a plan that works for both of us. Would it be ok for me to e-mail you so that we can set this up? I've found your e-mail @ trinsic if that's still valid.

Hi,

I am able to connect to Faber Agent deployed in AWS Cloud via Mediator agent using OSMA Mobile App. Upon successful connection , I tried to send credential 
from Faber Agent Via Swagger Api(/issue-credential/send) and it does sends the credential , However when i navigate to Credential Screen from mobile OSMA App crashes , Is it because Json response does not matches the expected CrdentailRecord format defined in Hyperledger.Aries ? Any pointers would be highly helpful. Thanks

Hi,

I have successfully created the wallet by using the link 
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin.
Now I want to restore the wallet details in my local path. 
I used the "RevocationRegistryDirectory" method to store my wallet details which is inbuilt in AriesFramework.
I am unable to see the stored data in "RevocationRegistryDirectory" path(unable to see any files in that location). It will be helpful if anyone of you share some insights on this.

Hi,

I am following the https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/AriesOpenAPIDemo.md#requestingpresenting-a-proof link
to create a proof request using "POST /present-proof/send-request" endpoint in Faber and I successfully created the proof request. After this call, I am going to create popup for proof request confirmation from Alice. Once Alice said "Yes", I wanted to respond for the proof request by using "POST /present-proof/records/{id}/send-presentation" endpoint in OSMA. Now, I want "Presentation Exchange ID"
to create "send-presentation" API call, So how can i get it ? If possible any one of you help me regarding the same.

Hi All,

I have followed and created the mobile wallet by using the below OSMA github link.
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin 

I am able to achieve some of the wallet functionalities successfully but i am unable to find where SQLITE has initialized and stored the wallet details of
 both mediator, mobile wallets ( in OSMA where SQLite has been initialized and handled). I can notice SQLite folder is placed in my local path "C:\Users\SRINI\.indy_client\wallet\Edge9aa217732c1f46088304b75b9c26d539"
while running the OSMA application. Still I am unable to find the piece of code where it has been initiated. Can anyone help me on this?

    Hyperledger.Aries.Features.BasicMessage.BasicMessage basicMessage = new()
    {
        Content = "Some Text",

    IMessageService messageService = App.Container.Resolve<IMessageService>();
    await messageService.SendAsync(AgentContext, basicMessage, Connection.Record);

The message is not received at the Aca-Py end

I also tried sending the message as below. However, I get the error as `{"@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/notification/1.0/problem-report", "@id": "8b605a23-b58d-466d-bb7a-eb456bd48ac1", "~thread": {"thid": "59134bfd-7b2a-49ee-ac42-9a4c310c632b"}, "explain-ltxt": "Error deserializing message: BasicMessage schema validation failed"}`

    MessageContext messageContext = await messageService.SendReceiveAsync(AgentContext, basicMessage, Connection.Record);



**Note**: The Xamarin Edge Agent is able to receive messages from Aca-Py without any issue

Hi,

The DotNet Edge Agent is unable to send a `Connectionless Presentation Message` to the DotNet Verifier Agent. Below is the scenario.

*EA = Edge Agent*

- EA1 creates a `Connectionless Proof Request`
- EA2 scans the Connectionless Proof Request and creates a `PresentationMessage` as below
`ProofRecord record = await proofService.ProcessRequestAsync(agentContext, Proof.RequestPresentationMessage, null);`
`(PresentationMessage presentationMessage, ProofRecord proofRecord) = await proofService.CreatePresentationAsync(agentContext, record.Id, requestedCredentials);
- The state of the `ProofRecord` on EA2 is `Accepted`
- EA2 sends the `PresentationMessage` as below
`ServiceDecorator service = Proof.RequestPresentationMessage.GetDecorator<ServiceDecorator>(DecoratorNames.ServiceDecorator);

    IMessageService messageService = App.Container.Resolve<IMessageService>();
    await messageService.SendAsync(
        agentContext: agentContext,
        message: presentationMessage,
        recipientKey: service.RecipientKeys.First(),
        endpointUri: service.ServiceEndpoint,
        routingKeys: service.RoutingKeys?.ToArray());
`
In the above step, EA2 gets the error "*Failed to send A2A message with an HTTP status code of InternalServerError and content*".

@tomislav, can you advise on the changes I need to make to get it working?
</p>

Hi All,

I have followed and created the mobile wallet by using the below OSMA github link.
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin 

I am able to achieve some of the wallet functionalities successfully but i am unable to find where SQLITE has initialized and stored the wallet details of
 both mediator, mobile wallets ( in OSMA where SQLite has been initialized and handled). I can notice SQLite folder is placed in my local path C:\Users\SRINI\.indy_client\wallet\Edge9aa217732c1f46088304b75b9c26d539
while running the OSMA application. Still I am unable to find the piece of code where it has been initiated. Can anyone help me on this?

I am not familiar with rust but "sodiumoxide = {version = "0.0.16"}" is present in Cargo.toml file in all directories. I hope someone knows how to build postgres-plugin correctly :pray: . Or is there an alternative way to run a dotnet agent with postgres?

Hi,

I want to make the Xamarin Edge Agent an *Issuer* so that it can create Schema and Issue Credentials. Can anyone guide me on the process, please?
If I try to create a Schema, I get the error *Ledger operation rejected*

*Note*: Once the Edge Agent wallet is created, I'm able to get the IssuerDid and IssuerVerKey from the `ProvisioningService`

`await provisioningService.GetProvisioningAsync(agentContext.Wallet)`

@ascatox indy is the library that allows you to manage the wallet. If you are looking to configure the agent that will work over your wallet, this is something akin to a conf file: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/9779eda8bc177f461c32e22fe405b5ec60dc51a3/src/Osma.Mobile.App/App.xaml.cs#L64

Are you sure you have the required write permissions for the ledger? The IssuerDid must be known on the ledger and must have the required permission (e.g. Endorser)
</p>
<p><strong>SahilK 6</strong> (Sat, 08 May 2021 11:38:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes. The IssuerDid of the Edge Agent is assigned the role of an `Endorser` on the Ledger. There is an entry for that on the Ledger.

Mediator Stuck and isn't Updating (sending/receiving messages to mobile agent)

2 Months ago, updated the `Hyperledger.Aries.Routing.Edge` to `1.6.1` from `1.4.0` and last week I noticed that we were getting an error in Presentation Proof, used the older version of agents and were still getting that same error. Noticed, that mediator got stuck and wasn't updating (after every 10 seconds, it route messages to mobile agent from issuer/verifier agent).

Now, using `1.4.0` again and Connections are most of time stuck in Negotiating, Credentials in Requested state e.t.c, and all these issues because of the reason that Mediator stuck and isn't routing messages. 

I only noticed this error in mediator logs few times.

Thanks for your response. I created a `CustomAgentMiddleware`. Now, I receive all the messages (connections, credentials, etc) in the `OnMessageAsync` method.

I want to know if the `CustomAgentMiddleware` needs to process all the messages that it receives, or is there a way to offload the processing of these messages to some other (already existing) module?

I think this is a more general problem with peer dids that currently is not handled by any agent that I'm aware of. If you use public DIDs you can solve the issue, but for peer DIDs you need something like the sync-connection-protocol to update the diddoc https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0030-sync-connection/README.md

I am using Xamarin in the Mobile end for configuring the application, however, when I am not giving any agent image URL it is working fine, however when I am using any agent URL in the mobile wallet, it is not working with the web agent connection, the connection state is remaining in negotiating state and not getting connected. I am posting the code here. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!! @horacionunez

Hello
I'm trying to implement a Web and Mobile Agent.
I want when issuing a document to be able to transmit a file (for example the image of the real document).
I analyzed the library and saw that is possible to add attachment, but I don't see operations that store or process these attachments
I created a issue on github but I don't get any response: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/issues/192
So my question: is it possible to send file attachments, obtain them and extract them later?
Thank you in advance!
</p>
<p><strong>SahilK 6</strong> (Tue, 13 Jul 2021 06:33:10 GMT):<br/>
@RounakGhosh , in case you are connecting to the Aca-Py cloud agent, you may have to check the logs of the Aca-Py cloud agent. Chances are the image from the .NET agent is sent in a different attribute (attachDecorator) and may not be parsed correctly by Aca-Py.

I believe connecting to the .NET agent (Mobile agent-1 connects to Mobile Agent-2) should work fine.

@RounakGhosh ,

I suggest you check the real-time logs of the below

- Connect from one Aca-Py (having a profile image) with another Aca-Py. See the structure of the `ConnectionRequest`
- Connect from one Edge Agent (having a profile image) with Aca-Py. See the structure of the `ConnectionRequest`


I believe you'll find some differences in the way the profile image URL is sent by the Edge Agent and Aca-Py

hi, Is it possible to add images in schema for identity issuance e.g. passport picture?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 15:49:10 GMT):<br/>
Images have been successfully passed, but base64'ing the image. Tricky part is that the parties involved in processing the schema must know it is an image and what to do with it.

Is it possible to set up 1 notification per type of event? if yes how to manage them? 

I'm sorry for these questions but I'm completely lost with this mediator.

<p><strong>SahilK 6</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 06:41:48 GMT):<br/>
@Drilmo , I doubt this can be done. The Mediator Agent cannot read the contents of the payload as the payload is encrypted. All it knows is the source and the recipient of the payload. Hence, you can send a common message for all the events the Mediator Agent receives.

Try this.

```
IWalletRecordService walletRecordService = (IWalletRecordService)Container.Services.GetService(typeof(IWalletRecordService));
            IAgentProvider agentProvider = (IAgentProvider)Container.Services.GetService(typeof(IAgentProvider));
            IAgentContext agentContext = await agentProvider.GetContextAsync();

Hi everyone,

I want to deploy the DotNet Mediator Agent on GCP Cloud Run. I have the below `Dockerfile`. 

```
FROM streetcred/dotnet-indy:1.14.2 AS base
WORKDIR /app

# Expose the default port
EXPOSE 5000

COPY mediator ./mediator
WORKDIR mediator

RUN dotnet restore "MediatorAgent.csproj"
RUN dotnet build "MediatorAgent.csproj" -c Release -o ./build
RUN dotnet publish "MediatorAgent.csproj" -c Release -o ./build
CMD dotnet ./build/MediatorAgent.dll --urls http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

If I create a container on my system, the Mediator Endpoint works fine. However, if I deploy it on GCP Cloud Run, I get the below error

```
Unhandled exception. Hyperledger.Indy.IOException: An IO error occurred.

```

*Can anyone help me with this, please?*

Can anyone suggest what build settings should I use to generate an iOS app for the Hyperledger Aries Xamarin project? I am able to run the app on a simulator, but get errors while release-build for a device.

```

@tomislav , can you advise on this, please?

The Postgres Plugin doesn't work in a Linux Docker Conatiner with the [DotNet Mediator Agent](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-xamarin/tree/main/mediator). The same thing works fine on my MacOS

- I built a project on Mac OS and the output was a `libindystrgpostgres.so` and `libindystrgpostgres.dylib` files.
- I copied the `.dylib` into a Visual Studio Console project and was able to load and invoke the functions of the library using the `DllImport` function. The project works as expected on MacOS
- I copied the project (including the `.so` and `.dylib` files) into a Ubuntu-based Docker container
- When I run the project using `dotnet run`, I get the below error
```
System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'indystrgpostgres' or one of its dependencies. In order to help diagnose loading problems, consider setting the DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES environment variable: dlopen(libindystrgpostgres, 1): image not found

Hello everyone, how is it possible to inform of the deletion of a connection by one of the 2 parties (in order to prevent the mobile that has not deleted the connection to send messages to the mediator to continue to send notifications on the mobile that has deleted this connection for example).
I work with the dotnet framework in last version and the last version of aries-mobile-agent-xamarin.

Hi All,

I am following OSMA application to present my wallet credentials to the verifier through connectionless way(Connectionless Proof Request). In that i am having the fields
like "Predicates and Attributes" and i am trying to present the required attributeCredentials(which contains both predicates and attributes)to the verifier using 
"CreatePresentationAsync()" aries api. Getting "No valid leaving transitions are permitted from state 'Requested' for trigger 'Request'. Consider ignoring the trigger" exception 
while presenting my attributes. Could any one help me on this? How should i send predicates into the presenation api? please refer the attached code for better understanding.

We have problems when connecting from findy-agent (Bob) to dotnet-agent (Acme) i.e. when dotnet-agent is creating the invitation and findy-agent is sending the connection request. The dotnet-agent reports that the connection state is invalid:

```
fail: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel[13]
      Connection id "0HMC4NQT2RHEA", Request id "0HMC4NQT2RHEA:00000001": An unhandled exception was thrown by the application.
Hyperledger.Aries.AriesFrameworkException: Connection state was invalid. Expected 'Negotiating', found 'Invited'
   at Hyperledger.Aries.Features.DidExchange.DefaultConnectionService.CreateResponseAsync(IAgentContext agentContext, String connectionId)
   at DotNet.Backchannel.Controllers.ConnectionController.AcceptRequestAsync(OperationBody body) in /src/Controllers/ConnectionController.cs:line 149
   at 
...
```

Does anyone have idea what would be the cause for this?

Hi,

I am trying to create pool and keep getting an IO error while trying to create a pool.

I have also verified that the android device has the correct permissions to read write files

On Android 30, the application fails. However, with Android 29, it works fine.

```

Does anybody have issues upgrading the Nuget packages to 1.6.3? It seems like the AspNetCore project requires AspNetCore.Contracts to also be 1.6.3 but the nuget repository only has AspNetCore.Contracts 1.6.2. I don't really want to fork off the repository and add all the projects to mine.
