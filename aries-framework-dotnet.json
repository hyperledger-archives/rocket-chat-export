{"msg":"@Drilmo , I doubt this can be done. The Mediator Agent cannot read the contents of the payload as the payload is encrypted. All it knows is the source and the recipient of the payload. Hence, you can send a common message for all the events the Mediator Agent receives.","username":"SahilK 6","ts":"2021-08-19T06:41:48.131Z"}
