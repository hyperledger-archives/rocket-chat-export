Sure! Sounds great. Are you talking about this PR? https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-sdk-java/pull/5/
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 18:52:35 GMT):<br/>
I hadn't seen it until just now.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 18:55:40 GMT):<br/>
I am not a direct maintainer on that folder. I have limited admin capabilities such that I can rename the repo, and I indirectly inherit maintainer rights on the repo because of my membership in a different github team--but I wouldn't normally be vetting contributions.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 18:55:54 GMT):<br/>
Do you want me to merge the PR? Or are you asking for permission to merge it yourself?
</p>
<p><strong>mbanerjee</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 23:35:18 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman - Can I get permission to merge if possible?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 03:23:10 GMT):<br/>
I would be happy to give you that permission, if I can figure out how. What is your github handle?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 06:19:04 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman you can also give me the permission - my github handle is sukalpomitra
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 16:23:44 GMT):<br/>
I have sent an invitation for Sukal to be a maintainer. I would like to send one to @mbanerjee , too--but I need a github handle.

I have also merged the PR.
</p>
<p><strong>mbanerjee</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 18:06:02 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/mbanerje/
</p>
<p><strong>mbanerjee</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 18:06:34 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman  please use "mbanerje" as my github handle 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 21:33:24 GMT):<br/>
Okay, I have sent an invitation to that github ID. Let me know if you receive it.
</p>
<p><strong>mbanerjee</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 00:38:38 GMT):<br/>
I am getting a page not found error when I click on the invitation link.

What is the plan for aries-framework-java? Do you plan to start with the Indy SDK Java Wrapper and then iterate, or to start from scratch?
There are some bugs in the Indy SDK backlog related to the Java wrapper, and we are trying to figure out the right way to handle them.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 20:16:54 GMT):<br/>
Here are the bugs:
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-1349
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-900
We would appreciate your help in figuring out what to do with them.

Hi I am Adrien, I am trying to integrate the lib VCX into an Android app, I have been able to find the prebuilt version here https://repo.sovrin.org/android/libvcx/stable/0.6.1/
But when I try to load I am getting some errors. Can someone help me or direct me to right documentation?
Cheers

@AdrienViolet , I just came across your post by accident (I don't monitor this channel very carefully). Sorry to be slow. My recommendation is that you contact @sergey.minae

<p><strong>AdrienViolet</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 16:54:53 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @danielhardman I have since learned that I should be using the arie framework instead of trying to use the lib VCX but the java one doesn't seems to have a lot of momentum at the moment
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 16:56:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I think the java effort is young compared to the other ones; Java with Indy is much more mature than java with Aries, so far. I'm hoping this will change.

I am building the react-native arise SDK and facing one issue.The issue is, In java whenever we perform any wallet related transaction it's taking too much time to execute that transaction while in iOS it's very less time to execute the same transaction. Is anyone facing same issue? Or may I am doing something wrong while integrating indy SDK in android
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 11:14:43 GMT):<br/>
Hi @ap  Are you referring to the rn-indy-sdk (https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk)? I can't help you with this issue, but if you're still having issues I suggest you either send @jakubkoci a message (he built it),  or ask in the #aries-javascript channel, where he is more active.

is this still active? I saw there was some activity in the repo recently https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-sdk-java
why is this called SDK and not framework? just comparing with the other repositories and languages
