@ajayjadhav @sudeshrshetty it looks like building the web hook demo docker image wasnâ€™t included as a dependency of that make target.

You need to pass search parameters, right now we support filtering based on `state`, other search criteria will be available soon.

I know it's a lot to ask for, but when can we expect a getting-started developer guide for Aries just like Indy? Although, I must say that the Go Docs are so far impressive, but it requires a lot of time to decode and build a prototype on top of that.
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Thu, 28 Nov 2019 11:56:12 GMT):<br/>
*"Bob"* sends an *invitation* to *"Alice"* using *"CreateInvitation"*.  *"Alice"* sends *"HandleConnection"* & *"GetConnection"* requests. Upon querying **(connection).ConnectionRecord.State*, I get *"Invited"*. How can *Alice* accept this inviation using *"AcceptInvitation"*?

What is the difference between creating two clients using the same context and using different contexts for both?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 20:53:48 GMT):<br/>
@priyashankar using same context for two clients means sharing the context between the two clients.. for instance if your context has a storage reference, the underlying storage will be used by both clients... it also depends on what kind of info you have in the context... but as a rule of thumb, don't use the same context for two clients representing two agents and they should not share contexts
</p>

Hi Everyone. Was made aware today of some BDD definitions in aries-framework-go, https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/tree/master/test/bdd/features
Good stuff, pleased to see it. I am in the initial stages of expanding the test harness with BDD/Gherkin for the aries-cloudagent-python AIP 1.0.0 protocols implemented. It may be a good idea for us to collaborate a little. It would be nice to have a common standard set of tests for the protocols between projects. Maybe even standards on tags used, references, feature definitions, etc in the Feature files. 
Question: I notice some of the Gherkin is not complete, ie. doesn't include When or Then or both. Is there a reason for this or was it just a quick way to use BDD to drive the tests not caring about format? 
Thanks and nice to meet you guys. 
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 21:39:53 GMT):<br/>
@sheldon.regular nice to meet you too, looks we didn't follow BDD/Gherkin format strictly in some feature files. We are in the process of correcting it. Thanks for noticing it and bringing it to our attention.

My primary reason to connect here was not to point out any lacking Gherkin, but more to make you aware that I'm here, doing similar things, and would like to collaborate in some way, if only at the feature file level. I'll be checking back and referencing your BDD when I get further along.

Hi everyone, I tried aca-py with von-network, play around with aries-framework-dotnet example.I would like to understand more how aries-framework-go run as a DIDComm Router/Mediator. Since I am not understand how to setup them.  Any runnable sample I can  go for a further study ? Thank you.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 21:23:40 GMT):<br/>
@CyrilLeung Awesome. @rolsonquadras has now posted instructions on how to perform DID Exchange via Routers using the REST API: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/master/docs/rest/openapi_demo.md#steps-for-didexchange-through-didcomm-routers

(you can use the OpenAPI/Swagger docker-compose environment: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/master/docs/rest/openapi_demo.md#setup)

But I come across building error in sidetree during "make run-openapi-demo"

I had go through  "Run OpenAPI demo", I can run  the steps in  "Steps for DIDExchange" and "Steps for DIDExchange through DIDComm Routers" successfully and make my concept in using router agent much clear. 

But in "Steps for custom message handling" after register-service  in a alice agent, and I move on to bob agent to send message in raise error 

{"code":3003,"message":"failed to send msg using outbound transport: received unsuccessful POST HTTP status from agent [http://alice.aries.example.com:8081, 500 Internal Server Error]"}

Is anything I setup incorrectly ?

Thank you very much for the update, I can test "register service request" successfully. But I have a question, when I check out the "checktopics" in webhook, the return record like the following, that is no content sent by BOB, is it normal ? or feature is under development ?

Aries Framework Go 0.1.2 released. Notes: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/releases/tag/v0.1.2
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 18:17:53 GMT):<br/>
I also found the problem pulling sidetree, like @CyrilLeung . Funny that the open-api demo worked fine 3 weeks ago, but not after pulling latest code today. It is not clear to me how to get past this by using the Actions and theGITHUB_TOKEN instead.  @rolsonquadras  Is there a way we can do that? Or would that require a change in the Makefile or other framework setup? Is it recommended just to create a personal token?
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 20:04:06 GMT):<br/>
Any ideas what am I missing?
I created a new personal token with basic permissions of only:    dockerimagesgithub â€” read:packages 
and successfully executed:  docker login -u scottz64 -p dockerimagesgithub docker.pkg.github.com
However,  "make run-openapi-demo" still fails.
I edited and updated the token to add write:packages and all repo permissions too, did another docker login and tried the demo again, but no luck. I did not regenerate the token; just updated it.
```Pulling sidetree (docker.pkg.github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-mock/sidetree:amd64-0.1.2)...
ERROR: unauthorized: Your request could not be authenticated by the GitHub Packages service. Please ensure your access token is valid and has the appropriate scopes configured.```
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 20:20:01 GMT):<br/>
Hi @scottz . Using personal token would work for me locally. The error says not able to read from the github packages due to authentication issues. Can you try to pull the docker image directly just to rule out issue with aries-framework-go?  "docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-mock/sidetree:amd64-0.1.2"
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 20:22:16 GMT):<br/>
"docker login -u scottz64 -p dockerimagesgithub docker.pkg.github.com"  --> looks like you used token name rather than the token value.
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 20:22:56 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 20:27:17 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. docker pull on command line gave same error. OK, I tried login again with token value; yes I had used the tokenname instead! That was the problem. It works now. Just needed another pair of eyes on it. Thanks!

Is the "POST /verifiable/credential" API working on the open-api demo? Maybe my format is wrong, but I cannot get anything to work. It expects a string for a name, and a string for the VC. But the VC is a complex structure. How should this work?

I do not see any code that encrypts the data (e.g. verifiable credentials) as is exhibited by ctx.Crypto().Encrypt() in the framework_test.go, before calling store.Put() to save it. Maybe I missed something? Is there a design reason for that omission?

Hi Folks...  I'm trying to respond to an Offer Proposal action event but I need to find out who the Issuer is.  This seems pretty fundamental but I can't figure out where that info is.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 15:01:27 GMT):<br/>
I have the same question for the Request Credential action event.  My business logic needs to know who is on the other end of these messages.  With Issue Credential, I can decode the raw credential from the attachment and get the issuer, but I don't know what the expectation is with these earlier messages.
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 16:30:22 GMT):<br/>
Looking thru the route protocol service I see the use of the ActionEvent Properties field to add a protocol specific property which contains TheirDID().
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 16:30:28 GMT):<br/>
Seems like the same is needed here?
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 16:35:30 GMT):<br/>
I can create an issue and submit a PR to fix this if that is appropriate.

@pfeairheller 
RequestCredential is a message sent by the potential Holder to the Issuer,
to request the issuance of a credential. Where circumstances do not require
a preceding Offer Credential message (e.g., there is no cost to issuance
that the Issuer needs to explain in advance, and there is no need for cryptographic negotiation),
this message initiates the protocol.

<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 13:07:53 GMT):<br/>
@pfeairheller would having `myDID` and `theirDID` in the `service.DIDCommAction` satisfy your use case?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 13:10:43 GMT):<br/>
ie. they can be added direction to the DIDCommAction, no need for properties.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 13:11:03 GMT):<br/>
please create an issue
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 22:02:59 GMT):<br/>
@george.aristy Yes that would be perfect.  And I imagine helpful for other protocols as well.  Seems that message correlation is often needed when applying business logic to these protocols.

@soluchok I have read the spec (several times) and I understand the meaning of these messages.  I'm trying to correlate the occurrences and issuance of these early  stage messages so I can understand who is responding to one I've sent.

Hi I read this in the Aries developer course in edx.org regarding the go framework. "Whatâ€™s unique about this framework is that it is written entirely in golang without any non-golang dependencies. That means that the framework can take advantage of the rich golang ecosystem and distribution mechanisms. That also means the framework does not embed the indy-sdk (libindy) and as such does not support connections to Indy ledgers or the Indy verifiable credentials exchange model. Instead, the team is building support for other ledgers and other verifiable credential models. " Is this a true statement i.e. go cannot connect to Indy ledger? What other ledger does it connect to now and what other verifiable credential exchange model will it support?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 18:53:26 GMT):<br/>
@dl2017 this is correct. the go framework supports a pluggable interface for DID ledgers and has implemented the W3C verifiable credential data model.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 18:53:50 GMT):<br/>
out-of-the-box, you can configure the https binding for DID resolution (e.g., https://uniresolver.io).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 18:54:47 GMT):<br/>
for example, our team uses a Hyperledger Fabric implementation of the Sidetree protocol as a DID ledger.

Another question. I've a JWT VC (not created with Aries Go)  and I frankly tried to post it to the /verifiable/credential/validate endpoint. I'm getting `{"code":6001,"message":"validate vc : decode new credential: public key fetcher is not defined"}` What does that mean? 
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 18:29:43 GMT):<br/>
It's actually not a fully compliant VC (credentialSubject) missing, but I don't think thats the issue here JWT: eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6d2ViOmFjbWUuaWlsLm5ldHdvcmsja2V5LTEiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJkaWQ6d2ViOmFjbWUuaWlsLm5ldHdvcmsiLCJpc3MiOiJkaWQ6d2ViOmFjbWUuaWlsLm5ldHdvcmsiLCJ2YyI6eyJ0eXBlIjpbIlZlcmlmaWFibGVDcmVkZW50aWFsIiwiTWFzdGVyRGF0YUNyZWRlbnRpYWwiXSwiQGNvbnRleHQiOlsiaHR0cHM6XC9cL3d3dy53My5vcmdcLzIwMThcL2NyZWRlbnRpYWxzXC92MSIsImh0dHBzOlwvXC9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tXC9paWwtbmV0d29ya1wvY29udGV4dHNcL21hc3RlclwvbWFzdGVyZGF0YS5qc29uIl19LCJpYXQiOjE1OTA2Nzc4MzF9.ADdIP6lyPm0-NgM1Jupp83o9M4CC0mHfO6bycWkSfaG7lMlyWjUUmbdjsf_CA-mA-NxLBvQIyVODu5NVDj0yDw

Hi everyone, I am testing openapi-demo with guideline writing on "Steps for DIDExchange through DIDComm Routers"

1. Create an invitation from carl router
2. Run receive inviation in carl agent
3. Register router in carl agent, but I get an error 
{"code":5002,"message":"router registration : send route request: wrong format did input: "}

So I would like to know did I test in a incorrect way , and what should I do to register the router. Thank you

Hi @george.aristy , Just getting started with this project and wanted to understand few things. 
For issuing a VC in Indy based solution, we first have to define schema and a cred-def.
How the process of credential issuance works in aries go framework? Hope it supports exchange of VCs between two agents.
Basically I am looking to build a simple Alice/Faber like solution in which credentials and proofs can be exchanges and verified using Hyperledger Fabric as the blockchain ledger.

Hey, we are interested in adding support for Ethereum/HL Besu. But I want to first clarify what information does Aries-Go store on the ledger:

- Afaiu, Aries-Go uses W3C JSON-LD proof VCs, so I don't assume credential schemas, definitions and the revocation registry is stored on the ledger. Is this correct?

- Afaiu, did:trustbloc is the primary public DID method. Are these DIDs used per default for the issuer of the Verifiable Credentials? 

- Does Aries-Go support linked secrets, or do you use public DIDs as the subject of Verifiable Credentials?

- Does every ledger interaction go through VDRI?

- Should we move this conversation to Github instead ;) ?

@o.terbu 

1. Correct - no shemas nor revocations on the ledger... yet
2. We recently started issuing credentials with `did:peer` as well
3. The framework does not support indy linked secrets yet. The framework has produced VCs with did:key, did:trustbloc, and did:peer as the subject.
4. Yes
5. probably :)

We have submitted PR to indy-vdr for a go wrapper for libindy-vdr as a shared C library.  We have build a VDRI for aries-go using that wrapper to resolve DIDs against any indy network.  Is this something aries-go would accept as a PR or is the desire for this framework to remain written entirely in golang without any external dependencies?

Can anyone point me to a spec for how RFC 0036 (Issue Credential) and RFC 0037 (Present Proof) are implemented with W3C LD-Proof-based Verifiable Credentials and Presentations in Aries Go? My expectation is that they will deviate a bit from the aforementioned RFCs.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 11:46:15 GMT):<br/>
@o.terbu our upcoming release will implement present-proof v2 and issue-credential v2. Godocs aren't up yet so I'm pointing you to examples in code:

* present-proof v2: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/master/pkg/client/presentproof/example_test.go#L108
* issue-credential v2: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/master/pkg/client/issuecredential/example_test.go#L107

Those packages are designed to be agnostic to the contents in the attachments.

We're using them extensively with our `verifiable` package that has extensive support for JSONLD and JWT formats of VCs: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/tree/master/pkg/doc/verifiable

Hi folks.  I think I've hit a bug, but I wanted to check before opening an issue.  I'm working with the latest from master.   I have 2 agents running and connected and agent1 begins a the issue-credential protocol by calling SendOffer to send an offer for a credential to agent2.  In agent2, I receive the following error: `doHandle err: invalid state transition: offer-sent -> offer-received`.  Looking at the code I see that the issuecredential Service `nextState` method offers up `offerReceived` as the next state instance for the offer-credential message type but the `CanTransitionTo` method of `offerSent` does not allow the transition.  At first I thought it was a bug and that the transition had to be added, but then I got similar errors on `credential-issued -> credential-received` and `request-sent -> request-received`.  Adding the appropriate names to the `CanTransitionTo` methods fixed everything and the agent can now successfully exchange a credential.  It looks like `proposal-sent -> proposal-received` will also be an issue but I have verified that yet.  Am I doing something really stupid or is this an issue I should create and submit a PR for?
</p>
<p><strong>soluchok</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 21:42:00 GMT):<br/>
@pfeairheller offer-sent is an issuer's a state, offer-received is a holder's state. Make sure you are sending a message to another agent.

I was finally getting my act together to submit the indy vdri implementation this weekend and a question occurred to me.  Besides this vdri, we also have a MongoDB datastore implementation as well as an inbound transport for AMQP.  Has any thought been put into maintaining these types of add-ons in separate repos?  The thought being that the core maintainers of the framework would not have to carry the added baggage forward but these add-ons would still be available to the community.  I'm happy to submit them to aries-framework-go if there is interest but wanted to raise this question first.

In the V2 issue-credential rfc, the request-credential message has a couple of options for the `requests~attach` listed, specifically the result from`indy_prover_create_credential_req` call for Indy credentials.   However there is no `WithRequestCredential` option for continuing the DIDComm action with a custom request-credential message.  Indeed in `states.go` the framework generates a request-credential message  with the attachments from the incoming offer by default.  Again, I wanted to check here to make sure I'm not missing anything obvious before reporting a bug.

Thanks for the reply @soluchok.  I do not understand how I could use middleware to accomplish this.  The `Metadata` interface does not provide access to a `RequestCredential` message as it does for offer, propose and issue.  So I'm not sure how I could change a request-credential in middleware.  As a matter of fact, the comment for each of the funcs states "...is pointer to the message provided by the user through the Continue function" which is what I wanted to accomplish with the `WithRequestCredential` in the first place.

<p><strong>Vid201</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 08:16:24 GMT):<br/>
Or I can just run sidetree-fabric instead of sidetree-mock?

Hello there. I am trying to perform a did_exhange connection between a aries-go and and aries-python agents.
</p>
<p><strong>AngelPalomares</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 10:31:33 GMT):<br/>

In order to do I tried 2 different ways: aries-go->aries-python and aries-python-aries-go

Hello there, I am doing a did_exchange using a web agent with a mobile but when I am using the local agent in the mobile development, when the web agent tries  to connect with the mobile  agent (e.g. accept_request), I have the following error: ```
ERROR command=[didexchange] action=[AcceptExchangeRequest] [connectionID=[b1cc9ac7-e2bd-4940-a73a-45bb3fc0b7aa]] errMsg=[did exchange client - accept exchange request: failed to execute state action 'responded': outboundDispatcher.Send: no transport found for serviceEndpoint: didcomm:transport/queue]
``` . I guess that this is because when creating the local agent on the mobile I haven't defined the serviceEnpoint correctly. I have tried with different options (defining websockectURL, addHttpResolver, etc) but not succesfully. COuld you please help me with this issue? Thx in advance

Hello,  firstly thank you very much for new version. I have tried and I am able to integrate the new notifier future and it works very well. However after acepting a did_exchange invitation, when the server side tries to connect with the mobile I have the following error:`[aries-framework/controller/did-exchange] 2020/09/22 10:07:49 UTC - n/a -> ERROR command=[didexchange] action=[AcceptExchangeRequest] [connectionID=[1802efbf-ab7e-4275-95c0-0fae7b74421d]] errMsg=[did exchange client - accept exchange request: failed to execute state action 'responded': outboundDispatcher.Send: no transport found for serviceEndpoint: didcomm:transport/queue]

There isn't an example in aries-framework-go for setting up sidetree-fabric. In the TrustBloc sandbox repo, there is a BDD feature defined that sets up sidetree-fabric: https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-sandbox/blob/master/test/bdd/features/setupfabric.feature
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:13:49 GMT):<br/>
I haven't given a lot of thought to separate aries-*-go repos. There is always a balance to be achieved when discussing a repo strategy.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:32:11 GMT):<br/>
I would think an aries-framework-go VDR for Indy should be available to the community (thanks for these efforts). It's also true that the framework maintainers would find it difficult to maintain a VDR for each ledger or storage that comes about.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:35:40 GMT):<br/>
btw - on the storage-side, we are working on an approach to enable a generic REST interface to the (remote) storage tier via the DIF SDS/EDV spec. This would enable plugging in remote storage without requiring direct framework integration ... similar to the capability we have for DIDs via the HTTP resolver.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:36:58 GMT):<br/>
Of course, like with DIDs, both direct framework integration and the REST interface would both be available for storage.
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:38:22 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense...  for our use case, it makes sense to use the direct integration but I see the value of the REST interface.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:39:09 GMT):<br/>
yup - we have cases for direct integration as well. (and also for REST via EDV).
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:47:27 GMT):<br/>
would it make sense to add this to the agenda for the next contributors call?  I am planning on attending it.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 15:46:41 GMT):<br/>
Guessing you need to connect the agent to a mediator. cc: @soluchok

I guess I have two questions re issue-credential v2 (RFC 0453)

1. Do you intend to use the preview-credential with LDS/LD-Proof-based VCs as well? In that case there is a lot of room for interpretation.

2. How do you provide the W3C Verifiable Presentation in the request-credential message in case a presentation_definition was included in the credential-offer (if format = dif/credential-manifest@v1.0)? The current issue-credential v2 spec uses the DIF Credential Manifest to allow the issuer to tell the holder what information is required. I don't see how one could use the Credential Manifest for including the Verifiable Presentation. Is this a typo in the issue-credential v2 spec?

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 18:45:23 GMT):<br/>
I think the request can be summarized as to create a curated aries-framework-go add-ons repository that contains code as such as additional VDRs, storage, etc. that is pluggable into the aries-framework-go interfaces. The framework would not have a dependency on that new repo.

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 19:34:30 GMT):<br/>
I think this add-ons repo would be effectively styled as a mono repo - where we have a go.mod for each add-on
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 19:36:38 GMT):<br/>
That all sounds right to me.

</p>
<p><strong>AngelPalomares</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 08:13:30 GMT):<br/>
In any case Won't I will have the same problem but now from the mediator to the mobile instead from the agent server to the mobile? :-/
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 18:59:55 GMT):<br/>
There isn't much documentation but you can start here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/master/docs/didcomm_mediator.md
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 19:00:27 GMT):<br/>
The connection between agent and mediator is over WebSockets so duplex communication is enabled.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 19:00:27 GMT):<br/>
The connection between agent and mediator is over WebSockets which enables the agent to receive the messages via the mediator endpoint.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:08:39 GMT):<br/>
We discussed the addon/extension repository on the Aries WG Call B today. The outcome was that it is okay to create a repo. Let the name bikeshedding begin.
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:16:03 GMT):<br/>
aries-framework-go-extension or  aries-framework-go-ext -> as we are building extension to the orginal repo. Also, this lines up nicely with aries-framework-go (closer alphabetically - which is the default(most of the cases) sort result).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:17:11 GMT):<br/>
Also if we decide to split out the core/common packages (like DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, ...), what would be a good repo name for that?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:20:04 GMT):<br/>
`aries-framework-go-core` I guess makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:21:38 GMT):<br/>
`aries-framework-go-ext` is shorter than extension suffix... I'd vote for it
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:21:38 GMT):<br/>
`aries-framework-go-ext` suggested by @rolsonquadras is shorter than with extension suffix... I'd vote for it
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:21:59 GMT):<br/>
aries-framework-go-extension / aries-framework-go-addon --> I agree with @rolsonquadras regarding naming convention
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:23:21 GMT):<br/>
Beyond the name, we should also discuss the folder hierarchy of the extension repo.
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:23:47 GMT):<br/>
I would go for 'hyperledger/aries-framework-go-extension' glueing together all the components (one repo - many go.mod files).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:24:16 GMT):<br/>
E.g., where would an Indy VDR and a Mongo store provider sit in the folder hierarchy. Assume that each of those is its own go.mod in the extension monorepo.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:25:54 GMT):<br/>
I think we might also consider moving other non-default packages over there too (that aren't need for out-of-the-box hyperledger docker images, wasm, and gomobile builds).
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:26:13 GMT):<br/>
for VDRIs, aries-framework-go has them in pkg/vdri/.... so Indy VDR would follow the same path, ie `pkg/vdri/indy`
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:27:12 GMT):<br/>
aries-framework-go-extension/store, aries-framework-go-extension/vdri, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:27:13 GMT):<br/>
and likewise for MongoDB.. it would go in `pkg/storage/mongodb`
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:27:17 GMT):<br/>
The repo should be considered a monorepo.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:27:34 GMT):<br/>
no top-level go.mod
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:27:41 GMT):<br/>
yep, that sounds right.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:27:45 GMT):<br/>
ok, Thant that won't work
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:27:45 GMT):<br/>
ok, then that won't work
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:27:45 GMT):<br/>
aries-framework-go-extension/store/mongodb, aries-framework-go-extension/vdri/indy
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:27:45 GMT):<br/>
actual code base can go in - aries-framework-go-extension/store/mongodb, aries-framework-go-extension/vdri/indy
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:28:04 GMT):<br/>
something/storage/mongodb/go.mod
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:28:11 GMT):<br/>
because we lose the package path in the name
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:28:25 GMT):<br/>
something/vdri/indy/go.mod
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:28:25 GMT):<br/>
and presumably something/vdri/indy/go.mod
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:28:25 GMT):<br/>
I.e., something/vdri/indy/go.mod
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:28:25 GMT):<br/>
something/vdri/indy/go.mod
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:28:41 GMT):<br/>
I would also imagine something/vdri/indy/pkg/foo
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:28:41 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:30:08 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:30:14 GMT):<br/>
addons, extensions, providers, components
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:31:21 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty I like "providers" as well along with "extensions".
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:31:25 GMT):<br/>
httpbinding, key and peer VDRIs are single end packages (no children), I wonder if Indy VDR would have children packages
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:32:03 GMT):<br/>
View each of these folders like its own repo that happens to be in the larger mono-repo.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:32:21 GMT):<br/>
yeah, ok
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:33:38 GMT):<br/>
I think "providers" is a generic word for a service provider ... we're talking about framework `addons` more specifically
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:36:05 GMT):<br/>
I'd lean towards `addons` or `extensions`

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:38:50 GMT):<br/>
I think `addons` was the top level package in the new repo
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:39:29 GMT):<br/>
that would be a folder not a package.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:39:35 GMT):<br/>
oh @sudeshrshetty suggested
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:39:35 GMT):<br/>
oh @sudeshrshetty suggested `aries-framework-go-addon`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:39:45 GMT):<br/>
yeah, a top level folder
</p>
<p><strong>DerekTrider</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 21:06:12 GMT):<br/>
I also agree with @rolsonquadras regarding the "extension/addon" part being after "go"... e.g. aries-framework-go-extension
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 21:16:30 GMT):<br/>
example:
aries-framework-go-ext/extensions/storage/mongodb/go.mod
  or 
aries-framework-go-ext/addons/storage/mongodb/go.mod
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Oct 2020 14:24:31 GMT):<br/>
So far the main suggestion for the repo name is aries-framework-go-ext unless someone has a catchy abbreviation for framework-go :).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Oct 2020 14:25:43 GMT):<br/>
(the acapy abbreviation enabled aries-acapy-controllers and aries-acapy-plugin-toolbox repo names)
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 11:11:42 GMT):<br/>
If we could rename it framework-aries-go then we could abbreviate to `fargo`  :-)

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 15:52:32 GMT):<br/>
The current thinking is that the core framework repo will focus on supporting extension integration AND have a limited out-of-the-box for REST services (KMS, EDV, DID resolution) along with support for "local" databases (currently the native build with levelDB and the WASM build with indexDB) and for the "core" DID methods (currently did:peer, did:key) and the "local" KMS.

But it would be removed from aries-framework-go rather than switched.

Basically the concept is that you have two options for extended storage - use an EDV that has that storage and configure the REST API OR have your own build that includes the framework and injects the extended storage of your choice.

Hi everyone, I have a question about the open api demo.
In "accept-request-presentation", there is a payload required to encode before made the reqest.

FYI: aries-framework-go will get soon get a support of *BBS+ signature suite* (https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020) what includes support of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The implementation will be compliant with https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs (my Mattr). The estimation of the first release is the end of October.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:33:28 GMT):<br/>
@kdimak : @pfeairheller & team are also working on BBS+ features. Perhaps you folks could compare notes? All of us would like BBS+ in as soon as we can (and tested for interop).
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:38:46 GMT):<br/>
Hi @kdimak.  We would love to set up a conversation about how we can work together on this.  We have one full time engineer dedicated to this effort.
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:49:33 GMT):<br/>
Hi @pfeairheller . Nice to hear, let's move things forward together!
In brief, we are using https://github.com/kilic/bls12-381 as a base library, but also use https://github.com/phoreproject/bls for ~FR~ calculations which are not implemented in bls12-381.
We consider https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/tree/master/libzmix/bbs as a reference of BLS+BLS12-381 implementation, and https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs (Mattr) as a reference of BBS+ signature one.
I am gonna make soon a first PR in aries-framework-go which will support VC/VP signature verification (BbsBlsSignature2020) generated by Mattr. I will post the link to this PR later on (as it's still WIP). Further plans:
- VC/VP BBS+ signature signing
- BSS+ signature suite interop tests (with Mattr)
- BSS+ selective disclosure
</p>

Hi @MALodder ! I am really happy to meet you! I recently looked a lot through your Rust code at `libursa`! :)
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:58:44 GMT):<br/>
We are also using the `ursa` Rust code as the reference implementation
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 14:00:54 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I saw your PR https://github.com/kilic/bls12-381/pull/15, we make use of it here: https://github.com/trustbloc/bls12-381/pull/1
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 14:01:00 GMT):<br/>
What `Fr` calculations are not in kilic
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 14:01:35 GMT):<br/>
You can use `math.big` mod Q
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 14:01:58 GMT):<br/>
We can get Q from G1.Q

</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 14:15:50 GMT):<br/>
Hello @tarkochevamik ! I believe you forked it and did some enhancements. What's available there for now? Can you share it with us?
</p>
<p><strong>tarkochevamik</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 14:19:43 GMT):<br/>
I updated `proofChallenge.go` to fix a compile error but it looks like we'll need to make the fields in the structs public. Based on what I was doing I though it would be best to keep all core operations outlined in the Mattr doc in go-bbs-signatures but am curious on your thoughts of where they should live?
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 14:25:52 GMT):<br/>
yeah, makes sense
I would also add API for signing and verification, as well as for the generation of selective disclosure. Maybe this could be deemed as the reference for the API: https://github.com/mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures/blob/master/native/src/lib.rs
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 14:27:29 GMT):<br/>

Since I try to use the data provided and encode to base64, that is not the same with the hash mention in the document.

@kdimak Do you have a list of features that are needed in @MALodder BBS+ implementation (but aren't there yet)? It would be nice to remove these forked dependencies once things are working.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:06:05 GMT):<br/>
(forked dependencies being github.com/kilic/bls12-381 and github.com/phoreproject/bls)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:06:51 GMT):<br/>
the main dependency is a bls12-381 library
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:07:23 GMT):<br/>
(forked at https://github.com/trustbloc/bls12-381 and https://github.com/trustbloc/bls)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:07:39 GMT):<br/>
the kilic library is the one I prefer
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:08:20 GMT):<br/>
that's the only dependecy
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:08:40 GMT):<br/>
no others
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:09:39 GMT):<br/>
@kdimak made these changes in bls12-381 (fork): https://github.com/trustbloc/bls12-381/pull/1 and https://github.com/trustbloc/bls12-381/pull/2
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:11:13 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:11:22 GMT):<br/>
right, that's it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:11:43 GMT):<br/>
BBS+ uses Blakeb instead of SHA256
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:12:01 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder Would aspects of the above would we replace with your code?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:13:01 GMT):<br/>
not sure what you mean
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:14:30 GMT):<br/>
Oh - I thought you had some code to use as a starting point. I wasn't sure which aspects you had.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:14:38 GMT):<br/>
for the BBS+ yes

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:17:45 GMT):<br/>
Ah ok. So you had a fork of bls12-381 that isn't available anymore (i assume difference was https://github.com/kilic/bls12-381/pull/15).

So if I understand properly:
- we should continue with kilic/bls12-381.
- try to get the PRs into that upstream (or otherwise figure out the fork strategy).
- what about the other bls dependency (from phoreproject)? do we need both?
- see if there is code from go-bbs-signatures that can be incorporated.

<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:24:56 GMT):<br/>
my two cents, I was expecting `go-bbs-signatures` to be what`aries-framework-go` used for BBS+ related operations, and that any work done would ultimately come back to that repo under the stewardship of @MALodder ?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:25:18 GMT):<br/>
I'm fine either way
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:25:34 GMT):<br/>
I haven't had much time to develop go-bbs-signatures lately
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:25:58 GMT):<br/>
But most likely you will be the point of reference/guidance for folks implementing it
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:26:03 GMT):<br/>
that was my main rational
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:26:12 GMT):<br/>
I think it would be nice to push the code into aries-framework-go (if we can) to reduce dependencies.
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:26:48 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I think it's a balance, there may be use for `go-bbs-signatures` outside of aries (I appreciate aries is our main concern though)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:27:49 GMT):<br/>
Similar with the Verifiable Credential, DIDs, JSON-LD signatures libraries that are already in the framework codebase :).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:29:26 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/tree/master/pkg/doc
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:30:07 GMT):<br/>
yeah, very true.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:30:28 GMT):<br/>
This is basically happening since it is nice to have this code under hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:38:26 GMT):<br/>
To clarify, I think if `kilic/bls12-381` is a dependency for `go-bbs-signatures` then that should be managed inside of `go-bbs-signatures`, not `aries-framework-go` that way if `go-bbs-signatures` decides to switch from `kilic/bls12-381` to `trustbloc/bls12-381` it doesn't impact aries, but is work done inside of `go-bbs` that's my only thought
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:39:00 GMT):<br/>
we're ( @tarkochevamik ) happy to support  the efforts anyway we can
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:40:25 GMT):<br/>
We would probably consider bringing that fork into an internal folder of this repo (if we cannot get PRs into the upstream).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:43:17 GMT):<br/>
I am concerned that @MALodder PR didn't make progress there: https://github.com/kilic/bls12-381/pull/15
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:43:45 GMT):<br/>
it didn't it sat there for a long time
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:45:10 GMT):<br/>
fork bls12-381 under hyper ledger? last changes were four months ago, and I think we all agree things will be moving fairly fast?
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:45:23 GMT):<br/>
or is that what the trustbloc fork is?
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:46:15 GMT):<br/>
ah ok  it is.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:47:55 GMT):<br/>
"fork bls12-381" - this would be an internal folder like aries-framework-go/internal/github.com/kilic/bls12-381
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:47:55 GMT):<br/>
"fork bls12-381" - this would be an internal folder in the form of aries-framework-go/internal/github.com/kilic/bls12-381

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:50:53 GMT):<br/>
and hopefully @kdimak can discuss if he thinks it is possible to remove the other dependency on phoreproject/bls
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:15:07 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I think we can remove dependency on phoreproject/bls, the only important thing we use from this lib is FR type ()
</p>

<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:16:22 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder already explained that we can use math.big mod Q and get Q from G1.Q
I have not checked this yet though, but I saw smth in `go-bbs-signatures`
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:17:49 GMT):<br/>
I checked BBS+ signature verification path so far, and I found one discrepancy between `kilic/bls12-381` and `URSA` algorithms.
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:18:55 GMT):<br/>
It's in `HashToCurve()` function. I think we will need help from @MALodder in this matter.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:19:20 GMT):<br/>
kliic library supports this
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:19:35 GMT):<br/>
yeah, bjt
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:19:35 GMT):<br/>
yeah, but it generates G1 points which do not pass the signature check later on

<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:25:14 GMT):<br/>
if we use `swuMapG1()` from kilic, different G1 point is returned and later the signature verification fails (on 2 pair comparison)

</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:25:41 GMT):<br/>
to recall, HashToCurve is used to generate h0, hi
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:26:07 GMT):<br/>
that's interesting because I've used the kilic library to hash to curve for other crypto signatures like BLS and it works just fine
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:27:22 GMT):<br/>
yeah
I don't know the internals of these algorithms so your help @MALodder should save the world :)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:28:24 GMT):<br/>
I suspect what is going on is that https://github.com/kilic/bls12-381/blob/master/hash_to_field.go#L9 is wrong
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:28:42 GMT):<br/>
outLen should be dependent on the curve
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:29:02 GMT):<br/>
double checking
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:37:30 GMT):<br/>
in your PR (), you are using
```
	h := f()
	lenPerElm := h.Size() * 2
	lenInBytes := count * lenPerElm
	randBytes := expandMsgXMD(f, msg, domain, lenInBytes)
```

but `lenInBytes` differs from the value we get in `URSA` (two times bigger value)...
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:39:39 GMT):<br/>
we should probably use `lenPerElm := h.Size()` here...
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:40:46 GMT):<br/>
but this change breaks existent kilic tests where default `sha256` hash is used
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 18:12:34 GMT):<br/>
my PR is incorrect. If you look at the hash to curve spec lenPerElm is supposed to be based on the curve, not the hash size
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 18:13:13 GMT):<br/>
so hard coding it to 64 is just fine
</p>
<p><strong>kdimak</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 21:13:52 GMT):<br/>
OK! it's what we have now here: https://github.com/trustbloc/bls12-381/blob/ba2e87ef05efdd119a162c62f32c98a491587847/hash_to_field.go#L8

<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 14:25:57 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda reading the issue on proposed structure, I think the global check around license/DCO is appropriate

I was imagining the rest of the checks would be a per `component` basis, just like codecov / release versioning etc will probably be easiest to handle on a per component basis? 
Does it make sense for each component to have it's own "job" in the github action work flow and allow them to be more or less independently built/tested/release?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 14:57:28 GMT):<br/>
@m00sey From my PoV, the principle is that component modules must have tests that are required to pass when files in that module directory are changed. We should not run tests for unchanged modules.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 14:57:53 GMT):<br/>
I think module tests should be as self-contained as possible.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 14:58:05 GMT):<br/>
I think there is an interesting question about testing the common interface for a component.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:01:15 GMT):<br/>
I'm not entirely sure if codecov supports the monorepo style or not - certainly it supports patch level checks regardless.

</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:19:42 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda Here are my thoughts - If don't have any common code between modules, then job for each module makes more sense. Also, I prefer if it can be run for all the codebase in that module, sometime code changes affect unchanged code as well. If we have common code (like top level /pkg/), then I feel its better to run globally. Changes in common code might affect unchanged code in each module. In short, if we have common code then run global checks/test, else have module specific jobs.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:21:14 GMT):<br/>
@rolsonquadras I meant run tests for the entire module but not for other unchanged modules.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:22:41 GMT):<br/>
We don't yet have top-level common code (at /pkg/) - that would have its own considerations.
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:22:50 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda oh ok, that makes sense. I guess, then the question is whether we gonna have common code for modules.

<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:23:07 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:27:13 GMT):<br/>
(my opinion) anything in this repo shouldn't have shared code.

My mental model is that this repo is an umbrella, under which reside components I can pick and choose which to use. 
So versioning/building/testing all happens at the component level.

So while I may clone `aries-framework-go-ext` I would use it via `go get github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/storage/mongo@v0.1.0`

However I've never tried to build a repo in such a way so it may not be feasible to structure it that way? :)
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:27:30 GMT):<br/>
Also, my mental model may be incorrect :)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:28:11 GMT):<br/>
You would use that command, but the tag is global to the repo.
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:35:54 GMT):<br/>
The problem with that is if bump mongo to 0.1.0, someone else bumps vdr-indy to 0.2.0, I bump mongo to 0.3.0 but I want to keep vdr-indy at 0.1.0 code, I can't.

That was my point about versioning at the component level, which should be viable with a go.mod at each component
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:36:15 GMT):<br/>
@m00sey go module versions are from the the repo tag.
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:39:13 GMT):<br/>
I seem to have overlooked that glaringly obvious fact
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:47:58 GMT):<br/>
we might need to consider a regular cadence of tags.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:53:46 GMT):<br/>
(and also where the tags might be aligned with the common interface changes).

A little late to the conversation, but I think I stumbled on the answer to the ext repo module version question while solving my own problem accessing the go wrapper for indy-vdr.

For module roots nested in a repo you have to add the relative path to the tag name.  So for me it became `git tag wrappers/golang/v0.0.0 ` with the go.mod file residing under `wrappers/golang`. 

Using this approach is seems each module could have its own independent version if that is what we desire.  (We'll likely need module specific tags either way).

Hi all, Android developer here, I have started looking at the aries-framework-go repo and the mobile bindings. I have looked at the demo app. I am not sure I get the full scope of the mobile SDK and I am curious to here more. 
Is it capable to run a full aries agent on a mobile? How does the inbound communication work? Is it managed with a mediator node? How are the credential stored?
I tried to ingest a connection invite of type `"@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/connections/1.0/invitation"` but it is apparently not supported in local agent mode. 
Sorry it is a lot of different questions at the same time, you can otherwise point me to some doc for me to look at, thanks in advance!
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:32:48 GMT):<br/>
"How does the inbound communication work? Is it managed with a mediator node?" Yes - you would use a mediator node. aries-framework-go supports mediation.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:33:32 GMT):<br/>
"I tried to ingest a connection invite of type" aries-framework-go has, so far, only implemented the DID Exchange protocol (not the original connections protocol).

@troyronda the bindings only work in "remote" mode for mobile right now, correct?  And the mediator you are referring to is the rest agent?
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:40:55 GMT):<br/>

@gnarula can you describe what `importing keys` does more precisely in aries-framework-go?
</p>
<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Wed, 21 Oct 2020 09:34:56 GMT):<br/>
say you have a bunch of keys that were created using indy-cli and for some reason you want to use/import them on to an aries-framework-go KMS. The library would allow you to extract the private key from the indy wallet for a given DID and import it to the KMS

correct, using the Import function in the kms allows importing ecdsa/ed25519 keys created outside of Aries-framework-go. Your can push a PR for Indy key import library to the Aries-framework-go-ext repo. We just need to know to see where to add it, either in a separate module or one of the existing ones.. @troyronda ?

@ajayjadhav , LocalKMS in aries-framework-go uses Google Tink to store keys locally, you can add a Hashicorp implementation of the kms api(https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/master/pkg/kms/api.go) and even use Google Tink integration's Hashicorp client https://github.com/google/tink/tree/master/go/integration/hcvault directly

@troyronda @george.aristy this question is more for the trustbloc folks but it also touches my understanding of the VDRI. the trustbloc VDRI does not implement store/build methods, so i am assuming that the VDRI cannot be used for DID registration? if this is the case, i am wondering if the VDRI is involved in any VC use case such issuance and verification, or this is handled completely outside of the agent?

@o.terbu the trustbloc VDR is currently being used by higher layers to sign presentations. It's on our TODO list to integrate it properly into the framework.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:31:11 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean by "DID registration"?
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:31:17 GMT):<br/>
I'm not Troy or George, but I would say that a Verifier would need to resolve the DID of the issuer using a VDR, right?
</p>
<p><strong>o.terbu</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:32:03 GMT):<br/>
@george.aristy DID registration -> DID creation as in registering / anchoring on the trustbloc sidetree network
</p>
<p><strong>jceb</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:33:52 GMT):<br/>
@o.terbu yes, I had that very same question before. @troyronda mentioned to me that DID creation is outside the agent to keep it small and universal

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:43:22 GMT):<br/>
@o.terbu I guess we can parse this as two questions. What is the framework doing and what is the trustbloc DID method doing.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:44:16 GMT):<br/>
The framework currently focuses on DID resolution and also providing a KMS interface such that the framework can hold keypairs and make the public keys available for DID registration.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:45:20 GMT):<br/>
This is mainly due to the resolver side having a fairly clear interface: resolve a DID and return back a DID document.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:46:22 GMT):<br/>
On the DID registration side, you effectively need a DID document mutation interface and also need to make decisions on how the KMS should interface with it.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:47:09 GMT):<br/>
(see, for example, universal resolver vs universal registrar).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:48:18 GMT):<br/>
So for simplicity, we have so far, have enabled external code to perform registrar tasks by exposing the KMS interface from the framework.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:53:33 GMT):<br/>
@o.terbu On the TrustBloc DID method. The TrustBloc DID method exposes the Sidetree protocol API. We have an additional layer defined in the method to discover the endpoints for a particular network and to supply network policy.

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:57:12 GMT):<br/>
The policy defines the consortium membership, enables validation of changes in membership (including hash-linked history), and policies about how many members should be queried when doing DID resolution.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 15:01:44 GMT):<br/>
Here's a CLI for the `did:trustbloc` method: https://github.com/trustbloc/trustbloc-did-method/blob/8f1f39e94a1e23ebe4abd213c5e6da3f2c205e29/cmd/did-method-cli/main.go#L17

@o.terbu are you looking to learn how to sign credentials using aries-framework-go?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:31:28 GMT):<br/>
the framework is sufficiently generic to do so
</p>
<p><strong>o.terbu</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:33:32 GMT):<br/>
i am trying to learn how to use other DIDs than did:trustbloc to issue VCs and come up with a demo (for evaluation purposes). ideally, i want to reuse existing code base and just replace it with a did:elem for example.
</p>
<p><strong>o.terbu</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:34:54 GMT):<br/>
i now have a good idea how this is done from a wallet (end-user) perspective, but i have not entirely figured out where the issuer codebase is that uses the verifiable package + their DID.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:35:03 GMT):<br/>
but, here are some pointers:

* `dataProfile.Creator` is the DID: https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-service/blob/96f3294b035f3c1afd892e65b409e74b86a160bd/pkg/doc/vc/crypto/crypto.go#L173-L198
* the DID is resolved here and validated: https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-service/blob/96f3294b035f3c1afd892e65b409e74b86a160bd/pkg/doc/vc/crypto/crypto.go#L249
* after all that you build an LD Proof Context and pass it to the framework's `verifiable.Credential.AddLinkedDataProof()`https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/13c12e662e0f98a1095360b58219df280a23e8ce/pkg/doc/verifiable/credential_ldp.go#L14-L29
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:37:53 GMT):<br/>
here's another example from a different project: https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-adapter/blob/6587a7111ada6bd16386bbcd9d97806d6cfb373a/pkg/crypto/crypto.go#L52-L65
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:38:03 GMT):<br/>
`signingKeyID` is a DID URL - the verification method
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:38:37 GMT):<br/>
Pattern is always the same - you resolve that DID and validate it, then build the LD Proof Context required by the framework's `verifiable.Credential.AddLinkedDataProof()`
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:40:57 GMT):<br/>
You have to configure the framework's VDR to resolve `did:trustbloc`. Here's an example where we use a universal resolver: https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-adapter/blob/4c14603e7d5e7cf3322d024ab4f7191d24e0118f/cmd/adapter-rest/startcmd/start.go#L928-L936
</p>
<p><strong>o.terbu</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:41:55 GMT):<br/>
thanks for all these references. again very helpful and it helps me to better understand how the framework is being used.
</p>
<p><strong>o.terbu</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:42:54 GMT):<br/>
why is it needed to resolve the DID before generating the proof?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:45:51 GMT):<br/>
It's not strictly required. It's done to ensure the DID is resolvable and correctly formed. Just a defensive measure.
</p>
<p><strong>o.terbu</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:47:06 GMT):<br/>
alright, makes sense. thanks.

Hi folks, just wondering if there is an example somewhere of the type of proof request restrictions that are supported by aries-framework-go (like restrict credentials by schema, issuer did, etc)?  I've done a quick review of the code and this is the only example I could find:

Hey @troyronda maybe you are already aware of this, but as a heads up `docker pull` from the github package registry (docker.pkg.github.com) is not working anymore on the latest Edge version (20.10) (I was using that and it was almost driving me mad). It works fine on the latest stable Docker Desktop (19.03). Also see https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/41687. I think the source reason is that Github Package Repository does not support pulling by SHA and the updated and error message of the edge version clearly indicates that it's trying to do that in 20.10. (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-packages#downloading-an-image)

Anyone familiar with the set up for the `ext` repo...  Is the intent of the common build to NOT build any of the components' code?   Right now, the common build doesn't trigger on changes to the components' code, but when it is triggered, it tries to build and test all the components too.

@pfeairheller if you changed only component then CI should run the tests for component. If there is at least one change out of component folder then all checks will be executed.
</p>
<p><strong>soluchok</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 15:20:50 GMT):<br/>
For now i donâ€™t know how to ignore components tests when global one was executed

<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 15:24:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @soluchok ,  I don't think we want to use a special container for all the component builds but we need one for indy-vdr to make the shared library available.  I've added some logic to the `check_unit.sh` script to allow for an exclusion used in common.yml.  I'm not entirely happy with the solution so I look forward to review comments.
</p>

Hey, is /vdr/did correct endpoint for creating public did (checking on Swagger, in OpenAPI demo docs it says /vdr/create-public-did)? I also get the error {"code":4000,"message":"invalid id"}, when trying to fetch the records on /vdr/did/records.

</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 30 Nov 2020 22:34:23 GMT):<br/>
Is there a swagger page for the aries go REST interface?  Or a document that lists all the api calls available?

<p><strong>marc0olo</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 17:37:38 GMT):<br/>
general question about the agents and framework(s) => where do you see the interoperability part on the DID layer being placed as we need to distinguish between lookup/verification & crud operations? will the uniresolver be used for lookup/verification within the agent implementation? will the different frameworks eventually support the crud operations of different DID methods? how is your take on that?
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 17:40:41 GMT):<br/>
In our project, we rely on functionality outside of the aries-go framework for creating DIDs on the ledger.  The `vdr` implementation is only for resolving DIDs.
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 17:41:54 GMT):<br/>
The main reason for this is the extra complication associated with registering DIDs with Indy.  You need to sign the requests with a DID already on the ledger that has the proper permissions and you need to specify a `role` for the new DID.  None of those are concerns of the aries-go framework right now.
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 17:42:55 GMT):<br/>
Besides, our project also has functionality for writing other artifacts to the ledger for schema creation and credential issuance.

The project I am referring to is https://github.com/scoir/canis

In particular, we have an Indy credential engine implementation that handles the this using the go wrapper for indy_vdr.  Its implementation is here:  https://github.com/scoir/canis/blob/main/pkg/credential/engine/indy/engine.go

Question about credential formats inside the attachment data of the issue-credential v2 protocol message. If I'm reading the spec correctly, those credentials can be any format listed in the "Credential Attachment Registry" table after each message. So we've done that with the output from our implementation of Indy credentials and aries-go is not saving the credential because it is assuming W3c formatted credentials. Are we expected to implement a different middleware for the different credential formats or am I missing something else?

I already asked in the main aries channel about this behavior. but I am just wondering about the perspective of the go framework it is planned to tackle that usecase. it's not specific to the go framework - but I guess that we need to tackle this. if I want to prove a verifier something which is part of a verifiable credential (issued by a known, trusted public DID) within my pairwise channel over did:peer without disclosing the my VCs subject DID - how can I achieve that?

I see that you merged a PR that includes the BBS+ selective disclosure approach pioneered by Mattr. can this be used to achieve that?

I know that in Indy / Sovrin we can make use of blinded link secrets to achieve that. I guess that's currently not possible with the go framework, right?

do you know of a public example available that showcases didexchange between ACA-Py and aries-framework-go ? just asking before trying to get it working on my own
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:50:36 GMT):<br/>
It's not been done yet.  We (ACA-Py team) will also be working on it soon, but haven't started.  The DID Exchange/OOB code just landed in ACA-Py.
</p>
<p><strong>marc0olo</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:51:55 GMT):<br/>
ahh cool. but if I am using the code in the master I should be able to run such an example already?

<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 12:12:06 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran As it stands right now, the aries-go version of OOB and didexchange are out of date.  @m00sey and @tarkochevamik have picked up issues https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/issues/2283 and https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/issues/626 to bring those protocols up to date with the latest RFCs.  You might want to hold off until that work is complete.
</p>
<p><strong>marc0olo</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 12:18:30 GMT):<br/>
we discovered this yesterday, too. @pfeairheller when do you think will v0.1.6 be released?

Could we use one of the afg planning calls to do a session on long term/short term road map? 
Maybe at the start of the new year?

That way the community can have a view into what afgâ€™s priorities are. It would give each of the contributors a chance to discuss their goals for the framework too.

Hi, I am currently trying to create an implicit invitation for didexchange by resolving a DID based on `did:web` and I get the error msg `did method web not supported for vdr`. is it possible to configure the go-framework to use the http vdr via uniresolver?

Hi, I am currently trying to create an implicit invitation for didexchange by resolving a DID based on `did:web` and I get the error msg `did method web not supported for vdr`. is it possible to configure the go-framework to use the httpbinding together with the uniresolver to achieve that?
</p>
<p><strong>marc0olo</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:24:06 GMT):<br/>
it seems like I am not using the httpbinding in my go agent. otherwise "accept" should return `true` for every method, right?
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/eebf14a1fae48bad4b7a2fe7a23834ce0aa6e6d9/pkg/vdr/httpbinding/vdr.go#L37

ok got it. had to set the env param `ARIESD_HTTP_RESOLVER`. now I am facing another issue but the httpresolver is configured :D
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:11:08 GMT):<br/>
@marc0olo - also FYI: there is a go implementation of did:web that the framework instance can be instantiated with.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:12:14 GMT):<br/>
We should probably add an option to the pre-built docker image for that.

See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/pkg/framework/aries#WithVDR for the option to pass Go VDRs into the framework instantiation.
</p>
<p><strong>marc0olo</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:24:24 GMT):<br/>
that would be nice! I think for the moment the httpbinding is sufficient for me. it seems like I have to fix my did document as the go framework tells me `public key is nil`

I want to test the implicit invitation of didexchange using aries-go. can I just create a keyset using the kms endpoint and publish that public key in the recipientKeys array within the service of the did-document? I am wondering about the format of the public key when creating a keypair with keytype `ED25519`. I got following public key: `GXuoM_hWSIQs1pq3I7CX0Pa_E1-OQgn38dP_twE78o4`

</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 12:38:07 GMT):<br/>
since this extension requires `libindy-vdr.so` share lib it will not run on a mobile device.  However, you could build the `aries-rest-agent` with this extension enabled and run your mobile agent connected to the rest agent.
</p>
<p><strong>kapster</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 13:54:15 GMT):<br/>
@pfeairheller are there any plans to make mobile bindings for that extension? or because of `libindy-vdr` dependency it is not likely to happen?

Hi Everyone, Question on DIDExchange. The docs day to call `HTTP POST /connections/create-invitation` to initiate the DID Exchange Protocol. Can the `outofband/create-invitation` be used just as well as the connections call? I ask because the DID Exchange RFC 0023 states to do the invitation through OOB. To further that, if it can, is this the proper order of operations for DID Exchange with OOB?
```
outofband/create-invitation
outofband/accept-invitation
connections/accept-invitation
connections/accept-request
```
Thanks.

@troyronda maybe you could answer my question, if there are any plans to make it possible to use ``framework-go-ext` on mobile devices or whether it is even possible at all. I cannot use rest agent and for me useing mobile bindings in native code seems much better option than xamarin

I assume you are asking about mobile indy bindings in aries framework go. (since most other components are buildable for mobile).

We don't personally have plans for this effort but maybe others do.

@mupheux you can't do that. `/connections` API do not support filtering by `invitationid`.

Several of the developers are testing using their Macs. The CI tests on Linux for Unit Tests and BDD tests. Unfortunately some demo aspects don't get run in the CI so don't get caught... Of course, we welcome PRs to fix issues as well. @mupheux

question, I remember wondering what the differences were between W3C VCs and the VCs issued by Hyperledger Indy and that at the time someone mentioned that aries-go produced W3C VCs as well as Indy VCs.  Is this true?  If it is, does there exist documentation for what the similarities and differences are between the two credentials in detail?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 16:31:04 GMT):<br/>

Hi Everyone. We are attempting to get acapy and afgo to interoperate. There seems to be an issue with non-standard attributes in messages in afgo. For example the invitation created by afgo has `ID` instead of `id`, and `Type` instead of `type`, etc.  Thoughts on standardizing on attributes?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 17:48:12 GMT):<br/>
Yes -- attributes should be standardized.

Hi @sheldon.regular . I'm assuming you're referring to Out-of-Band invitations. AFGO is rendering those fields as `@type` and `@id` on the wire just like the OOB RFC says: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/f1c7f7aa39eca010c0c14cdb8ea7e0287db52368/pkg/didcomm/protocol/outofband/models.go#L22-L31
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 15:12:14 GMT):<br/>
Can you be more specific? What is it you are doing? What interface are you getting this invitation from?
</p>
<p><strong>sheldon.regular</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 15:29:54 GMT):<br/>
Hi @george.aristy the outofband/create-invitation operation returns this as the invitation. We use this on the OOB/receive-invitation in acapy. 
```
{
   "invitation":{
      "@id":"a471422f-0529-45c3-be0d-43201a617966",

@george.aristy  One more item seems to have been identified. In the invitation created by afgo the @type is set to `https://didcomm.org/oob-invitation/1.0/invitation`, according to the RFC (and this is also what acapy does) @type should be set to `https://didcomm.org/out-of-band/1.0/invitation`

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 19:22:44 GMT):<br/>
@george.aristy -- another interop problem.  The message mime type is different between ACA-Py (and other frameworks AFD, notably) and AF-Go.  We're going to need a community update RFC that I'll provide.  In the meantime, could AF-Go change to support receiving both mime types (old/current: application/ssi-agent-wire , new: application/didcomm-envelope-enc).  We're going to do the same in ACA-Py, but for now continue to use the old one,. so that we still work with AFD.  AF-Go can send out what you want.

Reasonable?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 12:49:13 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran ok so to be clear we are referring to content-types at the transport level, and that both will continue sending what they are sending today, and both will accept both content-type values
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 12:49:49 GMT):<br/>
seems a simple change

@george.aristy There seems to be another item that may need your attention. It seems, when afgo is acting as the requester and acapy as the responder in did-exchange, when the requester receives the invitation by doing the outofband/accept-invitation operation, acapy throws an error

How can we get started with Aries Go Framework?
</p>
<p><strong>ghabxph</strong> (Sat, 13 Feb 2021 15:37:35 GMT):<br/>
I managed to solved it.

Steps:
```
// Use main
1. go get github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go@main

2. Just guessed that these codes
	framework, err := New(
		WithInboundTransport(newMockInTransport()),
		WithStoreProvider(newMockDBProvider()),
		WithProtocolStateStoreProvider(newMockDBProvider()),
	)

belong to aries package.
"github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/pkg/framework/aries"
```

It would be really nice if docs are updated. It's so hard to start working with aries. Things doesn't work on the spot :/

@george.aristy the acapy team has update acapy to give an option to send the DIDcomm MIME Type. ie. `application/didcomm-envelope-enc` 
This seems to cause a problem for afgo.
The scenario setup is, Acapy is the requester, Afgo is the responder. Invitation is accepted and requester sends a request (accept-invitation) to the responder. Acapy throws an error (ServerDisconnectError) posting to the afgo agent. Afgo throws this.

@sheldon.regular Sounds like the issue is an older version of DID Exchange in AFGO. Specifically this change needs to be implemented in AFGO: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/commit/30f5e5c3aaeb918f42162c75e8922ba8b8584f52#diff-1db1c2a11b3ff24b00b257fa3f000fd596cc70bcba3e228e22a45c0f0ffaec07

@daidoji From what I understand, the data model @troyronda talks about doesn't have a clear specification for machine-readable binary formats. Anyway, it is helpful to refer to this article (https://www.lfph.io/2021/02/11/cci-verifiable-credentials-flavors-and-interoperability-paper/) for the differences between the various existing vc formats. Seems to be.

thanks @kukgini yeah I ran across that paper the other day.  Even this doesn't quite get down to the nitty gritty though.  I think I'm figuring it out just struggling through the specs and various implementations that exist

<p><strong>kukgini</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 02:21:53 GMT):<br/>
@daidoji Daniel hardman's opinion will also be helpful for vc compatibility caused by the ambiguity of the standard specification. https://www.evernym.com/blog/getting-to-practical-interop-with-verifiable-credentials/

Aries Go is agnostic to DID methods, so they can be injected into the framework or used via Universal Resolver.

run command was (on MAC OS X):

Hi everyone ,I read that using BBS+ signatures removes the requirement for a credential-definition on the ledger, Can anyone confirm this
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 18:18:48 GMT):<br/>
Correct: BBS+ signatures does not require credential definition on a ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>da3v21</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 03:51:00 GMT):<br/>
Thanks , credential definitions holds the public key of an issuer, where does the verifier get  the public key of the issuer from?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 04:55:56 GMT):<br/>
The verifiable credential has the DID of the issuer. From the DID, you resolve the public key.

The current implementation has been tested for interoperability and for the ability to compile to our various targets. We haven't investigated performance comparisons. We would tend to stick to pure go for the default implementations.

Of course, alternate implementations can potentially be loaded via progmatic options - this has been our approach so far on non-go questions like this. (this would require effort though.)

AF-Go does not support Indy AnonCreds, and AFAIK does not plan to implement Rich Schemas. The plan of the team for ZKP and Selective Disclosure support is to use BBS+ Signatures with JSON-LD.

AFGO has not _planned_ for Rich Schemas yet, but it is not off the table. Having the schemas stored in a VDR is a useful feature in many use cases.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 13:41:40 GMT):<br/>
I'm not too familiar with the Indy method so cannot speak to the relation of Indy AnonCreds to Rich Schemas.

Hi everybody! I am having troubles troubles retrieving DID document from Aries Go. What are the steps to create new DID (e.g., did:peer or did:sidetree) and then retrieve this DID document from Aries Go agent? Can it be done via Swagger interface? I can't find correct endpoint.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 15:18:34 GMT):<br/>
Rich Schemas was defined to be an extension to AnonCreds to enable W3C standard VCs with CL Signatures. It introduced several new ledger objects and (IMHO) a complicated set of related data objects.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 15:21:48 GMT):<br/>
The term "anoncred" does not appear in RFCs 0281 nor 0249. The term "indy" appears just once, as a footnote to RFC0281.

They seem like generic concepts?

Hi there, since we have the same problem: I dont think this endpoint is registering a public DID on the ledger. Or did I misunderstand it's purpose?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 22 Mar 2021 13:07:37 GMT):<br/>
You need to have a build that includes a VDR for the particular DID method of your interest.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 22 Mar 2021 13:08:06 GMT):<br/>
(and several DID methods are backed by ledgers).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 22 Mar 2021 13:12:24 GMT):<br/>
As an example, we take the framework and add DID methods in the TrustBloc build. https://github.com/trustbloc/agent-sdk/blob/main/cmd/agent-rest/startcmd/start.go#L827

Hi Everyone! I am trying to create a service that will act as an agent for many users. So far I have tried doing this by creating one service that creates an agent framework per user, and manually calls the handler functions created by aries, but I am encountering a problem with the fact that each agent must have a different service endpoint (must be on different ports). Is there any other way to achieve this (many agents on one port) without having to make changes to the code that handles the service endpoint creation part? (my idea was to do smth like localhost:8081/name as a service endpoint for the user with given name, but not sure if this would be the way to go) Thank you :)!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 14:14:57 GMT):<br/>
FYI -- I don't know how to answer this from an Aries Framework Go perspective, but the Aries Cloud Agent Python has a multi-tenant implementation that seems to have what you are looking for.  With ACA-Py, you write the controller in whatever language you want, so the code you write can be in golang if that helps.
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 18:41:32 GMT):<br/>
You could also have a look at Canis (https://github.com/scoir/canis)  It is a platform written in Go, using aries-go to provide multi-tenant (agent) capabilities by routing all DIDComm traffic in through one port and out to handlers using RabbitMQ.  It provides a SwaggerUI for the REST interface that allows for provision of agents, establishing connections and issuing and verifying credentials.  It has deployment artifacts for docker-compose and kubernetes.

Looks like af-go is generating an invitation with an attribute called `service` and I think according to the RFC it should be `services` (plural)?

@AngelPalomares You can call this kms import key endpoint to import your private keys with matching `kid`.
Later you can use that saved DID with key ID (verification method) to sign the credential.

Sorry @sudeshrshetty but I don't understand what you mean, if I understood you correctly, you are proposing to create a DID and save it later on. However this method will allow to the creator has access to the information.  We still have the problem where the verifier can't verify the issuer DID as it is not "public" (no in sidetree/ledger). Did I understand you correctly? or maybe I have missed something? :-(

Hi Everyone! I am currently trying to find out how to issue and verify a credential in aries go, and I managed to follow the 'How to issue credentials through the Issue Credential protocol?' part of the openapi_demo, but am not sure what the next steps would be? How can I sign this credential by the issuer and how would some other user verify it?

I noticed that there are some api endpoints that seem to be about verifying and signing, but I can't seem to make it work as every call that I make to the endpoints result in an error. What would be the complete flow (in terms of requests) for issuing and then verifying a credential? Is there some part of the documentation that explains this that I might have missed. Thank you!

@AngelPalomares if you create public DIDs then resolver will have access to it during signing.

And some architectural overview in general, and also on how these pluggable dependencies work exactly?

I don't know a lot about Aries Framework Go, but I believe what you need to do is create a client implementation of RFC 0211 within AFGo.  Once you have that, you can use a mediator that also talks RFC 0211, such as the public mediator that Indicio stood up.

Thanks for pointing out to the resources, @swcurran .

I already have a working Mediator Agent (developed using Aries Framework .NET). I don't intend to build a new Mediator Agent using the Aries Framework Go.

I just want to know if I can build Mobile Edge Agents (that have the wallet created/stored in the smartphone) using the Aries Framework Go. 

Mobile Edge Agents can be developed using the Aries Framework .NET, however, the requirement is such that I cannot use that. Hence, I am exploring the Aries Framework Go.

Hello team ~, I'm a researcher interested in this framework.

I have a question.
When a "BLS12381G2" type key is generated by a REST API "/kms/ketset" post request, the publicKey increases from 96 size to 128 size during the decoding process for response.
This becomes a problem when the UnmarshalPublicKey function is called in the bbs12381g2pub package. This function checks whether the length of the publickey is equal to 96. At this time, false is returned and no further progress is made.
Is this intended? Or is it a bug that needs to be fixed?

Thank you :D

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 14:19:01 GMT):<br/>
my hunch is that its also returning the private key with the public key because the private key is 32 bytes and the public key is 96 bytes. The question is which 32 bytes are the private key? I try to unpack the last 96 bytes to see if that works, if it doesn't then try the first 96 bytes. I'm unfamiliar with how the go framework is doing it so I hope @troyronda or someone who is can help
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 22:17:57 GMT):<br/>

Hello everyone. When I hit the REST API 'POST /verifiable/credential/validate'

`pkg/controller/command/verifiable/command.go:ValidateCredential(...)` is trying to 
`pkg/doc/verifiable/credential.go:validateCredential(...)` in 
`pkg/doc/verifiable/credential.go:verifiable.ParseCredential(...)`

but `vcOpts` has no `publicKeyFetcher` yet. So it failed.
Is it sould be fixed? or Is there something I missed?

Hi Everyone. Just a minor inquiry. When calling `did-exchange/connections`, either with a query parameter and there are no results matching, or with no parameter and there are no connection records, it always returns 200 with an empty message. Would it not be better to provide a code that better represents no results?

Hello there :wave: 
Which information does the aries-framework-go request from external resources (like a VDR) and where/how does it happen in the code?
I'm thinking of DID Docs, schemas, credential/presentation definitions, (encodings, mappings for Rich Schemas), some kind of revocation list/registry?

Hi Everyone.  Question: I'm in the middle of issuing a credential. I want to check the state of that process from the issuer or holder perspective. There doesn't seem to be a way to get a state in the admin api, as in `proposal-sent` or `request-received` in this issue credential protocol in afgo. When doing a DID Exchange Connection, one can call the connections protocol with a connection id and get the state of the connection process. Am I missing something in the Issue Credential protocol? Thanks.

Hi Everyone. In the Issue Credential protocol, why to the `accept-` operations need a message body? They are in response to a either a proposal, offer, or request, those there established what the credential looks like, so why wouldn't these work with just the piid sent over? I ask because I'm integrating with the Aries Agent Test Harness, and it assumes once a key is created and can be added to the operation call, the data is no longer needed. So at the point of any of the `accept-` operations I don't have the credential offer etc in the afgo backchannel. I think I can pull it out of a webhook, but just wanted your opinion on this in case I'm missing something. Thanks.

Hi Again. I'm wondering why a receiver doesn't get a *_states webhook message? I'm doing issue credential and this starts with a proposal. 
The holder proposed a credential
The issuer accepts the proposal. 
The issuer controller gets an issue credential states webhook that contains the state `offer-sent`.
I would expect the holder to also get an issue credential states webhook message containing the state `offer-received`. 
The Aries Agent Test Harness would like to check the state of the holder after the issuer sends the offer, but there doesn't seem to be a way to do this. The holder does get an issue credential actions webhook message but there is no state in that message. 
Is there a way I can check the state of the holder?

Hi, I'm having a new issue after rebuilding aries-framework-go as of yesterday. It was probably a couple of days since I rebuilt afgo. With code that use to work, the `issue-credential/send-proposal` I now get the following error, 
```
{
   "code":8011,
   "message":"handle outbound: action proposal-sent: outboundDispatcher.SendToDID failed to get didcomm destination for theirDID [did:peer:1H6d33Hnh2yTvZRiUBGNi]: getDestination: failed to resolve did [did:peer:1H6d33Hnh2yTvZRiUBGNi] : fetching data from store failed: delta data fetch from store for did [did:peer:1H6d33Hnh2yTvZRiUBGNi] failed: DID not found"
}
```
This is the message data being sent with the send-proposal

<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 21:03:49 GMT):<br/>
the fact that `their_did` is so short is unusual, are you trying to interop with aca-py? or an interop fix that's supposed to be behind a build flag is leaking out (which would be a bug in a recent PR in afgo)
</p>
<p><strong>sheldon.regular</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 21:12:44 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the response @filip.burlacu. No, all agents are afgo in this scenario. Their_did came from afgo, I pulled it out of a webhook message at the time it was needed.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 21:17:24 GMT):<br/>
I'll investigate, the truncation is a bug for sure
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 21:30:08 GMT):<br/>
did you build the agent in acapy-interop mode? that's the only way, as far as I can see, where their_did could be truncated
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 22:37:18 GMT):<br/>
@ianco ^^^ we are using acapy-interop mode, right?  Perhaps we should ONLY be using that AFGo - ACA-Py.  E.g. we need to have two AF-Go test agents, one for when doing AF-Go to AF-Go tests and the other for AF-Go to ACA-Py tests.  Easily done -- just have to have two dockerfiles.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 23:03:09 GMT):<br/>
Yep that change is here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness/blob/master/aries-backchannels/afgo/Dockerfile.afgo-master#L28
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 23:03:38 GMT):<br/>
And yes it prob makes sense to have separate Dockerfiles for `afgo-master` and `afgo-interop`
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 23:04:34 GMT):<br/>
(`afgo-interop` would be temporary until we get the full AIP2.0 interoperability working properly)

Hello team ~, I'm a researcher interested in this framework.

I have a question when signing the credential, in the process of loading the document.
When calling LoadDocument(), what's wrong with just loading the URL in the list of context in JSON-LD without remoteDocument?

Thank you :grinning:

@filip.burlacu I'm having a small issue with connections in afgo. Calls through the api to establish a connection work. I get 200s on all of the calls and the 2 parties have a connection in the end. However, on the /connections/id/accept-request by the responder in the logs for the agent I get the following:
Responder:
```
[aries-framework/out-of-band/service] 2021/05/26 20:08:45 UTC - n/a -> ERROR command=[out-of-band] action=[handleDIDEvent] [] errMsg=[handleDIDEvent: ParentThreadID is empty]
```
Requester:
```
[aries-framework/out-of-band/service] 2021/05/26 20:08:45 UTC - n/a -> ERROR command=[out-of-band] action=[handleDIDEvent] [] errMsg=[failed to load attachment handling state : failed to fetch attachment handling state using id=9b99cd85-608f-4e7a-8dd0-cb223c877364 : data not found]
```
These messages happen around successful webhook calls and like I said the main call gets a 200 back and I can continue on.  Do you have any hints on why this is happening and what I need to do to solve it? 

I ask this because I want to make sure the calls are clear because I'm trying to diagnose another issue where, sometimes when I try to get the connection record after this call to check the state of the protocol, I don't get a connection record back, I get 200, and an empty message. Then my test fails because of no status information. This only happens randomly.

Here is a PR from Brent Zundel to add it to the BBS+ LDP spec -- https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020/pull/57/files

Per @brentzundel `The method for submitting a blinded commitment to the issuer is described in section 3.9 of the BBS+ spec linked to in the BBS+ LD-Signatures spec. The implementation in ursa already supports a holder sending the issuer a set of committed values for signing.`

I'm adding DIF PE support to AATH. What is the input AFGO expects to create and send the presentation? ACA-Py supports the following options:
- Send `{}`. Which means auto construct the presentation
- Or you can input a presentation_definition that applies extra restrictions on the credentials to use with the possibility to specify specific record ids of credentials to use for the presentation.
I don't want to make the API too ACA-Py specific, so curious to hear what you're using.
See https://github.com/ianco/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/85470918d5b60e2fd490567f6776e7a7de12dd7b/demo/AliceWantsAJsonCredential.md#request-presentation-example for a description of the possibilities in ACA-Py

Hi guys I am new to Aries and I have a few questions regarding issuing and veryfing credentials.

First of all to my understanding issuing a credential as described in the open api demo, doesn't sign the issued credential. I supposed that is done through the signcredential endpoint. So the issuing agent calls the sign credential endpoint and then calls accept request, right? Is that how it's supposed to be, or am I missing something?

Once I have the signed credential on the receiving agent, should I do anything to store that credential locally or is that done automatically for me?
</p>

Also, the JWT token in the proof section of the signcredential response doesn't have a payload. Is that normal?

Hi aries-go folks. What would I need to spin up a mediator agent with aries-go that works with indy? I've read that aries-go is DLT agnostic. What would I need to run it against indy? Or should I opt into aca-py right away?

You can integrate indy into aries-go, checkout https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go-ext. Under components>vdr there's an indy implementation.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-go?msg=WfnTzpyEYWD6fucqo) -ext is for plugins and other modules that aren't defaults
when you build a cloud agent with afgo, for example, you're free to choose the backend DB you use, so afgo itself has some utility stores and defaults, and afgo-ext can have a variety of plugins from which you pick whichever DB suits your needs

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-go?msg=khZHnPcyNs3ZY8HkJ) the http binding VDR uses an external server for resolving DIDs - so if you only need to resolve dids, you can use that with an external did method driver or a universal resolver instance

Hi everyone,

I started integrating AF-Go into a mobile application and i have two questions:

1. Does anyone also have issues with the android bindings? I got some weird error the first time i call a method (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/issues/3009)?

2. Is there a possibility to automatically connect a mobile agent with a mediator? I'm am currently doing the outofband invitation manually but the mobile application should automatically connect and register to a mediator.

In v0.1.7 Release Notes, What do you mean by Present Proof V3? I can't find any Aries RFC related with it.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 22:44:11 GMT):<br/>
The WACI-Pex work being done in DIF uses DIDComm 2.  Because of how DIDComm 2 works, some of the fields in Present Proof v2 are moved to the header. Hence, there is a Present Proof V2 that accommodates DIDComm2.  A number of Aries protocols will be subject to that change.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 22:45:28 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam -- I think the V3.0 Protocol should go in to the the Aries RFCs to keep them together and perhaps we should start on an AIP 3 that is based on DIDComm 2?

Hello all! I have two quick questions. I'm planning on creating an SSI ecosystem and I'm on the phase when I should decide which framework to use for each agent. As I've seen, AFGo has a great interoperability with other frameworks, but the only problem that I can see so far is its relationship with Indy ledgers. The scenario in my head is that the agent might need to communicate with different ledgers, and I saw that it can only read from Indy ledgers. If I decide to run my "Enterprise Agent" using AFGo, what would be your suggestion regarding blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>mateokurti</strong> (Wed, 03 Nov 2021 10:34:22 GMT):<br/>
The other thing is about the Android Agent. I have a prototype in Kotlin and I wanted to know if the AFGo can be used in a Kotlin environment
</p>
<p><strong>adn-misa</strong> (Thu, 04 Nov 2021 07:41:44 GMT):<br/>
Hi mateokurti, you could use the DIF Universal Resolver and Registrar for your issue with the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>adn-misa</strong> (Thu, 04 Nov 2021 07:43:34 GMT):<br/>
Yes you can use the mobile bindings for that (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/tree/main/cmd/aries-agent-mobile), But you will maybe encounter some weirds errors on your way like i did (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/issues/3009).

Hello @adn-misa It looks like based on gomobile. Is it OK to consider gomobile as production ready?
</p>
<p><strong>adn-misa</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 11:49:17 GMT):<br/>
@kukgini gomobile is experimental (https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/mobile) but i have seen multiple projects where complete application were made with it.

Depends what you consider to be production ready. The repository mention that you don't have any support from Google.

My approach is to use an abstraction over the aries framework on mobile. We are very early and other frameworks could come in the future. And if something happen you will only have to change your abstraction implementation (instead of the whole application).

Hi everyone, i'm currently trying to implement an Issuer with AF-Go and i came up with following questions:

How do i create a public DID? I'm right that the creation, update and deactivation need to be implemented in the VDR?

How do I integrate the implementation from the extension repository? I saw that there are implementation for indy, orb and sidetree(I assume it works with ION?)

What is the best way to get started with an issuer with a public DID?

Thanks in advance :smiley:
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 22 Nov 2021 17:51:20 GMT):<br/>
Hi @adn-misa and welcome

If you want to connect to a public DID registry, you would use the vdr's [HTTPbinding implementation](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/pkg/vdr/httpbinding/vdr.go#L36). If you only want to work with 2 agents directly, you would use peer DIDs that can be created using the [peer DID VDR creator](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/pkg/vdr/peer/creator.go#L29).

The best way to learn about issuing credentials and introducing agents (issuer and holder for example) is to see the BDD tests in action. For example out-of-band introductions are shown [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/features/introduce.feature) with corresponding code in the introduce_xxx_steps.go files found [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/tree/main/test/bdd/pkg/introduce). Note that sdk is for direct agent calls (you can use step debugging to view the agent's test run) or controller that runs the agent in a docker container. Note that introduce is based on out-of-band v1 version that requires and initialized DID connections between agents. The new out-of-band v2 implementation does not use connections and therefore only handles triggering attached requests goals.

If you want to see how Issue credentials works, the [issue credential sdk feature](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/features/issue_credential.feature) (SDK) or the [issue credential controller feature](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/features/issue_credential_controller.feature) (controller) files can be reviewed along with their test implementations [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/pkg/issuecredential/issuecredential_sdk_steps.go) and [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/pkg/issuecredential/issuecredential_controller_steps.go) respectively.

There's also a BDD test example resolving a public DID via a [mock SideTree node](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/features/didresolver.feature#L10) resolver, this is only a mock resolver, not the real SideTree, but the drill to resolve from a real public resolver is the same.

I hope this helps and feel free to post any more questions.

Hi @Baha-sk thanks for your response and yes I have some more clarification questions,

Yes I can use the HttpBinding to get DID Documents from public DIDs but how can i register a public DID from the framework. I looked at the implementation but HttpBinding does not implement the Write and Deactivate functions.

That comes back to my second question, the extension repository (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go-ext) seems to have implementation to register public DIDs with a orb or sidetree implementation, could you describe how it can be integrated into the AF-GO?

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:13:11 GMT):<br/>
aries-framework-go-ext offers more functionality to create/resolve DIDs for sidetree, orb, trustbloc and indy under the [vdr](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go-ext/tree/main/component/vdr) package

so the former project serves as an extension to the latter.

you don't need to integrate the -ext logic inside AFGO core project, as a user agent developer, you create the public DID using -ext, then create an agent and use its clients to execute the protocol services available, ie DIDexchange, out-of-band, issue-credential, persent-proof, etc. There's a client and a service for each of these in AFGO, as an agent developer, you would use clients found [here](https://github.com/identinet/aries-framework-go/tree/fix-vcwallet-correct-issue-vc/pkg/client) via the framework instance you create, just as in bdd tests, so the steps are:
1. [create agent](https://github.com/identinet/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/agent/agent_sdk_steps.go#L469) with all applicable options needed.
2. get the agent's context created in 1 above by calling agent.Context() example from bdd tests is [here](https://github.com/identinet/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/agent/agent_sdk_steps.go#L474)
3. create the desired client you would like to use, eg didexchange client by passing the context retrieved in step 2 above, bdd example: [didexchangeClient, err := didexchange.New(d.bddContext.AgentCtx[agentID])](https://github.com/identinet/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/pkg/didexchange/didexchange_sdk_steps.go#L294)

I build the AFGO agents using the make command for ACAPy interop. And run the mediator with http,ws capabilities for both inbound and outbound. I do the same for the edge agent too and I run it with ws for outbound, no inbound obviously. The connection with the mediator and stuff all works, also connecting to another AFGO on the cloud via the mediator works. So I suppose that setup is right. 
I run ACA-Py 0.7.2, with the two following flags, among others, --emit-new-didcomm-prefix --emit-new-didcomm-mime-type. I am able to perform didexchange with an AFGO agent running on the cloud but when I try to establish a connection with the agent on the edge (via the mediator) I get an error saying that Anoncrypt is not supported.
I was able to pinpoint that the error comes from the /legacy/authcrypt Unpack function. The Unpack function checks whether the data being unpacked is using Authcrypt, if it doesnt it throws an error. In my case, the data coming from the ACAPy seems to have typ set as JWM/0.1 and alg as Anoncrypt.
```
{"enc":"xchacha20poly1305_ietf","typ":"JWM/1.0","alg":"Anoncrypt","recipients":[{"encrypted_key":"32AvGbP8AL1L4M5IDHMx3AhDClFJzgnZKun4covFQiM214oBTIZTDL3jQ9EfJoeN37QwxTdKpMfePdvpIG1ua23Hqmxchw2TxSU9yZFOoMg=","header":{"kid":"5re4NG7eYNBgManWrPnZBUSBwyduGWiED3oFLjf7UVAk"}}
```
I tried unpacking the envelope with Anoncrypt, but it wasnt able to decode it either, and I was getting a different error. I tried with both an indy and aries_askar backend, still didnt work.

<p><strong>ArdianAbazi</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:10:36 GMT):<br/>
The thing is I am not sure it supports its, thats why i was asking for a sanity check basically :D
Thanks in advance
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:12:41 GMT):<br/>
to my knowledge, i don't think legacy packer supports `Anoncrypt`, it only supports `Authcrypt` packing since the sender key is always involved
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:16:00 GMT):<br/>
the new DIDComm V2 protocol supports both `Anoncrypt` and `Authcrypt` packing using X25519 keys/ NIST P keys found in the `KeyAgreement` verification methods of the DID ( as opposed to DIDComm V1's Ed25519 keys found in the authentication verification method of the DID)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:18:24 GMT):<br/>
> In my case, the data coming from the ACAPy seems to have typ set as JWM/0.1 and alg as Anoncrypt.
yeah JWM/0.1 and Anoncrypt is not supported in AFGO, we're aiming to move towards DIDComm V2 instead
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:36:18 GMT):<br/>
> typ set as JWM/0.1
@Baha-sk they made a typo here, it's JWM/1.0 in the example message, which is what AFGO supports.
@ArdianAbazi But that doesn't make a difference, because this message uses XChaCha20-Poly1305 and Anoncrypt, and afgo's legacy packer supports only Authcrypt and ChaCha20-Poly1305.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:38:00 GMT):<br/>
I'm running the test harness interop tests locally right now, to see if I replicate this error - interop can't work if acapy's switched its default ciphers...
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:12:57 GMT):<br/>
ahh nvm I misunderstood; acapy uses anoncrypt with XC20P for the enclosing message sent to the mediator, while using authcrypt otherwise.
</p>
<p><strong>ArdianAbazi</strong> (Thu, 25 Nov 2021 08:41:07 GMT):<br/>
@filip.burlacu I know that you probably know this, but AFGO decides what packer to use based on the typ field, JWM/1.0 is unpacked using the legacy packer. However, I did try to unpack it via the Anoncrypt packer, but still no luck there unfortunately.

<p><strong>ArdianAbazi</strong> (Thu, 25 Nov 2021 08:41:31 GMT):<br/>
The error I get is

<p><strong>ArdianAbazi</strong> (Thu, 25 Nov 2021 08:43:37 GMT):<br/>
Furthermore, I checked the test harness, I dont think this case is part of the tests.
</p>
<p><strong>ArdianAbazi</strong> (Thu, 25 Nov 2021 08:44:59 GMT):<br/>
I think it's safe to assume that this case is not supported for now. It doesn't seem like a lot of changes would have to be made to add support, but the codebases, as they are currently, don't have support for this case.
</p>
<p><strong>ArdianAbazi</strong> (Thu, 25 Nov 2021 08:47:08 GMT):<br/>
Do you guys @Baha-sk @filip.burlacu think I should create an issue for this, I also have code that can replicate it through tests :D

@ArdianAbazi , legacy packer in AFGO is for DIDcomm v1 (AIP1/2) packing and has only Authcrypt packer. The other two Anoncrypt and Authcrypt packers that are siblings to legacy are for DIDComm V2 packing only. Any V1 envelop cannot be unpacked by these packers.

so to sum up, AFGO supports only Legacy.Authcrypt packing for DIDComm V1 (AIP1/AIP2) support, there's no Legacy.Anoncrypt packer in AFGO

As for DIDComm V2, AFGO has Anoncrypt and Authcrypt packers

I'm currently implementing the did:peer spec in AFJ and want to test for correctness against the peer did implementation in AFGO.

I see a document is created [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/49e59b074359d344c6c9968e9650e6bc53f811d0/pkg/vdr/peer/did_test.go#L154) and verified against this did: `did:peer:1zQmZdT2jawCX5T1RKUB7ro83gQuiKbuHwuHi8G1NypB8BTr`.

I have zero experience with rust, so wondering if you could provide me with the JSON output of the `genesisDoc` method so I can make sure the method produces the same results in AFJ.

@baha: already replied: the verificationMethod.id is not a KMS ID, it's the verification method ID, you can't treat it like a KMS ID

I understand this, but don't understand how to provide the KMS ID instead.

Let me rephrase my problem and question:
- I do have a credential in place.
- I want to create a VC and sign it with a `BbsBlsSignature2020` signature
- In order to do so, I need to provide a `controller` and a `verificationMethod` ( I use the `/vcwallet/issue` call)
- To prepare this process, I need to provide the key material for the DID
- I have tried several things:
  - create DID doc with method "key" 
  - create DID doc with method "peer"
  - create key pair in KMS (`/vcwallet/create-key-pair`)
  - import private key (`/kms/import`)
None of the methods allowed me to sign the VC for several reasons. The most promising method seemed to be the private key import, but here I didn't succeed yet in providing the key correctly (decryption error)

Can you please advice what is the best method to create/import the DID/key material correctly such that I can sign a VC with BLS (best using HTTP requests). I have seen in the tests that typically you create private keys and import them.
Thanks a lot!
