{"msg":"Hi Everyone. Was made aware today of some BDD definitions in aries-framework-go, https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/tree/master/test/bdd/features\nGood stuff, pleased to see it. I am in the initial stages of expanding the test harness with BDD/Gherkin for the aries-cloudagent-python AIP 1.0.0 protocols implemented. It may be a good idea for us to collaborate a little. It would be nice to have a common standard set of tests for the protocols between projects. Maybe even standards on tags used, references, feature definitions, etc in the Feature files. \nQuestion: I notice some of the Gherkin is not complete, ie. doesn't include When or Then or both. Is there a reason for this or was it just a quick way to use BDD to drive the tests not caring about format? \nThanks and nice to meet you guys.

{"msg":"Hi folks.  I think I've hit a bug, but I wanted to check before opening an issue.  I'm working with the latest from master.   I have 2 agents running and connected and agent1 begins a the issue-credential protocol by calling SendOffer to send an offer for a credential to agent2.  In agent2, I receive the following error: `doHandle err: invalid state transition: offer-sent -> offer-received`.  Looking at the code I see that the issuecredential Service `nextState` method offers up `offerReceived` as the next state instance for the offer-credential message type but the `CanTransitionTo` method of `offerSent` does not allow the transition.  At first I thought it was a bug and that the transition had to be added, but then I got similar errors on `credential-issued -> credential-received` and `request-sent -> request-received`.  Adding the appropriate names to the `CanTransitionTo` methods fixed everything and the agent can now successfully exchange a credential.  It looks like `proposal-sent -> proposal-received` will also be an issue but I have verified that yet.

{"msg":"Hi Everyone! I am trying to create a service that will act as an agent for many users. So far I have tried doing this by creating one service that creates an agent framework per user, and manually calls the handler functions created by aries, but I am encountering a problem with the fact that each agent must have a different service endpoint (must be on different ports). Is there any other way to achieve this (many agents on one port) without having to make changes to the code that handles the service endpoint creation part? (my idea was to do smth like localhost:8081/name as a service endpoint for the user with given name, but not sure if this would be the way to go) Thank you :)!","username":"JovanShandro","ts":"2021-03-24T09:40:31.392Z"}

{"msg":"Hi Everyone. In the Issue Credential protocol, why to the `accept-` operations need a message body? They are in response to a either a proposal, offer, or request, those there established what the credential looks like, so why wouldn't these work with just the piid sent over? I ask because I'm integrating with the Aries Agent Test Harness, and it assumes once a key is created and can be added to the operation call, the data is no longer needed. So at the point of any of the `accept-` operations I don't have the credential offer etc in the afgo backchannel.

{"msg":"Hello all! I have two quick questions. I'm planning on creating an SSI ecosystem and I'm on the phase when I should decide which framework to use for each agent. As I've seen, AFGo has a great interoperability with other frameworks, but the only problem that I can see so far is its relationship with Indy ledgers. The scenario in my head is that the agent might need to communicate with different ledgers, and I saw that it can only read from Indy ledgers. If I decide to run my \"Enterprise Agent\" using AFGo, what would be your suggestion regarding blockchain?","username":"mateokurti","ts":"2021-11-03T10:33:36.909Z"}

The repository mention that you don't have any support from Google.\n\nMy approach is to use an abstraction over the aries framework on mobile. We are very early and other frameworks could come in the future.

{"msg":"Hi @adn-misa and welcome\n\nIf you want to connect to a public DID registry, you would use the vdr's [HTTPbinding implementation](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/pkg/vdr/httpbinding/vdr.go#L36). If you only want to work with 2 agents directly, you would use peer DIDs that can be created using the [peer DID VDR creator](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/pkg/vdr/peer/creator.go#L29).\n\nThe best way to learn about issuing credentials and introducing agents (issuer and holder for example) is to see the BDD tests in action. For example out-of-band introductions are shown [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/features/introduce.feature) with corresponding code in the introduce_xxx_steps.go files found [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/tree/main/test/bdd/pkg/introduce). Note that sdk is for direct agent calls (you can use step debugging to view the agent's test run) or controller that runs the agent in a docker container. Note that introduce is based on out-of-band v1 version that requires and initialized DID connections between agents. The new out-of-band v2 implementation does not use connections and therefore only handles triggering attached requests goals.\n\nIf you want to see how Issue credentials works, the [issue credential sdk feature](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/features/issue_credential.feature) (SDK) or the [issue credential controller feature](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/features/issue_credential_controller.feature) (controller) files can be reviewed along with their test implementations [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/pkg/issuecredential/issuecredential_sdk_steps.go) and [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/pkg/issuecredential/issuecredential_controller_steps.go) respectively.\n\nThere's also a BDD test example resolving a public DID via a [mock SideTree node](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/test/bdd/features/didresolver.feature#L10) resolver, this is only a mock resolver, not the real SideTree, but the drill to resolve from a real public resolver is the same.\n\nI hope this helps and feel free to post any more questions.","username":"Baha-sk","ts":"2021-11-22T17:51:20.832Z"}
