a suggestion, and merely is suggestion only,  reviewing a few other implementations over indy.  StreetCreds is good for A2A examples.   

Here is another example of one way types can be organized.  While it is specific to indysdk, the structure is abstracted to higher level types:

Sorry for a little bit chaotic explanation of the code, I should’ve prepared better :) I spent a lot of time with explanation of tests, but not so much about implementation. Therefore I created simple description and put it into the README. I also renamed the repo https://github.com/jakubkoci/aries-framework-javascript. Don’t hesitate to contact me if you would like to explain anything.

<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 16:10:46 GMT):<br/>

Hi, I pushed 2 commits, the first one yesterday, with refactoring into modules similar to the way how aries-cloudagent-python does that. Nothing final, just little step forward, hopefully, in the right direction. Today I did only smaller refactor of agent message creators. This could be converted to classes later. I wasn't sure with this step know because there is a lot of boilerplate. It could look like this:

```
class BasicMessage {
  '@type': string;
  '@id': string;

  constructor(type: string) {
    this['@type'] = type;
    this['@id'] = uuid();
  }
}

class ConnectionInvitation extends BasicMessage {
  label: string;
  serviceEndpoint: string;
  recipientKeys: Verkey[];
  routingKeys: Verkey[];

  constructor(label: string, recipientKeys: Verkey[], serviceEndpoint: string, routingKeys: Verkey[]) {
    super(MessageType.ConnectionInvitation);
    this.label = label;
    this.recipientKeys = recipientKeys;
    this.serviceEndpoint = serviceEndpoint;
    this.routingKeys = routingKeys;
  }
}
```

I found this feature https://kendaleiv.com/typescript-constructor-assignment-public-and-private-keywords/ I want to share with you for further discussion. I'm not saying I'm against classes, just thinking aloud about possibilities :)

I know we talked about it before and said no but given that little progress has been made trying the other approach, this would at least get us started

@ajayjadhav it's still "very much under development.", but it could be interesting to try. If I understand it correctly it's "just" runtime and it wont differ from Node.js so much (filesystem access, module system).
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Sun, 03 Nov 2019 17:08:32 GMT):<br/>
Possible we can have Deno as another  aries JS framework target (along with Node, web, RN)

Hi @TelegramSam - can you please add following Github ids as maintainers to https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/ repo? 

https://github.com/jadhavajay

https://github.com/matt-raffel-kiva

https://github.com/jakubkoci/

https://github.com/smithbk
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:10:17 GMT):<br/>
Hi. I'm confused now :) Shouldn't be aries-sdk-javascript and aries-framework-javascript separate project? The first would be a wrapper around Rust indy-sdk/aries-sdk library which could be used as standalone npm library. The second then is an implementation of aries-rfcs protocols.
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:11:13 GMT):<br/>
The same way aries-framework-dotnet and aries-sdk-dotnet for example
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:11:13 GMT):<br/>
The same way I understood aries-framework-dotnet and aries-sdk-dotnet for example
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:12:43 GMT):<br/>
@jakubkoci - May be my bad, but I thought we discussed about renaming and moving your repo code to aries-framework-javascript,
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:16:43 GMT):<br/>
Oh, I see. We have just misunderstanding, I thought we'll create new repo aries-framework-javascript under hyperledger github and move my code there, but we keep aries-sdk-javascript as it is.
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:17:16 GMT):<br/>
Yup, so that we can maintain both...
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:18:07 GMT):<br/>
In this case, we will have to keep the previous repo 'aries-sdk-javascript' as well 
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:22:49 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I think it's good approach, at least for now. I understand these two repos in the similar way as indy-sdk vs VCX for example.

</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:24:01 GMT):<br/>
So are you okay to merge the current agent code from your repo to this framework repo ?
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:26:04 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest to rename current aries-framework-javascript back to aries-sdk-javascript and create new empty repo aries-framework-javascript where I'll move my code. What do you think? Does it make sense? :thinking: 
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:29:08 GMT):<br/>
I am okay with either..
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:29:58 GMT):<br/>
:slight_smile:  I just that we decide it once and inform people who are helping us in renaming..

</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:30:39 GMT):<br/>
I see aries-sdk-javascript as API for low level operations with crypto, kms, dids and also for Indy ledger stuff (but I understand some of these should move away in the future as we want Aries to be ledger independent) Then we'll have dependency from aries-framework-javascript to this repo, but we (or other developer as a user) can decide to use different library for crypto for example and still utilize aries-framework stuff to handle particular Aries protocols
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:33:32 GMT):<br/>
Correct, that makes sence
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:34:44 GMT):<br/>
Could you please manage that renaming and creating repos? Then I

</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:34:52 GMT):<br/>
So to summarize, we ask for two repos..

1. aries-sdk-javascript (by renaming current aries-framework-javascript back)
2. aries-framework-javascript (new repo)

correct ?

<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:36:53 GMT):<br/>
Then I'll ask someone from community to help me with:
1. transfering the code from my repo (I guess we should probably keep history?)
2. manage licensing and other formalities
3. discuss architecture and eventually make some updates before we do it
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:37:19 GMT):<br/>
Perfect..

Hi @TelegramSam - can you please help us with this change? Sorry to bother you again...
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 11:07:13 GMT):<br/>
Just update about the current status in my repo. As I said before I implemented did-exchange and basic message with very simple routing (Alice and Bob, each with their own Agent and HTTP routing agency instance), all with in-memory storage. I already did some refactoring, but I still have a few bits in my mind I would like to finalize and make it clearer before merging. That’s the reason I delayed this step a little bit and I’m sorry I didn’t communicate it earlier. I believe it's important to have at least aligned basic structure on which we can all collaborate better.

@rjones Can we get an assist?

1. Rename aries-framework-javascript to aries-sdk-javascript (was renamed by mistake)
2. Add the following maintainers to the newly named aries-sdk-javascript repo:
https://github.com/jadhavajay
https://github.com/matt-raffel-kiva
https://github.com/jakubkoci
https://github.com/smithbk
3. create aries-framework-javascript with the same maintainers?

Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 14:03:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes, same maintainers
</p>
<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:07:06 GMT):<br/>
TBH the history is only important IF theres important information in the comments.  otherwise I don't know if we need to get too stressed about including it.   just imho
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 19:46:24 GMT):<br/>
How about the monorepo approach for aries-sdk-js ??

Hi Team ,I am thinking to develop a POC with mobile application
but i am confused ,as we have liberaries from indy as well aries. I am confused ,in what way shall i implement those liberaries. Shall i use indy liberaries for the whole Project or aries
As per my knowledge , Aries as of now doesn't have a mature library for nodejs
and also for mobile qr scanning or mobile to mobile communication we need Aries libraries
What you guys suggest ?

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Sat, 21 Dec 2019 00:26:46 GMT):<br/>
When the Aries libraries are mature enough, you should start with them instead of the Indy libraries. But the Aries JS libraries are not yet mature. It's currently just a clone of the wrapper from the Indy SDK.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Sat, 21 Dec 2019 00:27:09 GMT):<br/>
So if your goal is to get something done quickly, start with Indy and plan to migrate to Aries in the future. Otherwise, you should pitch in to help get the Aries JS framework ready for your use case.

Hi, hmm, me neither weird. That's probably a problem on the Sovrin side. I know there was a difference between https://repo.sovrin.org/repository/maven-public and https://repo.sovrin.org/repository/maven-public/ (slash at the end, but neither of it works now)

Hello, I want to demonstrate communication (connection, exchange of credentials/proof requests) between edge and cloud agents connected with the common indy-pool.
For cloud agents, I have considered using aries cloud agent python (`ACA-Py`) which will be deployed and maintained by the enterprise organizations.
As users (can be in thousands) will be interacting with these enterprise orgs, I am considering to have mobile applications which can act as edge agents for handling peer-to-peer communication with cloud agents.
I noticed that there are 2 projects available (`ARNIMA` & `rn-indy-sdk`) as open source react native sdk's for Aries and have some doubts around the same.

1. In which terms are these 2 projects different from each other as both are react native wrappers around indy-sdk? 
2. What is the maturity level for both these projects ? Can one start leveraging these project for building a mobile agent?
3. Are there any open-source implementations available which have used these sdks?
4. How is the communication handled between the edge and cloud agents? Do we need to run mediator agents for routing the messages ? 

@ajayjadhav @jakubkoci 
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Mon, 30 Mar 2020 12:50:22 GMT):<br/>
Hi @HLFPOC ,
1. These two projects are similar in nature, both are RN wrappers
2. I am not sure about `rn-indy-sdk`, however work on `ARNIMA` is active, and will soon have a release with basic consumable features
3. None, at least in my knowledge
4. Yes, the SDK will rely upon mediator/router agents for receiving messages
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Mon, 30 Mar 2020 13:39:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the update.
By when can we expect a release in ARNIMA repository, any tentative date ?
Also, hope agents built using ARNIMA will be able to talk with ACA-Py agents.

Hi, 
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 31 Mar 2020 22:06:40 GMT):<br/>
Hi,

For an SSI funding program from the EU we’re looking into a proposal that will integrate closely with aries-framework-javascript and rn-indy-sdk / ARNIMA. This would mean we could contribute quite a lot to these projects. If it is possible, we would like to have a short discussion about the current progress and the roadmap of these projects.

Is the working group call this Friday a good  place for such a discussion? Last time I wasn’t able to join. Later I found out I had different zoom link than in the wiki. Just to double check, is this the valid zoom link: https://zoom.us/j/625685050 ?

</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 12:15:23 GMT):<br/>
Hi @TimoGlastra, that sounds great. I would be happy to talk with you. This Friday call is a very good place for such discussion. The link should be correct, but it's the link @ajayjadhav provdided to us, so he probably would know better.
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 12:28:36 GMT):<br/>
`rn-indy-sdk` goal is to provide same API as indy-sdk Node.js wrapper (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/nodejs/README.md). It currently contains almost all methods you would need to implement edge/mobile agent. However, you would still need to implement Aries protocol around to be able to communicate with ACA-Py or other Aries compatible agent. There is the aries-javascript-framework for that use case, but it's currenlty in the beginnings of development.
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Fri, 03 Apr 2020 10:10:16 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, just a reminder for the call today in 20 mins. Are you going to join @ajayjadhav @TimoGlastra @gnarula ?

</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 09:02:00 GMT):<br/>
The call should start in an hour and half.

Mixed up the time, and thought it would start in 40 minutes. Is the call still going on?
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 12:43:14 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra Ouch, it was still going in that time. We can get in touch sometime next week and I'll explain to you what we discussed.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 14:23:59 GMT):<br/>
@jakubkoci I tried to join but it said the host needed to allow me to join first. If you can get in touch next week that would be great, otherwise I’ll definitely join the next call.

Hi, can anyone tell when will be the next Framework JS Meeting?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 12:38:43 GMT):<br/>
Hi @ItsOmerShafiq, we had a meeting last friday so next one will be may 15. Meetings are bi-weekly on friday 10:30 UTC. See https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/Framework+JS+Meetings
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 21:57:02 GMT):<br/>
hey all, i'm trying to investigate the current capabilities of the aries-framework-javascript. I was wondering if it's currently possible for it to generate a challenge? 
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 22:01:59 GMT):<br/>
Hi @spacemandev , I assume you mean a proof challenge? If so, no that is not supported yet. See https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/issues/39 for an (almost) up to date overview of what is implemented
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 22:02:13 GMT):<br/>
gotcha 
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 22:03:31 GMT):<br/>
and i'm assuming that since this relies on indy-sdk, this is largely meant to be an agent in cloud and not for deployment as a front end agent? 
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 22:06:56 GMT):<br/>
It is supposed to serve both use cases. Current focus is on edge agents, i.e. agents without an endpoint. The indy-sdk is pluggable and both the indy NodeJS SDK can be used and the React Native wrapper (https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk). Running in the browser is not possible yet until indy sdk can run in the browser
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 22:07:41 GMT):<br/>
Aries framework go can run in the browser via webassembly, but has no support for indy at the moment
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 22:08:24 GMT):<br/>
Where do you want to run the framework?
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 22:08:40 GMT):<br/>
so the usecase I'm hoping to work on is having a agent in the browser that can generate keys and a challenge, with a routing agent in the cloud. 
with the hope that the credential when being sent cannot be seen by the routing agent, but could be decrypted by the browser agent
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 22:09:36 GMT):<br/>
the routing agent i know i can run whatever (acapy being the one we're thinking about currently)
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 22:16:39 GMT):<br/>
If you need to run an agent in the browser I think for now the best way to go would be aries framework go compiled to wasm (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/master/cmd/aries-js-worker/README.md ) I think they support credential proofing, just not with indy. But I don’t know the details of the go implementation, so you would be better of asking in the aries-go channel 
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 22:16:57 GMT):<br/>
gotcha, no worries, thanks for your help!

The indy-sdk depends on libindy, which you must first install manually. Installation steps differ per platform: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#installing-the-sdk

<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 19:01:49 GMT):<br/>
thnx.  I guess I was expecting the indysdk package to include that

I noticed one of the items on the road map is docker files.   I have started that:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/pull/47

I am not sure what is needed.  So I have created the PR.  If someone can look it over and let me know what else is needed, I will update accordingly.

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 18 May 2020 20:05:03 GMT):<br/>

I tried fixing the dco requirement on this PR and cannot get it fixed.  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/pull/47

can someone advise?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 13:50:36 GMT):<br/>
You need to rebase, signoff and then force push: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/contributing.md#how-to-sign-off-previous-commits
</p>
<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 13:51:06 GMT):<br/>
thats what I did
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 13:52:50 GMT):<br/>
it looks like you only signed of the latest commit, not the "adding docker images that work for me"
</p>
<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 13:54:30 GMT):<br/>
I get that.  I dont get why the instructions did not solve the problem
</p>
<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 13:54:52 GMT):<br/>
its easier to delete the branch and create a new PR
</p>
<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 15:51:07 GMT):<br/>
try this:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/pull/48
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 16:17:13 GMT):<br/>
I think I've had similar problem recently. I solved it by `git rebase --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -s' -i dcec998` It signs commits from `dcec998` (excluded)
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 16:17:37 GMT):<br/>

Thanks Matt. I'll look at you PR. I think dockerization will be super helpful for developers using JS framework on the server-side :thumbup:

Hi all, from last few months I'm working on aries-mobileagent-xamarin, but now wants to migrate to React Native. Is there already any mobile agent build in React Native or anyother on the top of aries-framework-javascript?
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 12:34:24 GMT):<br/>
@davidd - ARNIMA is the agent created by AyanWorks for React Native.
Here is the repo - https://github.com/ayanworks/ARNIMA
It is not complete from overall functional perspective though but we are working on getting next version available with few more features.

Hi, there is a React Native wrapper https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk with the same API as Node.js indy-sdk wrapper https://www.npmjs.com/package/indy-sdk. It's just missing the native dependency - libindy binary built for a given platform (Android/iOS). The idea is that this indy-sdk and rn-indy-sdk should be a plugable library which you can then use with aries-framework-javascript
</p>
<p><strong>ap</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 12:22:50 GMT):<br/>
Hi @jakubkoci , I gone through that project and also try sample application as well.(https://github.com/jakubkoci/UseReactNativeIndySdk/). When I click on create wallet button, it's  through the error.

<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 10:16:18 GMT):<br/>
Hi @ap Is it on Android or iOS? Andorid should work, but iOS is missing the iOS native lib dependency I mentioned, you basically need to add Indy.framework into your iOS project.

Hi all, this is Pablo Romeu, I work for United Nations agency UNICC (https://www.unicc.org) and we are willing to create an identity solution around INDY. We already have developed a solution for UN retirees pension fund with Indy (https://www.unicc.org/in-focus/2019/11/08/unjspf-blockchain-delivers-digital-identity-to-its-beneficiaries/)  but we are looking for ways to move the wallets to the user's mobile for this, and other solutions we are willing to develop. 
- I've seen there is a project ARNIMA (I think being developed by @ajayjadhav ) on react native which is a wrapper over Aries, but, seems like it is starting right now. 
- I've seen other project rn-indy-sdk (developed by @jakubkoci ?) which is a wrapper over Indy. Which are the differences on both?
- I have not seen any native -android, iOS- development. Is that right?
Thanks in advance

Hello all, is there any NPM library to create indy wallet?
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 14:56:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi. Look at https://www.npmjs.com/package/indy-sdk. You would need also to install/build libindy binary as it's described in Installation section.
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 14:57:08 GMT):<br/>
You can find source code for this npm package at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/nodejs/README.md

Greetings everyone. I have seen great efforts for the Aries Javascript Framework. I wanted to explore the framework and test it out. To try to build an Aries Agent-cloud-wallet app for simple VC Issuing. I was wondering if this is possible, and also how to connect to the sovrin staging net ?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 16:56:33 GMT):<br/>
Hi @devexplore2020, aries-framework-javascript doesn't implement the present proof protocol and revocation yet. You can only create connections and issue-credentials at the moment. We're currently working on implementing the present-proof protocol
</p>
<p><strong>devexplore2020</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 16:57:31 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Great. So it is work in progress. How could I register and issue VC in Sovrin, via https://selfserve.sovrin.org/ ?
</p>
<p><strong>devexplore2020</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 16:58:15 GMT):<br/>
Would it be possible to build an instance of an Indy wallet in the cloud ?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:01:33 GMT):<br/>
You can use a custom ledger by specifying the `genesisPath` to the stored genesis transaction path. You can then register a did on selfserve.sovrin.org and set the `publicDidSeed` parameter in the agent config.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:02:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but the framework is not production ready at the moment. So depending on your use case it may be better to use one of the more established frameworks/agents
</p>
<p><strong>devexplore2020</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:03:41 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. You mean to setup the parameters in the run.sh of the framework code when I check it out from github ?
</p>
<p><strong>devexplore2020</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:04:24 GMT):<br/>
Hope it gets there soon. You mean production alternatives are AriesDotnet framework, ACApy and Go framework ?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:05:19 GMT):<br/>
The `run.sh` is to start a sample mediator. aries-framework-javascript provides the building blocks to build an agent yourself, but isn't usable out of the box (yet)
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:06:09 GMT):<br/>
An example is a mobile agent that depends on aries-framework-javascript: https://github.com/timoglastra/aries-mobile-agent-react-native
</p>
<p><strong>devexplore2020</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:07:52 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Thanks. So I guess I should read the getting started guide or you have some more pointers for me ? Kind regards.

Sad to say we don't have a lot of documentation yet. So it'll mostly be reading the internals of the framework and looking at the examples/tests.
</p>
<p><strong>devexplore2020</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:09:45 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @TimoGlastra
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:10:09 GMT):<br/>
It would help to be familiar with the aries protocols (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs.git), but besides that it's just what's inside the repo
</p>
<p><strong>devexplore2020</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:10:27 GMT):<br/>
So if someone asked me to build a production based Cloud wallet, the best bet at the moment would Aries Dot net Framework ?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:11:23 GMT):<br/>
Either that one or aries-cloudagent-python if you want to use Indy. But aries-framework-go is also making a lot of progress
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:11:44 GMT):<br/>
So It's hard to say whats the best bet
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:11:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>devexplore2020</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:13:04 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. So DotNetFramework is mixing Indy and Aries, and ACApy is just Indy with the controller. Sorry to bother you, I am just searching for the best way for a cloud wallet
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:29:51 GMT):<br/>
I'd suggest to take the free "Becoming a Hyperledger Aries Developer" course. It'd answer a lot of your questions I think: https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/becoming-a-hyperledger-aries-developer-lfs173/
</p>
<p><strong>devexplore2020</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:27:37 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I glanced trough that before. It was all about ACApy, will take another look

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 21 Dec 2020 15:56:16 GMT):<br/>
Hi @proteche, yes that's possible. Currently the sample mediator exposes the `/invitation` endpoint which will create a new connection invitation each time it is called

Hello team, I'm new here in the Hyperledger world :). I'm learning Indy and Aries. I've finished "Introduction to Hyperledger Sovereign Identity Blockchain Solutions: Indy, Aries & Ursa" course on edx.org written by Stephen Curran. I'm currently learning "Becoming a Hyperledger Aries Developer" course on edx.org written by Stephen Curran.

My goal is to build an identity network using Indy and build mobile app for the mobile agents. I know React Native, so I want to build my mobile agents in React Native. I'm following the ReadMe in the github, but I'm still lost :).

Can I consume Aries Framework JS in React Native? if yes, do you all have any documents that I can learn from in how to do this?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 09:48:25 GMT):<br/>
Hi @vosrey, nice to have you here! I can understand you're a bit lost, the README does not contain a lot of info yet, just the bare minimum to get you started. The answer is yes, but not without a hassle. We're currently building a reference implementation of a mobile agent in React Native that consumes Aries Framework JavaScript (https://github.com/animo/aries-mobile-agent-react-native). It uses `rn-indy-sdk` (https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk) under the hood to provide the indy API in react native. Couple of notes however:
- Aries Framework JavaScript does not have the present proof protocol yet (we're working on this)

Hi @TimoGlastra, @jakubkoci, and others, Indicio is looking to utilize and contribute to `rn-indy-sdk`. We've seen a number of different implementations working towards utilizing the `indy-sdk` from a React Native environment and we would like to point to one implementation to the focus the community's work and contributions. I have a question or two for you:
For iOS, is there a centralized place in which the iOS `Indy.framework` files are currently already being placed? If not, is there value in placing this inside of `rn-indy-sdk`, given that the sovrin repo does not contain the latest indy versions? We'd be happy to run through the effort of manually building for 1.15.0, however we'd rather not duplicate work already performed. 
Is there intentions of performing a new release (v0.1.8?) containing this logging bug fix for Android? (https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk/commit/6bfb07735543e4205d725a9d7087efa7f59fe54b) This would be needed for utilizing 1.15.0 of the `indy-sdk` via the `rn-indy-sdk` versions. 
Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 15 Feb 2021 19:18:34 GMT):<br/>
Hi @JamesEbert, great to hear you want to contribute to rn-indy-sdk! I think @jakubkoci could do a better job at answering but I'll do my best. 
1. No there's no central place yet where we host the `Indy.framework`. We've had some discussions about it and agree that we want to have a place to download but not sure where. If you're just looking for an `Indy.framework` build for 1.15.0 you can grab it from our mobile agent repo: https://github.com/animo/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/tree/develop/ios/Pods/Frameworks. It's built with Swift 5.(3?) I believe. 
2. Yes a new release was already on the todo list because we've made also made some additional changes that are not released yet.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 15 Feb 2021 19:20:26 GMT):<br/>
Question to you out of curiosity: are you planning to utilise aries-framework-javascript, or just rn-indy-sdk?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Mon, 15 Feb 2021 19:25:54 GMT):<br/>
Awesome! We will utilize the 1.15.0 via the link provided while the mentioned discussion are in progress. Let me know if Indicio could be of benefit in that effort or in other ways.
As of right now we are planning on just utilizing rn-indy-sdk to swap out our existing implementation for the indy-sdk.

</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 20:53:22 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for the delay with relase and late response, but I think Timo answered perfectly :thumbsup: It would be nic to have some CI  process to build native libindy dependency for both iOS and Android. Ideally to have Pod containing link to Indy.framework and Android AAR file. The place where to put these artifacts is still in question :)

Hi all, I was trying to get a AriesJS agent to use a .NET mediator and couldn't get it to work. I didn't dive too deep in, but it looks like the response from the .NET mediator during provision() is not what AriesJS is expecting. I realize it could just be compatibility issues, so I wanted to check with the group before I keep going whether this is a known issue.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 10:35:06 GMT):<br/>
Hi @jacobsaur, that's correct. We have two problems here:
- Aries Framework JavaScript doesn't fully support the mediator coordination protocol yet. @JamesEbert is working on this
- Aries Framework .NET uses its own protocol to do mediation, so it'll only work with .NET mediators.

Once we have full mediator support in AFJ, you should at least be able to use ACA-Py. However I don't think that .NET will implement the mediator coordination protocol anytime soon
</p>

<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Mon, 05 Apr 2021 16:43:29 GMT):<br/>

We got to the point where it was working in Android. We made the necessary changes in rn-indy-sdk for Android, not yet for iOS: https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk/pull/42
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 05 Apr 2021 20:02:01 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 20:44:33 GMT):<br/>
Aries Framework JavaScript can from now on be installed from the NPM registry. This should solve a lot of the inconveniences caused by manually packing the framework: See https://www.npmjs.com/package/aries-framework for installation instructions
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 21:04:37 GMT):<br/>
Awesome, thank you for diving in and getting this set up Timo!
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 21:06:20 GMT):<br/>
BTW -- aries-framework-javascript was already taken as an org name, so I went with `aries-framework`. A lot easier when the decision is taken away from you!
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 21:07:32 GMT):<br/>
Haha yes I saw in the PR! Definitely made the decision a lot easier! :laughing:

Can I inquire as to the issue with proposing presentations in AFJ? Or at least from an AFJ -> ACA-Py perspective (since that's theoretically failing in the AATH). I've been looking into it but haven't quite figured out everything yet.

</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:03:04 GMT):<br/>
I wasn't aware it's failing
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:03:30 GMT):<br/>
Any ∂etails/error logs?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:04:06 GMT):<br/>
Maybe I misunderstood the following at https://aries-interop.info/javascript.html#runset-acapy-afj: "All AIP10 tests are currently running, except for the tests with the holder proposing a proof, as that feature is not supported in AFJ."
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:04:38 GMT):<br/>
That's not correct. I think that's taken from the .NET. It should be supported
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:04:46 GMT):<br/>
Maybe it's not working however
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:05:29 GMT):<br/>
Ahh cool. 
In particular, I am sending a proposal, and I am not receiving a request quite as expected. Perhaps I am forming it incorrectly..
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:05:55 GMT):<br/>
Is AFJ creating the proposal?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:06:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:06:18 GMT):<br/>
Can you share the logs/input/output data
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:39:14 GMT):<br/>
Sorry--blew up my env.
This is my proposal:
"message": {
    "@type": "https://didcomm.org/present-proof/1.0/propose-presentation",
    "@id": "4fe451f3-f247-409c-8840-be92363b8799",
    "presentation_proposal": {
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name": "patient_first_name",
          "cred_def_id": "[cred_id_here]"
        },
        {
          "name": "patient_last_name",
          "cred_def_id": "[cred_id_here]"
        },
        {
          "name": "patient_date_of_birth",
          "cred_def_id": "[cred_id_here]"
        },
        {
          "name": "result",
          "cred_def_id": "[cred_id_here]"
        },
        {
          "name": "observation_date_time",
          "cred_def_id": "[cred_id_here]"
        }
      ],
      "predicates": []
    }
  }

And this is the corresponding request:
name: "proof-request"
nonRevoked: undefined
nonce: "536859494871115220516756"
requestedAttributes:
0_patient_first_name_uuid: ProofAttributeInfo {name: "patient_first_name", restrictions: Array(1), nonRevoked: undefined}

4_observation_date_time_uuid: ProofAttributeInfo {name: "observation_date_time", restrictions: Array(1), nonRevoked: undefined}

requestedPredicates: {}
version: "1.0"
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:43:40 GMT):<br/>
I guess the issue is that the referent is different when I do a proposal vs when I just do a request
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:44:52 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, this appears to be working mostly as expected--besides the referent change. Is the referent differences expected behavior?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:46:27 GMT):<br/>
Are you using `getRequestedCredentialsForProofRequest`?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:46:43 GMT):<br/>
If so, it probably has something to do with that method
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:47:03 GMT):<br/>
It gives different results if a presentation proposal is present
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:48:02 GMT):<br/>
Interesting.. I guess my thoughts were that ACA-Py was returning an altered referent, which I thought was peculiar.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:48:14 GMT):<br/>
Anyways, thank you, this is helpful
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:48:46 GMT):<br/>
What do you exactly mean by different referent?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:49:03 GMT):<br/>
Seems like both proposal and request use the same attributes names
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:49:15 GMT):<br/>
The proposal has no referents yet
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:50:16 GMT):<br/>
Exactly--in the request you create referents, in the proposal you don't. So how should you access the data in a consistent manner between the two (from the ACA-Py as a verifier perspective)?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:52:19 GMT):<br/>
You can match the data based on the property names. Referents are only required for the presentation submission for indy
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:52:57 GMT):<br/>
so the request includes them so I can include them in the proof I create
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:53:06 GMT):<br/>
Proposal doesn't make use of indy so doesn't use the referents
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:53:24 GMT):<br/>
Hmmmm
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:54:44 GMT):<br/>
Okay so it's essentially just different in this case because of Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:54:55 GMT):<br/>
That at least makes sense, thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:54:55 GMT):<br/>
That at least makes sense, thank you for the clarification.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:57:05 GMT):<br/>
This is changed in V2 and you know use the same format as a proof request I believe: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0592-indy-attachments/README.md#proof-request-format
</p>

Hey team! David from Indicio here. We're working to make the push for Mediation (in the context of a mobile client) to be at least in MVP stage soon. I know a few of us have been looking at it and working on parts of it. @burdettadam has been doing a lot of the heavy lifting so far, and we have some progress that has been made. We'd love to get a few people to review what's been done to give us feedback on it to make sure that it's going in the right direction. Also, if you have personal or professional interest in using it in a project, maybe we could divide up some of tasks?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 04 May 2021 19:36:55 GMT):<br/>
Hi David! Great to hear the progress. I'll definitely take a look at the current state of the mediation PR and provide some feedback
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 04 May 2021 19:37:55 GMT):<br/>
Maybe we go over the remaining tasks during the next WG call?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 04 May 2021 19:39:14 GMT):<br/>
I'm currently busy with some other tasks, but we're going to need it for a project in the somewhat near future
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 04 May 2021 19:39:26 GMT):<br/>
Would be good to have a clear overview of the remaining pieces
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 05 May 2021 07:47:59 GMT):<br/>
I second the desire to have a clear overview of the remaining pieces. I think going over this in the next WG call seems like a good idea to me. 
I'm aiming to get this completed soon too--as we also have projects in need of it soon.
</p>
<p><strong>david.clawson</strong> (Wed, 05 May 2021 16:17:45 GMT):<br/>
I saw that you sent in feedback, thank you! I'll look at it today, and we can talk about it tomorrow.

@PabloRomeu just so you're aware I've \href{https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk/pull/52}{\submitted a PR} to rn-indy-sdk to add present-proof support to iOS from the holder. I'll need to do the verify proof as a second PR.

Hi all, we have spotted a performance problem in ACA-py managing connections (my team will fill in a bug report soon). We may need to move to the DID Exchange Protocol - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0023-did-exchange - to avoid it. Is that implemented in AFJ?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 15:55:45 GMT):<br/>
Not yet -- but we definitely want to support it. We would also need to support Out-Of-Band protocol
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 15:56:31 GMT):<br/>
Is this something you or your team would like contribute to?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 18:50:53 GMT):<br/>
I am definitely looking to this too, but I'm unsure as to how soon we'd be able to assist in these two efforts. @TimoGlastra are there any other prerequisites for these two features in AFJ we would need to consider?
</p>
<p><strong>david.clawson</strong> (Fri, 21 May 2021 19:52:20 GMT):<br/>
Hey, AFJ team - has anyone gotten the docker command: 

docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-mediators.yml up -d

to work with an M1 Mac (ARM-64 architecture)? We've been working at it for a while, and are having issues getting indy-sdk to compile/work.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Fri, 21 May 2021 21:51:31 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure, but I'm guessing this is an issue at the Indy-SDK level.. so my thoughts would be to raise an issue in the indy-sdk repository.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 02 Jun 2021 10:15:13 GMT):<br/>
Yup I think we need to build the indy-sdk specifically for the M1 Mac. Not sure how to do this...

Hey all, in one of the latest versions of AFJ the agent init config requires a fileSystem class but that class is not being exported by AFJ. How should we go about with this problem/initializing an agent?
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 10 Jun 2021 08:44:47 GMT):<br/>
Hi Patrick. Sorry for inconveniences. Easiest solution would be just recommend copy-paste the class from the framework into your project. I did the same with aries-framework-javascript/src/storage/fs/ReactNativeFileSystem.ts for example.
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 10 Jun 2021 08:44:47 GMT):<br/>
Hi Patrick. Sorry for the inconvenience. The easiest solution right now would be just to copy-paste the class from the framework into your project. I did the same with `aries-framework-javascript/src/storage/fs/ReactNativeFileSystem.ts` for example.
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 10 Jun 2021 08:45:57 GMT):<br/>
We will fix this soon.
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 10 Jun 2021 08:51:33 GMT):<br/>
We're planing to split the framework into more packages and then put those platform-dependent parts of code into standalone package that could be used as a whole. Let's say for React Native you would install @aries-framework/react-native and call `new Agent({ ..., nativeDependencies: reactNativePackage})`
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 10 Jun 2021 12:26:48 GMT):<br/>
You can import it from the build directory. Because of platform specific imports we can't export it from the root package. See https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/blob/main/docs/setup-react-native.md#agent-setup for react native

Not yet, but it's definitely on the roadmap to automatically generate docs
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 18:15:50 GMT):<br/>
Do you have suggestions on this topic?
</p>
<p><strong>burdettadam</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 18:21:31 GMT):<br/>
nope, I am looking to write some documentation and wanted to follow convention. TypeDoc (https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc) sure does look nice.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 18:24:45 GMT):<br/>
Yeah we've done small testing with it recently (https://blu3beri.github.io/) but haven't invested the time yet to publish it
</p>
<p><strong>burdettadam</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 18:27:31 GMT):<br/>
no rush. I will make a readme in the module and links in the documents. I will update as needed to conform with future docs conventions. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 18:29:17 GMT):<br/>
Could you add it to the news docs/getting-started directory
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 18:29:25 GMT):<br/>
Not sure if this is already in your branch
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 18:29:45 GMT):<br/>
But we have one for routing that would be a great fit for mediation documentation I think
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Thu, 17 Jun 2021 14:01:22 GMT):<br/>

Hi Devs. I created a top level diagrams for an epic of receiving an issued credential from issuer
Please modify the document with the AFJ missing apis that should complete the business logic
https://lucid.app/lucidchart/invitations/accept/inv_f6076e23-cb5b-4fd7-9e9c-922fc6c3486d?viewport_loc=-403%2C1232%2C1629%2C1056%2C0_0
</p>
<p><strong>moosops</strong> (Tue, 13 Jul 2021 15:40:28 GMT):<br/>
I also ment to set auto accept invitation to false to create a logic where user should view the credential details first and have the option to click accept
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 16:44:40 GMT):<br/>
Are you at the AFJ call tomorrow @moosops ? We can go over the diagram and fill in the missing pieces
</p>
<p><strong>moosops</strong> (Thu, 15 Jul 2021 11:40:27 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 15 Jul 2021 21:01:00 GMT):<br/>
I just merged the PR to switch to a monorepo and successfully released the following packages:
- `@aries-framework/core` 0.1.0-alpha.0 - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aries-framework/core
- `@aries-framework/node` 0.1.0-alpha.0 - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aries-framework/node
- `@aries-framework/react-native` 0.1.0-alpha.0 - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aries-framework/react-native

Once we complete support for AIP 1.0 and finish a few ongoing work items, we'll make the first sort of stable release under 0.1.0. Documentation is not fully up-to-date yet, but @moosops is working on this!
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 16 Jul 2021 09:56:24 GMT):<br/>

I believe Trinsic's generated invitations don't match the current Aries rfc url format, I've been meaning to reach out and identify a solution here.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 12:03:44 GMT):<br/>
I believe It's an URL shortened version. I also had issues with connecting the Trinsic wallet to AFJ, but making the url request return an invitation JSON object did the trick I believe. Guess it also works this way the other way around (so we should do a HTTP request in the mobile agent as described in here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0434-outofband/README.md#url-shortening)
</p>
<p><strong>genaris</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 14:34:43 GMT):<br/>
Hi guys (especially @TimoGlastra as has been recently working on indy-sdk type definition) ,

I'd like to implement `registerPublicDid` method in AFJ's ledger module, and in order to do so I need to update types/indy-sdk from DefinitelyTyped to define `buildNymRequest`. No problem with that but I'm struggling when trying to use the `NymRole` enum that is defined there (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/cc94a59c9f4244b50b6cc46acad46f75fd10aec7/types/indy-sdk/index.d.ts#L636). It seems that enums defined in d.ts files are lost at runtime if not defined in underlying JS module (unless defined as const enum, but this is not allowed in DefinitelyTyped project). Also, as far as I can see in the wrapper, indy-sdk actually uses string for roles instead of numbers.
I'm thinking on removing NymRole enum from indy-sdk and putting it in AFJ's ledger module (not ideal because it's Indy specific, but it'll work). What do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 15:03:25 GMT):<br/>
It's my pleasure to announce that Absa donated React Native Indy SDK wrapper to Hyperledger. The code has been transferred from https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk to https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk-react-native preserving all contributions. Although it’s just a wrapper, if you combine it with Aries Framework JavaScript you’ll get the power to build an Aries agent mobile app. If you were a contributor to the rn-indy-sdk, please create a new fork from the new repository to continue the development. Thanks for understanding, and looking forward to collaboration with all of you.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 15:15:41 GMT):<br/>
Interesting. If indy-sdk actually uses string values, can't we use that instead of the numbers. Then we could type it like this:
```
type NymRole = 'TRUSTEE' | 'STEWARD' | 'TRUST_ANCHOR' | 'ENDORSER' | 'NETWORK_MONITOR'
```
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 15:16:21 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise I think the approach as you mentioned sounds good to me
</p>
<p><strong>genaris</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 15:39:27 GMT):<br/>
Well that's a nice catch because I was only looking at the expected data type from indy sdk wrapper (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/113b79cd64a238130d20e19b972326f72047c550/wrappers/nodejs/src/indy.cc#L1671) and sending the numeric value (i.e. '101'), which worked fine in my tests.

But, after your answer, I looked at indy sdk nodejs wrapper tests and it seems that you are right that they use 'friendly names' (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/e80e7092e4f3232b3ddf6841cd56619487e79eb0/wrappers/nodejs/test/ledger.js#L37), which is aligned with Rust implementation for buildNymRequest. However, GET NYM does return the numeric value for role (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/dbd89cf94a73e7a62611c4150a874c38b810ff8d/libindy/src/api/ledger.rs#L444) :exploding_head: 

So I will check it and probably go with your approach, that'd be simple and clear. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 17:37:17 GMT):<br/>
There's been a lot of additions lately :rocket: --we've got a case where the pool is only being opened once fetching the cred def at time of issuance (which is slowing down that process considerably). Was there an addition to allow for lazy loading of the pool as well as wallet? If not, any insight why this might be occurring @TimoGlastra @jakubkoci ?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 17:39:08 GMT):<br/>
Agreed--although once fetched the invitation still uses `?d_m=` instead of `?c_i=`, which would require a special check to parse correctly into JSON, right?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 18:02:27 GMT):<br/>
Should be doable. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/issues/400
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 18:04:55 GMT):<br/>
Not in place yet. before it did this in the agent.initialize method, however I removed it because it impacted agent startup quite heavily.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 18:08:10 GMT):<br/>
What we can do is initiating the opening of the ledger on startup, without waiting for the connecting to complete? Should probably make it a config option, as we should limit automatically intiating actions that require internet
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 18:08:55 GMT):<br/>
I think this would be a good addition (and straightforwad to do)
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 18:09:02 GMT):<br/>
I had noticed this slow down as well. And I agree on this strategy--it'd give options. In particular not waiting for it to complete seems wise to me
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 18:10:07 GMT):<br/>
Is this something you'll be able to look at?
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 18:12:14 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I could take a look at this
</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 18:12:54 GMT):<br/>
What's your thoughts on how to tackle not waiting for it to complete? Just not do an async await, and throw errors/warnings as appropriate?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 18:28:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes I think so
</p>

Hi!
Is aries-javascript only for react native clients? Or is it also for node servers to set up a mediator agent for example?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 26 Jul 2021 14:03:40 GMT):<br/>
Hi @aspannag . It can be used for both Node.JS and React Native. If you clone the repo and install dependencies (yarn install), you can then run an example mediator using “yarn run-mediator”
</p>
<p><strong>aspannag</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 08:35:19 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra thanks for the answer. Good to know :thumbsup: 
Can you explain what would be the difference / advantage / disadvantage of using aries-javascript over vcxagencynode?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 11:54:12 GMT):<br/>
Sure! Aries Framework JavaScript tries to deliver a cross-platform javascript implementation of Aries. VCX does the same, but by writing the core in Rust, and exposing it through FFI wrappers. What we've noticed is that writing everything in Rust is that it makes it possible to expose your code in multiple languages, however it adds a lot of complexity. Writing Rust is hard, and writing wrappers is tedious. By implementing as much as possible in JavaScript it becomes a lot easier to extend and maintain the framework
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 11:55:11 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK vcx agency node does not support the mediator coordination protocol (I could be wrong here), meaning you need to use with with vcx
</p>
<p><strong>aspannag</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:56:25 GMT):<br/>
Alright. I think I understand the idea now. Does that matter for me as an application developer that is merely using the frameworks? I guess features are more readily available on aries-javascript because development is faster and easier? What is the advantage of vcx then?
</p>
<p><strong>aspannag</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:34:58 GMT):<br/>
I guess the advantage of vcx is that it's c-callable and can be used both on the server as well as the (mobile) client.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:40:42 GMT):<br/>
AFJ can also be used on both mobile and server side. Node.JS for server side, and React Native for iOS + Android. The advantage of a c-callable library is that you can use it in any language you like. You can't use AFJ in a native iOS or Android app, and also can't use it directly in a Go application. For us this is fine, we build our mobile apps in react native and use Node.JS for server side (or ACA-Py). But for a lot of companies this may be a limitation. E.g. If you're an identity service provider you want to serve all your customers, independant of the language your customers use. Writing the core in rust / as a c-callable library makes this possible
</p>
<p><strong>aspannag</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:43:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I see. I think that clears up some of the confusion I had. For us it's a requirement to write native app code (i.e. we start with ios). So I guess we can only go for vcx and call it inside swift/objective-c.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:44:40 GMT):<br/>
Also: JavaScript is sometimes seen as insecure. Writing the logic in Rust and only exposing the public API can help with JavaScript security issues. We're still using c-callable libraries under the hood for crypto, so I don't see this as a direct limitation. Another one may be performance. Node.JS for server side is not the most performant (it's a scripting language)
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:45:16 GMT):<br/>
I'll see if we can add a "Why AFJ" section to the docs in the readme. I think this will be useful to others as well
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:46:58 GMT):<br/>
Yeah If you need to write a native iOS app, AFJ isn't the right tool
</p>
<p><strong>aspannag</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:48:20 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. That is very helpful. I think including sections like "Why AFJ" with tradeoffs can be super helpful. I feel like the aries/indy space is almost impenetrable for outsiders :slight_smile:
</p>

Can you clear up this point? Why would it matter to me as an identity service provider in which language I serve my clients? Isn't the protocoll responsible for ensuring interoperability?

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:55:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes! I mean for example Trinsic. They offer a proprietary mobile sdk that allows you to build mobile wallets. The want this to be available in as many languages and platforms. Writing this is a language that you can compile to a c-callable library means you can reuse the same core for all languages and platforms and just expose a nice wrapper for the platform/language

Any ideas as to why rn-indy-sdk would be parsing errors incorrectly? I'm thinking it may be a Hermes issues, but I'm unsure.
`{ a: 'IndyError',

I think it should be possible for developer to call `agent.ledger.connect` and handle the connection whenever he wants. We had the same issues as you both described with aries-vcx. Now, we handling the connection by ourself and it works well.

Hi team, I'll not be able to attend today but please tell me what exactly should I do with the PR for the "agent setup" to get it merged. I need to continue on other documentation. I am a bit confused since it was only 1 file that I changed now it shows something like 60+ files

<p><strong>sairanjit</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 13:16:10 GMT):<br/>
Hi team , I am facing issue after connection with afj web socket mediator when I try to connect other agents I am getting the error *Only HTTP(S) protocols are supported*
as I am using the web socket I have mediator endpoint something like this wss://664e-103-132-171-2.ngrok.io How can we solve this issue ?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:48:53 GMT):<br/>
Are you using the latest version of AFJ? We just merged support for using multiple transports, so you can use both HTTPS and WS for the mediator
</p>
<p><strong>sairanjit</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:49:33 GMT):<br/>
Actually I am trying to use a custom agent for the same
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:50:37 GMT):<br/>
So you're using a custom agent + an AFJ mediator?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:51:17 GMT):<br/>
The problem is that the mediator only supports websockets, so other agents that do not support WebSockets cannot talk to the mediator. If the mediator supports both HTTP and WebSockets that would be fine
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:51:52 GMT):<br/>
Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem
</p>
<p><strong>sairanjit</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:55:46 GMT):<br/>
Okay so I have to use a mediator which supports websockets and http both got it now I will try this and give update 
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:56:14 GMT):<br/>
Exactly
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:56:24 GMT):<br/>
The sample mediator has been updated: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/blob/main/samples/mediator.ts

How are you retrieving messages?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 17:03:57 GMT):<br/>
Specifically, are you using the implicit or explicit pickup mechanism?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 17:04:43 GMT):<br/>
It seems like you're using the implicit method (by opening a websocket and sending a trust ping). This is not supported by the AFJ mediator ATM
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 17:05:07 GMT):<br/>
You need to send a batch pickup message (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0212-pickup/README.md#batch-pickup)

<p><strong>sairanjit</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 18:39:46 GMT):<br/>

Also, @TimoGlastra, I know you and Berend were looking at/asking about self attested presentations at one point, I've been meaning to share the code we had used to make that happen in the Cardea Holder: https://github.com/thecardeaproject/cardea-mobile-holder/blob/main/components/Workflow/index.js#L321
It's a bit of a mess and we're on a verry old version of AFJ (0.0.5-unstable.0), so we've come a long way and need to get this back up to speed too. I think we're going to need to revamp some of the presentations code, especially for more stuff to do with self-attested attributes. Currently I don't think we have any mechanism available to do self attested *and* verifiable attributes in the same request. But perhaps that can be of use to you guys. :)

We are having some problems when connecting with aries-js-agent (Bob) to findy-agent (Acme). aries-js-agent reports `Connection in connection response is not signed with same key as recipient key in invitation`, this happens when aries-js-agent has received the connection response for the connection request. As the connection succeeds with acapy+findy-agent and dotnet+findy-agent, I am wondering how does the js-agent implementation differ?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 12 Oct 2021 15:11:41 GMT):<br/>
Hi @lauravuo-techlab , AFAIK all agents check for this (they should be), so maybe it's something we did wrong on the AFJ side
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 12 Oct 2021 15:13:04 GMT):<br/>
We check whether the verkey used in the invitation is the same as the verkey used to sign the connection response message. Could you verify for me that you're signing the connection response with the same key as the key used in the invitation?

```
    // Per the Connection RFC we must check if the key used to sign the connection~sig is the same key
    // as the recipient key(s) in the connection invitation message
    const signerVerkey = message.connectionSig.signer
    const invitationKey = connectionRecord.getTags().invitationKey
    if (signerVerkey !== invitationKey) {
      throw new AriesFrameworkError(
        'Connection object in connection response message is not signed with same key as recipient key in invitation'
      )
    }
```
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 12 Oct 2021 15:14:25 GMT):<br/>
We should probably improve that message to include the verkeys to see the difference
</p>
<p><strong>lauravuo-techlab</strong> (Tue, 12 Oct 2021 15:35:58 GMT):<br/>

Our implementation was actually using different keys, so the problem could be fixed in our side. Now we have all supported findy (default) - javascript (bob) cases passing. However, there seems to be an issue the other way around js (default) - findy (bob). For example with test `@T001-RFC0036`, when js agent receives the credential request, the execution stops without any errors in the logs i.e. findy-agent does not receive the reply for the request:

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 18 Oct 2021 10:11:55 GMT):<br/>
That is great to hear @lauravuo-techlab On the other issue, improving the logging is still something on our todo list. What I often try to do is enabling the indy sdk logger to see if there are any problems at the indy level
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 18 Oct 2021 10:13:08 GMT):<br/>
In the entry of the javascript backchannel (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness/blob/main/aries-backchannels/javascript/server/src/index.ts), below the import statements, above the `bootstrap` method add the following:
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 18 Oct 2021 10:13:19 GMT):<br/>
indy.setLogger(function (level, target, message, modulePath, file, line) {
    console.log('libindy said:', level, target, message, modulePath, file, line)
})
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 18 Oct 2021 10:13:19 GMT):<br/>
```
indy.setLogger(function (level, target, message, modulePath, file, line) {
    console.log('libindy said:', level, target, message, modulePath, file, line)
})
```
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 18 Oct 2021 10:13:56 GMT):<br/>
Also make sure to import indy-sdk: 
```
import * as indy from 'indy-sdk'
```

Where are release versions tracked for AFJ?
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Fri, 29 Oct 2021 19:18:17 GMT):<br/>
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aries-framework/core
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Fri, 29 Oct 2021 19:27:08 GMT):<br/>
I guess the reason why I ask is that there is no longer a correspondence between the GitHub release tags and the NPM package version.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 29 Oct 2021 20:35:28 GMT):<br/>
Yeah we should get that fixed somehow. Basically what we did first was create a github release for every commit. This is not really sustainable so what we're doing now is create a release on NPM for every commit (currently on latest tag under alpha version). Soon we will release 0.1.0 after which a new github release will be made, and 0.1.0 will be released to NPM under latest tag. From there we will still release on every commit but under a prerelease tag to NPM, but also won't create a Github release.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 29 Oct 2021 20:36:31 GMT):<br/>
If we only create releases for actual released it becomes a lot easier to track what has changed since the previous release. But it does complicate the tracking for prereleases a bit
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 29 Oct 2021 20:37:24 GMT):<br/>
Basically every commit is a release, so you can look at the commit history and count back the changes (if latest release is 289 and you're on 284 the last 5 commits is what has chnaged)
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Fri, 29 Oct 2021 20:38:17 GMT):<br/>
Ah ok that makes sense then. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Fri, 29 Oct 2021 20:38:42 GMT):<br/>
Following that it's easy for me to see what has changed between each pre-release

Hi Team, Has anyone taken a clone of AFJ in local and build the local repository and linked the core and node packages to use it as a demo, in place of the core and node packages downloaded from npm?
</p>
<p><strong>HarshMultani</strong> (Fri, 05 Nov 2021 15:49:01 GMT):<br/>
For me I am not able to register the inbound transport when i am using the local repo.
</p>
<p><strong>HarshMultani</strong> (Fri, 05 Nov 2021 15:49:42 GMT):<br/>
But when i download it from NPM, I am able to register the inbound transport and able to establish connection?
</p>
<p><strong>HarshMultani</strong> (Fri, 05 Nov 2021 15:50:53 GMT):<br/>
I have made changes to the local AFJ and want to use that. The error it gives is that "Argument of type 'HttpInboundTransport' is not assignable to parameter of type 'InboundTransport'." --- During a registerInboundTransport.
</p>
<p><strong>HarshMultani</strong> (Fri, 05 Nov 2021 15:51:05 GMT):<br/>
I have "strictFunctionTypes": false, in tsconfig.json, still It is giving me that issue.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 05 Nov 2021 16:30:05 GMT):<br/>
I think there is something going wrong with the linking. The `@aries-framework/node` package uses `@aries-framewor/core` internally. I suspect it is using the version of `@aries-framework/core` from NPM but you are using your local version of AFJ yourself? Not sure but it sounds like you have two versions of core. I have successfully used a local build of AFJ in the past using yarn link
</p>

Quick question about handling URL shortening and redirecting in the context of connection-less and OOB requests. From the perspective of AFJ, and if in the future AFJ will handle shortened URLs directly in the framework, should the redirect end with the JSON payload of the invitation/request in the response body or is AFJ always expecting to get the long URL from the header in the redirect (whether this is in base64 or JSON format)? The reason I ask is in relation to  the notes in this RFC: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0434-outofband#url-shortening. I'm seeking to align implementations from the sender.

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 20:19:52 GMT):<br/>
I think it should indeed be a JSON object, so if you have influence on the sender side that would probably be the best solution

Hello all! We are looking to support JSON-LD attachment formats (Aries Issue/Proof v2) using the Aries Mobile Agent React Native. As it uses Aries Javascript, our understanding is that we should be looking for this support in aries-javascript. Quick search reveals that this is already part of the Roadmap (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/discussions/430). Two main questions: has this work already started? If not, do you have some understanding (ideally, a ballpark estimate) about the efforts required? One viable option for us might be to support the development.

Hi @versus! To answer your questions:

> has this work already started? If not, do you have some understanding (ideally, a ballpark estimate) about the efforts required?
Yes the work has just started and will see a lot of attention in the coming weeks. The efforts required are quite big. We need add support for multiple protocols and also support a new credential type. 

> One viable option for us might be to support the development.
We always welcome new contributions!

If possible, maybe you can join the AFJ working group call tomorrow?

Alice-Faber demo in ACA-Py has been incredibly valuable. It's a great introduction, a great testbed as PRs are reviewed (does Alice Faber still work???) and has been very good for adding introducing new capabilities (revocation, multi-tenancy) with simple working controller code.  Well worth the effort -- kudos especially to @ianco for making sure it is always a part of the evolution of the framework!

Any advice would be wellcome.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 25 Nov 2021 15:15:40 GMT):<br/>
AFJ is mostly used as the basis of a mobile wallet.  You can look at Aries Bifold -- a react native wallet. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 25 Nov 2021 15:16:20 GMT):<br/>
If you want to build server based agents, you probably want to use another framework (such as Aries Cloud Agent Python) and build your controller (the business logic) in JavaScript.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 26 Nov 2021 19:27:04 GMT):<br/>
In the Canadian group, we've been talking about how to make VCs display nicely in the wallet for users, and how to ensure we have localization at the credential layer -- e.g. displaying localized attribute labels without resorting to code in the wallet that is credential-type specific.

@Jason.Leach and I have produced a summary of the topic and approaches we can take:  https://hackmd.io/YKAPlPxxQ1S5gzV9YrSVsA?view. I'm pretty sure whatever solution we choose will be implemented at the AFJ layer.

In that document, we summarize the problem for AnonCreds, and the two core issues -- how the issuer can make metadata about each credential type available to the Wallet (and verifiers) and what format we could/should use for that metadata.

As you will see, one of the options is the "Overlays Capture Architecture" that has been floating around the community for a few years. The more I scanned the specification (linked in the document above) the happier I was with it – if the tooling is there to use it. Key things that I was reminded of when reading about OCA, beyond the multi-lingual labels:

- flags on “PII” data so that the wallet can say to the holder – “hey, do you really want to share this data element?”
- An “information” overlay that allows the issuers to provide information about each attribute – allowing either direct display or a “?” icon to display more for the user.
- The label overlay includes a “grouping” concept with labels for the groups, so that the presentation can go beyond just a flat list of values.

There's more, but those are the most directly applicable to the Wallet use case.

Fun stuff that I’m sure the UX folks would love, while removing any sort of credential-specific code in the wallet. 

I'd be interested in any feedback from folks on the ideas presented.

(and where should tests for new V2 credentials go?)
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:22:31 GMT):<br/>
Good question! In general the root `tests` directory contains e2e tests that start complete agent setups (including HTTP / Websocket servers). The `tests` directory in the `core` directory contains tests that test a complete flow (issuing credential, verifying proof, connecting to a mediator, etc...) and can integrate with an external service (such as the ledger). The tests in the `__tests__` directories are mostly unit tests that mock external functionality
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:23:28 GMT):<br/>
We should probably reorganize the tests a bit, but I think it is nice that we have different kinds of tests separated
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:24:32 GMT):<br/>
To answer your last question. V2 unit tests should go into the `__tests__` directory of the `credentials` module. If you're testing the whole flow it should probably go into `packages/core/tests`
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:26:22 GMT):<br/>
This is really great @Jason.Leach @swcurran ! I'm not really familiar yet with OCA so will do some reading on it first, but looks very promising
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:45:49 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks for the explanation. I'll probably just separate the tests into V1 and V2 for now under the current folders.

<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:47:00 GMT):<br/>
One more question; looking through the code at the V1 Indy stuff and it doesn't look that different from V2. What are the main differences?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:48:47 GMT):<br/>
AFAIk there's no difference. The difference is in the protocol, and where the indy specific data should live.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:49:51 GMT):<br/>
We currently have indy logic directly in the credentialservice, that's why we now want to use format specific handlers for it
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:52:22 GMT):<br/>
you mean that outer layer DIDcomm message wrapper?
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 15:15:49 GMT):<br/>
ok I'll keep that in mind

Hi Guys, I want to know, is anyone working on the proof service test cases. I saw that currently, it is not present in the proof module. Should I write test cases for problem-report in the proofs?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 14:41:07 GMT):<br/>
I think we never got to implementing those. It would be great if you can add tests!

Hey folks, trying to identify what PR/commit version 0.1.0-alpha.289 corresponds to? I _think_ it's https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/pull/479, however I am not certain on that as the release are not tied to the code unfortunately. Any insight here @TimoGlastra ?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:41:24 GMT):<br/>

In the future if you want to determine which commit belongs to which release you can do the following:
1. calculate total commit count in AFJ from github UI or by running `git rev-list --count main`
2. get differnence between total count and the version you want to know: (e.g. 319 - 289)
3. run `git rev-list --max-count 30 main` where you replace 30 with the number from the previous step
4. the most bottom commit-sha is the commit that belongs to your commit
5. go to https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/commit/<commit-sha>

Do you see any harm in us adding some manual tags as well? This is something I'd be willing to do to improve the DX here
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:55:52 GMT):<br/>
Sure, but maybe it will be easier to let the CI handle it
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:56:09 GMT):<br/>
E.g. we create a tag, not a release for each unstable release
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:56:09 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:56:30 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>JamesEbert</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:56:39 GMT):<br/>
But that was probably just with a Github release

Hi everyone, from now if you want to install the latest version of AFJ use the `@alpha` tag. I'm in preparation of the first `0.1.0` release which will be the version installed if you run `npm install @aries-framework/core`  (after it has been released) while the latest commit will be installed if you run `npm install @aries-framework/core@alpha`.

I am trying to execute the createProposal method in the existing CredentialService with the new code I have written but I am getting an Indy SDK error:

`Test suite failed to run

Anyone hve any idea what would cause an invalid wallet handle in Indy SDK? When I run the tests using the existing architecture it works fine and I cannot see any difference in the config objects passed into this method.

I have hit a strange error whereby the JsonTransformer.fromJSON in the message receiver does not parse messages with a credential preview type set 
to https://didcomm.org/issue-credentital/2.0/credential-preview

After the fromJson() in In V1 I see:

 `V1CredentialPreview {
      type: 'https://didcomm.org/issue-credential/1.0/credential-preview',
      attributes: [
        CredentialPreviewAttribute {
          mimeType: 'text/plain',
          name: 'name',
          value: 'John'
        },
        CredentialPreviewAttribute {
          mimeType: 'text/plain',
          name: 'age',
          value: '99'
        },
        CredentialPreviewAttribute {
          mimeType: 'image/png',
          name: 'profile_picture',
          value: 'hl:zQmcKEWE6eZWpVqGKhbmhd8SxWBa9fgLX7aYW8RJzeHQMZg'
        }
      ]
    }
`



In V2 with the same credential preview I get this (the message is still in JSON format)

 ` {
      '@type': 'https://didcomm.org/issue-credential/2.0/credential-preview',
      attributes: [
        { 'mime-type': 'text/plain', name: 'name', value: 'John' },

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 09 Dec 2021 13:08:18 GMT):<br/>
This is caused by the wallet handle being invalid (i.e. there is no open wallet with this handle). A potentional cause could be that the wallet is already closed an deleted, maybe because you forgot to await some statements (that's usually the case for me)
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Thu, 09 Dec 2021 14:55:27 GMT):<br/>
That is exactly what happened: forgot to put an await on one method call...thanks!

The RFC-0453 spec has the following field in the offer-credential object:

replacement_id -- an optional field to help coordinate credential replacement. When this is present and matches the replacement_id of a previously issued credential, it may be used to inform the recipient that the offered credential is considered to be a replacement to the previous credential. This value is unique to the issuer. It must not be used in a credential presentation.

Can someone tell me where this field comes from, ie how I go about setting its value and in what circumstances (since it is optional)?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 08:10:45 GMT):<br/>
This is a field provided by the issuer, so it is not something managed inside the framework. A framework user can set the value to any string as they see fit

I copied CredentialPreview and made a new Class (V2 CredentalPreview) with the new v2 URL but it seems not to like that. Any ideas why this is failing?

I have hit a strange error whereby the JsonTransformer.fromJSON in the message receiver does not parse messages with a credential preview type set 
to https://didcomm.org/issue-credentital/2.0/credential-preview

I also tried subclassing CredentialPreview but that doesn't work either

Can you share a copy of the message class that contains the credential preview?
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 13:39:12 GMT):<br/>
problem fixed!

Just having a look at the auto accept use cases; I am a little confused between what the difference if between AutoAccept.Always and AutoAccept.ContentApproved
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 18:26:40 GMT):<br/>
Always auto accepts no matter the content or flow of the credential / proof. ContentApproved means the content of the credential cannot change between messages. I.e. If I propose a credential with a certain cred def id, and then the issuer offers me a credential with another cred def id, with always the flow would continue, but with contentApproved it will stop (as the new content (cred def id) has not been approved)

Hi @TimoGlastra @jakubkoci Does AFJ have provision to add wallet record as a non secrets from aries bifold into it ?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 17 Feb 2022 10:09:34 GMT):<br/>
Hi @sairanjit, this is what I sent to @MikeRichardson a few days ago on this topic:
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 17 Feb 2022 10:09:43 GMT):<br/>
1. Storing additional data related to an existing record
Let's say we have credentialRecord X and you want to store some extra data alongside this wallet record (e.g. has the user already seen this record before). The easiest way to do this is to add metadata to the existing record. The base record (and therefore all records that extend from it) supports metadata which you can add arbitrary data to. If you update the record, this will persist.

If you also want to be able to query by the custom data you added to the record, you can add custom tags to the record which allows you to use the query method on it:

```
    const hasSeenRecord = true

    // Set the metadata and tag
    credentialRecord.metadata.set('userState', {
      hasSeenRecord: hasSeenRecord,
    })
    credentialRecord.setTag('hasSeenRecord', hasSeenRecord)

    await this.credentialRepository.save(credentialRecord)
```

To then retrieve the credential record by the custom tag you can resolve the repository and query:

```
    agent.injectionContainer.resolve(CredentialRepository)
    const credentialRecords = await this.credentialRepository.findByQuery({
      hasSeenRecord: true,
    })
```

Maybe we can expose the findByQuery method on the agent, but we would probably also need to expose the update method in that case. We haven't done this as this exposes a way to update records in the public api. Having to use the injectionContainer makes it a bit more explicit that you aren't using the public API. I'm open to changing this (maybe we should only allow changing certain fields in the public API?)

2.  Create custom record types.

Another possibility would be to create custom record types not associated with any existing record. This isn't documented, but is possible to do completely outside of AFJ. This hasn't been exposed as a public API and uses a lot of internals, which are subject to change in future releases. Maybe it would be good to think about a public API for storing custom data (e.g. a specific record type that stores arbitrary data). See below for an (ugly) example of how this could be achieved. 

```
import { Agent, InjectionSymbols, utils } from "@aries-framework/core";

import {
  BaseRecord,
  TagsBase,
} from "../../packages/core/build/storage/BaseRecord";
import { Repository } from "../../packages/core/build/storage/Repository";
import { StorageService } from "../../packages/core/build/storage/StorageService";

const agent: Agent = undefined; // mock agent for types

class MyCustomRecord extends BaseRecord {
  public constructor(props: { id?: string; createdAt?: Date; label: string }) {
    super();

    if (props) {
      this.id = props.id ?? utils.uuid();
      this.createdAt = props.createdAt ?? new Date();
      this.label = props.label;
    }
  }

  public label!: string;

  getTags(): TagsBase {
    return {
      ...this._tags,
    };
  }
}

const storageService: StorageService<MyCustomRecord> =
  agent.injectionContainer.resolve(InjectionSymbols.StorageService);

const repository = new Repository(MyCustomRecord, storageService);

repository.save(
  new MyCustomRecord({
    label: "Mike's wallet",
  })
);
```


Open to discuss in more detail during the AFJ call and see if we can come up with something that's a bit more clean. But in the meantime, the above approaches could work.

@TimoGlastra Thanks a lot for descriptive explaination
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:05:34 GMT):<br/>
Question about credential revocation state. Is this something that is considered outside of the protocol for issue-credential (i.e. when a credentials is revoked, should the status marking this credential as such be attached to its metadata)?
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:06:35 GMT):<br/>
Just curious how the records are updated when a revocation message is received?
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:08:25 GMT):<br/>
I see that the credentials are filtered out in the proof request from [this](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/pull/641) PR
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 21 Feb 2022 06:41:43 GMT):<br/>
I think this should be solved once this PR is merged: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/pull/579/files
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 21 Feb 2022 06:42:11 GMT):<br/>
Then it can process revocation notification messages, and store the revocation state for a credential
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 21 Feb 2022 06:42:42 GMT):<br/>
Maybe it would be good to store the revocation state in the credential if the credential was revoked, but no revocation notification was sent
