{"msg":"Hello, I want to demonstrate communication (connection, exchange of credentials/proof requests) between edge and cloud agents connected with the common indy-pool.\nFor cloud agents, I have considered using aries cloud agent python (`ACA-Py`) which will be deployed and maintained by the enterprise organizations.\nAs users (can be in thousands) will be interacting with these enterprise orgs, I am considering to have mobile applications which can act as edge agents for handling peer-to-peer communication with cloud agents.\nI noticed that there are 2 projects available (`ARNIMA` & `rn-indy-sdk`) as open source react native sdk's for Aries and have some doubts around the same.\n\n1. In which terms are these 2 projects different from each other as both are react native wrappers around indy-sdk? \n2. What is the maturity level for both these projects ? Can one start leveraging these project for building a mobile agent?\n3. Are there any open-source implementations available which have used these sdks?\n4. How is the communication handled between the edge and cloud agents? Do we need to run mediator agents for routing the messages ? \n\n@ajayjadhav @jakubkoci ","username":"HLFPOC","ts":"2020-03-30T12:37:23.181Z"}

{"msg":"Would it be possible to build an instance of an Indy wallet in the cloud ?","username":"devexplore2020","ts":"2020-12-14T16:58:15.916Z"}

We've seen a number of different implementations working towards utilizing the `indy-sdk` from a React Native environment and we would like to point to one implementation to the focus the community's work and contributions. I have a question or two for you:\nFor iOS, is there a centralized place in which the iOS `Indy.framework` files are currently already being placed? If not, is there value in placing this inside of `rn-indy-sdk`, given that the sovrin repo does not contain the latest indy versions? We'd be happy to run through the effort of manually building for 1.15.0, however we'd rather not duplicate work already performed. \nIs there intentions of performing a new release (v0.1.8?) containing this logging bug fix for Android? (https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk/commit/6bfb07735543e4205d725a9d7087efa7f59fe54b) This would be needed for utilizing 1.15.0 of the `indy-sdk` via the `rn-indy-sdk` versions. \nThanks!","username":"JamesEbert","ts":"2021-02-15T18:51:58.268Z"}

{"msg":"Hi guys (especially @TimoGlastra as has been recently working on indy-sdk type definition) ,\n\nI'd like to implement `registerPublicDid` method in AFJ's ledger module, and in order to do so I need to update types/indy-sdk from DefinitelyTyped to define `buildNymRequest`. No problem with that but I'm struggling when trying to use the `NymRole` enum that is defined there (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/cc94a59c9f4244b50b6cc46acad46f75fd10aec7/types/indy-sdk/index.d.ts#L636). It seems that enums defined in d.ts files are lost at runtime if not defined in underlying JS module (unless defined as const enum, but this is not allowed in DefinitelyTyped project). Also, as far as I can see in the wrapper, indy-sdk actually uses string for roles instead of numbers.\nI'm thinking on removing NymRole enum from indy-sdk and putting it in AFJ's ledger module (not ideal because it's Indy specific, but it'll work). What do you think?","username":"genaris","ts":"2021-07-20T14:34:43.335Z"}

{"msg":"Interesting. If indy-sdk actually uses string values, can't we use that instead of the numbers. Then we could type it like this:\n```\ntype NymRole = 'TRUSTEE' | 'STEWARD' | 'TRUST_ANCHOR' | 'ENDORSER' | 'NETWORK_MONITOR'\n```","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2021-07-20T15:15:41.098Z"}
{"msg":"Otherwise I think the approach as you mentioned sounds good to me","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2021-07-20T15:16:21.139Z"}
{"msg":"Well that's a nice catch because I was only looking at the expected data type from indy sdk wrapper (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/113b79cd64a238130d20e19b972326f72047c550/wrappers/nodejs/src/indy.cc#L1671) and sending the numeric value (i.e. '101'), which worked fine in my tests.\n\nBut, after your answer, I looked at indy sdk nodejs wrapper tests and it seems that you are right that they use 'friendly names' (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/e80e7092e4f3232b3ddf6841cd56619487e79eb0/wrappers/nodejs/test/ledger.js#L37), which is aligned with Rust implementation for buildNymRequest. However, GET NYM does return the numeric value for role (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/dbd89cf94a73e7a62611c4150a874c38b810ff8d/libindy/src/api/ledger.rs#L444) :exploding_head: \n\nSo I will check it and probably go with your approach, that'd be simple and clear.

{"msg":"Sure! Aries Framework JavaScript tries to deliver a cross-platform javascript implementation of Aries. VCX does the same, but by writing the core in Rust, and exposing it through FFI wrappers. What we've noticed is that writing everything in Rust is that it makes it possible to expose your code in multiple languages, however it adds a lot of complexity. Writing Rust is hard, and writing wrappers is tedious. By implementing as much as possible in JavaScript it becomes a lot easier to extend and maintain the framework","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2021-07-27T11:54:12.120Z"}
{"msg":"AFAIK vcx agency node does not support the mediator coordination protocol (I could be wrong here), meaning you need to use with with vcx","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2021-07-27T11:55:11.407Z"}
{"msg":"Alright. I think I understand the idea now. Does that matter for me as an application developer that is merely using the frameworks? I guess features are more readily available on aries-javascript because development is faster and easier? What is the advantage of vcx then?","username":"aspannag","ts":"2021-07-27T13:56:25.990Z"}
{"msg":"I guess the advantage of vcx is that it's c-callable and can be used both on the server as well as the (mobile) client.","username":"aspannag","ts":"2021-07-27T14:34:58.913Z"}
{"msg":"AFJ can also be used on both mobile and server side. Node.JS for server side, and React Native for iOS + Android. The advantage of a c-callable library is that you can use it in any language you like. You can't use AFJ in a native iOS or Android app, and also can't use it directly in a Go application. For us this is fine, we build our mobile apps in react native and use Node.JS for server side (or ACA-Py). But for a lot of companies this may be a limitation. E.g. If you're an identity service provider you want to serve all your customers, independant of the language your customers use. Writing the core in rust / as a c-callable library makes this possible","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2021-07-27T14:40:42.721Z"}
{"msg":"Yes, I see. I think that clears up some of the confusion I had. For us it's a requirement to write native app code (i.e. we start with ios). So I guess we can only go for vcx and call it inside swift/objective-c.","username":"aspannag","ts":"2021-07-27T14:43:50.210Z"}
{"msg":"Also: JavaScript is sometimes seen as insecure. Writing the logic in Rust and only exposing the public API can help with JavaScript security issues. We're still using c-callable libraries under the hood for crypto, so I don't see this as a direct limitation. Another one may be performance.

I'm pretty sure whatever solution we choose will be implemented at the AFJ layer.\n\nIn that document, we summarize the problem for AnonCreds, and the two core issues -- how the issuer can make metadata about each credential type available to the Wallet (and verifiers) and what format we could/should use for that metadata.\n\nAs you will see, one of the options is the \"Overlays Capture Architecture\" that has been floating around the community for a few years. The more I scanned the specification (linked in the document above) the happier I was with it – if the tooling is there to use it. Key things that I was reminded of when reading about OCA, beyond the multi-lingual labels:\n\n- flags on “PII” data so that the wallet can say to the holder – “hey, do you really want to share this data element?”\n- An “information” overlay that allows the issuers to provide information about each attribute – allowing either direct display or a “?” icon to display more for the user.\n- The label overlay includes a “grouping” concept with labels for the groups, so that the presentation can go beyond just a flat list of values.\n\nThere's more, but those are the most directly applicable to the Wallet use case.\n\nFun stuff that I’m sure the UX folks would love, while removing any sort of credential-specific code in the wallet. \n\nI'd be interested in any feedback from folks on the ideas presented.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2021-11-26T19:27:04.728Z"}
