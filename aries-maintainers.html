@danielhardman I added this, which is the sample circleci yml: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/86 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 21:03:34 GMT):<br/>

if you don't want to use CircleCI, feel free to close my PR as not needed. I just didn't want to get in your way of moving forward
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 21:06:04 GMT):<br/>
I don't have a strong opinion about which CI to use, except that I want it to be dead simple. The "build" step is probably going to be a no-op; I just want some kind of test mechanism that I can use to enforce quality of the docs. Is CircleCI one you like and recommend to other HL projects? I'm happy to use it if HL infrastructure will automatically service the project for us...
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 21:07:19 GMT):<br/>
It's free for open source projects, and it's kind of the market leader, so yes.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 21:07:37 GMT):<br/>
and it's under your control, as a project maintainer
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 21:07:39 GMT):<br/>
Okay, great. CircleCI it is.

I would like another couple Aries maintainers to weigh in before I accept the PR, just so I know they're cool with where I'm headed. I don't want them to be unhappy with what I've done.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 21:08:03 GMT):<br/>
sure. The other thing is - that's the sample config - you'll need to put something interesting in there
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 21:08:18 GMT):<br/>
Yup. I'm reading CircleCI docs now.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 21:08:42 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:04:23 GMT):<br/>
@here: @rjones asks an important question. For the aries-rfcs repo, do we want to require a formal review of each PR, separate from the implicit review of whichever maintainer clicks the "Merge" button? We deliberately tried to streamline the process on that repo such that getting something merged had minimal impedance. The only things we are checking for with RFC proposals is minimal conformance to document standards, reasonable terminology, and hyperlinks. We can accomplish this with the 1 mandatory reviewer that Ry picked, or with zero, or with >1. What is our preference?

An argument for keeping Ry's choice of 1 is that some PRs aren't simple RFC proposals, but rather suggestions about meaningful updates to RFCs. For those, I would say reviewers should be >= 1, and we should possibly have a more ambitious process...

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:14:55 GMT):<br/>
I think 1 is fine because the maintainer who is merging can also be the one approving the PR. Something I've tried to do when merging PRs that aren't moving status is give a short summary as a backlog of why I'm accepting the PR. That way there's a record of my thinking as well as who merged it. I like the idea of using a DCO to keep the quality up while keeping the additional effort minimal on both maintainers and committers.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:22:45 GMT):<br/>
I think the guidance be that the reviewer should be the "facilitator" of the document, if known. If it is the facilitator submitting the change, it would just be one of the maintainers.

Separate question thread: folder naming conventions for decorators and protocols
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:26:23 GMT):<br/>
Thread: folder naming conventions for decorators and protocols
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:28:19 GMT):<br/>
I noticed when I was doing some cleanup last Friday that we have some RFCs that have the word "protocol" in their folder name, and others that are about protocols that lack that word. Similarly, we have some RFCs that have the word "decorator" in their folder name, and others that don't.

For the sake of consistency and clarity, how do you feel about stipulating that protocol RFCs have "protocol" in their names, and decorator RFCs have "decorator" in their names?

I'd like to decide this early, since we are creating permalinks as the RFCs get merged...
</p>

Thread: naming of other aries repos
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:33:49 GMT):<br/>
I'm warming up to the idea of calling the various top-level agent frameworks "aries-xyz", where xyz is a programming language. This would make the project-formerly-known-as-indycat into "aries-python".

We would keep names like "aries-sdk", "aries-rfcs", etc. And we would use the top-level aries repo as a documentation/orientation repo for people landing in the aries ecosystem.

Are there opposing opinions to this strategy, or was I the only holdout?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:43:03 GMT):<br/>
I think that sounds right.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:49:47 GMT):<br/>
BTW, I suggest that protocol versions NOT appear in a protocol RFC's folder name/permalink. Rather, I suggest that evolutions of the protocol version become subdocuments in that protocol. When a protocol first gets defined it's maybe 0.9, and the folder name might be "foo-protocol". The main README.md says that the current version is 0.9. Then, when version 1.0 is formalized, the main README.md is updated to describe 1.0, and a new doc called "version-0.9.md" is created and hyperlinked, so people needing to find the 0.9 docs can find them. This has the effect that the latest version of the protocol is the most natural permalink, but permalinks to older versions can be created if need be. Thoughts?

This is too funny. I started with aries-python-agent, Sam convinced me that aries-python was right for what we have, now he is on the other side :-).  Maybe I misunderstood him.

I think this thing is as close to "aries" as there is going to be, so I would leave off "thing" for this element.  I would be OK otherwise.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 16:55:00 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to reverse my opinion from yesterday and say that I don't think we want to require a review before a merge. Here's why:

We have 2 different kinds of PRs. There are substantive PRs, where the content is being updated in a way that matters to the community, and then there are "tweak" PRs where we're fixing a missing comma or something equally trivial. The enforcement doesn't distinguish between them, which means that even trivial stuff has the impedance of getting a review. I think that's going to make it less likely that we'll fix minor issues. It'll just be too much bother, so we'll let those issues just fester--sort of like a "broken windows" phenomenon for the repo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory).

Yesterday I raised trivial PR 90, and Sam obligingly reviewed and approved it. However, today I committed a minor improvement, and found that I had invalidated Sam's approval. So it now needs to be reviewed all over again. This despite the fact that a lot of the things we check for are now enforced by unit test--so we already have an automated review of sorts, on top of anything humans might do.

I think I'd rather leave the management of "tweak" PRs up to maintainer judgment plus automation, with the option that any of us could fix a hyperlink or comma whenever we see it, with no approval other than CI. This is trusting us to use good judgment and not unilaterally commit something that deserves community discussion. I think that's a good risk to take.

FYI, I updated the /README.md in the aries repo with a bit more info. In particular, I added a section about the relationship between Aries and Indy, because many people are asking about it. You can use this hyperlink to refer people to it: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries/blob/master/README.md#relationship-to-hyperledger-indy

I also added all Aries logos to the aries repo, in the /collateral folder

Cross-posting this from #indy-maintainers, FYI.

All: I have updated the indy-hipe repo with an /index.md that shows all HIPEs by status. It's patterned off the aries-rfcs /index.md and uses a very slightly modified version of the generate_index.py script. See https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/index.md. I have also updated the status of many of the HIPEs so they are clean/correct. There is still some cleanup to do, but it's much less daunting now. And I have run the check_links.py script from Aries and fixed all the issues it found. The repo now passes continuous integration for me exactly the way aries-rfcs does.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:05:32 GMT):<br/>
@rjones @TelegramSam - we're going to be shortly essentially transferring a bcgov repo (currently called bcgov/indycat-agent, to be renamed and populated from the bcgov/indy-catalyst repo, agent folder). I'm thinking that we should be transferring that repo to Hyperledger vs. copying the code/history into an existing repo.  E.g. that there should be an identifiable transaction that moves the repo from BC Gov to Hyperledger.  Thoughts on that?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:06:02 GMT):<br/>
identifiable transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:06:22 GMT):<br/>
Technically it doesn't matter, but it seems to be me that it should be done that way so we can point to it and say - "hey, BC Gov contributed that".
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:06:31 GMT):<br/>
ah, this one is only part of the source repo, not the whole repo.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:06:42 GMT):<br/>
identifiable transaction - the transfer of the repo
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:06:45 GMT):<br/>
That is harder to do and maintain history.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:06:51 GMT):<br/>
Yes - the whole repo.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:07:18 GMT):<br/>
No - you just go to admin and say "Transfer this repo to this other entity".  At least I think that's what you do.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:07:31 GMT):<br/>
oh, so this is indy cat as a whole?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:08:01 GMT):<br/>
there is another way to transfer history if needed. I just did it on the staticagent.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:08:17 GMT):<br/>
No - we are doing - indy-catalyst/agent to new repo indycat-agent in bcgov, and then transfer that repo intact to Hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:08:40 GMT):<br/>
At least i think that is the appropriate logistics to be done.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:09:22 GMT):<br/>
I didn't transfer the repo, but I suppose that could be done instead of the merge trick I did for the other repo.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:11:57 GMT):<br/>
Yes - that's what I realized. But for this, I don't think that's the way to go.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 22:03:51 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran the way to send a whole repo is to transfer it to me, ryjones, on github. another alternative is to make me an owner of the donating org, and I'll do the transfer and remove myself.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 22:53:32 GMT):<br/>
Hmm...not thinking the BC Gov is going to want to give you control over the organization, :laughing: .  We'll look to see what's possible. We want to transfer it directly from BC Gov to Hyperledger if at all possible.  We've got a bit of time (but not much) to figure out if that's possible and how. And of course, we can always fall back to the push the commits method.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 23:51:43 GMT):<br/>
this is literally how all of the repos landed in the hyperledger org at the start. Fabric, Sawtooth, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 23:53:03 GMT):<br/>
the issue with repo transfer from org to org is the person that does it needs to be an owner of both orgs.

If it's the "optics: of having Ry be a part of your GH org or assigning the repo to Ry that is challenging, since it appears to suggest that BCGov is giving it to Ry and not to Hyperledger, what if instead we set up a third GH org, call it "hyperledger-inbound", where both Ry and you guys can be owners, but it's considered "owned" and managed by the LF.  Then Ry transfers it from "hyperledger-inbound" to the right place in "hyperledger".  Does this make sense, solve anything?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 01:04:50 GMT):<br/>
I worked with @rjones  to transfer the former Sovrin Foundation repos that are now HL Indy repos. What I remember is that I simply went into the repo settings and changed the owner. I didn't make Ry an owner inside SF. HL's github account then got a notification that a repo transfer was proposed, and Ry approved it as an HL owner. It was super easy and did not involve all of the complexity we're talking about above.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 04:04:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm hoping that is how it will work - that's what the documentation appears to say. But it is ambiguous, and Ry has a lot more experience than I.  We'll try to do it that way, and if it doesn't work, we'll go to plan B or C.

Transfer of the repo has nice benefits - issues, followers, stars, etc come with. Also, anyone with the repo cloned or forked will end up in the right place due to GitHub redirects.

Yes, I can see the build status, but I don't see a way to re-trigger a build. Maybe I'm missing something that's there.

Anyway, it seems to be the case that when a PR is stalled like this, another commit to the PR may re-trigger the build and allow me to get unstuck. So I've got a workaround.

@rjones Yes, I do see that. However, this won't help if the job isn't running in the first place; it's only useful if the job has been triggered at least once. Also, it reruns the workflow with the snapshot of the code it first ran against, not with latest, so it wouldn't help to trigger a new build with a new version of the code, only a new build against the code as it existed before. With the stall I was experiencing, no build had ever been triggered in response to my PR being raised, so it would not have helped.

Hey folks - As you may have seen on #aries-sdk (or DIF channels), we've been working on native Golang DIDComm/Agent framework libraries. We have, so far, split up the functionality by concept (e.g., DIDComm "building blocks" vs Agent Framework [vs Hubs]). See this post: https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-sdk?msg=r45GyBg4DqnC6AJ6C. I also feel that it is better to build common functionality within a Foundation (be it Hyperledger or DIF). So I'd like to better understand (and/or kick up a conversation):

(1) How others view splitting up the library architecture;
(2) Which foundation should host each part;

and
(3) I'd like to propose that we create Go framework repos [in the right place] and start landing/maintaining code :). As mentioned previously, we are working on a native Go implementation of DIDComm/Frameworks (rather than wrapper of libindy/vcx).

If we aren't able to figure it out in this discussion here, I suggest we discuss it on an upcoming Aries WG call.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 18:53:34 GMT):<br/>
From what I can tell this is a new way of architecting agent frameworks based on building blocks, where some conversations happen in DIF and some in Aries.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 19:02:40 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda and @kdenhartog IMO, the path forward is quite clear: put the code in aries-cloudagent-go (or aries-mobileagent-go if that's more appropriate) under Hyperledger. This doesn't necessarily say where *conversations* ought to happen -- that could be on DIF calls or Aries calls or both -- but from a code management perspective, I think you want all the contextual support that HL offers in terms of process, devops support, integration with LinuxFoundation accounts for issue tracking, etc. Plus, the frameworks that are peers of the one you're building are also Aries repos.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 19:05:24 GMT):<br/>
It's not an entire agent which is where it becomes less clear. For example there's a separate Hub-store server component, a separate protocol component, a DID Doc parsing component, a hub routing component, etc. Would you put every component within the same repository then?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 19:05:55 GMT):<br/>
Would they be tested and versioned together?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 19:06:49 GMT):<br/>
There's also one component that's intended to package them together as an agent framework, however someone could just take 1 or 2 components and not use the entire agent framework. As for your question I'm not sure. @troyronda thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 19:07:29 GMT):<br/>
If they're tested, versioned, and released as a unit, then they should all be in one repo, even if people only use subsets.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 19:08:59 GMT):<br/>
If not, then putting them in separate repos might make sense. There's still a question about overhead for the team maintaining the separate components, and for people trying to discover what they need.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 19:12:54 GMT):<br/>
Maybe the one component that's intended to package them together as an agent framework should be the only thing in aries-agent-go, and all the other stuff should live under the github.com/trustbloc account as its own repos, upon which aries-agent-go depends.

So when thinking about DIDComm and Agent Frameworks, I had viewed them as separate logical blocks.
An Aries Agent Framework uses DIDComm but a Hub could also use DIDComm. In that view DIDComm is a set of building blocks to build features into agents, hubs, and other services.

When the projects are separated, there must be a clean API for these building blocks; if they are encompassed together then it might be only the Agent Framework API that is clean. Of course, this goes to a similar point about being tested and versioned together. I would say the DIDComm building block layer needs its own clean API and tests against it.

The main point is that there should be a clean, tested, and independent API for both the DIDComm layer and the Agent Framework layer, regardless of the number of repos and the name of the repo. If there is a single (mono)repo, then I would suggest a generic name like aries-framework-go with subdirectories for each framework component. If there are multiple repos, then put the component name in the repo. @danielhardman @kdenhartog 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 19:43:26 GMT):<br/>
One of the difficulties @troyronda pointed out about this is that it means that trustbloc now has to handle the contributor agreements. It sounds like they want to avoid this which is why they want it in a foundation.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 19:46:00 GMT):<br/>
I think the components that make this confusing for me is the hub-store, and side-tree components because the conversations and changes aren't discussed in HL.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 19:47:05 GMT):<br/>
Yeh sidetree and hub-store are server implementations based on the protocols discussed in DIF; although I think a hub-store client would be useful in HL.

Yeh sidetree and hub-store are server implementations based on the protocols discussed in DIF; although I think a hub-store client would be useful in HL so an Agent could use a Hub for a persistent store.

At the end of the day, this is still mainly about "I'd like to propose that we create Go framework repo(s)" ... and start landing/maintaining code. This framework contains DIDComm and Agent layers (along with supporting elements such as DID document processing and resolution, DIDComm, Hub storage client). (If framework isn't the right word, let's substitute a better one).

This can be done with a single generic repo and subdirectories for each logical module; or multiple more specific repos.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 20:01:53 GMT):<br/>
There are many good reasons to have a common place to contribute and collaborate on code. Sure - avoiding more CLAs is one of them.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 20:04:27 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda The desire to have an abstraction around DIDComm that is separate from the abstraction around agents makes sense to me--but it is a new architectural requirement. Until very recently "agent stuff" and "didcomm" were virtual synonyms in the minds of many of us. As a result, we do not currently have a mental model that separates things out in the way you'd like. I am friendly to creating one. However, I wouldn't hold codebase progress hostage to that conversation. Let's get the code somewhere public and then start working on how to divide it up. This makes the process of organizing take longer, but it breaks the logjam of trying to solve too many architectural problems with a single move.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 20:05:21 GMT):<br/>
I would be happy to endorse the creation of an "aries-framework-go" repo to get the ball rolling.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 20:07:29 GMT):<br/>
That seems like a reasonable approach to me.

@troyronda SDK's are generally structured in accordance to the language ecosystem they are designed for, but a rough separation can be drawn in few layers:
- storage layer (indy wallets, databases, hubs such as ion)
- protocol layer (Aries protocol, data contracts)
- agent layer (handler architecture, communication services)
- application extensions (language/platform specific support for integration)
Up until now, a lot of the frameworks have been designed with indy support in mind, and a lot of contracts and even messages part of the Aries protocol are created to eventually support Indy SDK capabilities. While a good abstraction can be made to support other ledgers and SDKs, it's largely a guess work right now due to lack of completeness of other libraries. Example, not many implementations of verifiable credentials with ledger support out there.
We're trying to design frameworks with these separations in mind (https://github.com/streetcred-id/agent-framework), but the implementation is far from perfect or generic.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 21:20:59 GMT):<br/>
Note that I use Aries instead DIDComm in my comment, this is unintentional 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sat, 29 Jun 2019 16:01:43 GMT):<br/>
Seems to me that this is the basic architecture we have already implemented in Aries-cloudagent-python
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sat, 29 Jun 2019 16:02:40 GMT):<br/>
Which has clear simple APIs for DIDComm and VC exchange and any other arbitrary protocol an implement wishes to add via a python module which is loadable at runtime. 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sat, 29 Jun 2019 16:03:46 GMT):<br/>
The language of implementation of the cloudagent is more or less irrelevant it seems to me as the web developer for a service that will control the agent simply uses the APIs to send and receive signals from the agent 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sat, 29 Jun 2019 16:05:37 GMT):<br/>
So to be frank ... not sure why one would want to incur the NREs of building something from scratch when they can just use what is already had a millions development effort put into it?

To take John's point a bit further.  Those of us building low level components (the plumbing) should be experimenting with integrations to other components based on code we have - e.g. integratiing with Ion and Hubs using the python agent we have.  That will expose more on the layering and improving the core.

I can totally see re-implementing 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 29 Jun 2019 17:42:18 GMT):<br/>
To take John's point a bit further.  For those of us interested in experimenting with integrations, build DIDcomm protocols (e.g. Ion, uPort) and agent services (e.g. storage) that plug into the python agent we have. That's the easiest fastest way to experiment, learn and contribute the learnings.

If you want to build an equivalent to the python agent in another language, go for it, but please don't alter the core concepts without discussion - don't unilaterally make something completely different.

For developers that just want to build apps - use the agents we have as configurable black boxes and build applications. Don't worry about the plumbing.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 29 Jun 2019 17:46:34 GMT):<br/>
I'll leave it to other folks to decide where the code should go. Our choice is Hyperledger and we'll be transferring the `aries-cloudagent-python` repo to Hyperledger on Monday or Tuesday this week - Monday is a holiday here :-).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 29 Jun 2019 17:52:30 GMT):<br/>
The conversation question is harder. I personally think the most advanced conversations on agents and scalable implementations leading to the common use of verifiable credentials are going on in Aries calls/chat.  Other communities are having deep conversations on other topics - especially different issues with DIDs and storage replication but those are not core to verifiable credentials.  If you want to talk agents, including integrations with other verifiable credential implementations, I think Aries if the place to be. 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 13:00:47 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran As mentioned above, we are working on building a Golang implementation of DIDComm, along with supporting framework libraries. In our case, we would use those framework libraries directly in our applications rather than a cloud agent API intermediary. We had also planned to have a Web API-driven service (reference agent) built on top of those libraries to enable our BDD integration tests (and demos) of the framework.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 13:01:43 GMT):<br/>

The thought was that we are working, as a community, to enable a new messaging standard based on DIDs. This means both SDK/framework/component libraries in various languages to enable native integrations for those applications. It also means that there are reference agents that use those libraries to enable an out-of-the-box experience, for easier integration and experimentation.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 13:15:54 GMT):<br/>
In terms of the python agent: I certainly understand the point of view that many "end" applications will simply want to use a Web API. However, for those of us working on applications that actually expose that Web API (aka building various forms of agents as it is called here); we need the flexibility to add these capabilities natively using libraries built for our implementation languages. In our case, we are adding these features to an existing Golang service.

Good note @troyronda and I certainly agree that's what we are trying to accomplish and we'll need multiple implementations in multiple languages. I was a little concerned with the ideas of fundamentally different (and hence, possibly not interoperable) architectures. As long as interop remains a top priority, I'm happy.

@swcurran and @TelegramSam, what do you think about getting an aries-framework-go repo where @troyronda and crew can begin working in a non-trustbloc place? (@troyronda, do you have DCO hygiene taken care of?)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 18:43:49 GMT):<br/>
I'm fine with it, but don't completely understand it. 

We have the aries-go-sdk repo and we eventually will presumably have an aries-agent-go repo, so I'm not sure what goes in the framework repo.  If there is a clear vision for the three repos by @troyronda and team, I'm good with it. If there is still experimenting to be done, I'd suggest going with populating the aries-go-sdk in Hyperledger and experimenting in trustbloc (in the open, of course).
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 21:20:55 GMT):<br/>
aries-sdk-go should be an unopinionated language library.

Hi @rjones, what is the recommended approach for publishing python packages to https://pypi.org under Hyperledger? 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 22:56:30 GMT):<br/>
@nbrempel I don't know that we have an approach.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 22:57:18 GMT):<br/>
Docker Hub and NPM were set up as needed - I think you're the first to ask to publish to pypi, so I guess I should set that up
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 22:58:59 GMT):<br/>
@nbrempel looks like I set it up some time ago - https://pypi.org/user/hyperledger/
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 23:06:11 GMT):<br/>
Ok, great! Does it have a permissions system? If you're able to give me publish access to a package called `aries-cloudagent` I can publish the initial release
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 23:10:22 GMT):<br/>
So far, I haven't found how to do that.
</p>

<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 23:27:23 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I saw that as well which would be nice to automate it. I have the manual instructions for cutting a release in a pending PR https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/36/files
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 00:04:04 GMT):<br/>
OK. Until we figure something automatic I can give it a whirl later in the week if that's OK?
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 01:52:20 GMT):<br/>
yep! No rush on it. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 12:22:16 GMT):<br/>
For the aries-staticagent-python pypi package, I just published it myself under my account with the intention to add as maintainers whoever/whatever would need permission to change or update the package. That allowed me to quickly get a release up manually with the potential for automation in the future.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 13:30:10 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm is there some obvious way for me to give people permissions to publish that I'm missing?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 13:34:03 GMT):<br/>
After logging in, it shows "your projects." From there, clicking "manage" on the project then "collaborators" from the left menu allowed me to add people as maintainers on a project which I assume means they can publish to the project but I haven't actually verified that yet
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 13:34:31 GMT):<br/>
ah ha! Since I haven't published, I don't have that option. thank you
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 13:35:27 GMT):<br/>
@nbrempel it looks like - you publish, then later we figure out automation, which is the reverse of what I said yesterday. Sound OK?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 13:37:16 GMT):<br/>
Another note, you can add maintainers to a project you've uploaded but you can also transfer ownership as well so @nbrempel can upload then transfer to hyperledger and leave himself as a maintainer
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 13:38:13 GMT):<br/>
I guess I was expecting something more like Dockerhub, where we have teams and acls somewhat like github
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 14:10:14 GMT):<br/>
lol I guess PyPI is too simple for anything like that
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 15:59:56 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good!

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 05:18:19 GMT):<br/>
All: a large number of RFCs are about protocols. A smaller but still significant number are about decorators. We do not have consistency in the folder names we use for these two categories. We have "service-decorator" and "payment-decorators", but also "message-timing" and "message-tracing" (both of which are about decorators). Most of our protocol folder names don't have "-protocol" on the end, but I'm wondering if they should; "0028-introduce" sounds weird, but "0028-introduce-protocol" much more natural.

Anyway, should we establish some naming pattern that we try to follow consistently, before permalinks get entrenched? Or do we not care?

@danielhardman @swcurran @TelegramSam @kdenhartog : It would be good to continue on the next steps for a Go (agent/didcomm) framework repo. (I was out last week).

The previous thread primarily left off at: https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-maintainers?msg=q5hx5W2Tj7n5kFLbQ and https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-maintainers?msg=mSdyxxWqKvP8SwZyE

To answer @swcurran previous question on Aries-agent vs Aries-framework vs Aries-sdk, here are a few thoughts:
* It seemed that "SDK" repos are effectively for wrapper libraries (unopinionated). So we didn't go down this path for naming.
* The repo will contain both libraries that can be used for building an agent, along with a reference implementation (with a particular goal of testing & demonstration). i.e., we particularly wanted to ensure that the libraries are useable "independently" of the reference implementation.
* We also want to ensure that the framework is extendable - e.g., you can plug-in additional handlers using extension libraries.
* We don't currently need to use an Aries SDK in this (agent/didcomm) framework, but there is an assumed need for Ursa for AnonCreds.

So I believe we know what should be part of this particular repo. In regards to naming the repo (agent vs framework). The repo's primary intent is to provide an extendable Aries/DIDComm agent framework (along with supporting libraries) so you could probably argue either way but I tilted towards "framework" due to this primary intent (even though it is intended to contain a reference agent) and my earlier thoughts in the thread about DIDComm layering.

My guess is what you are calling "framework" we are calling "cloudagent", but we'll have to see from the implementation. 

Each cloudagent instance is an agent that has a corresponding controller instance (with horizontal scaling available). The cloudagent does all the agent processing, has pluggable services and a configurable set of protocols.  The controller provides the business logic for the agent - when to initiate protocols, and how to respond to protocol events. We provide examples of controllers, but no concrete repo to fork, since they could be anything - a UI for a person, an actual person (by having the person operate a Swagger UI), an integration with a legacy service, etc, etc.

Our implementation uses a HTTP/JSON interface between the agent and controller (events from agent to controller, admin requests from controller to agent).  My guess is that your structure is that the framework is a library, and an agent embeds the library and calls it internally.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 22:42:43 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran One difference that I wonder about is whether Troy's framework is really about *cloud* agents specifically, or if it's more general.

I wonder if we should alter our naming conventions so it's consistently more-general-to-more-specific, as in "aries-agent-cloud-python", "aries-agent-static-python", etc. Then, if we have a repo that includes more than one kind of agent thingy, we could just omit the specifier, giving "aries-agent-go". Just a thought.

I've prepared a "0.1" release of the Aries Protocol Test Suite that I'd like to propose now moving out of my personal repo, transferring ownership to hyperledger under the name aries-protocol-test-suite.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 23:08:06 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to have a discussion about the handling of this PR - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/23

In one step this PR deprecated *and* eliminated a protocol, and created a new protocol that seems to only have a name change.  The proper handling of this (IMHO - and our developers) is that the existing protocol (connections) should have been marked as deprecated and the new one (did-exchange) should have been added.  As well there should have been a lot more flag raising about the change.

This change is (hopefully) somewhat of a special case as it was hidden in the transfer from indy-hipe to aries-rfc, but it is definitely not hidden in the implementations that are running. Our solution is to support both protocols for the forseeable future, until we can safely remove the deprecated protocol.

I don't think we need to change anything with this, but do I think we need to be more cognizent of such changes given that there implementations running. The implementations aren't running too many protocols, but the core ones should be handled properly when changed.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 00:13:39 GMT):<br/>
No objections, but a suggestion: it would be good to update indy-agent to point to where the work is currently happening.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-maintainers?msg=dpNJKhaWGspNPjZFg) @swcurran I agree as with the approach you suggested. I accepted because it was being moved and we had consensus about the name change. To rephrase how I'm understanding what you're raising, no accepted status RFCs should have a breaking change? 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 17:43:23 GMT):<br/>
I have a question for maintainers of aries-* on github: would you be willing to try a new tool for permission management for your repos? It would involve creating and editing a YAML file in each repo.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 18:14:40 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog - would say no breaking changes when we know there are multiple implementations.  In this case, the right thing to do probably was to migrate the HIPE as is with a "deprecated" flag on it and then copy the HIPE again with the new changes.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 18:34:25 GMT):<br/>
@rjones sure, interested for Aries-framework-go. Do you have a link to the tool?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 19:05:19 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-maintainers?msg=mTWYaifTWndWiTuff) @swcurran Multiple implementations would move it to active status from my understanding. Also, we should be including some way of indicating and potentially linking to implementations if we're using that as a distinctive metric. 

It's worth noting that while I agree that implementations are important metric to consider there's different types we should consider. For example, code that's in production I would consider a production implementation which should encounter as few of breaking changes as possible. However, we may also have prototype implementations which are used to learn and improve the protocols. These are useful, but can handle as many breaking changes as we see fit in my opinion. So I'd suggest that we also indicate what type of implementation it is in the RFC as well.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 19:06:52 GMT):<br/>
FWIW @danielhardman raised this point when we were moving to the new process. I'm not able to remember why we didn't start doing that.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 19:18:14 GMT):<br/>
I'd be happy to try it in aries-rfcs.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 19:20:58 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran and @kdenhartog : I generally feel aligned with sentiments that both of you expressed.

I think we may want to do a better job of tracking which protocols are implemented, and give them a status other than PROPOSED. That would have helped in the specific case that Stephen pointed out, because the bar for changing an ACCEPTED RFC is higher than for changing one that's merely PROPOSED.

@swcurran @kdenhartog @danielhardman As the perpertrator of the crime, I have to agree with all this as well. Moving the existing to Deprecated, then working on a replacement would be a much better option. It is still possible to do this. Should I revert this one to the original, and make a new one for didexchange?

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:51:08 GMT):<br/>
There was no "crime" here. What was changed was a PR, not a merged spec. That is always legal. And merging the PR was also legal, because there was no pre-existing PR to deprecate. I think we already have a copy of the old protocol over in the indy-hipe repo, and I think we already say that the Aries RFC supersedes it. If that's the case, then I think nothing further needs to be done. If it's not, maybe that should be the target.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 23:17:42 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it's a huge issue but bigger than just saying it was all legal and hence OK.  It is causing confusion that should be smoother handled in a smoother way.  Renaming a protocol is not something that should be handled lightly, and IMHO definitely shouldn't be done as part of another operation (e.g. the move from Indy-HIPE to Aries-RFC).  

We'll survive - just need to coordinate between the existing implementations.

Hey folks - interesting bit of learning about decorators that @andrew.whitehead and @sklump have been working on.  Thought I would add a note here to highlight this as a test of where to start a discussion about implementation experience.  I'm thinking this type of thing should wind up in the RFC itself?

In aries-cloudagent-python, the core message handlers scans the messages and processes decorators.  That works nicely for cross-cutting decorators - timing, threads, etc.  When Stephen K was implementing Issue Credential (RFC 36), an attachment is a required field of the message and it makes sense that it be processed in the protocol.  A first cut of his code had some ugly handling of the decorator - a workaround for what was happening in the core. What they came up with to avoid thw workaround and duplicate code/processing is that the core scans the protocol message format and skips processing decorators that are part of the protocol.  I believe thc core processing can also be passed a "skip" parameter to skip other decorators.

That experience might be useful for other implementations.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 17:37:43 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead 's final fix is a clever piece of marshmallow-fu that inspects the schema for named fields. If it's in the spec as a field, the decorator extraction process leaves it as-is. So the decorator spec can vary independently of the message spec as the standards progress. I think it's bulletproof.

Would `~attachment` ever not be processed by the protocol? I can't think of what meaning it could have outside of that given by the message type
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 17:42:54 GMT):<br/>
At present, `~attach` is not a default decorator, so you are correct. The processing extracts decorators like `~thread`, `~timing`, etc. These are conceptually different because they operate orthogonally to the spec. But if some wag in the future wants to put `bad~timing` as a field in the spec, this approach will do the right thing and leave it alone.

@TelegramSam @swcurran @kdenhartog I'm confused about this thread. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/137 . I thought DID Exchange replaced Connection.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 19:35:23 GMT):<br/>
The python agent had the previous ideas from Indy implemented and properly versioned releases. Then when moved to Aries there were changes made that caused breaking changes. This thread is proposing a common way to track who's building implementations and a way to identify when we create breaking changes of the protocol in an RFC.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 19:37:53 GMT):<br/>
Are you thinking of having two different RFCs - the existing RFC for DID Exchange and another one for Connections?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 19:52:23 GMT):<br/>
Bringing up some questions for this type of situation:
- Do both RFCs have effectively the same text (with a name change)? Or a smaller document about the old name or link to a version?
- Does the "new" name RFC state that the "old" name is deprecated?
- Do new implementations use the "new" name? How is the "old" name treated? e.g., do we default to sending the "new" name?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 16:54:35 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda Yes, the Aries RFC and the Indy HIPE have effectively the same text and the same concepts/flows. The most substantive difference is that the Aries RFC is still fluid (hence @TelegramSam 's intention to shift its status back to PROPOSED), where the Indy HIPE was more stable. Yes, the new RFC references the old one and says it is superseded. Implementations should be targeting DID Exchange Protocol, IMO--not Indy's Connection Protocol--unless they want to interoperate with code that's frozen to February's Agent Connectathon. It would be easy to write one impl that supports both protocols, given how virtually identical they are--but whether an impl does that or not is up to its authors.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 17:31:33 GMT):<br/>
I differ from Daniel's view a little in the details. A number of implementers implemented Connections 0.1 that is documented here -  https://hackmd.io/s/HkklVzww4 It was defined for IIW and has had a much longer lifespan than expected. Note that it is significantly different that DID-Exchange in that it does not support preview or the proposal messages.

We recommend:

- adding "connections" as an RFC with an "Accepted" status and a notice pointing to the DID-Exchange protocol for new implementation and the context described here.
- When DID Exchange becomes "Accepted", the connections RFC is marked as "deprecated" (or whatever term we have).
- Come up with a way to track implementations so that we know the impact of supporting one, the other or both (which is issue 137)

 I deliberate chose to mark connections as "Accepted" for now, because it is the de facto accepted protocol, and that pushes the group to agree on DID-Exchange.

I also suggest that we don't lightly change protocol names vs. versions.  I don't think DID-Exchange is significantly better than connections to be worth all this confusion.

From an implementation perspective, we did two implementations in parallel as intertwining the two was found to be difficult. Your results may vary.

I defer to Stephen about the substantive differences; I guess they're somewhat more meaningful than I realized. Thank you for the correction.

The remaining difference between my view and Stephen's seems to be in how much we think a hackmd doc needs to be accommodated by an RFC management process. I do agree with Stephen's recommendations for content *inside Aries*; I just don't think we should be reasoning about content that's not embodied in either HIPEs or RFCs, and applying the same standard. For example, the pushback about changing protocol names and versions assumes that there should be some sort of continuity between the hackmd doc and an Aries RFC; I don't think that's crazy, but I also don't think it's a foregone conclusion.

Anyway, if we never write and implement protocols in hackmd again, this is probably a moot point. I'll happily vote to merge Stephen's PR when it's raised. But can we also agree that, although writing a protocol doc in hackmd is fine, the Aries community doesn't have any obligation to protect it with formal change control management until it shows up as an RFC?

@swcurran Thanks for pushing us on RFC management a bit. Some things where I'm not clear on who's doing what:

1. Raise a PR that changes the description of our process, introduces FIRST_IMPL as a status, makes our 4-arrow circle into a 5-arrow circle, and changes our index script so it generates a differently sorted and better described list. Have it look up in-between statuses or last-status-update dates to provide better metadata. (Let me know if you're doing this instead.) We can then approve the updated process via the PR.

2. Propose a better status block and a new implementations block for all RFCs, and write a script that adds those blocks to all existing docs.

3. Raise PRs that move a handful of RFCs to ACCEPTED status.

@swcurran, @kdenhartog, @telegramsam What do you think of this graphic? Note that I named the stage between PROPOSED and ACCEPTED "POC" instead of "IMPLEMENTED". I could also go for "FIRST IMPL" if you like that better. And I changed the final phase to RETIRED instead of SUPERSEDED, because that seems to me to cover both the case where someone withdraws an RFC, and the case where the RFC remains around but is superseded or deprecated for some reason.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 17:02:02 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran and @TelegramSam In the updated indexer, I'm thinking I'd like to be able to report the following metadata about each RFC: when its status last changed (so we can tell if proposals are stale), how many impls it has, and what tags are associated with it. This means I need a section for impls that lists them in a way that they are easily countable. I'm thinking something like:

```
# Implementations
- [my impl](https://example.com/myimpl) (whatever note you'd like)
```

How does that sound?

@all I did some work to improve the indexing script. It's substantially cleaner and more useful. It counts and reports/hyperlinks implementations for each indexed item in the new impl section that @swcurran added. It also shows the last status date of each RFC, so we can see what's stalled. And it supports tagging. I have defined and used 4 tags so far; you'll see them when you go look at the latest version of /index.md. 

I went in and added links to implementations for a number of RFCs. They are definitely incomplete/imperfect, but even so, it is very encouraging to see how much real progress we've made that we just weren't giving ourselves credit for. This change caused a number of RFCs to move from PROPOSED to DEMONSTRATED status. I went ahead and merged those changes, because this status change is not controversial; it's just a reflection of us having data about impl code. Many of the things that are now in DEMONSTRATED status should probably be in ACCEPTED status instead, but that's a more controversial move and one that I think others might want to advocate.

Please note: I also added a new unit test that is picky about the metadata at the top of each RFC. Your PRs won't pass unless you follow the format. To find out if you're following the format, run `pytest code` from the root of the repo.

@swcurran Now that I have a little experience using the `Implementations` section, I want to suggest a couple tweaks:

1. The `Name` column and the `Link` column feel wasteful of screen real estate. If we combined them so `Name` is a phrase that's just hyperlinked, the reading would be streamlined.

2. I think I used the `Implementation Notes` field incorrectly about half the time. I put a description of a codebase there, when what I really ought to do is put a description of the specific implemented feature (e.g., not "Codebase X has the following characteristics" but "The impl of this RFC in codebase X has the following characteristics"). Do you agree? If so, I'll try to circle back and update.

3. I'm not sure that I chose the best name for each impl. Can owners of each impl please comment? @troyronda @TelegramSam 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 15:50:58 GMT):<br/>
Also, I am not sure what to do with this section for things that are conceptual. For example, it doesn't seem to make sense on the RFC about repudiation, or JSON-LD compatibility. Should the section be removed as not applicable, or just left empty?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 15:55:41 GMT):<br/>
Agree on 1 and agree on 2 - good call.

I think we leave the section in for conceptual ones, but less important beyond reference implementations. Nice to have a link to a reference implementation where possible. We can remove later if it's not useful.

@rjones - we'd like to have an artifact of the `aries-cloudagent-python` repo be a docker image with aca-py pre-installed, so that it can be the base image for other projects.

Is there a process/guidance for doing that?

I missed the meeting again today, I wanted to ask about moving `streetcred-id/agent-framework` to an aries- repo. I'm not sure if `aries-sdk-dotnet` would be the appropriate destination, or a new repo `aries-agentframework-dotnet`. The current codebase has no namespacing or branding related to streetcred.id, so refactoring should be minimal.

Just got off a call with someone with whom I was talking about Aries.  Found out that because of their indoctrination with the historical terms "Edge/Cloud" agent, they didn't understand that `aries-cloudagent-python` could be an edge agent.  I don't know what we can do about that other than to rename ACA-Py to `aries-notmobileagent-python` :-)

Too bad that those terms have become so well used.  Any thoughts on if we should change anything or just explain it to people that get confused by the terms?  We should reconsider and just go with `aries-agent-python`.  Anyone with the least bit of knowledge about Python would equate that to `aries-notmobileagent-python`

@swcurran I'm all for changing those names and left the issue on the subject open. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/122
Even if we don't go with the term "Custodial" (I still think it provides a good distinction) we need better language to describe the diversity of agents in the ecosystem.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 20:46:03 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 20:52:21 GMT):<br/>
It might and should be done. But since any name is bad, we'd like to change to ACA-Py to `aries-agent-python`.  Any objections?

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 22:45:42 GMT):<br/>
I'm worried that given a lack of good names for the landscape of agents in our current ecosystem, we are unlikely to choose one without significant problems of it's own.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 22:46:20 GMT):<br/>
My preference is to update readmes now, and work to mature the naming of things within the ecosystem. as it settles, perform the repo rename then.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 22:55:30 GMT):<br/>
I tend to agree that it could lead to confusion. The naming is going to set the mental model, and I'm concerned in not distinguishing between a cloud agent and an edge agent. From a personal user perspective (not a business) it's a generally accepted paradigm that they should preference an edge agent with a cloud agent approach over a cloud agent with a rest controller app. This is because by doing the latter has a strong incentive to not be run on user owned hardware which in turn undermines the users control.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 23:03:12 GMT):<br/>
My read of what you are saying is @kdenhartog is exactly why it shouldn't be called "cloudagent".  Given the original (circa-2016/17) "cloud" and "edge" agent terms from Sovrin, ACA-Py is either one.  In that terminology an edge agent != mobile agent which is what you seem to be implying.

The only limitation on ACA-Py's use is that it won't run on as a mobile agent and so would generally not be used by a personal user.  It can be an enterprise edge agent, an enterprise cloud agent, an agency endpoint, and a personal cloud agent.  It could be a personal edge agent, if a person doesn't want to run their edge agent on a mobile device.

It can also become an impersonator agent, which is the paradigm I want to avoid occurring. If we find a way to explicitly prevent developers from selecting that solution than I'm open to anything. So far, I don't feel that we've found a mental model that highlights all the solutions you provided while also excluding the impersonator paradigm.

an impersonator agent is a paradigm where the agent host has the capability (whether used or not) to impersonate the user.  For example, if Google decides to host personal agents for their users and only offers a cloud agent with a REST controller app. Then Google has the capability to impersonate the user (e.g. sending credentials without user consent) or to perform analytics and data tracking on the users habits (similar to what Google already does).

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 01:29:40 GMT):<br/>
Although the cloud agent term is too narrow, the plain agent term is too broad. How about server agent?

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:03:18 GMT):<br/>
And the name of a repo will prevent that?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:04:01 GMT):<br/>
Implicitly I believe it will if it sets the wrong expectations for the consumer of the repo.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:09:30 GMT):<br/>
Making sure we're telling a good story and setting a right vision is important though. That's what naming is about. If we pick bad names we set ourselves up for encouraging the poor usage. For example SSI albeit controversial it's an excellent name for setting the mental model that differentiates the paradigm from other identity models like federated and centralized identity.

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:11:43 GMT):<br/>
In the beginning we didn't call centralized identity that. We just called it Identity and Access Management. Then when we learned and differentiate the difference between Federated and Centralized, we brought in new language. 

What I hear is being suggested is we want to go from a model that sets a paradigm (cloud and edge) and move back to one without paradigms. I think that's a move in the wrong direction.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:17:01 GMT):<br/>
My argument is that we should be picking names that preserve the story that was originally told when we set out on build self sovereign identity. If people want to build impersonator agents than UMA may be a better paradigm for them to look at because it's been designed with those paradigms in mind.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:20:51 GMT):<br/>
In the end implementation and regulation if needed will set the conditions for what arises. 

</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:21:56 GMT):<br/>
Of course we do our best to design and describe this stuff to meet the objectives of protecting citizens etc
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:33:25 GMT):<br/>
Certainly, and the story we tell makes a difference in how regulators (who may not understand what they're regulating to the fullest extent) and developers will use the technology. That's why I'm a stickler for preserving the story to it's original intent. I don't want another OIDC situation where OIDC is designed well in theory and then the largest implementation get's used to abuse user rights (Facebook).
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:35:39 GMT):<br/>
Well. I guess that is why I do what I do. Because I have those discussions with the regulators. 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:36:35 GMT):<br/>
And I appreciate and trust you'll set their expectations properly. I'm not sure that a drive by developer consuming the package will understand this because it's very much tribal knowledge at this point.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:37:44 GMT):<br/>
I've started writing a RFC for concepts so that this would be less of a concern. Then calling it something like a server agent feels like it could be a potential middle ground. Would that feel like a better name than cloud agent for you?

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:39:36 GMT):<br/>
Yup definitely. Many people including yourself have done a good job telling the story. Let's keep it consistent in the repos as well.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 14:10:57 GMT):<br/>
The terminology of "cloud" vs. "edge" has a long and troubled history. Originally we believed that "cloud" and "edge" were good opposites and that they represented distinctions of trust. We've since realized that there could be untrusted edge agents (rare, but possible), or fully trusted cloud agents (also rare, but possible). So "edge" and "cloud" have more to do with location and less to do with trust. RFC 0004: Agents now has a section that discusses these terms; see https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0004-agents#categorizing-agents.

If you read that section of the RFC, I think you inevitably come to the conclusion that @swcurran and @jljordan_bcgov are correct to want the term "cloud" removed from their codebase name; there is nothing about the codebase that has strong alignment with cloud-based hosting.

The RFC suggests using the platform of an agent as a form of categorization. If you do that, then "mobile" and "server" are pretty good opposites, and a "server agent" does convey pretty well what the acapy codebase's focus is. It could be used as an edge agent or a cloud agent--but either way, it's definitely running a web server, and it's likely running on a machine that acts as a server. (Although it could be run on desktop hardware, its utility as an agent depends on it listening on a port for incoming communication, which makes it more truly server-like.)

So that's why I suggested changing the name to "Aries Server Agent - Python".

@all: I have raised a PR that makes the protocol test suite more important. It updates our docs to say that we can't give an RFC the ACCEPTED status unless we have tests for it in the test suite, and we have at least one impl that passes those tests. It also adds a unit test to enforce this logic. I would like to discuss on today's "B" call with the Aries community.

As noted in the #aries, there was no recording made of todays call - no one there could push the record button. 

How do we make sure that we can record Working Group meetings in the future?  At minimum, we need to know who is authorized to be a Zoom host on the Aries Working Group calls and push the record button.  Ideally, we explicitly hand over both the meeting host and Zoom host roles for all future meetings.  I had thought @kenebert had the power and made sure he was on the meeting, but he wasn't the host.  Thanks!

I thought I had record privileges (since I had been able to record other meetings), but I didn't. Nor could I find anyone who had them. I agree we need to clearly designate who has record privileges and a process for passing control when all hosts are unable to attend.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 00:33:23 GMT):<br/>
@SeanBohan had a way that he was able to designate shared hosts from the host's account. This allowed me to be able to record the Indy meetings in the past. I believe there's a setting in Zoom web app to toggle this feature.

@swcurran I was disappointed with how the call was setup.  We usually set the meeting to auto-record and also add everyone else in the org as alternative hosts.  It looks like we haven't done either yet with the Aries appointments

@george.aristy called to attention the fact that the signature decorator is currently undocumented in aries-rfcs. I had to dig quite a bit to find the original proposed HIPE that introduced it. As the `did-exchange` protocol depends on being able to sign a field, this ought to be resolved quickly -- especially with implementations intending to cut over to did-exchange after IIW.

In regards to the ~sig work, I think it's fine to keep things as they are in did-exchange protocol but the intent is to be using JWS for signing rather than the object I originally created for the ~sig decorator. If you only want to write one, then JWS would be better because that's what's being used in the crypto layer as well. However, it hasn't been documented because I've been caught up with work on products at Mattr and haven't had time to write the new documents like I originally stated awhile ago.

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 23:45:21 GMT):<br/>
What this means is that the did exchange protocol likely needs to be changed.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 23:47:01 GMT):<br/>
To clarify, we can embed a JWS inside of the connection response, essentially replacing the object that we were originally using?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 23:47:17 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's what I think should be done.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 23:51:28 GMT):<br/>
I wonder if it would make sense to first port over the original HIPE into an RFC and then supersede it with an RFC detailing use of JWS. That way we have a cleaner "commit history" so to speak
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 23:52:24 GMT):<br/>
Especially since the original HIPE was, unfortunately, never merged into the indy-hipe repository. All we have right now to refer back to is a closed PR
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 00:01:28 GMT):<br/>
Makes sense to the first suggestion of porting and superseding.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 00:01:53 GMT):<br/>
If you can make a PR on it I can merge it, but I won't have much time to chase that down before IIW.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:07:59 GMT):<br/>
I'd rather we decide now instead of switching gears later (if we've already made up our minds regarding what the final solution will look like)
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:09:29 GMT):<br/>
So, if I understand correctly, what you guys are proposing for the final solution with JWS is to have the `response` msg also include a `did` and `did_doc` attribute (just like the `request` msg), and in addition to that include an attribute with a jws signature on the contents of the `did_doc`?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:11:43 GMT):<br/>
Multiple implementations are already using the "forgotten" signature semantics and I think we still need more definition on using a JWS instead before we can cleanly switch
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:13:10 GMT):<br/>
the dot net framework is already using `conection~sig`: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/eb261677f7d13466b232db0ddfb410afd0a4078f/src/AgentFramework.Core/Messages/Connections/ConnectionResponseMessage.cs#L25
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:13:44 GMT):<br/>
The contents of `connection~sig` is what would change
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:14:39 GMT):<br/>
Right now, that object is what is defined in the closed PR from Indy HIPE. Or at least that's how things are working in the code bases I'm familiar with. I'd have to look into the .net framework
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:16:18 GMT):<br/>
My interpretation was that switching to JWS would essentially mean still having that `connection~sig` object but instead of what we originally defined as the contents of that attribute, we would have a JWS but I'm saying that without knowing in detail what @kdenhartog 's thoughts were on this
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:21:32 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:22:17 GMT):<br/>
So, is part of the proposal to simply continue forth with the did-exchange RFC as it exists in Aries?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:22:34 GMT):<br/>
And then update `connection~sig` later?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:23:47 GMT):<br/>
That's my personal opinion but I certainly don't claim to speak for everyone. Might be a good topic to resolve on the call today. @TelegramSam ?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:29:02 GMT):<br/>
Well... the problem I'm seeing with the RFC as-is is that `ed25519Sha512_single` is not defined at all
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:29:48 GMT):<br/>
And I see a few differences between what's described in the Aries RFC vs the HIPE that's currently sitting in Kyle's forkof indy-hipe
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:31:19 GMT):<br/>
I agree that that is a problem. We obviously need an RFC that defines it. I haven't been able to examine the original HIPE in detail yet. What differences are you seeing?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:32:28 GMT):<br/>
Well, for starters, the Aries RFC doesn't define `ed25519Sha512_single` at all. But if you were to assume that its definition resides in Kyle's HIPE, then I see that the timestamp format is different
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:33:46 GMT):<br/>
I'm confused; which timestamps are you comparing?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:34:18 GMT):<br/>
The one in `sig_data`
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:34:43 GMT):<br/>
I think that's the only difference I see
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:34:47 GMT):<br/>
Ah, I see it now
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:35:25 GMT):<br/>
Also, RFCs shouldn't define standards in terms of specific implementations - see the mention of "indy_crypto_sign" here: https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-hipe/blob/d421fc77bae87c780aad346d15c0c49939adc281/text/digital-signatures/README.md#signing-implementation
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:37:33 GMT):<br/>
I agree; that and any other indy-isms and the timestamp format would naturally need to be addressed in porting to an RFC
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:04:46 GMT):<br/>
All (and especially @dbluhm and @TelegramSam): I really liked our brief discussion about the test suite just now. It made me feel like we need an RFC to explain community expectations about the test suite. I just started a hackmd doc that I filled with questions (but not a lot of answers). When you see the questions, I think you'll see why I don't think it's the same thing as test suite docs. Maybe we could use this to collaborate on the topic? https://hackmd.io/@dhh1128/SyQ0Y4tvS

<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 23:32:29 GMT):<br/>
So what I see is that aries-framework-dotnet is pretty much following the signing implementation steps of the HIPE: https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-hipe/blob/d421fc77bae87c780aad346d15c0c49939adc281/text/digital-signatures/README.md#signing-implementation

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 23:42:39 GMT):<br/>
It is supposed to just be a normal ed25519 signature. However, I named it in that way to account for how signatures using weierstrass curves (P-256, Secp256k1, etc) can support multiple hash algorithms. With regards to Single, I was trying to account for the use of multi-signatures which is why the question at the bottom brings this up.

@swcurran @TelegramSam do you guys agree with @danielhardman 's solution for correlating a did-exchange request to an invitation by using `~thread.phid`? https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/208#issuecomment-538017606
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:14:11 GMT):<br/>
Does it need discussion on a call, or can we update the RFC right away if you guys agree?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:16:58 GMT):<br/>
I would also ping Ryan West and Matthew Hailstone, but I don't have their handles.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:38:00 GMT):<br/>
I'm out on vacation so won't get to it until next week. Seems odd, but I've not thought through it, and I suspect Daniel has 😀. Needs to handle  cases of a single-use and multi-use invitations.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:43:18 GMT):<br/>
Gave it a read. I agree with both the approach and the need for explanitary text.

I would like to get https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pulls merged. Does anybody have concerns about doing so? It's been sitting for a couple weeks waiting for community comment, but only a few thoughts have been shared. We socialized at IIW and got a positive reaction--but that was oral feedback, not written feedback... @jjordan left a question, which I tried to resolve... (If a maintainer is comfortable merging, please do so; I feel like it would be better for someone else to merge this than for me, since it is not a semantically insignificant tweak, and since I raised it.)

What I don't quite operationally understand is how the test suite is built and maintained ... as I understand this implementation for a test suite .. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-protocol-test-suite .. there is code that would need to be written and maintained to reflect something defined in an RFC and that this code would be different that the code for an "agent under test" ... is that a correct understanding?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 18:47:40 GMT):<br/>
@jljordan_bcgov @danielhardman A possibly related concern to the above point: Let's say that someone writes an RFC and creates an implementation and even writes the code for the test suite. Is there criteria for the test suite maintainers to accept the new code? Will the test suite maintainers have the bandwidth (and also interest) in dealing with (reviewing and merging) a ... wide range ... of test suite submissions?

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 19:26:43 GMT):<br/>
@jljordan_bcgov The required code to test an agent is significantly simpler than the code of an actual agent. It is still code that needs to be maintained but I think we can get to a point where the writing of tests is not much more difficult than writing an RFC itself is.

For us, do nothing is a good approach.

What does the Go folks and the IBM folks think?  We were trying to move to support them.

@TelegramSam and @cam-parra : I was able to rename the wallet repo to Ares - AMS. However, I couldn't change the list of maintainers, and I cannot create the new repo Ares - core. We need to contact Rye for that. I am using rocketchat from my mobile phone because the Mac client broke when I upgraded to Catalina, so it's hard for me to paste hyperlinks into this. I'm using voice to text. Could one of you paste a hyperlink to the Ares 3 ticket for Rye, and ask him to take care of this additional busy work? Tell him I tried to use the Privileges he gave me, and I could have done it in some groups, but it appears that I can't do it across the board.

@danielhardman the mac client works if you uninstall the client downloaded from the Apple store and download the package directly from the website. The link is the "direct download" button at https://rocket.chat/install

I just added a comment to the Jira 3 about the repo names and would like to propose that some of the repo names change to match W3C naming. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/ARIES-3?focusedCommentId=64801&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-64801

```
Troy Ronda had asked a question on the call about the term "dri" and I incorrectly answered that it is the term used by W3C for the source of verification data ("keys and other relevant data" per the spec) for verifiable credentials – aka the ledger.  The correct W3C term is "Verifiable Data Registry".  See this section.] of the verifiable credentials spec.

I suggest that we change the "dri" acronyms to be "vdri" to align with the W3C verifiable credential data model spec.

As a side note, I also suggest that we stick to github issues for everything Aries.

Hey all, @brentzundel has proposed moving the Rich Schema RFC (0250) from `proposed` status to `accepted` status. If anyone has objections to this change in status please raise them in the next week. Otherwise we'll assume consensus on the RFC has been achieved. Also, I'm taking note that @troyronda has raised a concern already and the RFC has been modified. Can you take a look to see if it addresses your concerns Troy?

Hey in regards to status, what's our take on converting things from Accepted to Adopted? I'm realizing that Accepted has become what I originally invisioned Adopted would be and demonstrated is becoming what I originally thought accepted would be. This doesn't align with what's written though, so I'm curious what difference do we expect to convert an accepted status to an adopted status?

@kdenhartog : To convert to ADOPTED, we'd need to see a really robust testing strategy and broad impl. The old encr envelope stuff might have approached that, but IMO we keep resetting the status by changing our minds about how we're going to do it next. This is one of my sources of frustration; I thought we had something working with reasonable adoption, and now I'm feeling like we're starting over. Certainly we can't claim that something not yet implemented, that's being discussed in PR and issue comment streams, deserves the ADOPTED status.

Yes, I agree that anything new would not even be of a proposed status yet. I was thinking of what’s implemented during that comment.  And more than anything I wanted to get a sense of what’s the rough boundary between accepted and adopted status. I’m uncertain of the additional hurdles that adopted places on an RFC when converting from accepted status. For example would the agents RFC qualify for adopted status?

I ran a simple experiment in aries-framework-go to compile to WebAssembly. So far, I tested starting up the framework and then calling DID Exchange CreateInvitation where I saw the freshly generated invitation (in this case, the wasm file was loaded into Safari v13). Note: I had to comment out the leveldb persistence code to get compilation to work. Thought I would share as it seemed interesting :).

Just doule-checking that the message type changes from "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/didexchange/1.0/request" to "https://didcomm.org/didexchange/1.0/request"?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 22:41:15 GMT):<br/>
So the equivalent update for DID Exchange would appear to be "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/didexchange/1.0/request" to "https://didcomm.org/didexchange/1.0/request". i.e., Replace "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec" with "https://didcomm.org"

@swcurran and @TelegramSam and @kdenhartog and any others who are interested: @jjordan and @drummondreed  and @darrell.odonnell  and @vinomaster and others have submitted an RFC about the general solution layers required for self-sovereign or decentralized identity. (My name is on it, too, but I am really more of a mechanical contributor than an author; I just helped fix some graphics and get it merged.) Currently it is numbered 0289. However, I believe this RFC should be renumbered to 0001; I think it is the most high-level or foundational piece of content in the entire RFCs repo. It describes the general problem domain and how the various pieces of a software stack contribute and layer on one another; as we describe Aries at lower levels of detail, I think we'll be referring to it constantly.

Are you okay with us renumbering this one?

@sergey.minaev : I head that you were interested in working on an RFC about general Aries architecture. The RFC I mentioned above ^^ would be a good reference. It is NOT the RFC you are imagining, but would provide background for it. Perhaps that RFC you want to write ought to be RFC 0002 and could include a bunch of the architecture diagrams that we've been trying to polish in this slide deck: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L5L4QcZOATrn9rj4bEMmlbvij9XWyqgQRoWO-HNiUGw/edit. Such an RFC could then be cited by the root READMEs of various repos we create or have already created for Aries (e.g., an aries-vdri repo could point to the arch diagram checked in with RFC 0002 that situates the VDRI component in inside the larger Aries stack that maps to the general problem domain description of RFC 0001).

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 16:33:11 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:00:31 GMT):<br/>
The problem with that kind of process is that permalinks become entrenched. Content gets indexed by google at old links. John Jordan is on the road right now, and told me last night he wanted to share the doc with people he is meeting. I don't want to perpetuate an RFC number that's going to be changed.

There is no document or process that covers this situation, so socializing it and having a waiting period feel to me like things we'd do out of an abundance of caution. Are we expecting there to be lots of pushback? This is NOT a request that we change the status of the RFC doc to ACCEPTED or ADOPTED...

We could socialize this idea in #aries right now, rather than waiting for a call and so forth...
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:07:59 GMT):<br/>
I reading the document now.  Finding some issues with it, but generally in agreement.  We would leave 289 in place as a redirector to the new location. I don't see that as a big deal.

Part of my reaction was that this was offered as an approach and immediately followed with "and this should be RFC 0002", which I definitely think is jumping the gun.  Lets get content and then consider if it should be a magic RFC. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:11:03 GMT):<br/>
Stephen: I think you're conflating 2 different things. RFC 0002 is a number I suggested for a non-existent document, and that is an "approach" document. The document I'm proposing to renumber is 0289, and I'm suggesting it be renamed to 0001. The latter doc is not an approach; it's a survey of the conceptual territory in our space.

Of course we can tweak a doc--but we don't normally renumber things after we accept them; we get the permanent number when it is proposed.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:11:39 GMT):<br/>
No, that's exactly what I understood.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:12:22 GMT):<br/>
Suggesting a non-existent document be RFC 0002 is IMHO odd.

I understand 289 -> 001, and generally agree, but I think the community should decide.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:13:07 GMT):<br/>
Leaving a redirect will require us to create some ugly kludges in our unit tests and automation, since the old doc will be degenerate.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:14:57 GMT):<br/>
I don't know what to tell you. I think its a bad idea.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:15:12 GMT):<br/>
What is a bad idea: 0001 or 0002?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:15:28 GMT):<br/>
Please keep these two ideas separate. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:15:43 GMT):<br/>
0002 is entirely unrelated to what I'm proposing.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:15:56 GMT):<br/>
I get that. I'm talking 0001 without community agreement.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:17:01 GMT):<br/>
So do you have a problem with me proposing it to the community right now, instead of waiting for a call?

Yes
</p>

why?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:17:49 GMT):<br/>
You can propose it now, and I'm against completing the process until the community responds.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:18:22 GMT):<br/>
And you're saying that the way to measure "the community responds" must be to let a 2-week comment period elapse?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:18:31 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:18:43 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:19:02 GMT):<br/>
I think this is a pretty important issue and the community needs to weigh in.  You want to make this a go to document for the entire community. That's not a small issue.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:20:41 GMT):<br/>
I certainly think there is worthwhile and useful content for a community introduction in it.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:21:02 GMT):<br/>
but there are bits that could have been ... perhaps moved to a particular flavor.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:22:37 GMT):<br/>
I think you are confusing acceptance (a defined status adjudication process) with numbering. Nobody is saying that the content of the document in its current form has to be what the community accepts. What I am saying is that a document with the current scope / topic belongs as RFC 0001. The community gets to debate its content just like any other RFC, until we are happy with it. But there's no question in my mind that this is topic #1 for the community, and it feels silly for me to wonder whether that's the case.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:23:11 GMT):<br/>
What alternative topic would you suggest ought to be topic #1?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:23:18 GMT):<br/>
I'm not confusing that. I'm saying if we are going to suddenly decide to have a flagship RFC, the community should weigh in.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:23:38 GMT):<br/>
I don't have an alternative to propose.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:23:51 GMT):<br/>
I don't think waiting is a crisis.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:35:00 GMT):<br/>
Okay. I'll follow the alternative process that you're recommending, Stephen. However, I'm gritting my teeth. I don't like polluting the RFC index and namespace with redirects, and I don't agree that numbering a doc is the same as accepting it, and I don't agree that assigning #1 to this topic is controversial. I do agree that it's worth discussing whether we want to have a "highest level survey of the problem space" RFC at all, and I do agree that the content of such an RFC should be vetted by the community very carefully, correcting any concerns like the ones Troy is raising. I think that by following the process you're recommending, we'll  perpetuate a misunderstanding about the relative gravitas of an RFC with only the PROPOSED status, and get bogged down in debates about content that don't belong as part of this numbering question. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:35:58 GMT):<br/>
Look for my post in #aries proposing the number; I'll also add myself to the agenda on tomorrow's two calls to make the proposal.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:02:47 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran : I'm feeling more cheerful now that I've had time to think a bit more about this, and I'm regretting that I pushed back so hard. Thanks for your patience with me. I eventually come around, if you outwait my impatience... :-)
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:05:59 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda : can you capture some of your feedback where RFC 0289 feels too Sovrin-y, as one or more issues in github? I don't want to lose that important input, and I also don't want the doc to end up feeling too Sovrin-y. That was not its intent. Dan G just added a section about the notion of network-of-networks, where multiple instances of multiple networks, including R3 and EEA and Fabric, fit into the diagram...
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:10:53 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:11:59 GMT):<br/>
I would summarize as being careful about the description of ZKP, governance frameworks, and being inclusive of cases beyond physical credential analogues.

I think it's appropriate to leave a 'redirect' RFC in place when another is promoted. I don't mean a literal redirect, just a placeholder RFC as a tombstone of sorts. This would require no changes to the CI and processing pipelines.

@danielhardman you mentioned above that some may want to put together an RFC for a general architecture  of Aries. This seems like the wrong approach since every piece of the architecture should have an individual RFC. And then maybe there could be something that says "these are the RFCs that make up the foundation of aries"
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 00:49:44 GMT):<br/>
Building up an architecture from the constituent pieces and breaking down an architecture from a global picture are both reasonable things to do, and they are not mutually exclusive. One process is called analysis; the other is called synthesis.

The drawback of starting from a big picture is that you can't be sure of the details. The drawback of starting from the details is that you can't be sure they add up to a big picture that you like.

In my experience, the best architectural output is achieved by iterating and alternating between these two modes, not by insisting that one or the other is correct. So my recommendation would be to do some work in both ways, and see what interesting tensions we uncover as we do it.

I have already attempted to start a big picture once (the slides I sent around; https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L5L4QcZOATrn9rj4bEMmlbvij9XWyqgQRoWO-HNiUGw/edit). This is just a beginning, not a last word on that side of the work.

The work you are doing to clarify the architecture of KMS is starting from the other side, and is also important. I predict that when we compare your doc draft to my diagram draft, we will find a lot that fits together and a few places that don't. Those few places will be worth learning from.

So: I'm not advocating anything that should disrupt the efforts you already have underway. AND I'm also suggesting that thinking about the big picture is a good idea. I'm only pushing back on the assumption that the only way to proceed is to build everything from the details toward the general big picture; we should do both.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 00:54:09 GMT):<br/>
BTW, do you have a draft of the KMS stuff that we can start looking at?
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 01:33:52 GMT):<br/>
I do apologize I realized that my statement above makes sounds like I am against your work on the slides. I actually really appreciate that work and have used it in my draft for the RFC for the KMS. I am more trying to compile all the good ideas that have been agreed upon so my draft may look familiar because it is compiled and then concepts are explained by me. 

My fear here is that we have a general RFC that goes against the KMS architecture (or any other piece of the architecture), therefore causing a divide. There are certain concepts that have been sold to the community already would be an anti-pattern to renege on those.

here is what I have compiled so far:  https://github.com/mac-arrap/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0276-key-management-service (it's pretty similar to what you've descibed) but I realized today that this is incomplete if we do not give a rough outline of what the APIs will look like. So I have invited the community to participate in that effort and realize that it might take some sitting down and discussing this.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 01:39:19 GMT):<br/>
What you have so far seems like a reasonable start to me, but it is maybe 5% of what that doc needs. The APIs only add another 5%.

I don't get why you say in your table that the Indy wallet doesn't have pluggable persistance. That was one of the major features of the Indy wallet--a defining characteristic, even. Maybe you mean something different from it than what I guess?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 01:42:27 GMT):<br/>
Some major sections that I think the doc will eventually need include:

1. What kind of data goes into a KMS? Why?
2. Is a KMS searchable? How?
3. How is a KMS protected at rest? How is it protected when accessed over the wire?
4. What scale and performance contract does a KMS offer?
5. How is data in a KMS replicated? (I suspect the easy answer: "not at all" is a dead end, since DIDs and public keys do need replication)
6. How does backup and recovery work?
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 01:46:27 GMT):<br/>
I meant that indy does not offer a pluggable storage for keys themselves. If that is a mistake I can fix that . Thank you I will start working on those questions and update the doc tomorrow. I do think that it will take more than just me to populate this document since there are many details that must be agreed upon and many may have specific needs that need to be fulfilled by the kms.

This "Aries Stable" proposal leaves out newer members like ourselves. Despite our newness, we have already made substantial contributions, so this proposal (and general process) gives concern. We are very focused on a ledger, credential, and governance framework neutral approach to DID communications.

On my phone, but quick answer is that  certain PRs for this RFC have to be handled like PRs that change the status of a protocol RFC to "Accepted" - they need community agreement before merging. I think that is what Sam is highlighting.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:39:56 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda I think we handle the message type change different than other protocol changes. Meaning, I don't think we need to 'version' them the same way. Further, I think we can have a conversion period handled in a small way within codebases that allows a transition period.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:52:11 GMT):<br/>
Adding a detect and replace block of code should be possible in a single place within a codebase. This allows for support of both for a period.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:52:33 GMT):<br/>
for the RFCs, This is also a search and replace operation.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:52:43 GMT):<br/>
combined approach means much less operational churn.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:54:02 GMT):<br/>
when we have a plan, we can set a community goal for accepting the new type strings. (as described above).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:54:06 GMT):<br/>
We (Nick) did a cut at an implementation last week. It does get a bit tricky and invasive to support both when you have to track which version of the @type to use with each outbound message based on the inbound message of the thread.  It is not a search and replace, but it is doable. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:54:37 GMT):<br/>
then a goal to transmit the new type, then a goal to remove old support.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:54:53 GMT):<br/>
We plan to support both for a period of time.  See: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/244
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:57:33 GMT):<br/>
We are also making some changes in ACA-Py that will make the transition from Connection to DID Exchange easier. It has the same issue with tracking the inbound message to know what to support, with the added fun of having a generated `invitation` (first message) not knowing what protocol family to use.  Our suggestion is that we make `invitation` separate from either Connection or DID Exchange to eliminate that issue.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:58:10 GMT):<br/>
That would still leave the issue of how to respond to an invitation - which protocol to use.

@rjones I'm interested in using Github Actions to automatically upload packages to PyPI for Aries Static Agent Python on new releases but this requires using secrets which I am unable to manage or create on the repository. Is that something I can be granted access to? It's not too big of a deal but it would be convenient

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 18:34:51 GMT):<br/>
Basically, any place in an RFC where there is a naked public key.  I'm not 100% sold on did:key, although after the call Wednesday I'm on board.  I do think that at minimum, we need to use multicodecs, so that we have both the key and algorithm in a concise form.  But Tobias was pretty convincing to me on the benefits of using did:key.

I don't think it will be particularly hard to implement.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 18:37:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I definitely think naked keys are nowhere close to ideal. Some encoding mechanism like multicodecs or JWKs should be used (the former preferred due to reduced size).
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 18:37:57 GMT):<br/>
What I did not understand was your statement about the other fields of did:key being useful. And you specifically pointed out `keyAgreement`. That alone reminded me of that weird quirk that some implementations are doing.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 18:38:11 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand why we need everything else aside from the key.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 18:38:48 GMT):<br/>
There's also this point about documentation on usage of the key being built into did:key - I'd like to see how/where that is done.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 18:44:58 GMT):<br/>
I assume you know about this: https://digitalbazaar.github.io/did-method-key/   @tplooker - do you know where those others would be used?

Also, what are your thoughts about the practicality of using both derivations of the keys?  Presumably you can start with either and derive the other?

</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 18:47:13 GMT):<br/>
I'll go through their method spec now
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 19:01:42 GMT):<br/>
It leaves me with the same questions. :/
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 21:07:34 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, there's not much about how the entries should be used, just the transformation from the input to the DIDDoc.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 23:25:52 GMT):<br/>
@george.aristy which elements of the did:key did document did you find confusing? The keyAgreement section makes it explict that the key defined in the section is appropriate for keyAgreement usage e.g doing ECDH KDF
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 23:26:03 GMT):<br/>
Which we need for both auth and anon crypt
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 23:27:22 GMT):<br/>
without being explicit we risk someone using a key inappropriately, for instance if you use ed25519 keys for this purpose without doing the conversion there are potential vulnerabilities 
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 23:28:31 GMT):<br/>
If I was going to create a non-repudiable signature in a did comm message I also need the key defined under the authentication section of the did:key did doc as this is an ed25519 key appropriate for signing
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Sat, 30 Nov 2019 23:33:03 GMT):<br/>
did:key would just be a more formal way of achieving the approach than a raw multi-codec public key, the main thing I wanted to point out was that if we do go with just a raw multi-codex public key, we are creating a new type of identifier and as such it should be appropriately defined.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 03 Dec 2019 14:01:19 GMT):<br/>
@tplooker isn't the Linked Data Crypto Suite Registry supposed to fulfil that same purpose? To document the key's crypto suite and usage?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 20 Dec 2019 23:50:21 GMT):<br/>
There are a number of aries rfcs that are not status changes.  Is there any reason that they are not being merged?  I'm going to do a few that I didn't write and can do those as well, if no one objects or no one else merges those.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 06 Jan 2020 04:29:20 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 06 Jan 2020 04:29:34 GMT):<br/>
At the very least we can merge and if additional changes are made new PRs can be added.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 06 Jan 2020 04:40:50 GMT):<br/>
@george.aristy, im unsure what you mean? if you are referring to the proofPurpose field in a Linked Data proof, that tells you what the key should be authorised with in reference to  the "verificationMethod". E.g take the following proof

```
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1",
  "title": "Hello World!",
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "created": "2019-08-23T20:21:34Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:123456#key1",
    "domain": "example.org",
    "jws": "eyJ0eXAiOiJK...gFWFOEjXk"
  }
}
```

This proof states the key identified by `did:example:123456#key1` should appear authorized in the did document retrieved by did:example:123456 for the "assertionMethod" proof purpose authorization is conveyed by the keys membership in the "assertionMethod" array element of the DID document
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 06 Jan 2020 04:42:19 GMT):<br/>
A DID document conveys both keys and the authority those keys have on behalf of the DID subject
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 08 Jan 2020 15:14:27 GMT):<br/>
@tplooker I was referring to how each LD Crypto Suite details how it's intended to be used. This is one of the benefits that proponents of did:key tout, yet we already have this in the form of existing crypto suites (if we accept JSON-LD as a representation for DIDs)
</p>

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 16:45:50 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam : can you please give us maintainers a 1-paragraph summary of the change in process we should expect as a result of this change? Do we just cross indexing off our list of worries in all contexts, forever? Or will we get error messages about the index not needing a change, that we should know to ignore, in cases where a PR doesn't introduce an index change?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 16:57:26 GMT):<br/>
Index generation becomes the concern of the maintainers, not the individual contributors. We should update the github action if we desire it to be different.

Right now, if a merge doesn't need an index update, the action 'fails' because the index generated is not different as a result of the merge and cannot be committed. For the time being that can be ignored. An update to the action can handle that case more gracefully.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 16:58:12 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman Is that what you were looking for?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 16:59:13 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's just the clarification that I needed. Should we modify /contributing.md to remove the instruction to update the index?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 17:00:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 23:47:23 GMT):<br/>
I'm a bit confused about the implications of this. Does this mean I'll need to update index.md each time we're merging a PR or is the actions handling that?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 00:13:39 GMT):<br/>
The actions are handling that.  You never need to touch index.md again.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 00:14:02 GMT):<br/>
With each merge, the github action will regen and commit a new version of index.md.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 02:51:54 GMT):<br/>
ok, that's seriously cool! Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 04:11:08 GMT):<br/>
FYI I added a label "Merge Ready" for when the author feels a PR is ready to be merged. What's peoples thoughts on using this so the author can indicate to maintainers that they'd like it to be merged? If people agree with this, I'll give a short announcement on the afternoon call about it this week.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 15:16:57 GMT):<br/>
I like it.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 19:00:47 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I think I have the index generation action fixed on the RFC repo. It should succeed even if the index had no changes as a result of the PR.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 21:35:38 GMT):<br/>
So, does anybody here know when branch protection was turned on for the RFC repo?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 21:52:38 GMT):<br/>
I'm pretty sure the branch protection is what is breaking the auto building index.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 23:40:05 GMT):<br/>
Hmm. I wonder why the push is failing then. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 00:05:18 GMT):<br/>
Line 14 and 15 show it is being rejected. If I had to guess, what we would need to do is make a branch the bot can access
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 00:07:10 GMT):<br/>
Could the bot create a PR? I notice this repo has a bunch of stale branches that probably should have been PRs
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 06:20:48 GMT):<br/>
those were PRs, but are protected branches now, and I can't delete them.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 06:21:14 GMT):<br/>
I don't really want to create PRs for these autogenerated files....
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 16:40:00 GMT):<br/>
I have another idea.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 16:42:09 GMT):<br/>
I've applied branch protection to master, directly. You should be able to delete the other branches.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 18:08:56 GMT):<br/>
In searching around, it looks like the PR pathway is the way to go. https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Allowing-github-actions-bot-to-push-to-protected-branch/m-p/34454#M1924

@dbluhm would you be interested in adding `Hyperledger` as an owner to `aries-staticagent-python` on PyPi? I would then add a token and send a PR to update the GitHub action for new releases.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 23:01:02 GMT):<br/>
https://pypi.org/user/hyperledger/ s/owner/whatever is appropriate to publish new releases
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 23:02:28 GMT):<br/>
Added as maintainer which should be able to publish new releases
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 23:05:19 GMT):<br/>
OK. I replaced the existing secret with the new one. I don't see a reason to rename it.

</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 05:43:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm frustrated at the collission between GitHub Actions and branch protection.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 05:44:35 GMT):<br/>
For now, it seems that a 2 part strategy is in order: 1. Respond to merge by regenerating the index and pushing it as a PR. Then, 2. Auto merge that PR and deleting the branch it came from.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 16:55:54 GMT):<br/>
Which is totally how it should be. 😂
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:00:18 GMT):<br/>
I disagree for bots.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:01:32 GMT):<br/>
which is why I added the laughing emoji
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:02:37 GMT):<br/>
Considering an alternate strategy: have an `autogenerated` branch that isn't subject to the same branch protection rules. The autogeneration checks out that branch, merges in master, runs the generation script, commits the new autogenerated files, and pushes to the `autogenerated` branch. We remove the autogenerated file, and change the links to it to point to the autogenerated branch version.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:03:06 GMT):<br/>
this has slight inspiration from the `gh-pages` branch practice.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:03:29 GMT):<br/>
Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:04:39 GMT):<br/>
I think that's a reasonable work-around
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:06:48 GMT):<br/>
I would be okay with that.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:06:51 GMT):<br/>
@rjones what are the branch protection rules in place now? how many reviewers, etc?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:07:31 GMT):<br/>
Branch protection is only applied to `master` at this point. You're free to noodle on other branches
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:07:41 GMT):<br/>
right, but what does master have on it?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:08:04 GMT):<br/>
it's frustrating that I can't see a read only version even if I can't change it.

`Require status checks to pass before merging, Require branches to be up to date before merging, DCO, Include administrators`
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:09:28 GMT):<br/>
the benefit of maintaining a separate branch is that we avoid all the issues at once.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:09:28 GMT):<br/>
Ry gave me permissions on this part, so I can facilitate to some extent.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:09:45 GMT):<br/>
I turned off the `restrict` and re-enabled `DCO` since I only had those settings for trying to work around the bot issue
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:10:32 GMT):<br/>
Fabric had a similar issue - they created a GitHub user which they added to the "allow" block to work around it
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:10:41 GMT):<br/>
It doesn't feel 'clean' but it feels cleaner than the other options.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:11:05 GMT):<br/>
I imagine there will be future movement around bots and GH Actions because of this conflict.

Related Thoughts: Actions need a button to manually run an action. (has been well requested of the actions team)
also: Having a draft mode that allows testing of action changes prior to commit would be great.

@swcurran @andrew.whitehead I've seen you guys mention difficulties occuring when ACKs are missing during implementations. Given this is a fundamental question that I always refer to as "reliability guarantees" could I get some of your time on a separate call to discuss this with you? Most recent mention of this was #3 in this comment https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging/issues/38#issuecomment-606846036
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 17:48:38 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog - yes glad to talk about it.  Set up something for later this afternoon our time?

Hey I was looking at the Aries repos.  Of the 30 repos, it looks like 13 were created and never used--created in anticipation of an evolution that never happened.  I suggest that we delete (not archive) all of them and if and when they are needed in the future, they can be created.  Any objections?

The list is:

- aries-sdk
- aries-agent
- aries-sdk-python
- aries-sdk-go
- aries-sdk-dotnet
- aries-kms
- aries-vdri
- aries-core
- aries-kms-postgres
- aries-ams-sqlite Archived
- aries-sdk-ios
- indy-vdri-aries
- aries-vdri-peer Archived

@swcurran let me know when, and I'll do it

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 20:59:29 GMT):<br/>
yeah preferably, I didn't have a link to include

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 21:02:11 GMT):<br/>
I'm adding him :-)

Last call on this - anyone care if we eliminate these repos?

@swcurran one more approval please - there are two repos with non-zero code, but IIRC that code is just copied from elsewhere.

Is anyone else getting automated security notifications for aries packages? In particular I've gotten ones for Aries-framework-javascript, aries-toolbox, and aries-framework-go. Given I don't work in these codebases closely enough, I want to leave it to maintainers to merge PRs so I'm not breaking anything. I'm happy to assist with triaging them if maintainers can assist with merging PRs.
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 14:33:15 GMT):<br/>
i believe there is no code in there. Just some directories but yeah this is not expected to grow and can be done away with. But in my opinion this repo should serve as an MVP for a kms 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 14:52:01 GMT):<br/>
I can move it to the hyperledger-archives org if you like, @swcurran 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 15:26:19 GMT):<br/>
There seems to be much more attention at the `*-framework-*` level of things in Aries than the language sdk levels.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 15:26:43 GMT):<br/>
under that flow, we likely don't need this repo around.

Hello Aries maintainers! Friendly reminder to pls join us for the Marketing Committee-DevRel call tomorrow, 4/8 at 9am PT.  This is a great opportunity to learn how you can get involved in many aspects of Hyperledger marketing including overall messaging, events, content, social media, PR etc. Feel free to add items to the agenda: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/x/_QjcAQ Hope to see you there :slight_smile: 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 01 May 2020 01:45:20 GMT):<br/>
Who maintains the aries-toolbox? I have gotten more notifications about security vulnerabilities and would like to keep them updated. I can commit to handling the security concerns in that PR if no one feels capable of reviewing it who's already a maintainer. Also @swcurran are you guys using this in anyway while demoing ACA-py?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 May 2020 01:46:16 GMT):<br/>
No, we're not using it to demo.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 May 2020 01:50:21 GMT):<br/>
You might check with Robert Mitwiki. He's done some cool things with it.

</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Mon, 04 May 2020 06:42:23 GMT):<br/>
hi, this what we did with aries-toolbox is to convert it to the web application for ease of use and use it for purpose of testing and demoing OCA, you can take a look here: https://github.com/thclab/aries
if this would be any interest to merge into main repo we are more then happy to provide it. The idea is to continue converting aries-toolbox into more user friendly testing environment.

Hi - I had a request from Jakub Koci and Ajay Jadhav to be made maintainers of https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript as well as moderators of https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/aries , which would give the ability to schedule meetings and the like. I'd like some guidance from the broader community
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 17:02:36 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam @kdenhartog ^^
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 17:30:46 GMT):<br/>
I didn't even know that lists.hyperledger.org/g/aries existed; I went looking for such a mailing list once, and couldn't find it. So I doubt it's being used. Either that, or I'm woefully behind the times. :-)

Re. being maintainers, I see that Jakub has been making contributions there consistently, but that Ajay has only made one, 6 months ago. I don't have any other insight into who would make a good maintainer of the project, so I defer to others who may know more. (Certainly we want people who are active to be maintainers, if they are active in healthy ways. I have no reason to doubt that's the case here. I'm just ignorant.)
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 18:14:49 GMT):<br/>
Thanks correct @danielhardman.
@jakubkoci has been a major contributor to the repo, my contributions have been mainly on the project roadmap, technical discussions/decisions and reviewing/merging PRs.

Ah...I contributed a bunch to the Indy one, but thought this one was an SEP.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:43:36 GMT):<br/>
we could combine them, no?

maybe "Aries, Indy" report
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:44:31 GMT):<br/>
I think that might be bad optically @rjones, for those that are Aries folks but not Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:44:32 GMT):<br/>
No - best to keep them separate.  The division between the projects is become clearly, and is appropriate.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:45:20 GMT):<br/>

@swcurran just went through the Libindy API for the presentation attachment. My thoughts:

* hard to read (it's docu for a rust API)
* lacks examples
* not clear what non_revoc_interval is
* not clear how users can model n-of-m from group 1, n-of-m from group 2, etc., using WQL

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 16:41:17 GMT):<br/>
Actually, I haven't been looking at Presentation Requests (step 1 in proving) so much as at Presentations (step 2). However, @brentzundel has been engaged with DIF on this topic, and I did leave some feedback on DIF's presentation definition format. See https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange/pull/18.

Here is one other doc, now more than 3 years old, that represents some initial thinking on the topic.

Here is one other doc, now more than 3 years old, that represents some initial thinking on the topic. It is clearly dated in several ways, but notice its answer to @george.aristy 's question about how to express boolean choices and m-of-n stuff, and also the way it allows both disclosure and predicates. https://docs.google.com/document/d/117cuMhMF_BLMniyCwnd0cu_Uj5H_45loZiqO1a3Ln7U/edit?usp=sharing

Thanks George --- I agree. I've been wanting to get a document that covers all the features of the Indy Presentation Request.  Answers to points:

* hard to read (it's docu for a rust API)
  * Yup
* lacks examples for requests and their respective responses
  * Yup
* not clear what non_revoc_interval is
  * This is how the verifier specifies how recent the revocation registry check must be, allowing flexibility in asking for revocation time range.
* not clear how users can model n-of-m from group 1, n-of-m from group 2, etc., using WQL
  * The "names" array allows for that.  You can specify multiple names with a single restriction set, and the claims must from a single credential.
* a bit curious on the choice of mixing WQL (low layer) with an interoperable format for requesting and issuing presentations (semantic layer)
  * The need for the prover to determine what credentials can be used to satisfy each claim (or claim set) requires a query of the agent's storage.  This is one of the features that is very powerful in the Indy implementation.  Something we don't want to lose.

Also to be clear: I'm proud of Indy presentation requests. Despite their shortcomings, they've been solving real problems in a powerful way, for quite a while now. (The non-revoc-interval is a great example of a vital feature that many other attempts haven't tackled yet.) We should fix the flaws, and we should also converge upon / learn from / resemble the DIF work as much as it makes sense, on a timing that makes sense. But we shouldn't feel bad about our first cut.

I agree.  The Indy team did an extremely good job on this and "it just works".  I've been very nervous about the DIF and CCG work on this as I suspect they will lose key features.

@danielhardman @swcurran @esplinr @andrew.whitehead @tomislav just in case: I apologize if my thoughts above on Libindy's API gives the impression that I am minimizing the quality of the work product. That was not my intention. I was evaluating it purely in the context as a proposed presentation format for an RFC that's in the works. 

The Indy project has pushed the boundaries in this space by leaps and bounds thanks to you guys, and i congratulate you and the rest of the team on the outstanding success!

Does it allow for multiple set memberships? Like, "N of group 1" AND "M of group 2" ?

No worries George -- didn't interpret it that way.  It's something I've been worried about.

Specifically things like being able to flexibly convert a request to a credential search; predicates for ZKPs; a focus on proving claims from many credentials vs. proving one full credential (e.g. selective disclosure handling); self-attested claims.  Things like that.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 21 Jul 2020 18:30:21 GMT):<br/>
Basically, it's the same as a presentation-request, but sent to initiate the delivery of a proof (which is a non-obvious use case), or more likely, sent as a reply to a presentation-request as a negotiation.

We'd like to move this Interop Testing repo into Hyperledger -- https://github.com/bcgov/aries-agent-test-harness

`The Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH) is a BDD-based test execution engine and set of tests for evaluating the interoperability of Aries Agents and Agent Frameworks. `

The necessary structure and files are in the repo, and we believe the content is now sufficiently mature to try to attract more contributors and participants. We are actively developing test cases in the repo and have the vast majority of the Aries AIP 1.0 test cases in place.  We are working to remove Indy-isms (e.g. focusing on the RFCs not the Indy details) in the test suite with the goal of broadening the applicability of the interop testing capabilities.

Any objections to this contribution to Hyperledger?

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 31 Jul 2020 23:25:55 GMT):<br/>
I continue to be uneasy about it because I don't like the need to implement an HTTP backchannel for mobile agents, and I don't like the lack of a reference agent to test against; I fear that acapy will become a default reference, and I don't think that default is correct. Moving it into Hyperledger makes it more canonical and makes my own unwillingness to invest in such a backchannel harder to explain. However, have expressed my discomfort, I acknowledge what I said in an earlier conversation on this subject, which is that this is a do-ocracy, and I won't stand in the way of the doers.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 01 Aug 2020 16:55:19 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I don't really understand some of what you are saying.  Have you taken a look at the test harness recently?  Since the discussion in Utah in December, both test approaches have settled on the need for a backchannel.  I don't understand how one can do a test suite without a meta driver to manipulate the agents-under-test.

I'm not sure why you particularly mentioned a mobile agent, but it's really not clear to me how you would do headless mobile testing without some sort of backchannel.  We've not yet investigated it, but we're fairly confident that the path we're taking is more likely to be successful on that front.

The purpose of the test harness is to test interoperability vs. conformance, so the concept of a reference agent is not really relevant. Ideally, each project will invest effort into making their framework (and agents) testable using the harness. We now have two more or less complete backchannel implementations with 3 runnable (acapy, aries-framework-dotnet, vcx) frameworks. In doing the second backchannel, we've neutralized the test cases and made sure they focus on the RFC, not on any implementation. As issues are found, we've debated the source - the RFC, the test case, the frameworks - and found satisfactory answers.  We're pretty close to AIP 1.0 complete with the test harness, working now on the connectionless presentation request test cases.

I am concerned that we are diluting effort with the two approaches and would rather see a focus on interoperability vs. conformance.  As you say, it's a do-cracy and we're definitely try to demonstrate by doing.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 15:32:26 GMT):<br/>
I'm not down on backchannels; the original RFC about a testing strategy includes that concept, and the older aries agent test suite includes that concept as well. What I'm down on is a *RESTful* backchannel modeled around acapy's preconceptions of what an agent's RESTful interface should be like, as a requirement for every agent under test. I know that's a natural fit for acapy, but not every agent has a goal of exposing a RESTful interface. Mobile agents are message processors, not web services. Same for most static agents. The least common denominator for agents is message processing and protocols. Therefore the backchannel should be a protocol, to avoid requiring every agent in the ecosystem to build and maintain a RESTful interface to be testable. Adapting the backchannel to an http transport would be a piece of cake; that can be done once, generically, for all agents.  Instead we've introduced a new requirement on agents -- not just a requirement for a new feature (which is what support for a test backchannel protocol would be) -- but a requirement for an entirely different type of technology.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 15:33:11 GMT):<br/>
If aries agent test harness proposed to test agents over a protocol, I would be a supporter.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 15:37:50 GMT):<br/>
@darrell.odonnell : regarding an alternative, I wanted a compliance test suite, not a paired interop test harness. So the alternative I was most interested in was aries agent test suite, which predates the test harness that Stephen is now advocating. I do see the value in pairwise interop testing, and I could live with a shift to interop as the emphasis, but I strongly dislike the RESTfulness of the harness. For Connect.Me and similar agents, we have to artificially construct interfaces that have no rational relationship to the way the agent actually works. For Evernym's Verity, we actually do have a RESTful interface, but it has to be adapted pretty significantly to conform to the test harness. The net result is that we pay an ongoing, obnoxious tax to evaluate interop. If we modeled the backchannel as a protocol, the tax would be minor and result in simple, clean code that had little maintenance cost.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 15:40:25 GMT):<br/>
The frustrating thing to me is that all the work BCGov is donating to this effort is not decreasing my ongoing tax, even one little bit. Rather, we are just building up a tech debt that Evernym has to pay off to make its code evaluatable as an interop target.

We (Ian) added a RESTful interface for VCX in a day.  Getting it working was pretty easy.  Extending it to cover all the test cases is more work.  We did a bounty for aries-framework-dotnet for $25k CDN and we have a RESTful backchannel that covers all the cases through connection and issuing.  Further, mobile agent's aside, if your framework does not have a REST mechanism, I'd guess that's it's not going to be very successful.

I'm not understanding your "ongoing, obnoxious tax" comment.  Testing is not free - you have to put effort in.  Yes, you have to build some infrastructure (in this case and in every case), but once there, extending to cover more test cases is an incremental cost with a corresponding incremental benefit.  To date, "interop testing" has been humans trying it out and sending a message on rocketchat.  That approach is an "onging, obnoxious tax" as well.

>"if your framework does not have a REST mechanism, I'd guess it's not going to be very successful"

This statement reveals a very strong enterprise software assumption. Mobile app front ends don't have REST mechanisms -- and they count among their category some of the most successful pieces of software on the planet. 

>"We (Ian) added a RESTful interface for VCX in a day. Getting it working was pretty easy"

Of course it was -- because you were calling VCX hosted on a server. A smart web dev like Ian can do a naive wrapper of nearly any functionality hosted on a server inside a RESTful interface in a day. That's not the challenge. The challenge is that every agent has to write and maintain their own adapter, and if the agent isn't natively RESTful, that means doing an entirely different type of development from the agent codebase's inherent paradigms. If this codebase becomes a standard tool, it will mean every agent developer in the Aries ecosystem not only has to do DIDComm, but also has to do REST, because their software can't be meaningfully evaluated for interop unless they also do RESTful. Of course ACAPY doesn't see this tax because it's oriented toward this style already.

Interop shouldn't be a function of RESTful; it should be a function of DIDComm. It's DIDComm functionality, after all, that we're trying to evaluate here. The fact that acapy wants to expose a RESTful controller is great and natural. Evernym's Verity product does the same. But requiring all agents to do so is unreasonable.

I am not at all opposed to evaluating interop through HTTP; it's just the notion of RESTful backchannel that I consider an obnoxious dependency.

This statement seems to be missing the point of Aries Agent Test Harness. No framework or agent has to speak HTTP to be used with AATH.  Neither VCX nor aries-framework-dotnet support HTTP and yet they work with AATH.  What is needed is a wrapper around the "component under test" (whatever that is) that speaks HTTP to the test suite and translates commands to something the component under test can understand -- using whatever mechanism works.  Success of the test cases is about the DIDComm protocols that are executed, not about the HTTP interface.

As Darrell notes, we're not getting very far here. We appear to fundamentally disagree on what is the best approach to conducting interop testing.  Happy to talk about this on the Aries WG call this week if others think it would be useful.

We do fundamentally disagree, and it is a valuable discussion. But as Daniel said earlier, Evernym is not going to "stand in the way of doers". We appreciate the efforts that the BC.gov team is putting into the project, and we do not oppose moving the repo to Hyperledger. But we need to be cautious about the confusion we create between the two test suites and we hope that we can resolve the different approaches.

Our testing also led to a suggested change in Aries Framework Dot Net that we submitted directly to Tomislav.

We don't mind working in the background, but it means people sometimes forget that we are helping move the project forward toward our common goals.

I don't think this is a profitable conversation to have in the community. We already had it at the last agent hackathon, and now we've re-had it over chat. Let's just move the repo and let Stephen and crew move ahead. My purpose in bringing up dissonance was not to stop that move -- just to note that today, I am not aligned with its philosophy and do not endorse it as the blessed interop testing strategy for the Aries community. That does not mean it can't be an Aries repo. If that's the narrow decision under discussion, there's no "no" vote. And even if there *were* a "no" vote  the larger question of whether this should be the community's interop tool, one "no" vote doesn't decide an election. I'm perfectly willing to be outvoted.

@rjones @WadeBarnes --- can the two of you add to your list to move the https://github.com/bcgov/aries-agent-test-harness and https://github.com/bcgov/indy-node-monitor repos to Hyperledger?

@andrew.whitehead -- I know that indy-node-monitor is currently still based on a published BC Gov docker image. Is there an ETA on getting that moved ahead to remove the need for that?  I think it is OK that happen in hyperledger vs. BC Gov, but wanted to be sure there was an awareness of the issue.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 06 Aug 2020 16:55:07 GMT):<br/>
It just needs a published python (wheel) package, but that would require github actions to build it for a few platforms. I suppose it could be built manually and published for 'manylinux

I'll try that.  I had assumed a Hyperledger account was being used, but perhaps not.

Hi. I have a question regarding test environment on CI server.  I added some test to features using Indy pool into Aries JS framework. Is there any pool already running for the tests running on CI? We're using Azure DevOps pipelines, but it was set up by @rjones so I don't know much details about it. I'm not sure if it's good idea to run our own Indy pool via docker within the pipeline.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:17:29 GMT):<br/>
Hi how can I help?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:23:04 GMT):<br/>
There is no long term pool running.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:23:27 GMT):<br/>
All CI infra is disposed of at the end of the run
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:35:29 GMT):<br/>
What about using a ledger running else where in public -- e.g. one of the BCovrin sandbox ledgers?  To work, the DIDs created would have to be random vs. fixed, which might be a problem.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:36:38 GMT):<br/>
indy-vdr has integration tests that run a test ledger using github actions, FYI
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 17:28:29 GMT):<br/>
This purpose is why Sovrin BuilderNet exists.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 17:56:48 GMT):<br/>
what can we (LF) do to help transition all of the CI/CD stuff to GitHub Actions or Azure?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 23:18:01 GMT):<br/>
I've posted it. Right now, the meeting is tied to my personal (paid) zoom account because that required the least amount of change.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 23:18:14 GMT):<br/>
I'm open to adjusting that if needed.

Thanks, Richard that's a good tip. I didn't think about BuilderNet in this way. I give it a try at least for now, not sure if it's good for the long term. Then it would be better something that Stephen suggested.
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 20:09:55 GMT):<br/>

Here's a good set of notes I found from Secure Scuttlebutt that goes in depth into many of their new design decisions they're making. Of note, they highlight the tradeoffs where groups have a hard time working with current cryptographic schemes with current best practices (perfect forward secrecy, post compromise security) https://github.com/ssbc/envelope-spec/pull/19/files

@danielhardman I'd think you'd be interested in this to see if we want to take different tradeoffs to get groups working
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 17 Aug 2020 16:59:39 GMT):<br/>
I cross posted that to the DIF DIDComm WG as well.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 18 Aug 2020 14:52:34 GMT):<br/>
I agree on interop profiles. Also, you might talk about the recent work to combine DIF's presentation definitions with Aries RFC 0037.

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 11:22:50 GMT):<br/>
Hi guys, I am looking for high level Aries architecture which I think was once presented by @danielhardman and was discussed couple of times. The architecture which touched on the plug and play modules in aries ecosystem e.g. having diffrent did resolvers, different network resolvers etc..
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 11:23:48 GMT):<br/>
We are planning to extend aries toolbox and aca-py with possibility to play nicely with different types of credentials e.g. w3c data model, not sure if there is already any work done towards that, maybe @swcurran you know about some efforts?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 15:43:53 GMT):<br/>
@mtfk - you may be thinking of these slides? https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L5L4QcZOATrn9rj4bEMmlbvij9XWyqgQRoWO-HNiUGw/edit
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 18:16:06 GMT):<br/>
exactly, thanks I lost it when I moved to new gmail account.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 18:16:16 GMT):<br/>
Is there any progress on that work?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 18:18:24 GMT):<br/>
@mtfk -- ACA-Py has some JSON-LD credentials code done by @TelegramSam for SICPA. The code does not use the RFCs 0036 and 0037 Credential Exchange (but should).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 18:19:15 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 18:42:56 GMT):<br/>
Is this implementation compatible with W3C Data model?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 01:07:59 GMT):<br/>
I believe it is, but it’s up to the controller to assemble and deliver the credential currently, aca-py just signs it, and it can’t be revoked 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 02:15:13 GMT):<br/>
It was done as part of the DHS work and so yes w3c data model. No zkp or selective disclosure.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 11:22:59 GMT):<br/>
perfect thanks a lot for info. We would make the way with it to the aries toolbox
</p>

Hi, all. I've been asked by @PatrikStas to work on https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy/2020-09-29+Indy+Contributors+Call the `aries-vcx-rs` part. Is this a new, blank repo I need to create?

@swcurran ?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:03:28 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I'm not sure whether it is better to start as a blank repo, or to migrate the repo currently being maintained by the Absa team. @PatrikStas what do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:26:02 GMT):<br/>
With a blank repo, there won't be any DCO issues :)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:27:35 GMT):<br/>
But all the contributions references are lost.  I would only do that if there were unsolvable DCO issues.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:28:38 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 18:26:34 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 18:26:34 GMT):<br/>
@sergey.minaev Do you have any concerns with the naming of the LibVCX repo?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 11:45:01 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr @rjones @swcurran I would like to port Absa's repo if possible. 

As for the name, I am fine with both `aries-framework-rs` or `aries-vcx-rs`, I don't have strong opinion. I see pros and cons for both - historically term `vcx` has been around for a while so it already sounds familiar, signalling that `aries-vcx-rs` is continuation of that, on the other hand `aries-framework-rs` is probably simply cleaner, easier to understand.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:13:52 GMT):<br/>
Discussing this with team, we'd rather go for `aries-framework-rs` - seems to be consistent with other hyperledger aries projects (`aries-framework-go/js/dotnet`), also it signals brand new start of the project as opposed to old libvcx which used to contain non-aries protocols.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 17:15:07 GMT):<br/>
@PatrikStas OK, great: please transfer the repo to my github account (ryjones) and I will put it in place

@TelegramSam @swcurran @george.aristy I've raised a PR with a proposed update to the Feature Discovery protocol that allows an agent to discover not just protocols, but goal codes, decorators, crypto suites, etc. Would love feedback: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/557
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 17:28:12 GMT):<br/>
Fyi for anyone interested in joining, we now have channel #aries-framework-rust
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Wed, 21 Oct 2020 13:07:34 GMT):<br/>
@rjones and others, we would like to suggest renaming `aries-framework-rs` to `aries-vcx` - it's almost revert to the originally considered option `aries-vcx-rs`, but without the `rs`. 
The reason is that as the library isn't necessarily rust-only but contains wrappers for java, ios, nodejs (and unmaintaned python). So we realized putting Rust language reference is misleading, it also makes naming of wrapper packages awkward (for example having NodeJS wrapper `aries-framework-rs` is bit weird).
Removing the `rs` part from `aries-framework-rs` would make the name too general.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Wed, 21 Oct 2020 13:08:57 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for changing thoughts on this, hopefully it's still early enough to make this change if community agrees.

What versions of `did:peer` are out there in the wild?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:43:48 GMT):<br/>
aries-framework-go supports it, but the implementation is old and it could be lagging behind recent changes.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:48:14 GMT):<br/>
I did a version in python. I believe Lohan Spies at DIDx did a version in python. I think Orie did an experimental version in JavaScript, but went off-spec to experiment with a different CRDT mechanism. I heard that someone else did a version in JavaScript, but I don't know who it was. I think there may be another 1 or 2 impls floating around that I haven't tracked.

I think the aries-framework-go impl was the first one other than mine in python that aspired to production status, so it has the greatest gravitas. If you updated your impl, I think others would follow suit and you wouldn't feel a lot of interop pain.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:49:13 GMT):<br/>
Should this be an AIP item?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:49:35 GMT):<br/>
I would love it if we did that. I'd be curious to see how community would react to that.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:50:05 GMT):<br/>
According to this comment, indy-sdk also implemented `did:peer`: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/pull/2159#issuecomment-730563589
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:51:10 GMT):<br/>
I would definitely support it being an AIP item.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:51:19 GMT):<br/>
+1
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:51:49 GMT):<br/>
Let's propose it.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:52:34 GMT):<br/>
Yup
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:52:48 GMT):<br/>
You want to do the honors?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:52:57 GMT):<br/>
Sure.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 20 Nov 2020 22:56:53 GMT):<br/>
For each proposal for AIP 2.0, I'm really keen for it to include a description of the use case it enables (user story or customer benefit). That will help vendors like me to prioritize the work to support the new interop profile.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 20 Nov 2020 22:57:29 GMT):<br/>
In other words, what use case will did:peer enable that isn't achievable with AIP 1.0?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 20 Nov 2020 22:58:13 GMT):<br/>
I agree with @esplinr
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 24 Nov 2020 14:21:19 GMT):<br/>
Agree with benefit focused discussion. However: Interoperability is clearly the goal here. Adding interim steps to achieve the interop required for DIDComm v2 seems like a worthy goal to me. Stepping up did:peer to something real from it's currently hacky implementation fits that description for me.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 06:34:00 GMT):<br/>
Not every proposed AIP item will map to a user benefit, but whenever possible it will help to describe the items in those terms. "Interop is the goal" is too vague as we have some level of interop today. So it will help me to understand "improved interop while doing X because the current approach fails due to Y". I know that repeats some of the long RFC conversations, but the summary would be really useful.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 14:19:34 GMT):<br/>
Fully agree @esplinr
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 15:03:25 GMT):<br/>
I think Interop beyond the Indy community is a goal - we don't have this interop today.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 15:03:25 GMT):<br/>
I think Interop beyond the Indy community is a goal - we don't have this interop across projects today.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 15:51:07 GMT):<br/>
Having user stories (benefits) provides useful context (when applicable). Of course, with many roles in an ecosystem, there are stories beyond the "end user" role.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 15:51:17 GMT):<br/>
Although there is some level of interop based on the usage of Indy and Indy credentials, we also need to focus on AIP profile items that enable interop beyond the Indy projects.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 16:30:14 GMT):<br/>
And we should also note that there isn’t currently interop between all the Aries projects. As an example, aries-framework-go has focused on being DID method (and ledger) agnostic, enabling “JSON-LD” verifiable credentials / signature suites, and implementing the updated Aries protocols.

I was given the assignment at the last Aries WG to generate a PR (or document) to start the discussion about what should be in AIP Next.  I've done that initially as a Google Doc and plan on leading a discussion about the document and it's comments at the next US Afternoon Aries WG Call. For those that want to take a look ahead of that to prepare their "discussion points", the link to the document is below.

Please read the initial section of the document so you have a bit of context of what's in the document and what I've already done.

</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:45:34 GMT):<br/>
Are there implementations out there that have adopted `RFC0360-use-did-key` ?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:45:49 GMT):<br/>
Curious to share some thoughts on this.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:46:18 GMT):<br/>
The `did:key` method is not very well documented: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:46:28 GMT):<br/>
But there is "enough" to get you started.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:47:00 GMT):<br/>
But when you get down to the details, making it work the way we expected to in DIDComm doesn't look so smooth.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:48:52 GMT):<br/>
Let's start with the attachments RFC which states:

> may also use a DID URL to reference a key within a resolvable DIDDoc

I think we should uniformly say usage of DID URL is a MUST.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:49:42 GMT):<br/>
*and* we should say the DID URL MUST de-reference to the DID's `keyAgreement` verification method.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:50:22 GMT):<br/>
Given the above, we arrive at `did:key`.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:51:00 GMT):<br/>
`did:key` does not _really_ provide any metadata for the key aside from its technical parameters (curve, values).
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:51:10 GMT):<br/>
It does _not_ indicate its purpose.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:52:38 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog correctly identifies an problem here - only some ECC algorithms have been shown to be secure when the same key is used for both signing and key agreement: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-key/issues/3#issue-547767482
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:54:02 GMT):<br/>
`did:key` does not provide a way for the controller (ie. the sender of the `did:key`) indicating the key's purpose. Hence the spec says that when you resolve a `did:key` you end up with _all_ purposes.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:54:15 GMT):<br/>
keyAgreement, authentication, assertionMethod, capabilityDelegation, capabilityInvocation
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:57:03 GMT):<br/>
So should the `did:key` method then be limited to those secure algorithms?  Or are you proposing a way to indicate the purpose in the did?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:58:19 GMT):<br/>
The purpose of a did:key is to send a public key and it's type as a DID, and to provide away to text transform that into a DIDDoc.  It's only content is the public key and type, and it's method specifies the transformation so you can resolve it. 

Are you expecting more than that?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:58:52 GMT):<br/>
It's used in DIDComm as a replacement for sending just a naked public key, so that it can be resolved.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:58:52 GMT):<br/>
It's used in DIDComm as a replacement for sending just a naked public key, so that it can be resolved/handled like a DID.

<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 20:59:25 GMT):<br/>
But it's still nothing more than a public key and a type.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:13:53 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran I know that is the intention, and you can easily see it "work" with a casual glance, but what is actually in the Aries RFCs does not match quite right with did-core (and by extension, did:key)
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:14:03 GMT):<br/>
We should be reusing components here.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:14:39 GMT):<br/>
Specifically, we should reuse our `did:key` resolver with a generic DID URL de-referencer on top
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:14:49 GMT):<br/>
For that to work we need to follow the rules in did-core.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:15:57 GMT):<br/>
"purpose" has a specific meaning in DIDs.. and it's related to how the keys in those DIDs are to be used.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:17:27 GMT):<br/>
I am still not clear why we didn't go the direct route of multibase(multicodec(key))
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:18:15 GMT):<br/>
Back to my first question.... are there implementations out there that are using did:key for DIDComm?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:21:36 GMT):<br/>
I see ACA-Py did implement `did:key`...

<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:24:38 GMT):<br/>
Here is where we have the gray area from a standards-perspective: using this example:

```
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "id": "did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH",

  }],
  "authentication": [ "did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH#z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH" ],

  "capabilityDelegation": [ "did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH#z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH" ],
  "capabilityInvocation": [ "did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH#z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH" ],
  "keyAgreement": [{
    "id": "did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH#zBzoR5sqFgi6q3iFia8JPNfENCpi7RNSTKF7XNXX96SBY4",

    "publicKeyBase58": "JhNWeSVLMYccCk7iopQW4guaSJTojqpMEELgSLhKwRr"
  }]
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:25:32 GMT):<br/>
How does the receiver know which to pick - the `publicKey` or the `keyAgreement` key - when ACA-Py just sends this: `did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH` ?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:26:26 GMT):<br/>
De-referencing `did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH` would result in this whole DID document, not the key within.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:26:52 GMT):<br/>
To reference a key we need a DID URL: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-url-syntax
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:27:04 GMT):<br/>
Also specified in did-core is how to de-reference DID URLs: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-url-dereferencing
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:27:47 GMT):<br/>
And finally, to support the case that these need to be `did:key` URLs and not just the DID, here's the section on signing attachments in the Aries RFC: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0017-attachments/README.md#signing-attachments
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:28:00 GMT):<br/>
> It may also use a DID URL to reference a key within a resolvable DIDDoc
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:28:42 GMT):<br/>
The references should be uniformly represented, and the standards-compliant way is through DID URLs.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:29:14 GMT):<br/>
If you are now convinced that we MUST use DID URLs, we can get on to discuss `did:key`...
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:31:13 GMT):<br/>
I agree with sending the naked key in explicit invitations. I agree they should be encoded with sufficient metadata such that the recipient can discern the curve.

<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:31:27 GMT):<br/>
I'm not very convinced we need `did:key` though.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 12 Dec 2020 20:08:25 GMT):<br/>
We had that debate when those PRs were done -- use of DID Key and the RFCs that were updated.  Your points were raised and in the end, the majority (but, as I recall, not unanimous) decision was to go with `did:key` vs. multibase so that a DID resolver could be used if needed.  

There are three ways to get the public key from a did:key --- resolve to get the DIDDoc and extract, use a did URL (AFAIK -- that should work...) or recognize it as a `did:key` and use a multi-base handler to get the public key.  Ugly, but up to the implementer.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:10:20 GMT):<br/>
I just raised a PR that adds a new field to an OOB invitation such that the sender declares the JWE parameters it supports for encryption: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/576
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:10:26 GMT):<br/>
Would like some feedback

This is what I want to clear up. There should be 1 way to resolve key agreement keys from `did:key`
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:35:32 GMT):<br/>
We're not running it through a full DID resolver when the process of deriving the key is clear, what would be the point?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:46:09 GMT):<br/>
Hi @andrew.whitehead - I believe the discrepancy will become more evident once we use curves other than Ed25519/X25519.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:46:51 GMT):<br/>
For example, if I wanted to use P256, what sort of `did:key` reference would I send and how would the receiver process it?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:47:04 GMT):<br/>
It is "obvious" - but different from Ed25519/X25519.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:48:14 GMT):<br/>
My second concern is this is already a "did URL de-referencing" problem. There shouldn't be an "Aries DIDComm DID URL de-referencer" - we should be able to reuse components.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:48:23 GMT):<br/>
These standards are meant to be composable.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 21:40:50 GMT):<br/>
I think the only real use case going forward are the routingKeys and recipientKeys fields in an out-of-band invitation, in which case the recipientKeys must contain a single ed25519 key. That's because it's used both for signing the DID Doc received in the DID exchange response, and its x25519 equivalent is used in encrypting the request. Perhaps another field could be added to indicate the signing key, in which case the recipient key could be another format (I think you can do key agreement with secp256k1 but it might not be well supported yet)
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 21:50:11 GMT):<br/>
I admit it's not clear to me how you would resolve another type of DID URL there which didn't reference a specific key in the DID document. For signing purposes you would probably have to support the various authentication rules of the DID spec, and for encryption you would use.. all of the key agreement keys perhaps?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 20:42:42 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran @TelegramSam any reason on why `handshake_protocols` should not be inside the `service` object in an OOB invitation?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 20:45:50 GMT):<br/>
1 reason is - need only specify it once for all `service` entries.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 20:46:20 GMT):<br/>
I guess the expectation is that most implicit invitations using public DIDs would be discovered via an OOB invitation.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 20:47:15 GMT):<br/>
Because the `did-communication` service endpoint does not have this information.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 20:50:33 GMT):<br/>
Is there as well an assumption that most OOB invitations will have several explicit `service` entries?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 21:07:55 GMT):<br/>
For now -- `handshake_protocols` is optional.  Also, service objects may be just references to service objects in a resolvable DID.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 21:07:55 GMT):<br/>
For one -- `handshake_protocols` is optional.  Also, service objects may be just references to service objects in a resolvable DID.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 21:08:39 GMT):<br/>
I think the expectation is that most OOB invitations will have just one service entry.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 21:09:01 GMT):<br/>
Can't see why there would be mutlitple.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 21:11:41 GMT):<br/>
Only if it's basically standing in for a DID document I think
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 21:11:41 GMT):<br/>
Only if it's basically standing in for a DID document I think, it's hard to imagine an agent that has multiple endpoints but can't publish their DID doc though
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 18:32:55 GMT):<br/>
> service objects may be just references to service objects in a resolvable DID.

That's a reason in favor of placing `handshake_protocols` inside the DID document as well
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 18:55:25 GMT):<br/>
Ah...I see.  This is for the implicit invitation use case.  Interesting...
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 18:55:49 GMT):<br/>
So you can tell the other party -- hey, use these protocols to connect with me...
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 18:56:32 GMT):<br/>
Yeah. If the DID is truly intended to be public, then anyone browsing the DID registry can connect to it using the appropriate protocols.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 18:57:14 GMT):<br/>
So to make it uniform: both `service` objects in OOB invitations and in DID Docs should have `handshake_protocols`
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 18:57:41 GMT):<br/>
OOB invitations are smaller.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 18:57:41 GMT):<br/>
OOB invitations using public DIDs are smaller.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 19:00:16 GMT):<br/>
An indy DID wouldn't have the handshake protocols in the synthesized DID doc, so it would still be useful to include handshake protocols in the OOB invitation in that case
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 19:00:54 GMT):<br/>
We might want to just support it at both levels, let the service entry override the outer value if there is one
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 19:02:28 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead so the bigger point would be: checks support for custom `service` entries across DID methods
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 19:02:28 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead so the bigger point would be: check support for custom `service` entries across DID methods
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 19:03:46 GMT):<br/>
This rings a faint bell - reminds me of the changes done in V2 to make it work with `did:key`
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 19:07:36 GMT):<br/>
So would this be the indy version, at least until there's a way to publish a custom DID doc? To support resolution for the keys and endpoint
```json
{
  "@type": "https://didcomm.org/out-of-band/%VER/invitation",
  "@id": "..",
  "service": [
    {
      "handshake_protocols": [
        "https://didcomm.org/didexchange/1.0"
      ],
      "serviceEndpoint": "did:sov:LjgpST2rjsoxYegQDRm7EL#service"
    }
  ]
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 22:58:04 GMT):<br/>
All: I just pushed a proposal to adjust the encoding of naked keys in some RFC - I'd love some feedback.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 22:58:06 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/577
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Sun, 20 Dec 2020 04:52:03 GMT):<br/>
Looks promising, I'll have to think about it some more. In the context of the DIDComm DIDDoc it feels like agents should just be using an `authentication` block to provide that information, rather than `authnKeys` in the service block. It seems like the semantics of the `authnKeys` array are that any single key can be used for authentication (as opposed to say, all of them) so that might need to be made explicit
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 01:33:15 GMT):<br/>
Folks: BC Gov wants to contribute the *aries-askar* (https://github.com/bcgov/aries-askar) repo to Hyperledger. The repo contains an Aries-level Rust implementation of agent storage/key management service that works with the already contributed indy-vdr (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr) and the also to be contributed  indy-shared-rs (https://github.com/bcgov/indy-shared-rs)  to enable the creation of Aries Agents without using the indy-sdk. Specifically, aries-askar provides the capability currently provided by the `indy-wallet` component of the indy-sdk.  Our expectation is that the combination of new libraries will be more flexible, capable and performant, and will eliminate the need to use the indy-sdk at all.

We hope to talk about this proposal briefly at the Aries WG call this week ( @TelegramSam )

Please let us know if you support or object to this contribution.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 13:41:17 GMT):<br/>

@swcurran @TelegramSam as per your request from yesterday's call:

If asked to stick strictly to NIST-approved crypto, and given the choice, the aries-framework-go team would default to the following:

* key agreement: P-384 with ECDH-1PU+A256KW, encrypting the epk to the recipient with A256GCM
* content encryption: A256GCM
* authentication: ECDSA with P-384

The team recognizes the prevalence of P-256, however, and would default to that instead if it makes sense.

Here is the complete list of curves and algorithms we aim to support for our next release (0.1.6):

* *key agreement*:
   * crv: P-256, P-384, P-521, X25519
   * alg: ECDH-ES+A256KW, ECDH-1PU+XC20PKW

* *encryption*: A256GCM, XC20P

@troyronda @andrew.whitehead and others -- questions from the CII Badge for Aries at Hyperledger (in prep for the "Exit Incubation" TSC assessment).

Do either or both of ACA-Py or AF-Go do this:

```
The release notes MUST identify every publicly known run-time vulnerability fixed in this release that already had a CVE assignment or similar when the release was created. This criterion may be marked as not applicable (N/A) if users typically cannot practically update the software themselves (e.g., as is often true for kernel updates). This criterion applies only to the project results, not to its dependencies. If there are no release notes or there have been no publicly known vulnerabilities, choose N/A. [release_notes_vulns] 

This criterion helps users determine if a given update will fix a vulnerability that is publicly known, to help users make an informed decision about updating. If users typically cannot practically update the software themselves on their computers, but must instead depend on one or more intermediaries to perform the update (as is often the case for a kernel and low-level software that is intertwined with a kernel), the project may choose "not applicable" (N/A) instead, since this additional information will not be helpful to those users. Similarly, a project may choose N/A if all recipients only run the latest version (e.g., it is the code for a single website or internet service that is constantly updated via continuous delivery). This criterion only applies to the project results, not its dependencies. Listing the vulnerabilities of all transitive dependencies of a project becomes unwieldy as dependencies increase and vary, and is unnecessary since tools that examine and track dependencies can do this in a more scalable way.
```
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 21:00:56 GMT):<br/>
Second question -- I'm assuming that none of the Aries frameworks, use any dynamic code analysis tools -- e.g. fuzzing.  Is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 21:15:40 GMT):<br/>
We haven't had any CVEs created so I think that's an N/A. I'm not aware of any use of fuzzing (yet), why?

I've not been made aware of any known CVEs in the project (all the dependabot stuff is normally just in sample code). I think I'm still on the hook for triaging those as well

I've not seen anyone using fuzzing yet either. Would be interesting to see what might come of it if anyone goes down that road

@troyronda @TelegramSam -- does 587 Encryption Envelope V2 replace 334 in AIP 2.0?  I assume so, but wanted to confirm.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:45:29 GMT):<br/>
Hmmm...maybe it is replacing 0019?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 17:10:03 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran yes: 587 replaces 334 in AIP 2.0.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 17:12:03 GMT):<br/>
I would, of course, prefer to also replace 0019 if the community is able to do so.
One issue that was brought up is that with 0019 in core and 587 in a sub-target, we should add some more description into AIP to cover those agents that can only do 587 (and not 19).

</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:03:27 GMT):<br/>
I'm working on one at the moment. Should have an initial version ready by next week
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:03:57 GMT):<br/>
Are you looking for anything specific to be included in the RFC? Then I'll make sure to account for that
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:06:16 GMT):<br/>
* I'm interested in seeing how the current proposal relates to previous work done in Indy Anoncreds 2
* I'm unclear what changes are needed in Ursa
* I want to be able to tell my team: our products need to implement that.

</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:14:20 GMT):<br/>
Yeah that would be appreciated. I don't know how Indy AnonCreds 2 works, so I can't make that comparison. For the implementation we did in ACA-Py we didn't need to make any changes to ursa, however we have only implemented the basic features at the moment.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:15:00 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is that Mattr's proposal doesn't support link secrets, which will be required for use in Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:15:10 GMT):<br/>
I'm currently mostly focussing on pointing to the correct specs, how to use BBS+ in credential exchange  and providing some tutorial / implementers guide
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:15:25 GMT):<br/>
That sounds like a valuable start.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:15:26 GMT):<br/>
At the moment -- they're working on it I believe
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:16:28 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog is your team making progress on link secrets in BBS+
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:16:28 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog is your team making progress on link secrets in BBS+? That would be fantastic!
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:16:31 GMT):<br/>
Or bound signatures based on public keys, which is their way of doing link secretes If I understand correctly
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:16:58 GMT):<br/>
Good to know. I'm not clear on the differences.
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:17:00 GMT):<br/>
that's what they are calling it, but it is the same mechanism as link secrets
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:17:13 GMT):<br/>
This is the response I got from Tobias two weeks ago: 
> Mike has been doing a bit of work on this, it is not quite ready yet though, the most complex aspect is actually getting the API’s as simple as possible
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:17:28 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for that update.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:17:48 GMT):<br/>
We're seeing a lot of enthusiasm for BBS+ signatures, but I don't know how we can adopt them before that feature is clarified.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:18:51 GMT):<br/>
For ACA-Py we went with the non-bound signatures for now, but I agree it's really needed
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:19:25 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense as a POC, but we can't accept the privacy implications of that.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:19:57 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for the update @TimoGlastra . Let me know how we can help. If you have a draft RFC, we can collaborate with you.
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:20:16 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:20:40 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-maintainers?msg=qHPTsPArW89pyqwwA) Not at this point. Last I remember there needed to be some additions to signing with G1 keys before we could start building on that to add support for domain bound proof generation, but I'm uncertain where that landed. I'll check with Tobias and Mike to see what happened. I think it ended up just getting pushed down on our list of priorities as we had other things come up.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 11:38:40 GMT):<br/>
I've added a lot more to the document. I've also added quite some TODOs at the top with questions, feel free to answer them in the TODO, or answer them somewhere else in the document
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 11:39:02 GMT):<br/>

@andrew.whitehead @tomislav @TimoGlastra @danielhardman -- I was tasked with a community update RFC to enable a transition from the "informal did:peer" we used in AIP 1.0 to the formal RFC 627 use of did:peer in AIP 2.  
>
I started on that (and can continue on it), but it occurs to me that the transition should be made as part of moving from 0160 Connections to 0023 DID Exchange/0343 OOB.   That is -- everyone using 0160 should continue to use the "old way", and everyone using 0023 should only use the "new way".  Since we have no "official" users of AIP 2.0 and hence, no live uses of 0023, we don't need a transition.  Implementations of 0023 just need to be updated to align with 0627.

Does that seem right to you?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 29 Apr 2021 00:13:31 GMT):<br/>
Yes I've generally been avoiding any changes relating to the connections protocol, including the formatting of DID documents

I've been talking to @nage about the challenge for his team to get PRs into Aries Mobile Agent Xamarin and we wondered about expanding the maintainers on the project to include a couple of people from Kiva --  @horacionunez and @nate.sulat .

Any objections to that?

@TelegramSam @swcurran Just noticed that transport return route isn’t in the AIP 2.0 PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579/files#r639783112
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 16:39:38 GMT):<br/>
I don't recall it ever being discussed.  It wasn't in my initial work, and I don't think anyone proposed it.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 17:33:52 GMT):<br/>
Since mediator interop was a desire (e.g., mediator coordination), there would be value in enabling bi-directional websocket transport (transport return route).

Hello Aries maintainers! Reminder to please join the DevRel Marketing Committee call at 9am PT tomorrow- 7/14. Take a look at the agenda and add items if you'd like here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/x/sANCAw

@TelegramSam @smithbk -- I've raised a WIP PR for the multiple issue credentials minor version update. I've raised some issues that need to be understood (requirements of the VC formats for signing VCs), and corresponding issues with message ordering.  See: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/692

I'm likely to make the call tonight, but note that I'm in Europe and am not used to such late nights...

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:36:46 GMT):<br/>
What's the best approach for resolving wallet interop issues? I'm trying to test mobile wallets (lissi, lissi beta, Connect.Me, trinsic, eSatus) against Aries Framework JavaScript and I wasn't able to walk trough a full flow with any of them. We've tested for interop with ACA-Py and the .NET framework, and some steps work in some of the apps. How were these issues resolved in the past? Should I reach out to the different parties?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:45:26 GMT):<br/>
Are you able to use the Aries Agent Test Harness Mobile Backchannel?  That works for most of the wallets (those that can use BCovrin Test).  That would at least give you a pre-defined list of test cases. Last I tried it, it took about 7 minutes per run, which is not bad.  For the tester, you are basically doing a series of scans of QR codes and responding on the phone to requests.  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness/blob/main/MOBILE_AGENT_TESTING.md
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:47:51 GMT):<br/>
I forgot about that one. I'll run through the tests again using the mobile backchannel and report back. Thanks

FYI -- I'm going to rename the aries default branch to "main", per Hyperledger requirements.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 10 Aug 2021 20:58:18 GMT):<br/>
The following Aries repos need to have their default branch changed to "main", per Hyperledger policy.  Can those in charge (identified below) please make the change?   The change is trivial -- https://github.com/github/renaming which says Go to Settings -> Branches and edit the name of the Default Branch.

@tomislav - hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet
@horacionunez - hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-xamarin
@smithbk - hyperledger/aries-protocol-test-suite
@PatrikStas - hyperledger/aries-vcx

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:28:46 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:30:27 GMT):<br/>
Wait. I've just updated the default now

<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:35:03 GMT):<br/>
Are others doing that also?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:35:36 GMT):<br/>
I think most are doing a rename
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:35:41 GMT):<br/>
You're better off to us the rename feature rather than switch to a different branch.
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:35:44 GMT):<br/>
ok, yes, pls delete master
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:36:14 GMT):<br/>
@WadeBarnes there was already a main. What's the proposed method in that case?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:36:16 GMT):<br/>
The rename feature has some automation that will automatically re-target open PRs and such.
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:36:38 GMT):<br/>
ah
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:36:45 GMT):<br/>
ok, so let's do the following pls
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:36:52 GMT):<br/>
set default back to master
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:36:56 GMT):<br/>
It sounded like @smithbk created it manually.
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:37:00 GMT):<br/>
then delete main
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:37:12 GMT):<br/>
then rename master to main
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:37:47 GMT):<br/>
Ok

@rjones: Indicio would like to contribute https://github.com/Indicio-tech/infra-mediator as a new repo under the Hyperledger Aries umbrella. The working name we've been using so far is `aries-mediator-service`. More discussion on this topic can be found here: https://github.com/Indicio-tech/infra-mediator/issues/9

Is this something we can arrange?

Hi @rjones thanks for the quick response!  Looks good, I've got "team" access to this repo now.  I don't have access to the above "dependabot" link though (which I got from My Curran), @swcurran do you have access to the above link (from your earlier email)?

Hey @rjones can I have my github account - kdenhartog removed from Aries Admin role and all other additional permissions associated with Aries groups and this account? I've not been active in Aries WGs or RFC discussions for awhile now and I don't think I'm the best person suited for this role anymore. Looking at who's currently listed there I think the admin responsibilities are sufficiently covered at this point. I should have requested this awhile ago but it slipped my attention.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 08:10:21 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog you want removed from all of these groups?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 21:10:50 GMT):<br/>
@rjones yup all those look correct. From the looks of my account every repo except the aries-rfc has the permissions properly removed. I think only the Aries-RFC repo would need to have my permissions descalated still since I still have PR merge authorizations. I believe it's because I'm still apart of the admin group for Aries RFC Commiters as an admin in that group. It also has the maintainer label next to my name in there as well so that may need to be handed off to someone else. I'd think @swcurran or @TelegramSam would be a good option for that
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 21:15:04 GMT):<br/>
I was able to properly remove myself now actually and no longer have any additional privileges from what I can tell. Can you double check if I removed myself properly in that repo?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 22:42:52 GMT):<br/>
I think so. If you want me to remove you from any other groups, let me know, @kdenhartog
