We would definitely recommend one of the latter ones if you are to build an iOS mobile agent rather than reinvent the wheel by using libindy directly.\n\nAs for the differences between the frameworks, the first thing to realize is that they all have iOS bindings (except ACAPy, AFAIK) and are all mutually interoperable, so it probably depends mostly on which API fits your use-case the most. They also offer slightly different functionality - AFJS, for example, does not offer revocations yet (as they focus mostly on mobile agents), whereas aries-vcx does (as we try to strike a balance of functionality for both mobile and enterprise). I would recommend you try some of them out and see which you like the best.

It's a shame that the information is not more readiliy available in the docs of the hyperledger repositories. I think what you suggest would help newcomers greatly. A `Why VCX?` section could be great for developers and IT managers to help decide which framework to use.\n\nSo far I compiled the following advantages and disadvantages for us:\n- Fast\n- Secure\n- Exposable in multiple languages via wrappers -> can be used in both frontend and the server\n- Actively maintained\n- Rather difficult to contribute if needed (writing rust is hard and writing wrappers could be tedious)\n\nIs that about right?\n\nI think we will start experimenting shortly with vcx.

{"msg":"Hi Agent :-) Great questions.\n\nSo for storing serialized connections - you don't neccesarily have to store them in wallet at all. A serialized connection might look like this:\n```\n{\n        \"version\" : \"1.0\",\n        \"data\" : {\n            \"pw_did\" : \"AJ8DfiB8kLqpW3UQC4BL62\",\n            \"pw_vk\" : \"64qndyQa7ZQdGS2rL2rxrXggiK3aQCFUqJ9impYXvt6s\",\n            \"agent_did\" : \"MXbV4NG5Bb6McXgaxjJEEP\",\n            \"agent_vk\" : \"CBv3N9udAsJur2rjTTYbE7XBhYbzrpwdzq1KjuN1eHBL\"\n        },\n        \"state\" : {\n            \"Inviter\" : {\n                \"Invited\" : {\n                    \"invitation\" : {\n                        \"@id\" : \"f0483f60-52ea-41bd-b575-61fdc550ee64\",\n                        \"label\" : \"f093572b-ad3f-45ff-ae71-18a37e8eb26d\",\n                        \"recipientKeys\" : [ \n                            \"64qndyQa7ZQdGS2rL2rxrXggiK3aQCFUqJ9impYXvt6s\"\n                        ],\n                        \"routingKeys\" : [ \n                            \"CBv3N9udAsJur2rjTTYbE7XBhYbzrpwdzq1KjuN1eHBL\", \n                            \"Hezce2UWMZ3wUhVkh2LfKSs8nDzWwzs2Win7EzNN3YaR\"\n                        ],\n                        \"serviceEndpoint\" : \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/agency/msg\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        \"source_id\" : \"f093572b-ad3f-45ff-ae71-18a37e8eb26d\"\n    }\n```\nso we have `data` which relates to pairwise dids and associated keys with the connection counterparty (pw_did, pw_vk) and mediator agent data for this connection (agent_did, agent_vk).\nThen in `state`, that's state machine for aries protocol, identifying current connection state and storing information about the counterparty.\n\nThe data could be perhaps misused in some way by an attacker, it's also not sensitive to a degree it would contain private keys. Storing it in the wallet using the `addRecordWallet ` is an option, but it's not necessary. It's up to consumer of `libvcx` / `aries-vcx` to choose where to store serialized objects - it can be the wallet, keychain or whatever fits your needs.","username":"PatrikStas","ts":"2021-08-10T14:44:25.752Z"}

{"msg":"Hey @PatrikStas I've had a quick look at the repo, but I'm not 100% sure on the difference between the shared indy/aries components (askar, credx, vdr) and the indy-vdr tools. Do they differ in performance? Has Askar also solved the wallet performance issues? Why did you choose to go for vdr-tools?\n\nWe're also on the point to move away from lbindy  in Aries Framework JavaScript, but are planning to use the new hyperledger libraries. I'm interested to hear your arguments on this :)","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2021-08-21T13:10:46.108Z"}
{"msg":"Hi @TimoGlastra \nwell the main difference is that askar/credx/vdr are build from scratch, have completely new API compared to libindy/vdr-tools.\n\nAt current point, the API of vdr-tools is almost identical to that of libindy. Given Evernym has developed most of libindy, I personally consider vdr-tools successor of libindy, a  continuation of their work.\n\nAbout asynchronous storage - afaik aries-askar is also built with async rust, so the performance problems libindy used to have should be solved there.\n\nAries VCX was build on top of libindy and swapping it with askar/credx/vdr would be gigantic effort. Using these libraries would be something I would consider if I were to write aries implementation in Rust from scratch. The thing is libindy/vdr-tools apart from implementing what's contained in askar/credex/vdr also provides 1 more function - integration,  gluing all these 3 areas together. Think about creating credential definition - you will probably need to call some function in credex, then vdr to push it on ledger and finally save key material with askar. Using these components might give you a lots of power and freedom in way you want to do these things, but I've never had probably with how indy integrates these pieces. Rather than reimplementing parts of libindy, I want to focus on Aries protocols.\n\nWith vdr-tools on the other hand, I was able to migrate from libindy  essentially in a day, after some initial research. In particular, pgsql wallet plugin with vdr-tools currently doesn't work. And even if it would, it wouldn't harness the async/await gains implemented on indy layer (you would have to rewrite the plugin itself). \nHowever vdr-tools comes with mysql wallet storage which is async/await capable and from my testing provides at least 10x pref improvement (could be infinity if you use indy with pgsql and bad internet connection ^_^) compared to libindy+pgsql plugin.\n\nApart from async/await stuff in vdr-tools, there's one more goodie I am very excited about - we'll be able to use vdr-tools as direct Rust dependency to aries-vcx, instead of depending on libindy/vdr-tools in runtime via shared library.","username":"PatrikStas","ts":"2021-08-22T15:50:13.745Z"}
{"msg":"These are some great points that it had not considered yet. I think keeping the same API and the glue are some nice things that really make it easier to integrate with libindy (or vdr-tools) compared to the askar/credx/vdr libraries.","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2021-08-23T09:43:47.070Z"}

{"msg":"Hi @profae yes, when it comes to these low level / ledger stuff, aries-vcx supports everything that libindy does. \n\nI am little bit puzzled when you say that you try to pass predicates to `generate_proof` - that's the prover's side of protocol. However it's the verifier who must set up predicates when he's generating proof request. In NodeJS wrapper it roughly looks like this\n\n```\n\nconst preds = [{ name: 'age', p_type: '>=', p_value: 100 }]\nconst attrs = [{ name: 'name' }, { name: 'date' }, { name: 'degree' }]\n\nconst proofParams = {\n      sourceId,\n      name,\n      attrs,\n      preds,\n      revocationInterval\n    }\nconst proof = await Proof.create(proofParams)\n```\n\nSo here the verifier is requesting proof revealing values of \"name\", \"date\", \"degree\" and also proof that \"age\" is 100 or more :-)","username":"PatrikStas","ts":"2021-09-30T10:38:18.095Z"}

{"msg":"hi @mateokurti fundamentally speaking, it should. We've recently implemented backchannel component for Aries cross compatibility testing. So far we have only a handful of tests running between `aries-vcx / acapy` pair but we'll be enabling more of them. The latest report is here\nhttps://allure.vonx.io/api/allure-docker-service/projects/acapy-b-aries-vcx/reports/29/index.html\nAlso depends how you define \"easily\" though :-) If you build mobile agent on top of `aries-vcx`, you would also need to have instance of specific mediator agent implementation https://github.com/AbsaOSS/vcxagencynode to enable asynchronous communication - we did not yet implement mediator pickup/mediate/route protocol, though we have it in our backlog.","username":"PatrikStas","ts":"2021-11-12T14:42:41.780Z"}
{"msg":"Thank you for the fast response @PatrikStas So, for the mediator agent it is better to use the VCX Agency instead of ACA-Py? What about the issuer/verifier then. Can we go with ACA-Py?

{"msg":"For issuer and verifier, it does make sense to use acapy. \nIf you use aries-vcx on mobile, you need to run mediator agent for mobile devices, but this is pretty much invisible to whatever acapy (or any other issuer/verifier). \nIf acapy establishes connection with a mobile device, the role of mediator agency is to receive messages sent by Acapy.

It would then download the offer automatically and modified the SM automatically. However, this would not allow you the correct offer if multiple of them arrived from the connection.","username":"mirgee","ts":"2021-11-25T09:43:58.388Z"}
