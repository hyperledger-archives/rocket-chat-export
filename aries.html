</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 12:40:26 GMT):<br/>
I would think @TelegramSam should be added to aries-rfcs and aries-agent
@dhh1128 should be added to aries-rfc
@jovfer should be added to aries
@nage should be added to aries-rfc
@swcurran should be added to aries-rfc
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 12:40:52 GMT):<br/>
the names coincide with github names (and overlap with their rocketchat names)
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 12:44:18 GMT):<br/>
also may be good to have @dbluhm added to aries-agent and aries
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 12:46:10 GMT):<br/>
These are just my suggestions though tagging @danielhardman and @tplooker as well so they can weigh in.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 12:47:18 GMT):<br/>
Another consideration is to bring in people who weren't previously on Indy projects. @troyronda may be a good option or another one of the people who attended the f2f IIW session

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 13:20:21 GMT):<br/>
Yup. If we get to the point we need to decompose it to a different ACL for each repo that can happen. I'm just trying to get the ball rolling :)

Minerva - Digital Wallet in action - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er9ifHvKPBM
We use DID base identity to identify user, car and the pad to start the payment and the charging. Then we use one of the assets account (in this example crypto currency) from the wallet to stream money (not micro transaction but really stream it in real time) to the charging provider. 
This approach allow to get into interaction with any service provider in a secure way without need to share any data or register up front. Small step towards MyData economy.

With the formation of the new Aries group, I'd like for many of us to read through this website on building and maintaining a good community in open source. There's excellent thinking here that we can reference as we are building and growing. https://opensource.guide
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:14:06 GMT):<br/>
Hey various Aries members,

At IIW I noticed that there was quite a bit of interest in discussing how a DIDComm protocol might work. I've been discussing this work in many places to help evangelize and find early consensus on what we would like to see in a common messaging protocol that's based on DID work that has been baking in various communities. Given that this work would likely need to cross cutting through (hopefully) the entire DID space, I wanted to reach out to various people in many different orgs to get discussion going on this subject.

My hope is that we can start with a call to discuss things and move forward in an agile way as needed. Right now I'm looking to find a good time for this call and have setup a scheduler here: 

http://whenisgood.net/DIDComms/

If you would like to join the calls please provide times that would work best for you weekly. 

Also, if you aren't able to make the calls, but would like to follow the discussion will be taking notes in a google doc here.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k5USBTdQP9RbcImbnC61cjyxRI3FtbTq8IRHlK-_7cw/edit#

Thanks!
Kyle Den Hartog

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:24:55 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam and @kdenhartog et al: I have raised several PRs against the aries-rfc repo. One (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/7) adds a brief section describing the use of github issues. I don't think it's controversial, given our discussion earlier this afternoon--but we would have to get someone with greater privileges to turn on Github Issues for that repo before we merge it (@rjones?). Others move a few very core concepts in the Aries RFC space. Given our discussion about process (which has now been formalized in the merged PR from Sam), can another maintainer quickly merge these today?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:26:59 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I can merge them in.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:33:25 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman merged in. As a general process, when I'm checking PRs I'm planning to only check for status changes right now to know if I should accept or reject PRs. In the future, I suspect will want PRs to have some sort of FCP waiting period to change statuses. Is this in line with others thinking?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:37:30 GMT):<br/>
Also check for Indy renames to Aries
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:37:39 GMT):<br/>
And proper folder name.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:40:19 GMT):<br/>
Thanks.

My head's more or less in the same place. Moving status from Proposed to Accepted and from Accepted to Adopted have a substantially higher bar than just updating some verbiage. Those are community decisions.

As a frequent author of stuff like this, I'm really glad to have a chance to update a doc with only a light interaction. However, even the authors of specs shouldn't just update them in significant ways willy nilly. I suggest we adopt a convention that a PR should be named according to its effect. I named mine "Propose RFC" when I was requesting the PROPOSED status, and "Accept RFC" when I was requesting the ACCEPTED status. For PRs that don't include substantive changes, I suggest we name them "tweak <something>" so a maintainer knows they're just typo fixes or clarifications. For PRs that do make substantive updates without requesting a status change, I suggest we name them "update <something>". This will help us triage better.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:46:17 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman do you want issues enabled across all three repos?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:58:15 GMT):<br/>
So far we have only discussed enabling them in aries-rfcs
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:58:41 GMT):<br/>
OK. I enabled them there, since the PR was merged
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:58:55 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @rjones !
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:59:29 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog Can you do another quick merge? This is just trivial terminology fixes: s/HIPE/RFC/g etc.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 22:59:35 GMT):<br/>
I also submitted a PR to fix the links to chat in the README, I wasn't sure if that needed to be an RFC or not. It was inconsistent.

Does anyone know if there's a way to ping a group on rocketchat? like @committers can automatically ping the committers of the group, so that we can merge quickly? If not anyone who wants a PR merged, you can ping me and take proper steps to move it. Please follow Daniel's suggestions as well.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 23:10:50 GMT):<br/>
I don't think there is
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 23:22:22 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog : one more merge, pretty please? https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/11
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 23:24:23 GMT):<br/>
Did a quick editor check for the hipe -> rfc and indy -> aries things. Only spotted one change.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 23:25:34 GMT):<br/>
There's a few other ones worth checking as well, but may be worth keeping since you reference HIPEs
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 23:30:07 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman found one last change that I think needs to go from HIPE to RFC and then I can merge it.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 23:41:13 GMT):<br/>
Merged it. If there's other changes that need to happen we can just PR it.

I'm the lead dev of this, feel free to ping me for any questions (haven't really read up on aries or how a wallet fits in xD)
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 13:59:38 GMT):<br/>
Oh gotcha! I haven't had a chance to dig through it yet and see how things are running. Is it using the updated work from the HIPEs (i.e. pack/unpack work)?
</p>
<p><strong>pimotte</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:11:31 GMT):<br/>
Nope, not yet. We've updated the underlying library (Quintor/quindy) to use indy-sdk 1.8.2 and someone was working on using pack/unpack, but it looks like he'll be occupied elsewhere for the foreseeable future 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:12:20 GMT):<br/>
No worries, I'll keep my eye on it on github. Glad to see that there's some diversity coming in wallets. I'd suggest adding this work to the Indy-agents repository list as well.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:12:48 GMT):<br/>
The list in the known-implementations https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent
</p>
<p><strong>pimotte</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:13:52 GMT):<br/>
I was mildly inspired by the early indy HIPES, but I sort of diverged when they moved slower than development, and we mostly wanted to figure out if it worked. So interop with others is probably a ways off
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:15:32 GMT):<br/>
That's good feedback. We're hoping that this new process in Aries should allow HIPEs to move more closely to the pace of development
</p>
<p><strong>pimotte</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:16:20 GMT):<br/>
Do you think adding it to the list makes sense if we are not making moves ourselves towards interop? (I would accept PRs for it)
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:17:22 GMT):<br/>
yup, just clarify in the tests passing section that it's not passing tests will indicate it
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:17:36 GMT):<br/>
It may help with getting others to build on top
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:18:04 GMT):<br/>
I'm mostly focused on lower levels at the moment so I won't be able to write any PRs for it
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:19:06 GMT):<br/>
@twshelton may be interested in collaborating with your to build a common Java library on Indy. It looks very similar to the Quindy stuff you guys are working on.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:19:44 GMT):<br/>
Last I heard he was committing to maintaining the SDK Java wrapper
</p>
<p><strong>pimotte</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:20:31 GMT):<br/>
This is the thing that would be named indy-sdk-java, right?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:21:24 GMT):<br/>
yup. I'd hope it would also lead to collaboration of a library/framework built on top in Java similar to the Agent framework stuff in C#
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:22:05 GMT):<br/>
A lot of the reason the agent framework stuff has been successful at moving quickly is because multiple teams are collaborating and building services with it
</p>
<p><strong>pimotte</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:30:25 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, sounds good:)

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 20:46:44 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam I am reviewing your PR so it can be merged momentarily.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 21:07:11 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog I'm thinking of moving the Message Trust Contexts HIPE. Do you want me to rename it to Message Security Contexts at the same time--or have you retracted that suggestion?

@kdenhartog or @TelegramSam Could you merge this PR quickly? https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/16 I raised it from the wrong branch of my fork, and having it open is complicating some other PRs I'm trying to raise...
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 21:51:44 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I can also merge if you like
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 21:52:29 GMT):<br/>
@rjones That'd be great. It's just a trivial tweak, not something substantive.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 21:52:45 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 21:53:07 GMT):<br/>

@swcurran first question: is the Phone Agent sharing two DIDDocs? One for the Routing Agent, and the other for the Other Agent?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:38:29 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:38:30 GMT):<br/>
Yes

</p>
<p><strong>jonnycrunch</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:50:48 GMT):<br/>
yes, that makes more sense.  B/c the routing agent needs to encrypt for the phone despite using a push notification like apple push. 
</p>
<p><strong>jonnycrunch</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:51:18 GMT):<br/>
it is just not shared with the other agents
</p>
<p><strong>jonnycrunch</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:51:19 GMT):<br/>
I
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:55:31 GMT):<br/>
And the routing agent is forwarding messages for all sorts of other agents.  The routing agent can't see what's in those messages, just needs to get them to the phone so it can decrypt/process them.

And the routing agent is forwarding messages from all sorts of other agents.  The routing agent can't see what's in those messages, just needs to get them to the phone so it (agent on phone) can decrypt/process them.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:56:03 GMT):<br/>
The routing agent and the mobile agent are a collaborating pair.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:56:52 GMT):<br/>
also important is that the routing agent doens't have to be under the control of the same identity owner as the phone.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:56:58 GMT):<br/>
It _can_ be, but is not required.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:57:37 GMT):<br/>
the routing agent will have some reason for providing that service, like getting paid to do so, or supplying services to members of it's parent org or something.
</p>
<p><strong>jonnycrunch</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:57:51 GMT):<br/>
I'm still not sure how to specify the protocol that I want the other agents to communicate over my service endpoint on the routing agent? Is that specified in the DID doc?  ... and by that nature, I want my phone to initiate the query of the routing agent if I have queued messages or a push notification to my phone that I have a message and initiates me to send a query request.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:58:28 GMT):<br/>
yes, endpoint goes in the DID doc given to other agents.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:58:43 GMT):<br/>
and yes, your phone will need to initiate the request.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:58:53 GMT):<br/>
one proposal here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/2af3bca5bf51f2936e04dae1d71071fdb9712d77/text/return-route/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:59:03 GMT):<br/>
(not yet migrated to an Aries RFC)
</p>
<p><strong>jonnycrunch</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:59:28 GMT):<br/>
but, where to specify the protocol and messaging format that my routing agent is using?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 20:59:46 GMT):<br/>
protocol also in endpoint. It's a URI, not an IP.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 21:00:04 GMT):<br/>
message format will hopfully be quite standard.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 21:00:18 GMT):<br/>
but the endpoint type would indicate that.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 21:00:45 GMT):<br/>
For example: a DIDComms endpoint would use DIDComms standard encryption and message types.
</p>
<p><strong>jonnycrunch</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 21:03:24 GMT):<br/>
and where is the endpoint `type` (i.e. DIDComms) declared/understood to have its meaning? What about version?  
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 21:03:45 GMT):<br/>
that is an open topic.

We are working with the DIF on data sync protocols to sync data between different agents. To clarify though, private keys are not intended to sync. Relationship information with other parties, as well as internal protocol state, are prime targets for sync.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 17:10:30 GMT):<br/>
@sklump and @TelegramSam What if we changed the terms as follows:

The early messages, currently called "proposal" and "offer", get renamed to "holder-cred-plan" and "issuer-cred-plan", respectively. The back-and-forth of cred plans is optional and can happen as long as it takes to guarantee alignment.

This phase, when plans are being negotiated, is called the planning phase. ZKP-oriented credentials require at least a plan from the issuer, to satisfy the cryptographic protections they need.

Once the planning phase is done, the execution phase begins. This consists of a pair of messages -- cred-request followed by cred-delivery. Non-ZKP cred issuance can skip the planning phase entirely if it likes.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 17:19:56 GMT):<br/>
This seems OK to me, but I have no problem with proposal/offer either.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 17:22:17 GMT):<br/>
I like that it helps identify the two flows.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 17:23:47 GMT):<br/>
ALL:

The Peer DID Method Spec is maturing nicely, thanks to thoughtful improvements from many--especially Oskar van Deventer and Christian Lundkvist. We still have more to do, though.

You can help in the following two ways:

1. Please review this PR and express an opinion about whether it should be accepted: https://github.com/openssi/peer-did-method-spec/pull/32

This PR would change the way a peer DID's numeric basis is generated. Instead of generating from the initial public key, it would use a sha256 hash of the initial version of the DID Doc, which means the initial DID Doc could have any number of keys, and that it wouldn't be vital to rotate the one and only initial key value immediately after being used to generate the DID.

2. Please read at least section 5 of Oskar's doc here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SgKvuG7u0r5UkaDRnnkQmnarVylCx5VF5y0eIyV-I6Y/edit. Perhaps we can discuss some of the questions he raises in our next Aries call.

<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 19:16:58 GMT):<br/>
I was reading the aries-rfc repo right now. Sorry for the ignorance, but what would be an RFC?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 19:16:59 GMT):<br/>
Socializing a possible convention: I'd like to suggest that *protocols be named by a verb, not a noun*. For example, we would have the "issue credential" protocol, not the "credential issuance" protocol; "connect" instead of "connection".

My reasoning: You can do lots of things with a noun. With the noun "connection", for example, I could "build" it, "destroy" it, "maintain" it, etc. By naming protocols after a noun, I think we're creating an inherent fuzziness that would go away if we named them with a verb or verb phrase.
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 19:17:22 GMT):<br/>
a RFC*
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 19:19:01 GMT):<br/>
An RFC is a "Request for Comment" (a specification that we want to align around). This terminology comes from RFCs that define most of the internet's plumbing today. An example of an RFC in Aries is the DIDComm explainer RFC: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0005-didcomm/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 19:25:03 GMT):<br/>
Understood! Thanks by the explanation, @danielhardman !
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 19:53:29 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I generally like that. thinking through the implications: a single message family would likely need to contain multiple protocols if it were to cover multiple 'verbs' that were closely related.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 23:41:28 GMT):<br/>
is a message family one or more protocols?

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 03:47:17 GMT):<br/>
@jljordan_bcgov - that's a good question.  Currently we have in the (currently named) "Credential Exchange" message family both the (soon to be called) Issue Credential and Present Credential protocols.  My preference (although not strong) is that we treated them as two separate message families, and define a message family as being a single protocol.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 03:50:41 GMT):<br/>
Reasoning - we reduce potential artificial dependencies between protocols that occur if they are in the same family, and there is confusion during message family discussions about which protocol we're talking about.  That occured several times this week around the credential exchange protocol.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 04:40:44 GMT):<br/>
Can we just eliminate one of the labels?

@jljordan_bcgov @swcurran The word Protocol doens't naturally scope well: it is possible for one Protocol to have sub protocols that refer to different roles within the protocol.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 12:54:03 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran I also prefer two different message families for issue vs present.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 13:02:32 GMT):<br/>
This consideration generates more heat than light, but a protocol implies a message order and a message family seems an unordered bag to me. However, it appears to me that we fleshing out protocols more than message families.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 13:21:12 GMT):<br/>
That's fine with me.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 13:23:12 GMT):<br/>
As we use it today, a message family is a set of related messages that implement one or more protocols.  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 13:24:22 GMT):<br/>
If we just go with protocol, and restrict it to one per message family than they are the same and we can eliminate the term "message family"
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 13:25:49 GMT):<br/>
Argument against I think is that in other places, "protocol" is a whole bunch of interactions - HTTP, SMTP. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 13:26:04 GMT):<br/>
There'a always a bigger protocol.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 13:37:18 GMT):<br/>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite

I think we are dealing with protocols. And there can be protocol suites that align with a more business/human level goal and the set of suites forms part of the Trust over IP stack. 

I think my point is this is not new territory and we should not feel the need to rework what is already well understood. Using nomenclature that is familiar to future implementors of the Stack is more important   

I’ve never heard of a message family and I’ve dealt with probably dozens and dozens of protocols from ARP to http.  
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 14:23:05 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if I'm the first person to use the phrase "message family", but I was one of the first. And I wish I'd never used it. Its relationship to the true, crisp concept of "protocol" is muddy. We have to version a protocol, and we have to route based on a protocol. The messages involved in creating connections, and the messages involved in synchronizing changes to DID Docs, are both part of a logical grouping of messages about connections, but they have to be versioned in different units. We could say there's a general "message family" about connections, but there are most certainly two distinct protocols there. I've never liked the idea that "message family" included sequence rules, roles, and state machines; that always felt like a "protocol" construct to me.

Sam (and I think Stephen to a lesser extent) have been the main proponents of promoting the term "message family", and I went along because I was a lone voice in the wilderness. But if there are others now showing up saying that "protocol" is the term that really resonates, I think we should listen to them and de-emphasize the term "message family" as a fuzzy term with little practical impact that could be applied to any type of grouping.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 14:32:20 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to rename the term as well; "wire" doesn't really apply well to messages at rest on disk, or to messages transmitted wirelessly. But I have a different preference from "message encryption". Let me explain.

I think the other "layer" or "level" of messaging (the one where agents or applications deal in plaintext JSON structures) is also misnamed as the "application level". We struggled with this term quite a bit, wanting to call it "agent level" at one point, but never really loving anything we came up with.

There is a metaphor that I think gives us both terms very nicely. It's the metaphor of envelopes and the content inside them. So I'd suggest that we use the terms "message" and "envelope", and talk about putting a message inside an envelope. This is exactly the visual I used in diagrams in the mediators and relays HIPE, and I think it was very clear. This also has a nice secondary consequence, which is that Tobias's idea of plaintext-but-signed messages as an alternate wire format just becomes a second type of envelope. (And that's the reason I don't want to refer to this layer as "encrypted", BTW, even though I think encrypted envelopes will be far and away the most common envelope style.)
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 15:08:02 GMT):<br/>
so, DIDComms Encryption Envelope?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 15:08:27 GMT):<br/>
I could get behind that.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 15:23:29 GMT):<br/>
... only sometimes it might not encrypt (e.g., signed-only), so maybe a DIDComms cryptographic envelope.

My two cents only.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 15:39:05 GMT):<br/>
I like @sklump suggestion of DIDComms cryptographic envelope
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 15:41:33 GMT):<br/>
I also like the idea of calling it a DIDComms message instead of application layer
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 15:49:27 GMT):<br/>
I'd call that a DIDComms Signature Envelope.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 15:51:31 GMT):<br/>
Both the encryption envelope and the signature envelope are cryptographic envelopes.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 16:00:09 GMT):<br/>

Same goes for the content level of DID comm messages, we have defined a set of conventions for expressing DID comm messages in JSON however I dont want DID comm to be reliant on JSON long term.

are you using the -s when commiting locally? I've found that even when properly copying it doesn't work. You may need to squash all of your commits and then do an ammend to sign them off.

*Fundamental Question*
I had understood that every holder/prover would have a nym on (some) ledger. Is that still a valid assumption, or can an entity use exclusively off-ledger n-wise (pairwise) DIDs?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 14:45:23 GMT):<br/>
@sklump For Indy based credentials, only the Issuer needs to have a ledger anchored DID. Holders can use a Peer DID Exclusively.

For non-Indy based credentials, there has not yet been deep discussion on this topic that I'm aware of

@danielhardman should RFC #33 be proposed or accepted status? I think it's fine to make it accepted given it was in FCP previously and should have been accepted as a HIPE awhile ago. Just want to make sure it aligns with your thinking.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 21:05:20 GMT):<br/>
Quick comment about wallets. Wallets to me include the following components:

1- Data storage layer
2- Security layer
3- Messaging ayer

The data storage layer is currently pluggable. 
The security layer currently has fixed crypto and requires a single key to access the wallet either a key itself or derived from a password.
The messaging layer should provide the capabilities of syncing data and recovery.

From the last call it sounds like we aren't ready to discuss this yet but I would like to do the work for the RFCs to cover what I am suggesting
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 21:05:35 GMT):<br/>
The layer I want to upgrade and propose RFCs for is the security layer
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 21:06:39 GMT):<br/>
I would like to create RFCs that 

1- allow the crypto to be pluggable
2- support better methods for opening the wallet besides just one key. I would like to deprecate the password derivation. I would like to support threshold based key creation, 2FA and multiple keys that can access the wallet. 
3- Allow clusters (groups, think of these like a folder of data that is accessed based on your permission) of data that are accessed based on the wallet access key so a single key doesn't access everything just a subset that they are granted access.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 21:08:15 GMT):<br/>
I also want to write up an RFC that explains the tradeoffs for the wallet security properties like the Threat models. Take for example if the security layer and storage layer are on separate instances, an attacker could sniff the traffic between them even though he doesn't have access to either. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 22:00:37 GMT):<br/>
I'd argue that the wallet enables 3 (messaging layer) but does not contain it.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 22:24:51 GMT):<br/>
This is where would be nice to really define what is wallet, agent, digital wallet, credential store etc... 
In our world digital wallet (mobile ) looks more less like this:

</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 22:26:49 GMT):<br/>
This is simplify version of "mobile agent" or as we call it Digital Wallet, there is a lot of components around that which in my opinion should or already are part of the Aries scope. 
</p>
<p><strong>nhelmy</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 22:27:02 GMT):<br/>
@mtfk is the wallet in this case the dotted box?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 22:27:23 GMT):<br/>
yes, dotted box is the mobile digital wallet 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 22:29:16 GMT):<br/>
the way as we think of that one is that you can put and take out anything anytime from it. You can think of it as your pocket wallet where you put only stuff which you need to carry with you atm. You could have stronger digital wallet (agent) in a cloud (personal cloud if you wish at your home) where everything would be stored and you could pull stuff from it etc...
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 22:31:52 GMT):<br/>
If you take a look on the Digital Wallet report: https://ssimeetup.org/state-digital-identity-crypto-wallets-darrell-odonnell-webinar-22/ you would see that here is much more into it then actually scope of any work so far in indy or aries.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 01:46:33 GMT):<br/>
@mtfk - that's a very good list. It does mix a number of concepts though, that go beyond storage.  For example "Credentials" would be just one thing, and the other items listed are the actions (by agents) related to Credentials. Necessary, but not storage. Another class you have are the features of an agent with storage - e.g. rmulti-device replication, backup/restore.  

The indy discussions to this point have covered at various times all of those things (to varying degrees of detail), but those are separated into storage (aka wallet) and functionality (aka agent).  It will be interesting to see how that evolves with Aries.

@MALodder I still consider "DKMS, data sync, and consensus" to be data held by the wallet, but enabled by communication of the agent itself.

Besides static agents and using TLS between hops, have we written anything that ensures end-to-end security–ensure that messages are only accessible to the communicating endpoints, and not to any servers involved in the delivery. This involves establishing keys to provide such protections
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 16:46:53 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder and @mtfk and others: There is an Indy HIPE that was accepted by the community 10 months ago that describes exactly what wallets are, what they contain, how they are layered, how their encryption works, and so forth. That HIPE is fully implemented by Indy's current wallet implementation, and it includes a lot of very desirable architectural features that have been thoughtfully chosen--including a number of features that I believe are misunderstood or not known, as well as several forward-looking hooks for future DKMS work. Besides Indy's implementation, @ianco and others at BCGov have invested time in building atop it (e.g., Ian's work on the postgres storage plugin), and Evernym has built the Sovrin Connector, Connect.Me, and its own enterprise storage solution atop it as well. This does not mean the HIPE is the last word--but it should be referenced and debated, not ignored, when offering new ideas. Can we please frame new thinking on wallets in terms of deltas to the agreed-upon architecture? https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/text/0013-wallets/README.md

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 16:48:48 GMT):<br/>
This is a core characteristic of DIDComm, not an incidental feature that we might need to add. It has been a guarantee since day 1. We don't use TLS to achieve any of those guarantees, and it has nothing to do with static agents. So I am puzzled by the question. Could you maybe restate it?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 18:04:11 GMT):<br/>
Sure, I understand DIDComm, but we haven't done any more work for pushing forward the signal or MLS protocol right?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 18:22:49 GMT):<br/>
We have not yet implemented the HIPE that you wrote about perfect forward secrecy. We are likely to propose adopting MLS at some point in the future, when it is more mature.

Interesting discovery I just came across. JWS support both repudiable (SHA 256 HMACS) and non repudiable signatures (edDSA, ECDSA, etc) This would mean that we could get integrity protection of an entire JWE if we required a JWS to wrap JWE for DIDComms. @TelegramSam @MALodder @danielhardman @tplooker what's your take on this?

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 22:38:54 GMT):<br/>
I was lightly aware of this, but I've never understood how the repudiable signature actually works. Does it cease to become a signature in the sense that you know who affixed it? If so, what is preventing a middleman from replacing the content and affixing a different HMAC?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 22:42:29 GMT):<br/>
interesting points. I think you're right in that it provides no origin guarantees. I'll dig in more to see what I can find. Given the HMAC version is the required algorithm, I wonder how this affects the kosherness of being "JWS compliant". Similarly this raises the question for me if we have to support the required parts of JWE in order to be "JWE compliant"

My way of thinking about digital wallet is not far away from that what is currently in the HIPE,  and if is not yet migrated to Aries would be nice to have it there. I think important part is to agree on the naming as we already have agent, wallet, digital wallet, identity wallet, Personal Digital Assistant etc. Maybe for one of the call we could go through the status quo discuss mentioned HIPE (and how it would impact Aries) and talk about overall picture on this part. We already know that we have multiple types of the wallets (mobile, cloud, public, private) which would required different set of features. Of course underlying toolkit should be shared but would be nice to draw the boarder where is what. For example for me is unclear difference between agent and identity wallet which is mentioned in this HIPE. 

Working with different initiative we came with some basic components which in our opinion this basic toolkit should cover:

This layer I’m suggesting is part of the digital wallet and is part of the access layer. We now deprecate the password based call and providing the raw key is the same as picking a null enclave backend

Hello everyone, having spent a fair bit of time trying to figure out Indy SDK I am at the point where I am considering a pilot. Would it make more sense to wait for Aries to be ready or do people think I should go ahead and build stuff with Indy and perhaps cut across in the future? We are involved with credential verification for civil engineering firms here in Romania.

You could get start working with the IndySDK and when we properly move things over to Aries, that would be when you make the switch. Lots of us are taking that approach as well.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:08:37 GMT):<br/>
The main advantage is we will have better support of languages with easy to use APIs. Where the logic is implemented isn't decided yet.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:09:24 GMT):<br/>
I suspect most people just want to consume a prebuilt agent and add their own protocols in. When Aries is mature it will make that easy for you.

<p><strong>SteveMagennis</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:09:35 GMT):<br/>
Given wallets can represent a target of highly concentrated value, thresholds, 2FA, etc. all make a lot of sense - especially if pluggable - to mitigate unauthorized access or restore rightful access. One topic I haven't heard discussed much though is how to rapidly (and maybe even just temporarily)  suspend activity as a backstop to limit time critical damage that could be caused by a breach. Sort of like a 'panic button' that would pause wallet activity if something hinkey were detected. The thinking may be that once a breach occurs, it is too late to do anything anyhow and maybe the focus should be on creating a trail. Thoughts? IMHO if we accept that breaches will occur and can limit the extent of damage as a native feature (pluggable) rather than push mop up activity to a higher layer there is greater likelihood of getting it right.

I woujld not recommend starting with the Indy-SDK but start with a framework on top.  Depending on language of interests - at least look at agent-framework (streetcred repo, c#) or indy-catalyst (bcgov repo, python) agent folder. Those are approximately what will become Aries.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:27:39 GMT):<br/>
Too low level. It's like building an app starting from TCP library calls.  SDK is embedded in the frameworks so you are still using it, but you have way (way) less plumbing to write and things to learn that aren't helpful to you.
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:29:24 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:32:21 GMT):<br/>
You can run a demo of using indy-catalyst at http://iiw.vonx.io. The email verification server and iiwbook are both indycat agents with different personalities - they are good ways to see how the Agent works.

If you want you can sideload the OSMA .apk and use android. We haven't put it on the app store yet which is why you'd have to sideload it.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:34:01 GMT):<br/>
Speaking of that, should we just publish a link to an android .apk so people can sideload the app for the demo?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:34:35 GMT):<br/>
Is there an agency with it?  Last I checked there is no osma agency, so no way to use it as is.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:34:45 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:34:57 GMT):<br/>
Someone would have to do a proper deployment with a full configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:35:36 GMT):<br/>
but one *could* use the Indy SDK and that would be a way to really understand how the technology works. 
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:36:26 GMT):<br/>
at a low level
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:37:02 GMT):<br/>
Yeah that's possible. Framework developers will need to understand how the IndySDK works so if you want to get to that point then it would be useful. I would suggest consuming one as @swcurran which will get you more familar with consuming the SDK too.
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:37:45 GMT):<br/>
Kyle you got me there..."consume"?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:37:57 GMT):<br/>
Depends on your goal. 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:38:21 GMT):<br/>
Make calls to the framework rather than directly to the IndySDK.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:38:31 GMT):<br/>
Definitely depends on goals though.
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:38:42 GMT):<br/>
initially we want to build a simple web agent, like Alice and faber college
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:40:01 GMT):<br/>
You can take 6 months starting from the indy-sdk and the HIPEs/RFCs (so that you are compatible with others) or a week using indyCatAgent.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:40:48 GMT):<br/>
There is also a command line example of alice/faber in indycatagent repo that you can explore to understand.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:41:39 GMT):<br/>
And I'm not joking about the 6 months. We've been working on Indy code for 18 months.  IndyCat is the second iteration done in the last 6 months based on all the learnings of the community.
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 15:08:21 GMT):<br/>
I am a little confused...while I have plenty of spare time so I could spend 6 months learning stuff...but my question is. if SDK is so low level why was Indy moved from incubation to production in April. Surely that would be done with a mature SDK??
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 15:09:07 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for all the replies btw I will certainly check out IndyCat
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 15:12:12 GMT):<br/>
The code is extremely solid and the SDK does all it should do.  However, what the SDK should do and what is needed to build valuable apps are two different things.  Kubernetes is awesome and amazing, but as a business, you don't want to build/manage raw kubernetes. Same with this.
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 15:19:06 GMT):<br/>
I am slightly surprised: sure it is a lot to learn but the code base for the Alice -Faber demo doesn't look *that* big. Could that demo not be used as a framework for a POC? 
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 15:19:54 GMT):<br/>
But it sounds like IndyCat agent is the way to go
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 15:21:53 GMT):<br/>
Sure, and lots of have done that. It's where we started. Challenge is that it's not update to date with latest protocols of how to use indy - pairwise DIDs, establishing connections in interop ways, exchanging credentials so it works with other implementations, etc..  You can make it work with a one off, but not to interop with the community. And you will have to solve lots of higher level issues.

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 17:15:23 GMT):<br/>
For me the "panic button" is just revocation (could be temporary) of all keys which are within the wallet. The assumption in our approach is that master key is never in the wallet (not the one which is operating) it is in cold storage or something like that. Within the wallet you just keep derived keys which in case of breach (or in case of losing the device) you could turn panic button which would required extra signature from "panic button" key which is available somewhere outside the wallet (for example shared with one of your relatives). 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 17:30:50 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 17:31:36 GMT):<br/>

@mtfk if the holder doesn't like a credential in the wallet, the holder can delete it or just not present it. There are all kinds of reasons an issuer needs authority to revoke a credential. A drunk driver likes his driver's licence just fine, but the province might not.

All: I proposed an RFC to supersede the merged Indy HIPE 0026 about "agent file format". This RFC would answer the question, "what is the MIME type of a DIDComm message in an encrypted or signed envelope, or without any envelope. It is mostly a straightforward evolution of what we had before, but it now includes the notion of a signed envelope that @tplooker and @kdenhartog have been talking about. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/44

Two more PRs: wallets and dkms

<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Sat, 01 Jun 2019 01:05:25 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman great PR, perhaps we should make clear the plain text content format you are talking about is just a content level message or are you envisaging a plain text unsigned envelope around messages stored in this format (*.dm)? Happy to file a PR either way if we are in agreement about an approach?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Sat, 01 Jun 2019 01:07:11 GMT):<br/>
Also in general I would like to start talking about message id, message type and decorators in their general sense rather than how they are expressed in content level messages that are JSON based? Thoughts? This would just mean a tweak to some RFC's, again happy to work on these changes if others think the exercise is worthwhile?

<p><strong>SteveMagennis</strong> (Tue, 04 Jun 2019 00:39:31 GMT):<br/>
I guess this implies the need to access the master key (however it may be protected or cached) each time a new derived key is generated, i.e. a window of exposure exists at least each time a key is generated and maybe more often if access to the master key is always available via a call over a network connection for example. 

Then, once a (derived) key exists, and lives in a wallet on a device, the security protecting the use of the keys, VC, agents, etc. is for the most part dependent upon the security of the device itself (pwd, biometrics, 2FA, etc). Do I have these two concepts right?

I like the use case, it got me thinking of other scenarios around certification of things that are in part based on credentials of both people and process. I made a few comments on your doc. Always keep in mind an issuer needs to be credible with respect to the topic they are attesting to, have a self-interest that is distinct from that of the holder, and themselves have a trustworthy reputation with respect to the verifier.

<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 15:29:03 GMT):<br/>
hey so i am a little confused about how agents are built using indy-sdk: is the native compile step required for installing and using indy-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 15:29:45 GMT):<br/>
ie, trying to bundle wallet functionality into things like a chrome extension or something similar and trying to figure out how to 'bundlde' compiled libraries

The Indy SDK provides wrappers in multiple languages that call into the indy library (libindy). The native compile step is necessary to use the library assuming you're on a platform that does not have pre-build packages available.

<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:17:12 GMT):<br/>
so couple of things we're working on right now is a serverless cloud agent and a chrome extension agent
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:17:31 GMT):<br/>
we have some docker images as well that can be helpful

<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:18:37 GMT):<br/>
i'm trying to figure out if i can bundle indy-sdk with the libindy such that we can use it for platform agnostic calls. 

or if it's not possible, trying to understand why it's not possible
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:19:16 GMT):<br/>
ie, we got agents + servers working great, we have our version of the vonx email credentialing and verification all working 
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:19:25 GMT):<br/>
but the agents basically can only exist on servers
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:19:37 GMT):<br/>
too detailed for me :)
some of the devs need to join in to help with that!
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:19:38 GMT):<br/>
(or docker containers) -- but basically 24/7 services
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:19:57 GMT):<br/>
all our stuff is containerized
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:19:59 GMT):<br/>
What platforms do you want to run agents on?
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:20:16 GMT):<br/>
we use OpenShift (kubernetes) 
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:20:51 GMT):<br/>
first platform that would be super useful is aws lambda
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:21:19 GMT):<br/>
serverless stuff is nice for auto scaling
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:21:50 GMT):<br/>
but the restriction with lambda is that you don't get access to the container itself. there is no 'npm install' you bundle all the files (including libraries) with webpack
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:21:52 GMT):<br/>
and upload
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:24:20 GMT):<br/>
the ways that we are thinking about solving it are: 
1. trying to precompile indy-sdk on a image similar to the container that lambda runs in (aws linux 2) and then copy+pasting that linked library on upload (with libindy mounted on /opt in the container and LD_LINKED_PATH set)  ==> running into problems with libzmq not being found for bindings.js trying to debug that
or
2. the easier solution to use knative with  gcloud so we have control over the container
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:25:09 GMT):<br/>
i'm pretty sure the second way will solve this issue (cause then we can specify the container as a custom container that configures indy-sdk on startup) but it would fragment our API across services so we're keeping it as a backup
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:25:26 GMT):<br/>
furthermore, the other agent we want to work on is a chrome extension wallet 
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:25:49 GMT):<br/>
but again the problem of bundling indy-sdk as a dependency comes up
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:26:28 GMT):<br/>
libindy has dependencies on libzmq (and openssl? need to verify) so you'd have to go through a similar process of building in a similar environment and packing it up with the libindy.so
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:26:59 GMT):<br/>
openssl is likely already present on AWS lambda, though, I'd guess.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:27:31 GMT):<br/>
There are plans to create WASM builds of libindy that can be run in a browser
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:31:57 GMT):<br/>
Efforts on that are currently blocked by the libzmq as well and poor performance of generating safe primes for credentials without using openssl. In the long run, I believe we will be able to overcome this through the advent of the aries-SDK (still forthcoming) which will essentially be the indy-sdk without the indy node communication pieces, removing the dependency on libzmq. As for the poor performance, future versions of anoncreds will use ECC instead of RSA, removing the need to generate safe primes.
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:32:39 GMT):<br/>
ah yes ! this is the explanation i was looking for
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:32:40 GMT):<br/>
thank you
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:33:25 GMT):<br/>
like i was struggling hard to figure out the motivation and what libindy actually does that couldn't be written as a non compile needed library 
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:33:58 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder  has been working on WebASM builds of Ursa and, when we can remove or handle the libzmq issue, of the SDK as well
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:34:35 GMT):<br/>
For those interested in browser-based wallets, it may be easier to help Mike with his efforts than pursuing something independently
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:34:54 GMT):<br/>
link to that browser based wallet work?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:35:37 GMT):<br/>
There are undeniable benefits to having a common, compiled library but it can be troublesome
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:35:39 GMT):<br/>
is it possible to provide libzmq within the linked libraries path as well? 
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:36:24 GMT):<br/>
That should be possible, yes. Should look very similar to how you packed libindy for the AWS lambda container
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:36:41 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm i agree that it's abstractly good, but as someone who's getting into in the indy ecosystem post creation, it's helpful to understand motivation of why certain design decisions were made
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:36:56 GMT):<br/>
to just better understand how everything fits together
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:37:41 GMT):<br/>
Where we are now trying to move to more conventional transports like HTTP2, away from libZMQ (and before that RAET) has a lot of history.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:38:36 GMT):<br/>
I expect we will document it more extensively when we can devote more attention to it.  Right now @MALodder is focused on offline CLI support for high security wallets, and the new Anoncreds 2.0 work
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:40:11 GMT):<br/>
well, so if i may ask a bit more naive question -- 

does libindy not do similar work to web3 for ethereum in terms of crypto and node communication ?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:41:10 GMT):<br/>
yes, but focuses more on keeping things off ledger using verifiable credentials
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:41:34 GMT):<br/>
so it isn't directly comparable
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:43:07 GMT):<br/>
that translates to figuring out verifying proofs through crypto libraries like anoncred right? 
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:44:22 GMT):<br/>
asking because previously in this thread the issues for browser based was Libzmq (messaging for nodes) and OpenSSL for deps. is then the issue for aries-sdk just porting anoncreds to WASM? 
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:46:46 GMT):<br/>
yes verifiable credentials using anoncreds are the heart of how the system is constructed.  There are two pieces holding browser-based SDK back: using libzmq for ledger communication (we hope to enable agent-messaging to ledger nodes to fix this), and some likely hiccups in how background threads are currently handled (not sure if we have a coherent plan for this yet).
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:49:45 GMT):<br/>
thank you! this has been very helpful 
basically for agents right now we're focused on using mobile agents 
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:49:45 GMT):<br/>
thank you! this has been very helpful

Ursa can do WASM, but until zmq can be built to WASM or libindy drops ZMQ, then we're stuck with no WASM for now

I would have suggestion to limit topics for the weekly calls to very high level which impacting project overall or are critical/interesting for whole community. Aries is quite big and complex projects in my understanding. Discussing specific RFC or specific technical issue give me the feeling that it is limiting the audience a lot and makes the call discussion of few instead of the voice of the community. Not mentioning that we would always lack of time for proper discussion. What are your thoughts about that? Is just me? Wouldn't it be better to spent those calls to talk about the project overall instead of rushing through each issue? 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 20:36:00 GMT):<br/>
Is there a dashboard and/or roadmap that maps the RFCs to implementation status in the SDK (or for those not implemented, the community or maintainer interest/priority)? (e.g., I was curious about the forward message, and more generally, the mediator concept).

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 20:42:12 GMT):<br/>
I've also been curious about the layering of the protocols and message families that are being defined in Aries. There appear to be more lower-layer concepts such as connections, introductions (I assume these fall into "DIDCOMM") and higher-layer concepts such as ZKP-based credential exchange (e.g., PresentProof). So one thought I had is that it would be handy to show the separation in the RFCs; but I was also more generally wondering about messages that might do, say, a non-ZKP-based credential exchange and how that fits.

agreed

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:22:19 GMT):<br/>
The "concepts" folder is for RFCs that are conceptual (maybe we could say low-level building blocks that apply to many different business problems); the "features" folder is for RFCs that are higher-level and more specific. Do you think we should show which folder an RFC comes from in index.md?

Re. a non-zkp-based cred exchange: that should be covered by the existing RFCs. Our intent was to point out that some of the early steps in the diagram become optional when ZKPs are not used, and that you could short-circuit all the way to cred-request+cred-response. Did that not make it into the RFC yet?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:30:41 GMT):<br/>
No, there is no RFC. Shall we collaborate on one? What Tomislav presented was an excellent start. I will attach some thinking that one of Evernym's developers did.

Here was the set of requirements that Khagesh was given, that drove his doc:

1. A URI format has been defined that explains how to pass messages by simply invoking the URI.
2. The payload of such URIs consists of a single A2A message, packed and encrypted.
3. The URI format is associated with a predefined schema (I suggest "ssi://") that would be serviced by whichever rich agent is the "master" app for managing someone's identity on a mobile device.
4. The URI format can also be associated with one or more "thin agent" schemas (e.g., "fitbitssi://") on the same device. By having this predefined schema plus one or more thin agent schemas, messages can be sent to the rich agent, and responses can flow back to each thin agent that wants to communicate this way.
5. It is possible to discover whether a rich agent has registered as the handler of "ssi://" messages.
6. A message family has been defined that can be used to query the rich agent to find out its name and characteristics, and to register thin agents to cooperate with it.
7. A simple security model has been specified, clarifying what trust should be imputed to apps communicating in this way, under which circumstances.
8. It is possible to envision a way to use this mechanism so a thin app could query the ssi wallet on a mobile device for the 1 relationship it is interested in, to share credentials, and so forth.

I gave the wrong term on today's call. Not "Farley Book", but "Farley File": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farley_file
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:42:56 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I still think that the custom schema would do the work instead of having files throwing around, would give same possibility as the file (content association) but still not sure about ios (official spec says it is possible). Will check that with @tomislav. My favorite is custom schema as it is more UX friendly. Files are always problematical. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:43:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes. That was Khagesh's conclusion as well.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:44:10 GMT):<br/>
But what I heard from @tomislav today made me wonder if Khagesh had gone deep enough. Perhaps what Khagesh imagined is not as practical as he had hoped.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:48:06 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK custom schema is the way to trigger application across different operating systems (including mobiles), it is basically handling URLs 
this is well established on windows/linux/unix/mac/android etc... 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:48:17 GMT):<br/>
According to this one even ios supports it: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:49:09 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but that mechanism has limitations. For example, it's not clear that you can have multiple apps register to handle the same schema.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:49:29 GMT):<br/>
yes you can 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:49:31 GMT):<br/>
You can on desktop OSes, and on Android--but on iOS, the UX isn't deterministic.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:49:35 GMT):<br/>
that the main idea behind it 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:50:04 GMT):<br/>
Robert, are you asserting that from personal experience, or from theory? That's the crux of the doubt here.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:51:05 GMT):<br/>
From experience on all systems except ios where I have just theory from official documentation. I will check that and try to provide some more details 
</p>

What I have observed is that the zoom app registers for https://zoom.us URIs, but about half the time clicking on such a URI launches google maps from a meeting invitation.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:51:21 GMT):<br/>
It is quite frustrating.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:51:28 GMT):<br/>
But this is universal link 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:51:38 GMT):<br/>
with custom schema you would have zoom://meeting/123
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:51:51 GMT):<br/>
and this one is registered on os level and then app is triggered 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:51:57 GMT):<br/>
if there is more then one it should ask 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:52:31 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:53:00 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:54:05 GMT):<br/>
If that is how it works in practice, and it works well, then I will be very pleased. What I heard Tomislav assert is that iOS doesn't provide an easy way to manage the case where the user picks "always handle with App X" -- there's no way to undo that choice. Also, that iOS is using some sort of opaque algorithm to decide which app to recommend; the ways to make one app appear sooner in the list of alternatives are crude, and sometimes the results are iffy.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 21:56:54 GMT):<br/>
I had intended to say you can’t tell in accepted state if there are 0 or at least 1 implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:03:24 GMT):<br/>
I am 99% sure is possible I saw somewhere way to do it with hold press and then open with ... If you have custom schema which works only with 2-3 apps which you have installed (in most cases it would be just one) there should not be a problem with that at all. When you change to new app you can just simple remove the old one or just do `open with` 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:04:03 GMT):<br/>
That would be great.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:04:26 GMT):<br/>
If we can make custom schema work *smoothly*, I agree that it is a slicker UX.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:05:20 GMT):<br/>
For sure you cannot override existing schema like mailto, message etc. but custom one should not be a problem will check it.

New thread: renaming wallet (@kdenhartog, @swcurran, @TelegramSam , et al)
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:14:17 GMT):<br/>
I heard the term "enclave" proposed by @MALodder . I kind of like that. It's better than almost any alternative I can imagine. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:14:57 GMT):<br/>
However, it does carry a connotation of secretness. Only half of what a wallet does has the same characteristics as a secure enclave.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:15:25 GMT):<br/>
Agreed. I’m not completely sold on it but it’s best term I can think of and encapsulates what it does it’s a SW enclave
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:16:16 GMT):<br/>
However, it does carry a connotation of secretness. Only half of what a wallet does has the same characteristics as a secure enclave.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:19:38 GMT):<br/>
I wonder about using the adjective "agent" in front of it: "agent enclave". It seems to me that a defining characteristic might be that it's used by agents. I'm contrasting this mentally with cat videos or bank records (varying degrees of sensitivity, but neither used by agents). This other type of data is part of the larger corpus of what I own, but it isn't the unit of identity portability when I fire my agent and go get a different one. The scope of what we call wallet today is what I need to back up to ensure minimal continuity of my identity when I move.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:19:58 GMT):<br/>
The other type of data is what hubs are particularly good at managing.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:21:15 GMT):<br/>
We can think of the "agent enclave" as a subset of the larger unit ("all my data" --which we tentatively called "my vault" in the old wallet HIPE). In that sense, "enclave" particularly works, because besides its resonance with "secure enclave", it also resonates with a partioned-off subset of a larger geographic area.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:21:45 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed ^^
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:24:30 GMT):<br/>
-100 for enclave. It's already defined in technical context and it's obscure otherwise.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:27:36 GMT):<br/>
An alternative to "enclave" is "database" or "db", as in "agent db".
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:30:15 GMT):<br/>
Minor quibble, @swcurran : "enclave" is not defined in a technical context; "secure enclave" is. We are not including the word "secure" in our term, so we are not redefining its meaning any more than putting an adjective in front of "imaging" redefines "magnetic resonance imaging"
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:32:22 GMT):<br/>
btw. and ask for the requirements as if we would not limit the size of the message which we want to pass then files would be the option with url the size limit is quite strict. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:33:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that is an important advantage of files.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:33:50 GMT):<br/>
so not sure what kind of messages we would pass but maybe we would not have any other choice. Especial that in above points you have "consists of a single A2A message, packed and encrypted" 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:34:41 GMT):<br/>
with files we have basically no limit.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:35:07 GMT):<br/>
Basically RFC would be handy to collect all requirements in front
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:36:20 GMT):<br/>
or maybe it should be part of any existing one? 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:36:38 GMT):<br/>
No, I think it deserves its own RFC
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:36:55 GMT):<br/>
My view was that a custom scheme does work as explained above eg didcomm://example.com?m=<message> however this effects the discover-ability of did comm messages as if a user without an ssi agent a message in this format there is no app installed capable of them interpreting the message  
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:37:20 GMT):<br/>
One of the major questions I have is what is considered to be data within the wallet? For example, do cat pics go in the "wallet" or what about a publicly served HTML page?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:38:05 GMT):<br/>
this is loosely how email clients work with mailto://
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:38:05 GMT):<br/>
this is loosely how links to email clients work with mailto://
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:38:51 GMT):<br/>
No, neither of those goes in a wallet. See the RFC here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0050-wallets/README.md#types-of-sovereign-data
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:40:35 GMT):<br/>
So what happens on a mobile device if you ask it to load undefined schema xyz://foo? Does it just err out, or defer to browser as default handler of all content, or do nothing, or give the user the chance to pick?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:41:51 GMT):<br/>
Summary line: "This variety suggests that an identity wallet as a loose grab-bag of all our digital "stuff" will give us a poor design. We won't be able to make good tradeoffs that satisfy everybody; some will want rigorous, optimized search; others will want to minimize storage footprint; others will be concerned about maximizing security. We reserve the term vault to refer to the complex collection of all an identity owner's data"
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:47:31 GMT):<br/>
Ahh gotcha, thanks for referencing that. Do you see the sync protocol data going in a wallet or a vault then?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:49:32 GMT):<br/>
The main reason I'm asking this is because within the scope of Aries we said we want general storage, so I'm hoping to start drawing a fuzzy line between the wallet and vault. My current thinking is that the wallet is for secrets that can't be removed, but can be requested to have something done for you. However, the vault is more like a Hub in that it will store just about anything and things can be removed.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:51:31 GMT):<br/>
I'm feeling like there is data that agents need for their direct operation, and data that is more general. The former data includes keys, dids, link secrets, and credentials. It may also include agent policy, agent config, etc. I think this stuff belongs in what we currently call a "wallet" but want to rename--and that all other data could be handled with a more general mechanism. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:51:47 GMT):<br/>
I agree that vault approximately equals hub.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:52:11 GMT):<br/>
I don't think all agent data has the secure enclave behavior where you can put it in but not get it out.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:52:52 GMT):<br/>
But I could be convinced to draw the line elsewhere.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:52:53 GMT):<br/>
Another weird edge case worth teasing out would be the state records used by the Agent Framework right now.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:53:36 GMT):<br/>
hmm.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:54:06 GMT):<br/>
I'm not really certain where to draw the line either. I'm just at the stage where these are use cases I've seen popping up so I want to see if we can find a pattern.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:54:24 GMT):<br/>
My early thinking is that if it involves tagging and searchability it should go in the vault.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 22:54:46 GMT):<br/>
However, I see a usecase for credential tagging to speed things up, so that doesn't fit very well.

<p><strong>SteveMagennis</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 01:04:08 GMT):<br/>
there has got to be some analog from the world of telecom or networks that can be appropriated. Descriptively, the collection of 'stuff' contained within the erstwhile wallet facilitates and in some cases manage connections or circuits. Something like 'circuit manager' maybe?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 01:21:15 GMT):<br/>
So we have compartments in the wallet: secrets that shouldn’t be extracted-private keys, secrets that need to be protected but can be extracted-credentials, and non secrets like settings. Enclaves function exactly like non-extractable secrets, protect secrets with other secrets and do nothing for non secrets. 

So what if we name parts of the wallet to be as follows, enclave, wallet, and vault. The whole thing is a vault. Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 01:21:28 GMT):<br/>

Sounds like you are almost describing wine storage, you have your open rack of wine you share with anyone, you may also have a wine cabinet that is on display but clearly not for general consumption, you may then have a locked cupboard that only the family has access too, and possibly you have the basement where only you know what is there...

* Vault is extensively use right now for personal data storage and it sound like you can put there anything (as soon as the vault is big enough )
* wallet - is something bigger then just keys and people already used to called wallet something more then just storage for keys. 
* enclave - is just "territory" which gives you some boundaries. Does not specify what is in. This is why in mobile there is something called secure enclave which defines secure place - but this quite often assume that you can not get anything out.

My suggestion would be to have few layers similar to the suggestion from @MALodder  and reuse definitions which are already there:
- secure element/secure enclave (HW backed or not place for storing securely secrets - you can not get anything out) 
- Key chain - place where you can store and manage your pair of keys - can be unlocked with SE^ to get stuff out

Don't know what do you mean by having non secret stuff there but I would decouple that from "secrets". And put it somewhere else. What are the use cases for non secret stuff atm?

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:03:41 GMT):<br/>
Got confirmation from ios dev that the schema can be registered by multiple apps. In case if there is more then one there is no way to control which one would be taken. Basically from user perspective it would always start the first one I guess. But we would need to test that. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:34:30 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:36:40 GMT):<br/>
I think crucial question would be about the size of the data which we would like to pass. Of course we can have multiple ways of communicating:
- deep links - gives you the way to handle situation in a way where user does not have any app installed. 
- schema for easy way of triggering simple actions/communication etc..
- files for heavy load 

Not sure if the idea is to have all of them, some or just one. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 21:00:15 GMT):<br/>
can we do deep links with a custom schema?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 21:02:45 GMT):<br/>
I thought on IOS you could not use a custom scheme unless it aligned with the package name of the app? so for example no app could register to ssi:// on IOS
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 21:38:33 GMT):<br/>
registration of the schema within the app required to link it to the package name but that on the app side so when you register to the OS with that schema OS will know that this app can be called as soon as someone will ask for `ssi` 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 21:41:11 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam deep links required to have `http` to work correctly means the idea is that you have universal link that no matter on which platform you click it you will get something. Redirect to store to install the app, website explaining what is wallet and how to get it etc... in the back it include custom schema so when the app will be installed it would be passed to it but on top is just https

iOS will allow you to register URL scheme for multiple apps, but there's no control which one will be used when launching the app. From Apple's docs
```
Note: If more than one third-party app registers to handle the same URL scheme, there is currently no process for determining which app will be given that scheme.
```
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 03:15:30 GMT):<br/>
I am testing this right now, three apps all with ssi:// scheme registered, iOS launches only one of them every time (the first one I installed in my case)
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 03:18:52 GMT):<br/>
Universal Links on the other hand are tied to a domain, so they're actually less universal than URL schemes
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 05:30:57 GMT):<br/>
The point of deep links is to guide user through specific process so having one deep link to multiple apps has no point. If the user does not have any app where the link should lead? To appA, B ? To landing page of company A or B? 
I think that deep links are case specific and anyone would be allow to use it to improve UX

Deep links do provide a nice guide feature, but by design only for a single domain/app. The goal is to allow any installed app to receive the message, which is served by a custom scheme.

These two options appear to be opposed to each other.

New topic thread: "didcomm" versus "didcomms"
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 19:20:28 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it matters how we speak informally; these can be in free variation for all I care. However, when we write or name formal RFCs, I think we should be consistent.

I'd like to suggest that the version without the 's' is more correct. Here's why.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 19:35:41 GMT):<br/>
In English, we have the phenomenon of count nouns and non-count nouns. A count noun is something that you count with integers: cars, shoes, phones, etc. We say, "I own 3 cars." A non-count noun is something that you quantify as a collective or mass: "My car is emitting *a lot* of smoke." "I bought *3 bushels* of wheat."

Count nouns carry plural markers in English: I own 3 car*s*.

Non-count nouns do NOT carry plural markers in English. We would not say, "I saw 3 smoke*s* coming out of my tailpipe when I started the car."

It is possible for a noun to be both a count noun and a non-count noun. "Water" is a great example. Normally, water is a non-count noun--we measure it in real units, as a collective. However, when a waiter takes our order at a restaurant, he may say, "Okay, so that's 3 waters, right?" When this happens, we're implying that we've packaged the non-count, collective noun in a discrete form.

When you turn nouns into adjectives, usually the non-count, non-plural version is more common. We talk about "water-borne illnesses" and "watercraft", not "waters-born illnesses" and "waterscraft".

So what about the word "communication"?

Well, "communication" is normally a non-count noun. We say things like "There's a lot of communication happening" (non-count collective) or "The internet backbone carries 3.9 terabytes of communication per second in the transatlantic cable" (units +real quantifying a collective but not discrete items).

We *also* use communication as a count noun, in the same way that my water example does. If each discrete communication event is counted, then we can say things like, "27 communications arrived on this radio channel in the past hour."

So, what would "didcomm" imply, and what would "didcomms" imply?

"Didcomm" means communication in bulk, uncounted. It is also the appropriate ajective form. "Didcomms" means individual, countable didcomm events.

Almost always, we want the non-plural, non-count sense.

As I said before, I really don't care how we talk informally--but in formal written artifacts, I suggest that we follow best practice grammar and use the form without the 's'.

I did some more research on this topic, @mtfk suggested I try an option that would potentially allow iOS to switch opening ssi scheme to another app, but that's not possible.
Regardless, I believe for the most part, having a ssi:// scheme for all links is a good way to go. Most consumers will likely have one app that they use as their default wallet. If users, and I mean here iOS users only, want to juggle couple of apps, application providers can alternatively offer extension support for this. It's not ideal, but it's a step toward unifying app linking.
There's a lot of pressure on Apple to add support for this, I think Apple is just playing politics here encouraging use of their own apps.
Not that application can register for multiple schemes, so there's flexibility if vendors want to promote their own app. Ex

Hi everyone, thanks for reaching out to me @kdenhartog and @MikeRichardson, very excited about Aries! I don't think I'll have much capacity to contribute to protocol design, but rather I see myself more on the implementation side of things for now. I'll join the wednesday's Aries call to get hopefully bit more in touch with what's the Aries roadmap and how exactly I can start contributing.

</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 10:02:27 GMT):<br/>
I will also join the call. I guess the implementors of other frameworks (in other languages) will be able to advise on the design. Either way that will require assistance from Indy SDK experts (until we catch up which could take a while)

Hey. Just found out this project. Nice idea!
I've looked through the RFCs and noticed the one related to protocols. I was working on this topic for a while and now I have a nice implementation of a tool that is able to describe protocols in a declarative way. There are many similarities between your RFC and my implementation such as request-response/notify logic and an ability to nest one protocol inside the other. As a bonus my implementation is based on no-ARQ reliable udp.
Check it out: https://github.com/seniorjoinu/prodigy  

Yes, it's not finished (I have some issues with concurrency and I'd like to implement some congestion control, security and nat traversal techniques),  but the field of improvements and fixes is clearly defined, and the concept is proved to be working.
</p>

@AlexanderVtyurin : I read the README.md in your github repo, and I can see that there is, indeed, much in common in our thinking. I'm glad you found us!

Having a declarative language for protocols is something I'm quite interested in. However, it would have to be something we could use in languages other than Kotlin before we could adopt it, because we are language-agnostic.

How do you propose to deal with protocols that are not composed purely of peers (that is, there are different roles with different rules about how they interact)?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries?msg=YRGHAmGXq3PxxAYfa) @danielhardman Can you give an example of such a protocol? I don't think I understand you.

Prodigy can be language-agnostic - after all it's just about message format and serialization specifications. Transport layer  can be replaced easily (because without it prodigy is tiny). But I personally feel negative about all this enterprise ultra-flexible stuff. I believe that as a developer/creator I should promote my own way of thinking and technologies that I find more attractive. Don't get me wrong - I understand why you guys are designing your tools to be like this and I respect it.

@tplooker I know that in Aries we're trying to avoid the baggage of JSON-LD, but why aren't we specifying new a `@context` for the extended service endpoints of *DID documents* when we add `recipientKeys` and `routingKeys`?

</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:32:06 GMT):<br/>
@george.aristy can you clarify are you speaking about why this isnt present in the did doc or in a did comm service decorator?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:32:39 GMT):<br/>
DID doc
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:33:09 GMT):<br/>
(because the service decorator imports its definition from the service endpoint of the did spec)
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:34:48 GMT):<br/>
The conventions that are present in the did doc are mandated by that spec, when we were defining a did communication service type we just followed the conventions applied by that spec, how it relates to a service level decorator is still in development. Could you elaborate more on how you foresee that behavior?

</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:52:42 GMT):<br/>
@tplooker The DID spec leverages JSON-LD for its definition. It also conveniently offers an example of how to extend a service endpoint definition: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#extensibility
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:53:49 GMT):<br/>
Based on that example I would expect a new `@context` for the service decorator since we say the service decorator inherits its definition from the service endpoint of the DID spec, and we're also adding new properties
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:55:35 GMT):<br/>
Ok I understand, JSON-LD compatible decorators would have to be discussed in a broad sense though rather than adding support for this just in the service decorator.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:59:17 GMT):<br/>
You think the routing stuff belongs in the DID spec?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 01:04:19 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, im not sure I follow, my above remark was that I think JSON-LD support for decorators (a purely did communication based concept) should be discussed as a behaviour for all decorators, rather than just adding JSON-LD support for the ~service decorator, does that make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 01:05:13 GMT):<br/>
In regards to what we have put in the did doc currently, we defined a service definition for the did doc which expresses the information required to send a compatible did a did comm message

Hi all, I was using for some time now Indy (local pool + cli) in order to get familiar with it and now I am at the point to start implementing an Indy application using IndySDK, to provide Decentralized Identities. But now there is the Aries project where there are interoperable agent among others. Which is the way forward? Should I jump to Aries and keep Indy just for the pool of nodes and the ledger?

@haniavis For now, there isn't any Aries to jump to. My suggestion is that you get started with Indy SDK, but keep an eye here so that you can migrate when the time is right.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 00:16:54 GMT):<br/>
@haniavis - I would not recommend spending much time at the indy-sdk level for getting started.  Definitely look at the various agents in the community - indy-agent, the BC Gov's indy-catalyst repo (agent folder) and Streetcred's agent-framework repo.  They all embed the indy-sdk, but operate at a higher level.  Saves a lot of time and struggle.

@tomislav @TelegramSam Regarding the topic of "deep links" we had recently some internal discussion about how to make that right from usability point of view. Basically the point is that neither custom schema or file provides proper flow for regular users. Generates a lot of questions and confusions. This is why important would be to get the deep link rights so we can guide user through the whole journey. We can talk about the details later but overall it could work like this:
- Umbrella organization like MyData could host a website `https://digital.wallet` which would be the registry of all known SSI digital wallets. What that means for the user is that if you want to send a link to someone you sent:: `https://digital.wallet/identity/xaddw324?callback=myservice.com`
Which let's assume that this point to identity request with schema `xaddw234`. If the user clicks it and on given platform does not have any wallet it would open a page where whole concept would be explained and give possibility to download one of the existing wallets.

This sounds very interesting, and seems to address a critical UX issue for all of SSI, yes? It's a little worrying that it involves a centralized component for decentralized identity, but hopefully we can work around that.

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:46:34 GMT):<br/>
It sounds like it's an important discussion of what org (or orgs—this could be a cooperative project among several) are the best fit for this. And it sounds to me like it needs a governance framework (but then, I tend to see a lot of things through that lens :grin: )
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:29:11 GMT):<br/>
obviously there would be a performance hit so maybe it would be good to do it each time for bigger wallets, but for smaller wallets I think it would be a great feature

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:54:13 GMT):<br/>
Technically, it's not possible. You are saying that we choose a centralized domain and depend on that entity to allows our URL access to our own apps. I have concerns about this approach as app vendors won't have control over their own links. The same can be achieved if we establish a UX framework to guide vendors how to display links. For example: use custom universal scheme for links ssi:// but give the (iOS) user an option to invoke their own app by falling back to file type associations. I believe this is what roughly Sam suggested at the Aries call.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:06:16 GMT):<br/>
The agent supplies the wallet name instead of the key. Technically, LOX will use that plus other information about the caller to ask the OS keyring or other secure enclave to retrieve the wallet key to open the wallet

An example is in Linux or windows when you log in as a user and try access someone else’s stuff the OS blocks you unless they have shared it. Key rings also add another protection layer by encrypting the Keyring so only the user can decrypt it so even if someone gets root/admin privileges they could read the keyring

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:26:43 GMT):<br/>
How so
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:27:21 GMT):<br/>
Key rings have been around a long time they are understood by the security community 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:29:59 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but you are talking about keyring mediated access to encrypted storage.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:30:08 GMT):<br/>
is lox the storage layer?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:32:13 GMT):<br/>
No
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:32:32 GMT):<br/>
so it's giving the key back to the wallet to decrypt storage.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:33:02 GMT):<br/>
Lox talks to the keyring and selects the correct key to open the wallet, opens the wallet and securely erases the key from memory 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:33:11 GMT):<br/>
Agents talk to Lox
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:35:06 GMT):<br/>
Right now, the agent has to ask the user for a password right? Instead LOX would ask the OS for keyring access then the OS determines what is needed to authenticate to the keyring and handles that for you like on mobile devices asking for a fingerprint or facial recognition, or the pin code to unlock the phone.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:35:59 GMT):<br/>
Many agents pull password from config. No user directly involved.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:36:22 GMT):<br/>
also, 'opening the wallet' means decrypting all of it so you can remove key from memory?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:44:37 GMT):<br/>
No need to put the password in a config because the password is sensitive. Instead, put it in the keyring and ask for it relying on the OS to authenticate the running process.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:45:17 GMT):<br/>
Opening the wallet doesn’t decrypt all of it. It just opens it so the accessor can then do CRUD
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:45:44 GMT):<br/>
Like credentials to a mysql db
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:51:27 GMT):<br/>
so the accessor keeps the keys used to encrypt the data at rest?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:51:42 GMT):<br/>
and we trust the Agent to not remember the password?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:55:31 GMT):<br/>
I don’t understand your question 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:55:52 GMT):<br/>
Lox isn’t an agent
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:55:57 GMT):<br/>
It’s an API
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:56:11 GMT):<br/>
Layer that sits right above the wallet layer
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:56:23 GMT):<br/>
Just like wallet access is a layer
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:58:02 GMT):<br/>
wallet access is a component.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:58:18 GMT):<br/>
Okay so Lox is a component 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:58:27 GMT):<br/>
let's pick this up another time and see if we can work out the details.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:58:36 GMT):<br/>
If that’s better how you think of it
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:59:01 GMT):<br/>
that has implications you are not considering.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:00:39 GMT):<br/>
Enlighten 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:01:20 GMT):<br/>
Not the right medium, not enough time at the moment.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:01:29 GMT):<br/>
let's find a time next week.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:03:43 GMT):<br/>
To me it’s just another function call to open or create the wallet. Just like it has now. You could also plug in a different one than the OS default keyring if want just like the storage layer so I’m failing to see the implications 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:49:35 GMT):<br/>
How does this work in server scenarios when there's no user interaction for a consent? Does LOX provide pluggable support for secure storage integration?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:56:09 GMT):<br/>
I see huge security concerns as well if that domain wasn't properly managed. For example, doing a DNS cache poisoning is a potential attack vector that has to be considered by ALL vendors and they have no way to mitigate other than trust the webmaster to handle it. I would strongly advocate against using a common domain name. We evaluated this originally, but chose to opt away from this because of a variety of concerns this being only one.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:58:08 GMT):<br/>
we have two thing in conflict: New user experience (deep link best for this), and Robust Decentralization (ssi:// best for this).
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:58:40 GMT):<br/>
Bad idea, access to the config file gives access to the wallet and the config file is left unprotected.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:59:08 GMT):<br/>
what is an enterprise agent to do then?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:00:34 GMT):<br/>
Should rely on the OS keyring (e.g. Lox) an HSM, or FIDO authenticator.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:00:54 GMT):<br/>
Alternatively a password managed by a sysadmin (which is what's done today).
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:03:57 GMT):<br/>
LOX will provide a pluggable layer yes. Enterprise's can use an HSM, FIDO, OS keyring, Hashicorp vault to store the wallet key
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:04:15 GMT):<br/>
For everyday agents the OS keyring will be the default
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:05:32 GMT):<br/>
For server scenarios, the effective uid:gid that is executing the process is used by the OS keyring. The OS may or may not need any interaction with a user
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:05:40 GMT):<br/>
it depends on how the server is configured
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:05:58 GMT):<br/>
Keys and password should never have to be stored in a config file
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:05:58 GMT):<br/>
Keys and passwords should never have to be stored in a config file
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:06:25 GMT):<br/>
once LOX becomes available
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:07:19 GMT):<br/>
LOX will not force people to use it, I'm proposing to leave the current method to access the wallet using a raw key, but deprecate the password method as that's not recommended and usually not secure
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:07:45 GMT):<br/>
If someone wants to provide a LOX plugin that does the password method then I'll let them if they go thru that effort
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:41:10 GMT):<br/>
This also permits wallets on different agents to have keys specific to the hardware they run on
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 20:00:46 GMT):<br/>
There are ways to mitigate all above concerns, the important point is that we need to find a balance between UX and security. As @TelegramSam mentioned you can't have both.  
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 20:01:15 GMT):<br/>
Having super secure system with 0 adoption won't help anybody.

@swcurran Is your "code-with-me" bounty to add other ledger support imagined to be done at the level of indy-cat/python -- or at the level of aries-sdk? It seems very unfortunate if only python gets support for other ledgers. Could I convince you to bounty the creation of that support inside Rust in aries-sdk?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 20:46:21 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam can I get on the front of next weeks call? I want to give a demo for a few options based on your suggestion for JWS supporting both a sign only function plus a pack with sign function.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 20:47:09 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog YES! I had the same plan.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 20:47:31 GMT):<br/>
Main concern I want is to get dev feedback on API design. I'll take care of the rest.

@danielhardman - as mentioned on the call, the bounty will be a first cut at using one or more other ledgers at the lower level - a PoC.  We would likely not start with Rust (friction), and we would (very likely) not put the code in indycat (very likely wrong layer).

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:18:22 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder If applications utilize OS keyrings/keychains and cloud services use secure key storage already, like key vault, what added security does LOX offer? Inter-application/memory key management is one I can think of.
I like that the component is optional, as it allows concrete added layer of security that a lot of enterprise adopters would be interested in.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:18:56 GMT):<br/>
How is LOX implemented? Is it a native library layer? How would applications use it?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:20:58 GMT):<br/>
Right now how is the wallet key managed?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:21:23 GMT):<br/>
keychain on mobile devices, and azure key vault on cloud services, specifically
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:21:37 GMT):<br/>
right and who is choosing that?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:21:40 GMT):<br/>
you are
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:21:46 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:24:08 GMT):<br/>
LOX allows you to not have to worry about it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:25:04 GMT):<br/>
but if you want to do your own thing you are not restricted to LOX
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:25:18 GMT):<br/>
LOX will be additional functions in indy-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:26:50 GMT):<br/>
I see. Would LOX talk directly to the secure storage then?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:26:58 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:27:49 GMT):<br/>
it talks to the keyring/enclave
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:28:02 GMT):<br/>
then pulls out the wallet key
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:28:48 GMT):<br/>
How is the keyring implemented for different platforms?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:29:17 GMT):<br/>
opens the wallet, erases the wallet key from memory, hands the wallet handle back to the caller and steps out of the way
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:30:37 GMT):<br/>
What would the application supply then to access the wallet? Different key every time?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:31:08 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:31:24 GMT):<br/>
Or the same key, but the actual underlying wallet key is different that LOX takes care of
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:31:46 GMT):<br/>
to your question about OS keyrings, see https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0042-lox
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:33:15 GMT):<br/>
to your question what does the application supply see my RFC as well
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:33:42 GMT):<br/>
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware of this RFC, should've read it first
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:33:51 GMT):<br/>
NP
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:35:31 GMT):<br/>
but the OS looks at the effective user, running process, and key  id
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:35:46 GMT):<br/>
if that combination has access to the key then the OS returns it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:36:07 GMT):<br/>
if the OS needs to ask the user for a password/biometric/pin/hardware token it does
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:36:34 GMT):<br/>
The advantage of LOX is that you can put the public information in your program
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:36:43 GMT):<br/>
without any secrets
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:37:04 GMT):<br/>
no putting the password in a config file
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:37:18 GMT):<br/>
just ask the LOX for it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:37:29 GMT):<br/>
and have LOX open the wallet for you and done
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:39:05 GMT):<br/>
I see. What about remote wallet scenarios i.e. my key would be stored in my device keyring, but the actual wallet is on a server, that has different security policies? Would it be able to delegate this security access? 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:39:42 GMT):<br/>
The OS keyring won't but LOX would support plugins that could
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:39:58 GMT):<br/>
Are you thinking like AWS CloudHSMs?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:40:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:40:15 GMT):<br/>
OS keyrings work similar to how AWS uses group permissions
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:40:39 GMT):<br/>
if the instance is part of the IAM role then it grants access
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:40:54 GMT):<br/>
and you don't have to supply anything because its implied by the instance and IAM role
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:41:14 GMT):<br/>
so LOX could have a plugin for that easily because it matches how OS keyrings works
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:41:14 GMT):<br/>
so LOX could have a plugin for that easily because it matches how OS keyrings work
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:41:24 GMT):<br/>
I see a lot of value and added security for this with wallets that have remote storage, i.e. my indy process is local, but I have registered remote storage that now has different key for access.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:41:46 GMT):<br/>
right, LOX would be the component that allows better wallet key management
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:41:56 GMT):<br/>
Remote storage wallets are the easiest way to solve backup/restore
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:42:03 GMT):<br/>
then agents can use LOX to open/create the wallet
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:42:05 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:42:21 GMT):<br/>
the other thing you could do with LOX is change the wallet key each time you open it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:42:28 GMT):<br/>
that way you have PFS wallets
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:42:48 GMT):<br/>
So even if someone manages to sniff your wallet key, its use is gone because you already used it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:43:09 GMT):<br/>
key rotation because more trivial with LOX
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:43:34 GMT):<br/>
you also don't need to sync the wallet key across devices because each device could have its own wallet key protected in its own way
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:43:51 GMT):<br/>
unless you are in a multi tenant situation but still LOX is flexible that way
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:43:57 GMT):<br/>
at least thats the hope
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:44:55 GMT):<br/>
Right, awesome. And OS keyring already sync between user's devices, so if key rotation can be implemented automagically in applications, that's great 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:45:06 GMT):<br/>
true
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:45:42 GMT):<br/>
this could be a setting of LOX that you pass in such as rotate every time/week/month
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:45:51 GMT):<br/>
Cool, thank you for answering my questions :beers: 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:46:27 GMT):<br/>
but I want to leave the normal use raw key interface so if LOX bothers you, fine implement your own solution
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:46:40 GMT):<br/>
but definitely get rid of just derive key from password
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 23:46:45 GMT):<br/>
you're welcome

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:47:55 GMT):<br/>
Sorry about the confusion. When you copy a meeting page for a new meeting, it brings over the attachments, and I sometimes forget to remove them. :/

I believe it is possible to link multiple Apps to a URL, but the mOS will automatically chose the "top one in the list" if the user has multiple associated apps installed; unlike the protocol handler approach, the user is not given a choice / selector of which app (wallet) to launch...

<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 18:35:26 GMT):<br/>
ok cheers Sam. That was the first WG call i attended and it was very interesting. Some great ideas and demos. I would encourage anyone who hasn't attended to come over. 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 18:43:33 GMT):<br/>
Is there other ways that we could achieve similar UX without the use of deep linking or Domain linking? For example could we use a Http redirect to an SSI schema URL in order to get robust decentralization, but also get the UX we're after?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 19:37:53 GMT):<br/>
I would very much like an approach like that, if we could work it out.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:12:00 GMT):<br/>
I would love a solution and decision to this.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:13:09 GMT):<br/>
I am afraid that there is no much alternatives here. Deep links (universal links) are the only way afaik for smooth UX. And basically it works as @kdenhartog requested http redeirect to custom schema (more less)

</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:13:38 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog ultimately, the OS will try to resolve the SSI scheme and take over, so we fall back to whatever the OS is capable of.

@kdenhartog ultimately, the OS will try to resolve the SSI scheme and take over, so we fall back to whatever the (i)OS is (not) capable of.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:14:53 GMT):<br/>
We have a bit room to experiment with who own the domain which is able to resolve deep links. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:15:50 GMT):<br/>
for example we could use ENS or just simply github repo which would host the file (repo would be "owned by community") etc... 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:16:55 GMT):<br/>
another challenging part is the owner ship of the project in firebase as this is something which we would probably won't be able to overcome 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:17:55 GMT):<br/>
What would this domain host and ultimately do? How will it solve the problem of giving iOS users option to launch their own app?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:19:47 GMT):<br/>
not much just give possibility to link to the app with specific custom schema let say `wallet://` 
means that if you click on the link like: `https;//digital.wallet/identity/xad2d2` it would open any app is able to handle `wallet://` if you don;t have any it would open you a website with list of compatible digital wallets.  
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:20:33 GMT):<br/>
The main reasoning for it is that if user does not have any app that there would be fallback page which would explain what to do. 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:21:27 GMT):<br/>
How would this domain detect if you have an app installed that supports that scheme?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:22:05 GMT):<br/>
It would be registered within firebase and apple with fallback url which would be called if there is no app. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:22:45 GMT):<br/>
Default behavior is that it would send you to the apple store/google play store. But you can override that behavior and send to the website.  Which in our case would be helpful. 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:23:15 GMT):<br/>
Aren't there privacy concerns about having all links go through a central web server?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:24:18 GMT):<br/>
A bit :) but UX works better. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:25:05 GMT):<br/>
You could have it only for entry links, everything else could go to specific provider as soon as user would choose it. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:25:24 GMT):<br/>
But still some traffic would go through it. 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:25:42 GMT):<br/>
I'm still unclear how will this domain capture the universal link? Doesn't that mean it will require an app to function?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:25:49 GMT):<br/>
Is similar concern that traffic goes via apple or google :) 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:25:49 GMT):<br/>
Is similar concern that all traffic goes via apple or google :) 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:28:09 GMT):<br/>
The domain would works more less like this:
e.g. on apple: 
`https://digital.wallet/identity` if the link would be clicked on mobile apple will check the association file and see if there is any app which is associated with that link. If so trigger the app if no send to store to install it or send user to fallback url 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:29:06 GMT):<br/>
but that URL can ever launch only one app
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:29:22 GMT):<br/>
on ios the first one from the list would be picked, yes 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:29:30 GMT):<br/>
No.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:29:39 GMT):<br/>
It's an https domain, only one vendor can claim it.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:30:14 GMT):<br/>
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40790747/can-ios-universal-app-link-support-multiple-apps-using-the-same-domain
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:30:19 GMT):<br/>
you are talking about this?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:30:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes, multiple apps from the same vendor, with the same Team ID
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:31:21 GMT):<br/>
This app must be published to the App Store under that specific publisher, which means all SSI apps would have to be published by the same account
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:31:39 GMT):<br/>
can you link official spec saying so? 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:31:56 GMT):<br/>
my understanding is that it does not matter. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:32:13 GMT):<br/>
I can host domain for you app without having access to your teamID nor apple account. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:32:22 GMT):<br/>
Is just association file needs to match 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:32:39 GMT):<br/>
Read the requirements what it takes to setup universal links. I guarantee you are fundamentally misunderstanding the usage of it
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:33:35 GMT):<br/>
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/enabling_universal_links
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:34:05 GMT):<br/>
Apple's example show how you can setup multiple apps, but these apps originate from same Team/Account/Publisher
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:34:42 GMT):<br/>
But does not say that this is requirement. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:34:48 GMT):<br/>
Are yo sure that this is the limitation? 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:35:17 GMT):<br/>
The link between app and the domain is just associated file.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:35:22 GMT):<br/>
Yes, your app is signed with the that teams provisioning certificate
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:35:44 GMT):<br/>
yes but it has nothing to do with the file hosted under the domain. 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:35:46 GMT):<br/>
No, the bundle ID is important
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:35:59 GMT):<br/>
You can release the app without owning the domain. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:36:13 GMT):<br/>
you need to have possibility to upload the associated file, isn't it? 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:36:25 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:37:00 GMT):<br/>
So I can host that file for you (or multiple apps) without having rights to release any of those app
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:37:43 GMT):<br/>
Best would be to do test and make sure that it works like this.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:37:57 GMT):<br/>
I  would test that scenario on Android to make sure that it works as suggested.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:38:08 GMT):<br/>
Each app would then have to claim a specific path. domain.com/app1, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:38:19 GMT):<br/>
No two apps can have the exact same domain and path
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:40:05 GMT):<br/>
according to that what I got from our devs it is possible but then if you would have both apps installed the one on top would be picked. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:40:19 GMT):<br/>
so best would be to test it and verify it. 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:41:51 GMT):<br/>
So then why use universal links when we can just use scheme or app specific universal links?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:42:44 GMT):<br/>
So you can have universal link which would handle case when the app is not installed. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:42:44 GMT):<br/>
So you can have generic link which would handle case when the app is not installed. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:43:21 GMT):<br/>
Covers the flow like this:
if app is installed - run it
if app is not installed -> show website with list of wallets. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:43:46 GMT):<br/>
you can not do it with custom schema nor with universal link for specific app because then you forcing to use that specific app. 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:43:57 GMT):<br/>
So the only gain is really the list of wallets
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:44:10 GMT):<br/>
The gain is UX 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:44:21 GMT):<br/>
Which is important for the adoption. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:44:22 GMT):<br/>
could that website detect other installed wallets?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:44:34 GMT):<br/>
what for? 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:45:14 GMT):<br/>
to auto redirect them to the link for an installed one.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:45:15 GMT):<br/>
The website would ask to start app for `wallet://` if there is any installed it would be started if none website would popup 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:45:21 GMT):<br/>
No, there's no mechanism to do that
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:46:43 GMT):<br/>
Basically the purpose of the website is that the website does not care which app is installed, as soon as there is one which can handle `wallet://` it would ask to start it. If not help user to figure out what to do next. 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:47:20 GMT):<br/>
How will the website detect if an app has been started?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:47:44 GMT):<br/>
Does not have to. Just redirect to the custom schema and the os is doing rest 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:48:34 GMT):<br/>
This would show a invalid URL on some browsers, wouldn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:49:09 GMT):<br/>

<br/><a href="./assets/Mp9qrhqitC547ZgC5-Clipboard - June 13, 2019 4:49 PM">Clipboard - June 13, 2019 4:49 PM</a>
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:49:34 GMT):<br/>
no, this is why you have the http on front which ping firebase or apple ot check if the app is there if not there is fallback url which should be http page to open in browser. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:49:48 GMT):<br/>
Browser will never handle custom schema as this is just payload for the app
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:49:52 GMT):<br/>
if no app no custom schema 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:50:01 GMT):<br/>
how do you propose the app detection work?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:50:22 GMT):<br/>
I don't, it is given by google and apple. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:51:02 GMT):<br/>
do you have references for this process?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:51:16 GMT):<br/>
"Deep link" + "Universal link" 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:51:33 GMT):<br/>
do you need anything specific? 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:52:00 GMT):<br/>
yes. What you shared doesn't help me understand anything about the process.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:53:30 GMT):<br/>
you can start reading about deep links (android) and universal links (apple) but there is much more into the whole process. Basically the flow is more less like this:

domain -> apple/firebase -> custom schema (or fallback url) 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:54:03 GMT):<br/>
apple/firebase is very inspecific.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:54:34 GMT):<br/>
you can not do universal links nor deep links without using firebase or apple notification system. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:54:50 GMT):<br/>
but _how_ are they used.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:55:15 GMT):<br/>
who would own firebase instance? the owner of the domain?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:55:20 GMT):<br/>
yes 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:56:16 GMT):<br/>
What consumes the data in this firebase database and what's in it?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:56:18 GMT):<br/>
@telegramSam there is API which you use and integration which needs to be done up front. Slightly different in each case. 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:56:40 GMT):<br/>
So each app would need to talk to this firebase instance?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:56:52 GMT):<br/>
yes 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:56:59 GMT):<br/>
Firebase just pass the data 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:57:10 GMT):<br/>
it could be encrypted (good example is this what uport is doing) 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:57:18 GMT):<br/>
what data is stored there?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:57:27 GMT):<br/>
sorry forget about the data ... is not related. 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:57:34 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:57:37 GMT):<br/>
just the link which was clicked 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:57:57 GMT):<br/>
data is related if you would like to have push notification but we are not there yet. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:58:25 GMT):<br/>
so the idea is that this setup is just for simple link handling which is entry point for someone who does not have yet the app. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:59:17 GMT):<br/>
Not sure if that is the case but I can imagine that all links will include only public data anyway. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:59:53 GMT):<br/>
any further communication would be established outside that link. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:00:06 GMT):<br/>
I'm still unsure how the website knows that a compatible app is installed and redirects to the wallet:// url
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:00:52 GMT):<br/>
this is magic behind deep links and universal link which is happening within the black box of google and apple 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:01:11 GMT):<br/>
we've now completed a full circle of not understanding.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:01:25 GMT):<br/>
there has to be an explanation somewhere on how this mechanism works.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:02:11 GMT):<br/>
mtfk, setting up deep links and universal links is fairly straightforward. Do you think you can come up with a POC to showcase this?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:02:34 GMT):<br/>
I have to run, but if you have addiitonal info or links (or an example!) that'd be awesome.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:02:40 GMT):<br/>
Appel: https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/
Android: https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking

I would recommend start here.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:03:03 GMT):<br/>
Yes I will try to build it for android. 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:03:08 GMT):<br/>
I recommend that as well
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:03:10 GMT):<br/>
I understand both and the common case. What you are describing is different than I've read there.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:03:20 GMT):<br/>
But the issue we have is for iOS primarily
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:03:53 GMT):<br/>
I do not have xcode anywhere to build it on iOS so help is welcome. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:05:53 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam let's build POC and present it during the call, so we can share know-how. Basically all above comes from the links of official spec.. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:06:14 GMT):<br/>
Having understanding how both ecosystems works help to understand the flow. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:06:41 GMT):<br/>
One of the crucial part is that you can not do it without google nor apple :) 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 13:32:48 GMT):<br/>
Somebody asked on the call about RFCs that related to DIDComm. Rather than spill a list, I added them to the 0005 DIDComm RFC near the bottom in a 'Related RFCs' list: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 20:50:56 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I'm interested in enabling CI/CD for the aries-rfcs repo. The initial tests would be exceedingly simple--they'd just test that /index.md (which is autogenerated) is up-to-date, and maybe test for broken hyperlinks. Later we might add checks for a few other things, like use of correct terminology and so forth.

I haven't been involved in any of the discussions that happened around using HL CI infrastructure for Indy. I can ask my buddies what they know, but I thought I'd come straight to the source and ask you what I should know about this topic. Can you teach me?

I thought the move for CICD was to GitLab ... 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 02:36:49 GMT):<br/>
It should be standardized 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 15:10:35 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman - should we be using elements of the did:peer method in Aries agents?  If so - what parts are ready now? For example, should we start by putting "did:peer:" into the DIDs? 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 15:31:09 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Apps.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012195-CH6-SW1
would be a way to improve UX in terms of the discussion that was happening around deep links and so forth
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 15:31:57 GMT):<br/>
certain well-known or commonly used proofs could be added by users or suggested to be added as passes to apple/google wallet
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 17:39:25 GMT):<br/>
@jljordan_bcgov no decisions have been made WRT CircleCI/GitLabCI/etc. CircleCI is easy for me to pay for, which is why I suggested it. It's also the direction LF in general is moving
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 18:18:27 GMT):<br/>
Ok. My understanding was investigation in Indy was going on with GitLab. 
It’s important to have consistent tooling. At least across the HL project to do with Indy, Aries and ideally Ursa as they are likely to form part of an overall system 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 18:20:21 GMT):<br/>
If they've decided on GitLab this is a) news to me and b) not a big deal. We're having weekly meetings on the direction of CI/CD and @dhuseby has been leading them
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 18:20:50 GMT):<br/>
If the Indy-Ursa-Aries teams want GitLab then it's gitlab. My feelings are not hurt :)
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 18:21:45 GMT):<br/>
Cool. Just would like to see a purposeful discussion and decision making occur rather than choose what you like and we deal with the consequences later
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 18:22:22 GMT):<br/>
There are meetings every Friday, please join us?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 18:22:41 GMT):<br/>
Is did:comm: taken? :)
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 18:24:42 GMT):<br/>
I’ll check with the team. I’m not the person that can provide experience based opinions on the actual option. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 18:25:54 GMT):<br/>
OK. The thing that is news to me is that A/U/I had made any decisions. Since they're on the call every week - I would have expected more mention of it. If that decision is made, cool.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 18:26:11 GMT):<br/>
@WadeBarnes may be able to provide his input

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 13:18:37 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, Discussions regarding CI/CD for Indy have been happening over on the `chat.sovrin.org`, `community-ci-agents` channel.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 13:19:58 GMT):<br/>
There has been some progress on the pipelines for `indy-sdk`.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 13:21:35 GMT):<br/>
We've tried out a number of different things with our projects.  I'll provide more details later today when I have a bit more time.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 13:21:35 GMT):<br/>
We've tried out a number of different things (Jenkins/SonarQube/Zap  in OpenShift, CircleCI/Codecov, GitLab CI) with our projects.  I'll provide more details later today when I have a bit more time.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 13:23:04 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to join the calls so I can get a better feel for every ones thoughts.  I won't be able to make the call this Friday though.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 15:27:08 GMT):<br/>
OK @WadeBarnes please do join when you can.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 15:27:24 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby please note above :)
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 15:58:51 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I wouldn't conflate Aries with Indy. I had heard that Indy folks were liking gitlab--but I wouldn't imagine that has much to do with Aries, necessarily. In particular, the aries-rfcs repo has very different CI requirements from the others and can probably make its own choice.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 15:59:23 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman OK.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:25:07 GMT):<br/>
Anybody submitting a new Aries RFC: the instructions have been tweaked very slightly, so you get an RFC number JIT, right before you submit. And you get the number by clicking a link instead of looking up the highest-numbered PR by yourself. This should make things a bit easier. Note also that you should now be updating index.md as part of your PR, because we are now enforcing correctness of the index with a CI test step. See https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs#mechanics

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:47:24 GMT):<br/>
We have talked about Static Agents before, but we don't have any reference code showing how it could be done. Daniel Bluhm and I wrote one.
Quick recap of Static Agents: 
- Capable of speaking DIDComm, 
- no wallet, 
- minimal dependancies, 
- should feel like using an API.

Here is the code: https://github.com/TelegramSam/aries-staticagent-python
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 20:01:20 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam what were the doubts about how to do static agents?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 20:05:31 GMT):<br/>
doubts?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 20:07:03 GMT):<br/>
I didn't have any doubts, but thought a working example would be useful.

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:14:32 GMT):<br/>
I find this conversation to be really surprising.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:14:44 GMT):<br/>
One of the arguments for moving from Jenkins to GitLab was "that is where all of Hyperledger is going".
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:14:53 GMT):<br/>
 I hadn't heard of Circle CI until this thraed.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:14:53 GMT):<br/>
 I hadn't heard of Circle CI until this thread.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:15:15 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder should Indy be moving to Circle CI instead of Jenkins?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:15:54 GMT):<br/>
This is an important question because much of the Indy code will be moving to Aries, and there is a push away from Jenkins. I don't want to pay the cost of migration twice.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:18:38 GMT):<br/>
I apologize generally that  I have had conflicts on many Wednesdays preventing me from attending the Aries calls.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:19:31 GMT):<br/>
I have been on the schedule for discussing meeting schedules and formats, as well as Evernym's thinking on how to start moving code from Indy SDK to Aries. I have another conflict this Wednesday and would appreciate these topics waiting one more week.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:19:47 GMT):<br/>
@tplooker was on the schedule to discuss meeting times. Feel free to proceed on that one without me.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:20:29 GMT):<br/>
Evernym would support a call where @tplooker and @sergey.minaev could talk, even though that probably won't work for most people in the US.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 02:25:33 GMT):<br/>
This is my first notice of circle CI. I’ll look into it
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 12:51:07 GMT):<br/>
If there is still question about the direction there is also GitHub Actions to consider.  It's still in beta, but it's basically GitHub's answer to GitLab CI.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:23:24 GMT):<br/>
Azure has a nice CI system as well
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:29:19 GMT):<br/>
In my limited experience with GitLab CI, I've found although it is powerful you sacrifice many of the slick reporting features when you are just using GitHub integration.  You only get those when using GitLab is your active repository for PRs and so forth.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:36:09 GMT):<br/>
One of the reasons Indy was looking at Gitlab Is its ability to have anyone provide CI runners. And this way if the CI pipeline is slowing down the community may donate runners to help speed it up temporarily or permanently I don’t know if Circle CI supports that or not
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:36:34 GMT):<br/>
Last I heard hyper ledger was switching to Kubernetes
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:36:45 GMT):<br/>
But that was a month or so ago
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:37:01 GMT):<br/>
No, we were investigating k8s and discarded it as a path forward
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:37:26 GMT):<br/>
we're trying to figure out a way forward with ci/cd. no decisions are made.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:37:48 GMT):<br/>
I find Gitlabs reports to be fantastic and way better than Jenkins or Travis CI or appveyor
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:38:11 GMT):<br/>
ci/cd is, right now, bespoke silos of knowledge. it's hard for someone to switch from project to project and get up to speed.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:38:56 GMT):<br/>
Travis is dead.com
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:39:56 GMT):<br/>
Self hosted runners, is one of the powerful features of GitLab CI.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:40:11 GMT):<br/>

All the more reason we are looking at Gitlab
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:52:55 GMT):<br/>
As a comparison to the Circle CI, and CodeCov integration we have on the main Indy Catalyst repo I did a GitLab CI integration here; https://gitlab.com/WadeBarnes/indy-catalyst/pipelines
</p>

The 2 CI integrations provide the equivalent functionality.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:58:25 GMT):<br/>
What we loose with the GitLab CI integration is the direct PR message integration we get from Circle ci and CodeCov regarding the code's health and deltas in quality.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:59:00 GMT):<br/>
does Circle CI allow self hosted runners?

I'm just providing a comparison, I don't have a strong preference.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:59:28 GMT):<br/>

I'm trying to port the "Cross-Domain-Messaging" HIPE into Aries - and decide if it should be moved, or is it covered elsewhere.  It relates to several other HIPEs and I'm trying not very successfully to determine if they have been migrated yet:

- Wire Message - @kdenhartog
- DIDDoc Conventions/Routing Messages - @tplooker (looks like it is still a PR in indy-hipe?)
- Agent Messages - @dbluhm @danielhardman 

Could I please get an update on those HIPEs and/or guidance on how to handle this migration?  Do it?  Don't do it?  At minimum, I have to remove the no longer relevant (and terrible) parts of this in favour of the Routing Messages HIPE/RFC.

</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:19:04 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran the diddoc conventions is migrated and I'm working on a new routing rfc
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:19:53 GMT):<br/>
So use the PR in Indy-HIPE for now for the routing?  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/42fd315eed4a502f34a956abafd80a73700dbcb3/text/agent-message-routing/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:21:24 GMT):<br/>
@tplooker which RFC is the diddoc conventions one?  I checked the HIPE and there is no reference to one, and there is no RFC called that.
</p>

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:30:39 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran I'm not sure which HIPE went by the name "Agent Messages". Are you talking about the one that defined file formats and mime types? I think that's RFC 0044.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:30:51 GMT):<br/>
It is heavily modified from the original
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:31:32 GMT):<br/>
All: I updated the instructions about migrating Indy HIPEs to Aries. Note that the step where you get an RFC number is now later in the flow, and that it's now important to regenerate /index.md and run unit tests: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BKLR6lmjuwmHrYldNELijddJYi43IJByBXSMQgIHSYM/edit
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:33:10 GMT):<br/>
But which is it?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:33:34 GMT):<br/>
Should update the HIPE to say it's moved.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:34:00 GMT):<br/>
The did doc conventions hipe?
</p>

@andrew.whitehead thanks was looking for that it will :) I think we need to break the HIPE up too, my first submission was just going to describe key based routing 
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:37:40 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense, I think like queuing there could be alternative management protocols
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:38:15 GMT):<br/>
I've implemented that protocol in indy-cat btw
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 18:38:59 GMT):<br/>

@TelegramSam and/or @swcurran , can I have 3 minutes on the Aries call today? I just want to announce that I am going to be proposing adjustments to the status of a few RFCs that are currently PROPOSED but should probably move to ACCEPTED because they are standards track. No discussion--just alerting the community to watch for those PRs.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:15:33 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:15:51 GMT):<br/>
we are having an RFC/HIPE discussion anyway. I'll give you the first few minutes of that.

For those who are wondering about the relationship between Indy and Aries, here is a formal answer that could be shared: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries/blob/master/README.md#relationship-to-hyperledger-indy
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 20:04:17 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible to separate discussion of protocols (and, in general, matters concerning interoperability) from specific libraries and implementations (ie. the SDK)?

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 20:35:47 GMT):<br/>
@george.aristy - I think we are getting there and that will happen over time.  I think it will be hard to just declare it and make it happen.  I think we are becoming concious of it as a community, which will lead it it happening faster.

@TelegramSam and @dbluhm  here's how web crypto is storing keys when used in a browser. https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#concepts-key-storage
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 18:15:41 GMT):<br/>
While it won't help with the chron job use case it may be useful for in browser web app static agents.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 18:26:05 GMT):<br/>
The browser extension I wrote a while back uses browser local storage for storing its keys. It looks like WebCrypto is encouraging/anticipating use of the IndexedDB API. This isn't really my area of expertise but I haven't identified a significant difference in security between those two storage mechanisms? IndexedDB has definite advantages when a more sophisticated data storage solution is needed, though.
</p>

For everyone writing Aries RFCs, I just learned a trick that I wanted to share.

A lot of our RFCs need to show JSON samples. I've never been very happy with directly embedding the JSON in the markdown using its code block construct with 3 backticks, because:

A) I wanted to be able to point to or highlight parts of the JSON, to make it easier to explain its structure
B) I couldn't put comments in the JSON, because github's JSON beautifier highlights such things and complains about them.

This has caused me to take the alternate approach of writing JSON files, checking them in next to the markdown, and then taking an image of how the JSON displays in an editor, adding highlights and arrows, etc.

I know this has annoyed @swcurran particularly, because it makes it harder to see the diff as JSON changes. (It's still there, just in a .json file instead of in the main markdown file. But I agree that's not obvious or ideal.)

Anyway, here's what I learned:

If you declare that the language of your codeblock is "jsonc" instead of "json" after the 3 opening backticks, Github uses its Sublime/JSON-with-comments beautifier, which allows you to use `//` for comments. This gives much better outcomes than calling the code block straight JSON and having ugly red marks all over it when github beautifies it.

I will probably still use the embedded image approach sometimes when I need to highlight a subset of a JSON block (e.g., the way I used it in the attachments RFC here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0017-attachments/README.md#inlining). But I'm going to start using the "jsonc" code style instead of the "json" code style in other places, to reduce the ugly JSON rendering and improve my ability to comment inline.

I was very interested to hear about the plans to make Aries compatible with Fabric at last night's call (I have been working with Fabric for the last year). I was wondering if anynody is appointed to start looking at this work yet, and perhaps what people think would be the timescales for having something working.

thks @troyronda. "A derivative of Fabric" implies that Fabric needs to be modified to work with Aries? So is there official Fabric work going on in conjunction with Aries?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 11:28:21 GMT):<br/>
Our modifications (related to a DID ledger) were to add a built-in DCAS, enable a REST API on the peer, and performance tweaks.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 11:33:31 GMT):<br/>
Btw - You could use something like IPFS instead of our built-in DCAS (replacing our fabric DCAS client with an IPFS one).

I'm new to the indy community and I have a couple questions. I'm building on top of indy-catalyst and I'm trying to find a way to make the user sessions persistent, 
that is, once a connection is made the user should be able to log off and then log on and the connection will still be there. 
I assume connections are stored on a distributed ledger somewhere, but I can't seem to access the ledger.
for example, I get the following error when I try and send a schema to the ledger
```
500 Internal Server Error

@wadeking98: I don't know the answer to your question, because I'm not an expert on that codebase. However, I am certain that it is NOT related to the ledger. You don't have to persist anything to a ledger to remember your connection. It is more likely the case that you are storing something in your wallet already, without realizing it, and that you have to look it up again when you want to use the connection in the future.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 17:32:33 GMT):<br/>
@wadeking98 the connections are in the wallet. If you are using postgres instead of in-memory wallet, they ought to still be there. Check out the admin API (port 5000) and enumerate the connections to find the one of interest.

I notice that your command line is missing the genesis URL, so it has no idea what its ledger is.

Here's a command line I've been using to thrash on my instance:
```

We're working on a tutorial as I type that will show how to use the Swagger interface (e.g. port 5000) to test the API for such things.  It will be part of the `aries-cloudagent-python` repo (which is what you are looking at in indy-catalyst today) and which should be transferred to hyperledger on Monday (this Monday).  The tutorial will walk through spinning up the agent and using the API to connect agents, issue a credential and then prove it.

And, we'll try to wrap the command line a bit to make it easier on the first run :-)

@swcurran I think the parameters are all important, but maybe they ought to go into a config file. There is a config file, it also provides a natural conversation point for how-to documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 17:59:40 GMT):<br/>
That's what I'm thinking - something .gitignore'd. But for sure we'll have something for the initial tutorial.

Want to do a pull request to add a config file?  :-)

We use this trick to get the docker host IP in a portable way `docker run --net=host codenvy/che-ip`
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 18:54:13 GMT):<br/>
That might be what you need.  I needed it for running the agent and API on linux.

<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 18:59:13 GMT):<br/>
I got my docker host IP as 192.168.65.3 so I used that in place as local host, I also tried my local ip address but none of those worked. I dont think it's a problem with the url, I think that --genesis-url isn't recognized as an argument. when I run "Scripts/run_docker --help" I dont see --genesis-url come up as a recognized argument. The closest argument that I see is --genesis-transactions
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 19:01:46 GMT):<br/>
OK I guess genesis-url is new: somehow the transactions then have to go in as a string.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 19:04:37 GMT):<br/>
and it appears that string is a path
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 19:04:37 GMT):<br/>
and it appears that string is ~a path~ correction, the genesis transactions as a string. If so, that's awful but it might work.

I used my genesis transactions string and it said that "Genesis txn is mailformed j
son" then I put the string all on one line and I got the same error. Next I tried putting all the reqSignature objects as an array and using that as the string. It did't say malformed json anymore but it said "MerkleTree contains invalid
 item". Finally I tried using a single reqSigniture object and I got  "client request invalid: CouldNotAuthenticate('Can not find verkey
for 4QxzWk3ajdnEA37NdNU5Kt',)" Is there any way I can switch to the newer indy catalyst agent that uses genesis-url instead? or has that version not been published yet

…hey guys, I’m trying to run faber-pg.py (from indy-catalyst) locally in debug mode in VSCode, webhook in_port_1 set to 9001. Per Readme it suggests using the indy SDK docker image as a local ledger – I had no luck with that. I then tried using the von-network container – this allowed me to get farther into the code to line 157 (print endpoint url):
Admin url is at: http://127.0.0.1:9004
Endpoint url is at: http://127.0.0.1:9001 
When I get to the next statement (line 161 check swagger content) things blow up
OSError: No socket could be created -- (('0.0.0.0', 9000): [Errno 98] Address already in use)
I feel I’m missing something basic, like using the wrong ledger container, not understanding something about the way the ports are being used, etc. Any suggestions for a different rock to beat my head against?

Any objection to my removing the tables from the Aries agendas? I prefer bulleted lists because the tables make it hard to take notes and don't copy / paste well between agendas.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 15:34:43 GMT):<br/>

No objection, Richard.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 15:35:36 GMT):<br/>
Ry: I think the community Zoom account can be useful for some meetings. But this call conflicts with the Quilt call. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 15:36:21 GMT):<br/>
We have three accounts to reduce conflict. Where I think it was most useful is when we used to host the recordings and could pay for that. Since we don't do that any more, I'm not sure of the value.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 15:36:54 GMT):<br/>
but: this isn't a decision we're making this year, since they're already paid for.

@swcurran I can't attend the afternoon call this week to explain any changes I make to the agenda layout, so I'll wait to until next week to do that. That also allows us to try out the layout on the morning call.

@TelegramSam  I'm not sure yet.... good question but @nage asked for participation and I *think* it fits under DKMS but need a forum to ask questions
</p>
<p><strong>callahan</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 14:07:58 GMT):<br/>
Is there a DKMS channel?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 14:41:06 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for joining the call.

<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 14:42:05 GMT):<br/>
So am I right in saying that tonight's WG call is one  hour earlier than previously?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 14:42:24 GMT):<br/>
I don't think so.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 14:42:32 GMT):<br/>
It's the same time as always on my calendar.
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 14:42:36 GMT):<br/>
ah ok...
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 14:44:23 GMT):<br/>
The two meetings are four hours apart and the first one just ended 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 14:44:32 GMT):<br/>
There is not yet. I would love to understand which aspects of DKMS you are aiming to work on, and then we can figure out the best way to support your work.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 14:44:55 GMT):<br/>
I probably miscounted when I said how far apart they are.

@nbrempel or @andrew.whitehead I noticed something that seemed odd in aries-cloudagent (congrats on getting it migrated to Aries, btw!)

For context: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/727b3430492e3d3b9d96c8a648d792f673799058/aries_cloudagent/messaging/serializer.py#L61

The order of decorator checks and unpacking seems off; it first deserializes which would result in a dictionary with 'tag' and 'iv' and 'ciphertext' etc but then checks for '~thread

Thank you for the tutorial everyone, I still have a couple questions about the persistence of credentials and connections across reboots. From my understanding when two users connect, their connection information is stored on a private ledger between the two users, when both users log out (by pressing ctrl+c in both terminals) the ledger no longer exists. Is there anyway to save the private ledger to a database so that the users dont lose connection information when they log out and log back in?

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 18:35:02 GMT):<br/>
It is not actually a ledger ... it is simply state that is stored in the respective peer agents

<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 18:40:09 GMT):<br/>
ah, thank you. How do I stop the agent's persistent storage from being destroyed when I press ctrl+c ? can I just save the connection json somewhere until the agents log in again?

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 18:40:37 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 18:44:54 GMT):<br/>
right ... one of the devs may know a way to do that but I think it was not the intention of the demo to maintain state across "reboots"
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 18:48:30 GMT):<br/>
okay I have a meeting about it later today so I should get a chance to talk to one of the developers. Thank you for your help

As per our discussion on the WG Call today, I'll start preparing the test suite I demoed today for publishing under Hyperledger!
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 21:21:50 GMT):<br/>
I have a general question about how aries agents will be running on the network. Currently in the demo each user has their own port value, there are about 65,000 ports available on most computers so there can be at most 65,000 active agents at a time. This is fine for now but I'm worried about how it will scale as the project i'm building grows. Is there a way around assigning each user their own port? or will there be a different approach for managing users in the production version of aries?

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 21:59:20 GMT):<br/>
@wadeking98 I think a situation like that would normally be handled by a routing agent dispatching messages to the edge agents
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 22:26:30 GMT):<br/>
The agent stores all of its "state" in the wallet (in non-secrets storage).  Credentials are also stored in the wallet.  To persist across reboots you should (a) use a postgres wallet, and (b) setup your postgres (assuming you are running in docker) with persistent storage
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 22:27:46 GMT):<br/>
We have a standard setup with docker compose that orchestrates the various containers that are needed to run an aries solution (including the agent, postgres storage, controller app, etc)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 22:28:53 GMT):<br/>
For example see the "docker-compose.yml" and "manage" scripts here:  https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst/tree/refactoring/starter-kits/credential-registry/docker
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 22:29:53 GMT):<br/>
Other examples are https://github.com/bcgov/iiwbook/tree/master/docker and https://github.com/bcgov/indy-email-verification/tree/master/docker
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 22:30:10 GMT):<br/>
@wadeking98 
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 22:30:56 GMT):<br/>
As @andrew.whitehead said already, this is not generally how agents will work. Most of the time, Agents will be behind a routing agent that routes to the edge so all of the edge agents are behind a single endpoint. This removes one piece of information that could be correlated. I think we commonly see the one-port-per-agent thing today because that's the simplest way to show that the two interacting agents are separate from each other.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 22:31:53 GMT):<br/>
Correct, and on something like Linux you could add virtual network adapters, or file sockets instead of network sockets (not sure how adaptable our code bases is to that approach, but it shouldn't be too difficult).
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 11:32:44 GMT):<br/>
Fixing this order would also obviate the need for a workaround I've shimmed in for the present: in several Aries#0036 messages, attachment decorators are required, but this code strips them before validation. My workaround puts them back for the validation step. It's ugly and won't scale. The right thing here is to validate first.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 17:37:06 GMT):<br/>
@sklump That particular code doesn't strip any decorators, it's just grabbing a couple fields to allow return routing of error messages (like if validation fails). Decorator support was also refactored a while ago to support things field decorators automatically and not fail on unknown decorators
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 17:38:49 GMT):<br/>
We might need to add a post-validation step to check the presence of decorators, I think they're populated after the message is deserialized
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 17:49:08 GMT):<br/>
It doesn't strip it as such, but it abstains from adding their content into something called `remain`, which it then returns. So whatever uses the remainder doesn't get the attachments.

In this case, what uses it is marshmallow's deserialization validation step.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 17:53:01 GMT):<br/>
Yes, and then the decorators that were found are populated on message._decorators
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 17:53:01 GMT):<br/>
Yes, and then the decorators that were found are populated on message._decorators. But that's a different step from this issue
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 17:57:41 GMT):<br/>
Can it be fixed so that if a decorator is required, it is still there for marshmallow to validate?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 17:57:41 GMT):<br/>
Can it be fixed so that if a marshmallow schema requires a decorator, it is still there for marshmallow to validate on deserialization?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 18:20:10 GMT):<br/>
It's too fragile that way, the decorator formats are independent of the message formats so eventually the agent may support a few different variations of ~attach decorators, for example. That's why I was suggesting adding a post-validation method that could be overridden in that AgentMessage class to check for the decorator. It would have to be called from the Dispatcher after deserializing the message
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 18:20:52 GMT):<br/>
Actually I see it could be called from populate_decorators on the AgentMessage class
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 18:20:52 GMT):<br/>
Actually I see it could be called from populate_decorators on the AgentMessageSchema class
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 18:20:52 GMT):<br/>
Actually I see it could be called from populate_decorators on the AgentMessageSchema class. Or you could override that method
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 18:23:56 GMT):<br/>
I think you're going to have to tell me what buttons to push.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 04 Jul 2019 18:24:55 GMT):<br/>
Anyway I'm thinking, next week is good enough.

hello again everyone, I'm trying to set up persistent storage with the aries agent using a postgres database. The approach I'm taking is to set up a docker-compose file to run a postgres container and then connect to that container from the aries agent container.

hello again everyone, I'm trying to set up persistent storage with the aries agent using a postgres database. The approach I'm taking is to set up a docker-compose file to run a postgres container and then connect to that container from the aries agent container. The database is running and I think I'm using the correct arguments for "--wallet-storage-type", "--wallet-storage-config", and "--wallet-storage-creds" but it still fails to connect. Here is the docker-compose file I'm using and the resulting error trace: *docker-compose.yml*<br/>```

```

I'm assuming this error means it failed to connect to postgres. My question is: am I using the correct arguments to connect to the postgres docker container? 

*Note: I copied and renamed aries/docker/Dockerfile.run to aries/Dockerfile. My docker-compose file is in aries/docker-compose.yml. von-network is running in the background. I could not post the full error trace, only the last part with the error message. After running docker-compose up I am able to connect to postgres on dbeaver using username postgres and password docker *

It looks like the database container has not started and initialized before the agent tries to create the wallet.

I got it working by changing a few things. Added 'db' to the aries 'links', changed the DB url to just 'db:5432', and changed the wallet name ("CREATE DATABASE default" was causing a syntax error, @ianco)

hi good morning i was checking the code of https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/tree/master/python and now i found aca-py agent here, which one should I focus? but I guess they are both pretty related...i want to play a little with the demos code and I had some doubts... Is there a better channel to make these kind of questions? like where is this come from (hardcoded in indy agent demo**)  *did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg* ....

Just ran through the ACA-py demo and was amazed at the 0 to working time of around 3 minutes to complete the demo. Great work BCGov team! I'd advocate for us making this the standard demo used to getting started with Indy as well. The current demo in Indy should remain for people who want to dig into the SDK, but I bet the majority of developers just want to be able to run something like ACA-py and go.

Hello, I have been looking at the Indy Agent code for a while now, and more recently the ACA code as well. I was curious if there was a spec for how Credential offer messages look in Indy / Aries ? 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 15:47:10 GMT):<br/>
I have used https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/blob/master/python/modules/connection.py#L235 as a reference for connection requests, but curious if there is something similar for credential offer's that are made to an agent.

Hello everyone, I have persistent storage set up for one aries agent but I'm trying to connect multiple agents. I'm assuming that each agent should have their own postgres db instance running since the postgres db serves as each agent's wallet. when I try and run multiple instances of the aries agent with persistent storage I get the following error:

However, If i comment out the tags for database connection in the aries service in docker compose, I can run two agents in different shells using docker-compose up. It seems that the public DID information is stored in the postgres db and there is only allowed to be one public DID at a time in the database. (this makes sense if each database is supposed to be the wallet of a single agent). *My main question is "How do I initialize seperete databases for each aries agent?"*

Hello everyone. I have persistent storage set up for one aries agent, but I'm trying to connect multiple agents. I'm assuming that each agent should have their own postgres db instance running since the postgres db serves as each agent's wallet. when I try and run multiple instances of the aries agent with persistent storage I get the following error:

```
aries_cloudagent.error.StartupError: New seed provided which doesn't match the registered public did 4QxzWk3ajdnEA37NdNU5Kt

I'm currently just running the following command in different shells with different arguments for ot, it, and seed:

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 20:00:05 GMT):<br/>
You can share the same server instance, but you have to define a unique wallet (database) name for each agent; `--wallet-name`.
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 20:37:23 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the quick reply, I've added the --wallet-name tag but whenever I start a new agent in another shell, it kills and re-runs the agents in the other shells and makes them run on the same port. Example:
the aries agent is running in shell 1 with wallet name alice on port 5000. When the command `it=10001 ot=5001 seed=00000000000000000000000000000001 label=faber wallet_name=faber docker-compose up` is entered into shell 2, shell 1 outputs the following:

it seems like it, but the only thing is that if I comment out the database connection tags for the aries agent in the docker compose, docker no longer tries to recreate the aries agent, which is strange

Wondering if @ianco, or @andrew.whitehead have any thoughts.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 21:04:42 GMT):<br/>
You should be able to use one postgres for multiple wallets
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 21:04:58 GMT):<br/>
The wallet name is used to create the database inside the postgres server
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 21:11:21 GMT):<br/>
... so you need to provide a different wallet name for each instance of the agent
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 21:11:35 GMT):<br/>
... but they can all point to the same postgres database
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 21:12:23 GMT):<br/>
docker-compose up is always going to recreate the environment, and running it twice (with -p to override the project name) would just give you two database containers. It's not the right application for docker-compose if you want to run an arbitrary number of agents
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 21:13:32 GMT):<br/>
@ianco they are connecting to the same database and I'm providing different wallet names with the wallet_name environment variable

You can take a look at how the agent is started as a subprocess in the alice/faber demo, that may be a more suitable approach for your use case

@TelegramSam  Hi Sam, all, I created pull request https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/119, in which I propose to add XMPP to the list of DIDcom transports, with reference to RFC 0024 DIDCom-over-XMPP, https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0024-didcomm-over-xmpp. Please let me know if you have any questions. Also, what steps/actions would be needed from my side to bring 0024 further? Should I be discussing this proposed RFC with you? Oskar

I'm trying to understand the current concerns with correctable service endpoints for individuals. Can someone clarify for me who would be doing the correlation and what they would observe in order to see this correlation?

Let's say that a private individual were to use the same service endpoint for 2 different pairwise relationships

<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:04:24 GMT):<br/>
This seems significant, because it is clear that a RoutingRUs universal router would solve these problems, but it's not clear if a very specific routing / forwarding agent solves this at all
</p>
<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:04:57 GMT):<br/>
For example, if I had my own personal cloud agent that forwarded DID messages to my edge devices, this would hypothetically be very correlatable
</p>
<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:05:16 GMT):<br/>
Because all of my relationships would point to this agent, but only MY relationships not relationships of others
</p>
<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:05:23 GMT):<br/>
Am I thinking about this correctly?
</p>
<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:05:56 GMT):<br/>
The requirement of having routers that serve a lot of traffic but definitely aren't central (this causes a host of other issues) seems difficult
</p>
<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:10:06 GMT):<br/>
Seems like this could easily push towards a few very centralized routing providers... and then these providers can correlate everything and know a lot more than they should about all of the traffic

@josh.graber you've hit the paradox of the problem of routing on it's head. This is a tricky problem that we felt didn't have great answers. On the one hand a person can be fully self sovereign by hosting their own router, on the other hand they lose out on the herd privacy. We thought about how mixnets could fit in to help, but ultimately didn't follow up with that work. Right now we felt it was sufficient to leave the options you suggested as available and see if anyone could offer improvements to the design later.

</p>
<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 18:12:07 GMT):<br/>
I think there is some clarity in this document on this topic: https://github.com/hyperledger/education/blob/master/LFS171x/docs/introduction-to-hyperledger-indy.md#unwanted-correlation
</p>
<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 18:12:54 GMT):<br/>
It would appear the concern is with service providers collaborating to correlate end user data for the purpose of advertising, which clearly is a widespread problem with the current flawed identity / authentication system
</p>
<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 18:19:35 GMT):<br/>
Any thoughts about how we can prevent this same correlation from occurring on the bases of disclosed attributes from verifiable credentials?
</p>
<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 18:30:14 GMT):<br/>

There are still a couple of potential issues to keep an eye on. 
</p>
<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 18:31:11 GMT):<br/>
First, the difficulty of establishing trust. Which does often require sharing a certain amount of information (which could then be used for correlations). 
</p>
<p><strong>josh.graber</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 18:31:59 GMT):<br/>
Second, for essential services it sometimes feels like we are at the mercy of the providers. If they require that we disclose more information than we are comfortable with we often feel as if we do not have any viable alternatives.

I am currently of the thinking that once we have “safe streets” via DIDComm peer connections and we have devalued non-VC based Data (your accurate but not presented in a cryptographic envelope personal data) we will need to use privacy commissioners and regulations to discourage the storing of Personal data in relying party systems

This might be a silly question, but is it possible to have a connection download my images (IPFS links to those images are stored in aries / indy wallet)? Also, Can I have a consent receipt from the connection for the use of my images only for a period of time?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 23:42:24 GMT):<br/>
@ravip you could design a protocol to allow that behavior, but I'm unaware of any existing protocols for that behavior.
</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:02:45 GMT):<br/>
okay, do you think the consent part can be achieved using indy wallets?
</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:06:46 GMT):<br/>
I mean, is there some kind of explorer for microledger between entities wherein a data subject could see what they have consented to and for how long to data controllers?
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 01:33:00 GMT):<br/>
A bunch of thinking and work about consent going on in #indy-semantics 
Consent likely managed via verifiable credentials.. perhaps issued to the person providing consent as a “receipt” and vice versa. Recall that verifiable credentials are always countersigned...

@TelegramSam I'm working on adding the feature query to static agent as we discussed. The static agent sends the query to indy-agent. I'm stuck because indy-agent doesn't have 'their-endpoint' for the static agent. It looks to me like I need to add 0092: transports return route to indy-agent and use ~transport with return_route: thread in the feature query. I wanted to check with you before launching into this. Does this sound reasonable to you? 
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 19:35:34 GMT):<br/>
@rchristman for now, you can get around this by using one of the static agen examples that has a web server running so both sides can contact each other over http post. At this point, the addition of return route support to the indy agent python reference agent is not trivial and I would recommend you don't worry about it for the time being.

<p><strong>rchristman</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 19:44:46 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm Two more questions. There's inconsistency in using '-' and '_' in the family names. Which one is the standard going forward?
</p>
<p><strong>rchristman</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 19:46:06 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm Other question. There are big similarities between the protocol query and feature query. Is 'feature' replacing 'protocol', or are these different things?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 19:50:09 GMT):<br/>
@rchristman refer to the aries-rfc repository for up to date naming conventions. I believe `-` is preferred over `_`. Protocol discovery was the original naming as captured in the Indy HIPE repository. The updated protocol name is `discover-features`. This may be problematic in your testing against the python reference agent as it uses the old naming convention. If you feel so inclined, I'd be happy to accept a PR that updates the naming convention in the reference agent.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 20:58:58 GMT):<br/>
@ravip sounds a lot like snap, of course they have it implemented using a central server, but using e2e encryption and a ratchet protocol, so even snap does not have access to your images. There are leakages that can occur like taking a screenshot or a photo of the screen which cannot be prevented. The trick will be to transform the protocol into a decentralized peer to peer setting

@jadhavajay The existing indy-agent node codebase was an early project prior to much progress in settling protocol work. It will need updating, but does include many of the core ideas and ui to enable use.

So your choice depends pretty heavily on the architecture you want in your final work. The node app has a built in ui, the ACA-py has a driver architecture.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:39:10 GMT):<br/>
My $0.02CDN would be to use ACA-Py for guidance.  @mhailstone might want to weigh in on this since he was driving the early work on the node-js implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:39:46 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if it makes any sense as a demo to do a controller in nodejs that talks to the ACA-Py agent.

Assuming you are running von-network, you are running indy-node 1.8.4 (based on the dockerfile - `FROM bcgovimages/von-image:py35-1.8-4`).  Is it possible that is an older version of Indy Node?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 00:28:31 GMT):<br/>
It's weird that the DID was created, but failed on the schema and cred def creation calls.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 00:33:41 GMT):<br/>
If GENESIS_URL isn't set then it defaults to local-genesis.txt. It's possible the transactions there don't match the actual ledger instance
</p>

<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:25:19 GMT):<br/>
Nope that didn't fix it. Same error. So not sure what is happening.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:27:42 GMT):<br/>
Wallet and ledger out of sync perhaps now. Restart with clean ledger and reinitialized wallet? (I’m guessing) 
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:29:50 GMT):<br/>
Not sure exactly how to do that. If ./manage down then ./manage start does that start with clean ledger?  And then how to clean wallet?  Is there stuff stored on disk or should it be clear every time I run faber.py?  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:30:59 GMT):<br/>
The ./manage down removes the volumes.  Not sure how to remove local wallet - its a removal of a magic folder.  I'll see what I can see in the indy-sdk channel.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:31:11 GMT):<br/>
If this is not the first run, then that likely is the issue.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:31:49 GMT):<br/>
If you are using von-network you can use the ledger browser at localhost:9000 to see the state of the ledger 
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:31:58 GMT):<br/>
I have tried to run it several times. At first it couldn't find the libindy.dylb but I fixed that. 
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:32:02 GMT):<br/>
Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:38:12 GMT):<br/>
The ledger is getting cleaned when I bring down and back up so I think its the local wallet.
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:38:39 GMT):<br/>
Where is that stored? Magic Folder?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:39:49 GMT):<br/>
There is `./manage stop` which does not delete the ledger persistence.  But you really shouldn't need to stop it without deleting it - just leave it running.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:55:30 GMT):<br/>
I think the local wallet would be stored in `~/.indy_client/wallet`
</p>

Hi,
I am following the https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/README.md running through the docker.
I am able to establish the network using link https://github.com/bcgov/von-network#running-the-network-locally but getting an error while connecting to indy network using CLI:

indy> pool connect sandbox
Error: Invalid library state
  Caused by: Ledger merkle tree is not acceptable for current tree.
  
Additionaly while trying to connect the Agents with network getting an error as below:

Yes the local wallet for faber is being created in ~/.indy_client/wallet  but deleting it before running does not change the error.  humph.  ?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:10:45 GMT):<br/>
Hi @AmanAgrawal - what is your setup?  The scripts usually figure out your docker IP address using the follow command - `DOCKERHOST=$(docker run --rm --net=host codenvy/che-ip)`
</p>
<p><strong>AmanAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:17:14 GMT):<br/>
I am using the Running the Network on a VPS approach.  had to give the public_ip_address as my docker IP and it worked. Also, had to make IP changes to the agent.py file to make this work.

Could you attach the two files so I can see what you did?  We should be able to make it "just work".  Attaching them here would be great.
</p>
<p><strong>AmanAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:19:44 GMT):<br/>
sure.give me few mins
</p>
<p><strong>AmanAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:25:55 GMT):<br/>
for the 5th step i.e run the network of nodes i had to put my docker ip as to the below command: 
</p>
<p><strong>AmanAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:25:58 GMT):<br/>
./manage start 172.17.0.1 WEB_SERVER_HOST_PORT=80 "LEDGER_INSTANCE_NAME=My Ledger" &
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:28:32 GMT):<br/>
@AmanAgrawal, for the demos, assuming you are running everything locally, you should be able to start `von-network` by running `./manage start`
</p>
<p><strong>AmanAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:29:12 GMT):<br/>
this i did on my VPS
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:29:52 GMT):<br/>
@AmanAgrawal, so you are hosting `von-network` on a machine separate from where you are running the demos?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:31:07 GMT):<br/>
The demo instructions assume you are running everything locally.
</p>
<p><strong>AmanAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:31:09 GMT):<br/>
by demos do you mean agents?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:31:44 GMT):<br/>
@AmanAgrawal, Yes, I mean agents.
</p>

yes.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:37:46 GMT):<br/>
Those instructions assume all of the commands and services (von-network, faber, and alice) are all run on the same machine; local machine, or VM (VPS).
</p>
<p><strong>AmanAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:40:14 GMT):<br/>
so according to you what should be the public IP while running the ./manage start public_ip_address WEB_SERVER_HOST_PORT=80 "LEDGER_INSTANCE_NAME=My Ledger" & command?
</p>
<p><strong>AmanAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:40:37 GMT):<br/>
assuming i am doing this on my VPS
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:41:12 GMT):<br/>
You should literally be able to do;
`/von-network $ ./manage start`
`/aries-cloudagent-python/demo $ ./run_demo faber`
`/aries-cloudagent-python/demo $ ./run_demo alice`
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:42:34 GMT):<br/>
The VPS instructions for `von-network` are for hosting shared instance of `von-network` like this; http://dev.bcovrin.vonx.io/
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:44:33 GMT):<br/>
The VPS instructions are not meant to be followed when you are running von-network locally for development or demos.  The demos assume von-network is running on the same machine and available at `http://DOCKERHOST:9000/`
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:44:33 GMT):<br/>

The demos assume von-network is running on the same machine and available at `http://DOCKERHOST:9000/` and/or via is service name.  Running von-network using `./manage start` will also expose it at `http://localhost:9000/`

<p><strong>AmanAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:46:16 GMT):<br/>
did you check the connection error i posted above? i did just the steps you have mentioned.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:47:37 GMT):<br/>
I did, how are where were you running the `CLI`
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:47:37 GMT):<br/>
I did, how are where were you running the `CLI`?  Also are you running von-network in it's default mode; `./manage start`?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>AmanAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:52:35 GMT):<br/>
i did these steps precisely as mentioned : Download this repository:

curl -L https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/archive/master.zip > bcovrin.zip && \
    unzip bcovrin.zip && \
    cd von-network-master && \
    chmod a+w ./server/
Build the Docker container:

./manage build
Run the network of nodes:

# This command requires the publicly accessible ip address of the machine `public_ip_address`
# WEB_SERVER_HOST_PORT maps the docker service port to a public port on the machine
# LEDGER_INSTANCE_NAME sets the display name of the ledger on the page headers.
./manage start public_ip_address WEB_SERVER_HOST_PORT=80 "LEDGER_INSTANCE_NAME=My Ledger" &
Connecting to the Network
With the CLI
Once the nodes are all running and have connected to each other, you can run the Indy client to test the connection in a separate terminal window:

./manage cli
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:54:10 GMT):<br/>
Those are the instructions for hosting a shared instance of `von-network`.
</p>

Please follow these instructions; https://github.com/bcgov/von-network#running-the-network-locally

<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 20:33:53 GMT):<br/>
Let's say, an organization is developing an application that uses decentralized identity mechanism to recognize the participants and it is a requirement that user wallet needs to be portable, meaning user should be able to login from any machine. 
In this case, if I am not wrong, the wallets (agent) need to be on cloud.
Now, who hosts user's wallet (database)? Where does it reside? 
And I guess the user would be able to read from the wallet only when they provide decryption key which is tied to an agent?

I am still in the process of learning the concepts of decentralized identity and agents so please pardon me if I have used incorrect technical vocabulary.

One of DIdery's features is cloud encrypted store of private keys using OTP encryption. In general storing private keys in the cloud for very valuable keys is not recommended but some sort of hardware security module.

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 13:02:14 GMT):<br/>
@mbonito Cordova based frameworks use a javascript bridge to invoke native features. To use the indy-sdk you would need the native wrapper for iOS/droid in addition to a bridge that would invoke these functionalities from javascript. I am not familiar with any effort for this. Nodejs wrapper wouldn't work in this scenario as it requires nodejs runtime, not a browser JS runtime.
Xamarin has the ability to invoke the native libraries for each platform through the .NET wrapper, which is why it's convenient for cross platform dev right now.

Looks like you are running with Docker - correct?  I'm trying to run the demo just using python directly, and not getting much luck, so we'll have to get back to you.
</p>
<p><strong>zzx02</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 16:13:44 GMT):<br/>
I am also using python directly.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 16:15:55 GMT):<br/>
OK - right now I can't get it running on linux at all - even less than you have.  I've got a question out to the dev to look at it and get proper instructions.  We'll post as soon as we nail it down.

Update - @andrew.whitehead is looking at this and we'll do an update to the instructions.  The layout of the folders is making it awkward to run, so that's being adjusted. Not sure how you got as far as you did @zzx02, as we are having different issues, so it all needs to be sorted out.

<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 19:22:28 GMT):<br/>
Running locally won't work as instructed because of the relative imports in the same folder.  I fixed that for me by adding a glue file to fix the imports but then ran into indy-sdk issues. which I then fixed but now am stuck on the issue reported above with the error creating the credential.

My best guess of my current problem is that Docket is setting up environment variables that the local setup instructions do not include.  There are several places within the agent codes where is sets defaults via os.getenv()  and does not supply a default if os.getenv() is empy  (Which IMHO is good practive)

Regarding the label discussion from the aries call...

The self-asserted label field in the invitation seems analogous to the 'reply to' name in email addresses, which is abused, today.  However, since we are processing pairwise DID invitations from currently unverified parties, then it seems more useful than not.  (In-person QR codes help with the uncertainty.)

However, if these invitations are received remotely, what will the UX designers do?  If they display the name, it gives the impression of trust -- unless it specifically states that the name is "unverified".  Should that be called out as a requirment?

I see label as analogy to the label of the phone within Bluetooth communication (hard to connect just on mac addresses) but for BT quite often you have second step before that will happen that other part need to confirm with pin or just a message box (this is how the UX is design) 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:00:29 GMT):<br/>
I don't think that even signature on the message proposed by Tobias would help in that case.  As you still can't trust the label anyway. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:01:36 GMT):<br/>
But I get the point from @danielhardman why it is there. I am just afraid that it will be misused and the UX won't be the right one. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:02:19 GMT):<br/>
I could imagine that you enter huge event where you have 100 companies which each of them want to advertise to you with did:peer sending out invitation to everyone who is in the range. 
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:02:41 GMT):<br/>
I wasn't on the call, but we did bring up this topic in a slightly related context. 

Tobias's connectionless authentication HIPE could also use this label on challenge requests.

This was brought up when discussing the challenge flow with Tyler (connect.me team), for when a challenge is shown, what's the UX to see who is sending it if it's not already a connection. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:03:26 GMT):<br/>
Or even better example shopping mall where every store would like to send you some invitation to established relationship. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:03:43 GMT):<br/>
My invitation inbox would be full all the time. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:07:12 GMT):<br/>
We started thinking about making this secure connection completely transparent by user to filter out for him connection requests which he should never deal with and just drop them for him). But valid point is that for did:peer could be to expensive to do it that way. But still problem stays how to deal with potential hundreds connections coming in while e.g. my BT is on.   
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:09:00 GMT):<br/>
My ideal scenario would be that the "agent" is dealing with all those request on behave of the user means that the user never interact with the request. Just "agent" shows the most relevant one or the one which you approved (e.g. by setting proper filter - no adds.) 
</p>

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:35:44 GMT):<br/>
I'm on board with this approach. I especially like that the UX accounts for the 3rd and forth options. This feels like a good middle ground that's analogous to handling a phone call received from a random number. 
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:40:51 GMT):<br/>
For the third option (Alice asks for a self attested ID), would it not be ideal to already include an ~ optional ~ label field in the connection invite, allowing the agent to use that instead of delegating it to a separate protocol?

I thought about that.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:43:07 GMT):<br/>
I wouldn't be super opposed, but I think some of the other purists might be. And they might be right.

If we *did* allow this, it should be on the latter messages in the protocol, NOT on the invitation. and it should be named something that makes its self-attested nature clear. The UX in my proposal would be modified so that button 3 says, "Rename Anonymous Panda to the self-attested name 'Bob'" or something like that.
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:45:16 GMT):<br/>
i would also possibly position that instead of a label field, it could be self attested "metadata" field -- this would spawned from a conversation with the evernym folks, for stuff like picture of the invitee, any other info, etc 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:46:06 GMT):<br/>
As soon as you start getting fancy, you make me wonder if that's not just some sort of "describe yourself" or "share a profile" protocol that policy could trigger once DID exchange is done.
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:46:15 GMT):<br/>
Alice's agent would be in charge of actually reading this field or not
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:47:07 GMT):<br/>
I guess my motivation really comes form the fact that we're really liked the connectionless flow for interactions a lot, the idea of having a connection with everything that you interact with seems -- a  little tedious to user flow

Ie, one of the key things we're trying to develop is API integration for websites to allow for verifications and "one click login" that uses connectionless auth instead of creating a new connection for every website you visit. having tons and tons of connections seems like non ideal UX
</p>
<p><strong>mccown</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:53:03 GMT):<br/>
I like @danielhardman 's approach and think there are some simple use cases, such as this:

1) Bill:  thanks for the chat, Alice, I'm sending a invite request
2) Alice: looks for Bill's invite (which shows his self-asserted name) and accepts

In this model, the label isn't a trust point by itself, but becomes a fiducial point in context with their conversation.  This helps housekeeping, but does reinforce the "don't accept connections from strangers".
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:57:45 GMT):<br/>
@spacemandev, although I was one of the people who tried to normalize the idea of operating in connectionless mode, I don't think it's a good idea to stay connectionless as standard operating procedure. Connections give you an audit trail; they are what you would look up to say, "What does <entity X> know about me? What consent have I given them? What credentials have they seen? And what do I know about them, too?" Connections are also a point of policy enforcement; they are where you can say, "Don't ever tell Bank X anything else about me". If everything you do is ephemeral, it is true that you are a ghost on the digital landscape, but so is everybody else. Usually, you want more record-keeping and control than that.

As far as the UX implications, think of connections like cookies. How much time do most users spend inspecting a list of their cookies? And how much of a UX burden do you consider them?
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 22:05:43 GMT):<br/>
well,
for the first bit, I would say I don't think it's all or nothing -- i think there's specific cases where connectionless shines. 
as for the second, i don't know if cookies is the appropriate term because there is more user involvement with "connectioning". i know that it's been discussed about setting up rules for agents to be able to automate stuff like this, but i think in practice setting rules for each type of usecase increases set up time for users who likely won't engage in that and leave it to defaults

i think of it more like adding email addresses/phone numbers to your address book. for example, if I wanted to start a secure did message chat with someone i'm connectioned with, it'd be clunky to go to my connections list and see every service i've ever interacted with as a connection.

furthermore, like emails and and phone numbers, you could still maintain logs of proof requests fulfilled for audit purposes without needing to tie those to connections -- and linking them automatically if a connection with an entity was created after the fact (texting a number, then adding that number to your contact list later is an example i think of)

call recording posted for USAfternoon call yesterday: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=16321260
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:14:25 GMT):<br/>
Thinking about the two roles of this: the inviter and invitee. The inviteee is actively involved in receiving an invite (due to the out of band passing of the invite) which means that prompting the user for a name (perhaps prefilled with a random name as suggested) is a normal flow.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:16:48 GMT):<br/>
the label field is also present in a Request message. This helps the inviter identify the invitee. This is particulary important when it's a group invite, such as a slide during a presentation.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:18:48 GMT):<br/>
so: I think we can eliminate the label from the invite, but we need to discuss the use of a label in the rest of the flow.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:19:17 GMT):<br/>
other ideas include a visual identifier derived from the keys in use.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:21:51 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam I hadn't considered the need to identify the invitee. That's a good wrinkle to think about.

The other thing to consider, possibly, is the need to facilitate introductions. The DID exchange protocol is the second half of the introduction protocol (or more precisely, the introduction protocol ends when the introducer has triggered the DID exchange protocol between the other two parties). When that's the context, the introducer will have already given a label to the other two parties to help them know what to expect of the DID exchange that's about to start...
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:23:05 GMT):<br/>
For those unfamiliar with the introduce protocol, please see https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0028-introduce/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:26:44 GMT):<br/>
In all cases, labeling the DID with a 'user suggested name' and allowing easy renaming might be the right answer.

@ravip - in the aries-cloudagent-python Alice/Faber demo, the agent is invoked as a sub-process of the controller and the command line parameters are set here - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/9428c083d76712028e820d87ccdc8719e827b106/demo/runners/support/agent.py#L142

We expect the "normal" use case for ACA-Py will be to have the agent in it's own container (vs. a sub-process) and so in the start up of that container, you would specifiy the command line parameters.

The list of command line parameters is documented here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/DevReadMe.md#command-line-arguments
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 18:17:05 GMT):<br/>
@AmanAgrawal - the OrgBook use case is special in two ways.  First, the credentials in it are all public, *not* private information - basically, the pieces of paper that a business puts on their wall for clients to see that they are permitted/qualified to do the work they do.  Second, the mechanism is largely to bootstrap the Verifiable Credentials model in a jurisdiction - to get all the gov't (and others) to issue Verifiable Credentials even though no business have their own wallets (to create a supply), so that when organizations get their wallets, they can get verifiable credentials (the demand).  There are longer term uses of OrgBook that go beyond bootstrapping, but that was the initial reason for building it.

We would definitely not recommend putting 14M citizens private information into an OrgBook-like repository.  That would be private information would just be a honeypot for attacks.  We would never use that approach for citizen data.

On your last question. Once an organization has their own wallet, they will connect to the various services that issued credentials about them to OrgBook to be issued a verifiable credential directly to them.  The OrgBook could facilitate the connections, but would not "transfer" the credential they have to the organization.  That is technically not feasible, nor is it desirable. The business would just collect the verifiable credentials from the enabled services that provided those same credentials to OrgBook.

Hope that helps.

The implementation work for identity inside of Hyperledger has gotten to a point where there is a significant amount of cross-project collaboration.  In particular we have a lot of Indy+Aries+Ursa discussions about API surfaces, release planning and use cases that has always been going on in the Thursday Indy WG call.  Since the nature of that collaboration now spans multiple projects with the three we mentioned, we are moving that call underneath the Identity WG's management and officially opening it up to all Identity Implementation work (we didn't want it to distract from the higher-level whitepaper or use case work already going on in the bi-weekly call we have now).   So if you're writing identity code for a Hyperledger project, or anything that intends to be interoperable with a Hyperledger project, please join us for the first Identity Implementers call next Thursday at 9 AM mountain time.  We will be discussing whether to have the call every week or every other week, and looking for any other working groups from the projects that would like to report status or discuss progress.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 18:45:28 GMT):<br/>
What about allowing an optional passing of a proof as the label in the request and response messages?  So instead of getting a self-attested name, you are getting a self-selected, 3rd party attested name?  I believe the other party can construct the proof request and send the proof, and that the recipient can verify it, and use the included claim for the label.

This would work like the "reply-to" mechanism, be flexible, but in time, cultural norms would define what is appropriate to use for that in different situations.

Could that work?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 18:49:09 GMT):<br/>
It could. But if that's the only option we offer, I think it still depends on VCs too much. Self-attested names are really quite normal and perfectly fine for many relationships. If I meet a salesman at a car dealership and we build a relationship around a car purchase, I may eventually do some pretty formal stuff with him--but I will *never* care whether he's lied to me about his first name. It's just a handle. He could call himself Iggy Stardust for all I care.

Now, if we make your proposal optional, then I think we've done something quite nice. We've given people the option of beginning a relationship with high assurance of the other party's name. A moderate amount of the time, that would be nice.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 18:51:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's what I was thinking - optional and a self-attested option as well. Then the user experience and usage patterns would push to making one that easy path for the user.

I'm a bit leery on the idea of passing credentials in the unencrypted format. It seems odd that we would go to great lengths to protect the sender's key in the crypto layer and then pass plaintext VCs around.

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 20:36:27 GMT):<br/>
At least with the self attested data I can do something that provides indirection (e.g. provide a random number) but with credential data it makes for some privacy reduction that I don't believe are worth the tradeoffs of being able to name the connection immediately.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 20:43:03 GMT):<br/>

+1 to the "happy place" (as Daniel calls it) where this thread ended up. The option of a self-attested label or a VC (or, in theory, both) seems right.

FYI - the BC Gov team has initiated an open source project (via an open source "Code With Us" bounty) to implement a OpenIDConnect Identity Provider that works using Verifiable Credentials.  Mattr Global is doing the work with BC Gov.  The initial repo for the effort has been created and a first draft of a document that outlines many of the details of how it is going to work is in the repo.

Check it out here - https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc. 

Please feel free to help with this effort - add issues, ask questions and add pull requests.  We're hoping to have something that can be easily used with any IAM in any deployment.

Greetings from Ottawa! This is my interaction at this chat.
I read https://github.com/hyperledger/education/blob/master/LFS171x/docs/introduction-to-hyperledger-indy.md . 
It is still not very clear how Indy uses ZKPs. The same question goes for Aries. How does Aries use ZKPs.  -- Cheers -- Gustavo

the ZKPs that are supported in the protocol are basically that you can require that a certain attribute has an integer value >= a given value.. so anything you want to check if someone is 18 and you have the DOB the credential would need to use e.g. epoch date.. so you cannot use a string notation for the date if you want to use ZKPs. 

/// predicate_info: Describes requested attribute predicate
///     {
///         "name": attribute name, (case insensitive and ignore spaces)
///         "p_type": predicate type (Currently >= only)
///         "p_value": predicate value
///         "restrictions": Optional<wql query>,
///         "non_revoked": Optional<<non_revoc_interval>>, // see below,
///                        // If specified prover must proof non-revocation
///                        // for date in this interval this attribute
///                        // (overrides proof level interval)
///     }

A richer set of predicates are part of the upcoming rich schema project. At present it's even less complete than it appears at first glance: if you want to use DoB for age of majority, you must store it as a negative stringified integer (e.g., epoch seconds) and then test whether that moment exceeds the negative of the current moment plus [16/18/19/21] calendar years' worth of seconds.

IIRC (I'm just an Indy user, not part of the Sovrin team), the mobile agent would include an end-point to a cloud agent in their DID document. You would then send any messages intended for the mobile to the cloud agent which acts as a post box for the mobile.

<p><strong>janb</strong> (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 14:13:43 GMT):<br/>
question: is there a way to promote a way to acquire a credential? If you miss a credential to fulfill a proof, is there something in the did to promote a URL "go here and follow the steps to get the XY credential"? (bit of a crosspost from the DID sovrin chat)

I have a use case where a mobile agent has an existing connection to a web agent. I would like to issue a credential to the mobile agent. Assuming that this user has connected multiple mobile agents to the web agent, how would we decide which connection to prepare the credential offer for? The preferred path would be to offer a QR code to the mobile agent and somehow negotiate to find the existing connection, then offer the credential on that connection. Is there already a feature to cover this?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 19:54:17 GMT):<br/>
That sounds much like the Email Verification Service is doing.  It's a controller for the Aries-CloudAgent-Python.  It collects and email address from the user, creates an invitation associated with the email address and puts it into a link in an email. When the user clicks on the link (confirming they own the link) they get a QR code of the invitation such that there is a linkage between the connection and the web session (aka the email address).

It's not a "core feature" but certainly can be implemented.  Look at  https://github.com/bcgov/indy-email-verification

The Aries Cloud Agent - Python supersedes the Indy Python Reference Agent. Indy Agent was a useful demonstration of a lot of the principles discussed as part of the Indy Agent WG call. The Aries Cloud Agent Python has far more hours of developer time put into it and is actively being developed. It is currently unclear whether there is any need to continue work on the Python Reference Agent but probably not; it is effectively deprecated.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 21:27:31 GMT):<br/>
Yup - that's it. To extend it a little further, in the newer take on Indy, few agents would have public DIDs - just those that issue credentials. All others would connect using pairwise dids that are not published on a ledger.

This material starts from the Indy course on blockchain and goes from there to explain it...

<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 21:39:50 GMT):<br/>
Ah ok got it.  This is the standard for Indy, I don't think there is (yet) a plan for a different storage for Aries.  @swcurran  would know
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 21:48:56 GMT):<br/>
Currently in aries-cloudagent-python there is a generic storage service, and two implementations - one using in-memory persistence (mainly for tests) and one based on Indy storage.

So, there is an abstraction layer that enables other implementations, but no serious alternatives other than Indy.

For now, it's sufficient, but we'd be fine with the community deciding on other approaches.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 21:50:02 GMT):<br/>

Hi Fellow Community Members!

We, the folks from the BC gov VON (https://vonx.io) team, would like to share an opportunity with members of open communities to work with us to do some focused collaboration around mobile agent, Aries agents and aries-cloudagent-python interoperability. We have a pilot production service planned for a significant professional accreditation organization within our province coming up in the fall. This pilot has a requirement for mobile agents to be able to hold and offer verifiable credentials issued and verified by services operating instances of aries-cloudagent-python. Details are in this Open Collaboration MOU: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GPZ4p4zM36AN3DcHJ13s_IisSrT4F3S0 

More details around the use case and how we intend to work with the community are in the document.

Our offer is to work closely, in the open, with groups that we believe are close to having a releasable mobile agent such that their agent could be one of the listed compatible agents when this new service goes live. Our expectation is for the production pilot to occur this fall.

If you are interested and think you have a mobile agent that is close to release, please review this Open Collaboration MOU, and contact us via Hyperledger Rocket.Chat or via my email available in the MOU.

We would expect to have all participates identified with signed MOUs by Aug 6th 2019.

hi, for aries agent how can a holder knows that if his credential is revoked or not? does the holder need to selfcreate a proof to himself and verify proof?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 10:09:31 GMT):<br/>
At present, aca-py does not support revocation.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 13:52:22 GMT):<br/>
Revocation support in Aries agents for Indy Credentials will be the same as for Indy agent and will be added relatively soon.

From a technical perspective, the Issuer can unilaterally revoke the credential with no notice need be given to the holder.

From a business perspective (which is what I think you are asking), we would expect that the issuer will notify the holder that they will/have revoke the credential and offer the holder a new credential that reflects the new state of the credential.  For example, if you move, the Driver's Licence agency will revoke your old licence and issue you a new one with the new address.

Since the issuer has a nice, secure, end-to-end channel to message you with DIDComm, they would have an easy time notifying you of the change and offering you a new credential.

</p>
<p><strong>janb</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 17:57:01 GMT):<br/>
another interesting aspect: even if a credential was revoked you can also check if it was valid before timestamp X, so even if e.g. the drivers license is revoked the DoB attribute on that license still holds value regardless of the overall validity
</p>
<p><strong>janb</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 17:57:45 GMT):<br/>
so revoked -> have the holder delete it is not necessarily the flow you might want to implement
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 17:58:28 GMT):<br/>
Agreed - a passport can still be used for somethings even after revocation.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 17:58:28 GMT):<br/>

@janb , true from far but not in detail: the holder can present proof that it was valid at timestamp X if it actually was: it's an instant, not a time period.

The verifier can specify an interval where he will accept proof of non-revocation, but the non-revocation proof itself is at a given timestamp, not over an interval.

For example,
verifier: was he a lawyer any time last year?

I would love to find out who is in that space and collect some more information about the current status. Would be nice to bootstrap discussion. If anyone has anything to share in the space of IoT or knows someone who could, please comment here. I will try to collect as much input as possible for further discussion and do some preparation for our call (it could be the morning call if the timezone is problematical). Of course if someone has already some work which he would like to share that would be perfect.

Hello again everyone, on my project I have users connected to aries agents with the ability to connect to each other and send messages. when a user logs in it finds two random free ports to start the aries agent on. The only problem is that when two users form a connection each user's inbound transport port is saved in the connection. so if one user logs out and logs back in again they will be allocated a new port for inbound transport, but the connection will still contain their old inbound transport and the user won't be able to recieve messages. My question is: *is there any way I can update the connection information so that it contains the new inbound transport for each agent?*
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 22:23:26 GMT):<br/>
I believe this is covered by Aries RFC 30 but I don’t know of any implementations yet 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 22:25:19 GMT):<br/>
Two answers.  First, I think you want to avoid that situation, so I would relook at the approach.  Second, what you are asking is can you update the DIDDoc of a peer DID.  At the moment, you cannot.  The did:peer spec is being reviewed and will be accepted and then implemented in the various code bases in a consistent way. Once that is there you will be able to update a DIDDoc for a pairwise DID.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 22:26:25 GMT):<br/>
Ah...well there you go.  Same answer as mine, but you can look at RFC 30 - which should be the same as the did:peer spec.
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 22:31:24 GMT):<br/>
sorry I'm still a bit new to hyperledger, what is RFC 30?

<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 22:31:24 GMT):<br/>
sorry I'm still a bit new to hyperledger, what is RFC 30 or where can I find it?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 22:36:20 GMT):<br/>
It's here - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0030-sync-connection
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 22:36:50 GMT):<br/>
The aries-rfc repo has many specs about aries that enables interop.
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 22:41:09 GMT):<br/>
ah thank you, I'll read it over and maybe think of a different approach for my user connections
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 22:59:36 GMT):<br/>
FYI - this is the did:peer spec that will be the basis of pairwise DIDs.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 12:58:14 GMT):<br/>
@Zohaib_Sohail, How did you start the Indy Pool inside your VM?  Are you using [von-network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network)?  If so you may have to follow the [Running the Network on a VPS](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network#running-the-network-on-a-vps) instructions and expose the ledger network on the VM's external IP, otherwise it will be running on `http://localhost:9000` and be inaccessible to external agents.  On the agent side you'll need to point it at VM's IP.
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 16:37:29 GMT):<br/>
Great, thanks for your suggestions - @TelegramSam & @swcurran. It's a good idea to write a demo controller in nodejs which talks to the ACA-Py agent.

current revokation status should still be checked though, right? It may be revoked due to an error in the issuance process where invalid data was used in the claim(s)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 18:19:44 GMT):<br/>
That's a business decision you would make as a verifier.  How fresh does the revocation check have to be in the proof?

I have gotten a 307 when I mixed up the txn file being used by the agent. In my case I had 4 nodes in the file, but only three running.

During wallet query could there be pagination for the credentials? as i checked the implementation seems to not have it
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 28 Jul 2019 15:59:06 GMT):<br/>
What would your use case be?
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 28 Jul 2019 16:00:37 GMT):<br/>
For individuals it’s likely there will be very few credentials that satisfy a presentation request 

For credential registry use case such as our OrgBook BC implementation there is a query language to narrow down search results from wallet

Hi guys, I am having problems running the Aries Cloud Agent. I have tried to install the libsodium library in several ways, but I still get the same error logs: `Traceback (most recent call last):

What are the ways you've tried installing libsodium? What version of ubuntu are you running?
</p>
<p><strong>lucafra</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:06:14 GMT):<br/>
Hi dbluhm, thank you for your answer, i had a slip in getting the right libsodium for my ubuntu 18.04. It was probably my fault on getting the right binary, thanks for the help!

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 15:57:23 GMT):<br/>
So ... it depends on what layer you are contemplating the query from. If it is from the API / web app level then it is a question of configuration of the SOLR index and web app. If you are thinking about the lower layers at the Indy SDK or Aries Cloud Agent layers .. that is a different question that some of the developers can tackle ... https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0050-wallets/README.md is a helpful doc

<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 16:36:58 GMT):<br/>
I have been exercising the aca-py CLI agent. I am confused about the difference in purpose of the inbound transport and the endpoint. Could someone care to  explain in more detail?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 17:00:21 GMT):<br/>
Hi Sam – the inbound transports define what address and port to bind to, but the endpoint is the URL used by an external client to connect to the service. It may use a resolvable domain name instead of an IP address, and the port number or path could be different due to request forwarding. At the moment only one endpoint is supported (added to the DIDDoc sent in a connection request/response)

Hi all, I'm looking into setting up a routing agent so other agents can change ports and still be connected through the routing agent. Before I get started, I wanted to ask if there's any existing support in aca-py for creating a routing agent (ie, special flags or combination of flags, etc)

You can plug in a different seed and register it using the form on the ledger page

Yes
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:05:17 GMT):<br/>
The inbound transport is how to physically reach the agent.  The endpoint is what the agent will put into a DIDDoc to tell other agents how to reach it.  Those could be the same thing if the agent is directly connecting to other agents.  However, if the agent is using a routing agent, those would be different things - the endpoint would be how another agent (owned by another entity) would send message to this agent.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:05:40 GMT):<br/>
What @andrew.whitehead said :-)
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:06:00 GMT):<br/>
So if I don't supply and endpoint is it the same as the inbound transport?. To be more specific. I have agents and ledger nodes. When do agents use the endpoint vs the inbound transport. Likewise for ledger nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:06:50 GMT):<br/>
now it gave me this error

So invites etc can all use the inbound transport. Only when I do routing do I need the endpoint so that it can be different than the inbound if needed?

register from seed
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:23:32 GMT):<br/>
okay and what are you inputting into the form
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:24:14 GMT):<br/>
the seed value as 00000000000000000000000000041234 and the DID as RfypwYjJtEsohYsAVVoZL2 which is generated by the code
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:24:38 GMT):<br/>
try just regestering the seed, you dont need to register the did
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:25:18 GMT):<br/>
sure, then how can i tell the docker-compose to use the generated DID 
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:28:48 GMT):<br/>
I think the same seed will generate the same DID every time. if you use a seed that is hardcoded into your docker-compose, if will be linked to the corresponding DID that is also hardcoded into your docker-compose
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:29:54 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately when i supply a new seed it generates a DID for the agent
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:30:32 GMT):<br/>
it is possible to highlight where exactly can i hardcode the DID
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:31:11 GMT):<br/>
yes new seeds will generate new DIDs but old seeds will generate the same DIDs

You might use `-it http 127.0.0.1 5000 -endpoint http://127.0.0.1:5000` for instance

<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:42:02 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:42:10 GMT):<br/>
so what you saying is that 
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:42:37 GMT):<br/>
i supply a new seed and do a ./manage rm and register the seed on the portal 
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:42:43 GMT):<br/>
also supply a new wallet name
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:42:47 GMT):<br/>
and then run the agent
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:44:20 GMT):<br/>
you might not have to do all those steps, but for now just to be safe yes, that's what I would do 
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:44:45 GMT):<br/>
ok doing them and let you know of what happened
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:45:06 GMT):<br/>
sounds good, goodluck :thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:45:25 GMT):<br/>
should i register the seed with a role?
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:45:38 GMT):<br/>
the default role works fine
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:45:53 GMT):<br/>
which is trust anchor
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:45:58 GMT):<br/>
great
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:47:55 GMT):<br/>
great! so if alice, and faber are connected to the routing agent's endpoint and alice wants to send a message to faber through the routing agent, would I have to create some sort of script so that the routing agent will automatically send alice's message to faber and vice versa? or it there a more elegant solution.
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:48:40 GMT):<br/>
so, with all the steps done, it initialized the agent pretty well with the new registered seed, created the schema and the cred_def_id
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:48:53 GMT):<br/>
but then again it gave the error
</p>

<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:52:35 GMT):<br/>
Looks lit its trying to use SSL. Does that mean its requires https?  Is that an undocumented feature or a bug?
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:53:03 GMT):<br/>
This is an invitation receipt when the bug occurs
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:55:55 GMT):<br/>
unfortunatly I'm not an aries developer so I'm not familiar with the email-verification service because I haven't used it in my project. Maybe @andrew.whitehead @swcurran can help you
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:56:33 GMT):<br/>
You would need to substitute your real IP address. For the inbound transport you can use 0.0.0.0 to bind on all addresses, partly why we need to support both options
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:56:56 GMT):<br/>
I really appriaciate your help. many thanks. waiting for then to reply
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:57:54 GMT):<br/>
I don't know what's going on there. You say it published the schema and cred def, but it's failing while trying to publish the schema. Is this a second run?
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:58:13 GMT):<br/>
seems so
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:58:27 GMT):<br/>
should i post the whole log
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:58:42 GMT):<br/>
So what it listens for on the endpoint is the same as the inbound transport. It goes into the same workflow for messages?  But you need an externalbly addressable endpoint for invitations and routing?
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:58:54 GMT):<br/>
So is the SSL a bug?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:59:04 GMT):<br/>
If you remove the wallet in between but keep the same seed, then it won't have a local copy of the schema and will try to publish it again. That should produce a duplicate schema error though, not this one
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:59:38 GMT):<br/>
it says action forbidden
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:59:53 GMT):<br/>
No it just says ssl:None, as in none is enabled
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 19:14:09 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure. It looks like the verifier service tries to register the schema again, maybe because the django cache was lost for some reason. Could be a bug in the deployment.
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 19:14:25 GMT):<br/>
I have a quick question similar to @smithsamuelm 's question. Can multiple agents use the same endpoint so long as they have different inbound transports? or does each agent need their own unique endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 19:15:16 GMT):<br/>
ok...any suggestions on what can be done?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 19:17:24 GMT):<br/>
Not at the moment. I see you already filed an issue. The service isn't under active development but hopefully somebody can try to reproduce it
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 19:17:58 GMT):<br/>

There's an example in the demos if you run the performance demo with --routing. Basically Alice would form a connection with the routing agent, then receive an invitation from Faber, without accepting it. The admin method /connections/{conn_id}/establish_inbound/{router_conn_id} is used to make the Faber-Router connection the inbound route for that new invitation. Then when the invitation is accepted, the DIDDoc that is generated in the connection request will reflect the route through the routing agent, which will automatically forward messages to Faber

@andrew.whitehead   Maybe you can see what I am doing wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:24:51 GMT):<br/>
I have two agents running with aca-py.  The first one Leo is run with this command line invocation:
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:24:55 GMT):<br/>
$ aca-py --inbound-transport http 0.0.0.0 8100 \
         --outbound-transport http \
         --log-level debug \
         --endpoint https://localhost:8110 \
         --label leo \
         --genesis-url http://localhost:9000/genesis \
         --admin 0.0.0.0 8150 --admin-insecure-mode \
         --public-invites \
         --auto-accept-invites \
         --auto-accept-requests \
         --auto-ping-connection \
         --auto-respond-messages \
         --invite
         
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:25:50 GMT):<br/>
I am able to see the swagger interface on 8150 and use POST /connections/create-invitation to create an invitation.
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:26:05 GMT):<br/>

{
    "@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/connections/1.0/invitation",
    "@id": "95570169-2cfb-4f00-be68-a3c456d52a6e",

    "recipientKeys": [

    ]
  }
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:26:33 GMT):<br/>
I then go to Zoe which is another aca-py CLI created with this invocation:
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:26:47 GMT):<br/>
$ aca-py --inbound-transport http 0.0.0.0 8200 \
         --outbound-transport http \
         --log-level debug \
         --endpoint https://localhost:8210 \
         --label zoe \
         --genesis-url http://localhost:9000/genesis \
         --admin 0.0.0.0 8250 --admin-insecure-mode \
         --public-invites \
         --auto-accept-invites \
         --auto-accept-requests \
         --auto-ping-connection \
         --auto-respond-messages \
         --invite
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:28:01 GMT):<br/>
Leo seems to have https in the endpoint in the invocation, but not in the invite. Zoe has 8200 for the inbound port but 8210 for the endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:29:43 GMT):<br/>
I then use the swagger interface to POST /connections/receive-invitation   I get the following error in the console for Zoe.

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:31:59 GMT):<br/>
Actually Leo is bound to 8100 but has 8110 in the endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:32:28 GMT):<br/>
So the endpoint and the inbound transport have to be the same port?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:32:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:33:13 GMT):<br/>
OK that would be a good constraint to document in the aca-py docs.

<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 21:12:51 GMT):<br/>
one clarification. The connection id for the same connection is different on each of the agent's  IE Zoe's connection id is not the same as Leo's connection id for the same connection?
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 21:13:06 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead 
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 21:14:33 GMT):<br/>
That's right, each agent randomly generates it. It's the key when the record is stored in non-secrets

<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 21:17:15 GMT):<br/>
One more thing. the command line option --invite generates an invite URL that it prints to the console. How would I used that?

use
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 21:20:13 GMT):<br/>
The controller would have to base64-decode the c_i query parameter and post the contents to the connections/receive-invitation endpoint as the request body

How would I go about getting on the calendar invite list for the morning WG call?
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 21:36:35 GMT):<br/>

1) Register a public DID and store it on the ledger.
</p>

<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 21:37:21 GMT):<br/>
But it appears that there is no endpoint in aca-py to register a did but the faber agent demo does that so how should I do that using the agent?

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 21:39:02 GMT):<br/>
That depends on the ledger. For von-network it's easy, there's a form on the index page (at localhost:9000) or a REST API. For the sovrin test networks you'd have to send an email

<p><strong>rchristman</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 00:15:00 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm in aries_staticagent why is there a route_def decorator in the Module base class? I see the dispatcher has route and flavors of route_module. They make sense, but I can't figure out what Module \@route_def does.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 00:40:51 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries?msg=84vDByJbZqxgnPJaT) @rchristman That decorator allows you to explicitly define routes inside of a module. Look at tests/test_module.py (I believe that's the path...) for an example of its usage
</p>
<p><strong>rchristman</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 00:45:43 GMT):<br/>
I see \@route_def in test_module_routing_explicit_def. Why do you want to do that? I'm missing something basic here, it seems.

Hi all, question about query in aca-py the example inputs in a credential as follows: "results": [
    {
      "referent": "5e3e2521-99bf-4f30-849f-0d2f23e861af",
      "attrs": {
        "age": "24",
        "name": "Alice Smith",
        "date": "2018-05-28",
        "degree": "Maths"
      },
      "schema_id": "FR4ZXVDup5giwift49JtFr:2:degree schema:84.58.33",
      "cred_def_id": "FR4ZXVDup5giwift49JtFr:3:CL:8:default",
      "rev_reg_id": null,
      "cred_rev_id": null
    }
  ]; 
how do i write a wql to fire into the api provided "GET /credentials" to get all credentials with { "degree" : "Maths" }

I tried to put directly `{ "degree" : "Maths" }`  and ` { "attr" { "degree" : "Maths" } }` but seems to be no avail, i could however query the "schema_id" at the level 1 json attributes

Use case example: Entities issuing credential to people with a designated wallet only accessible with a "Private key" to store and present credential for verification; Further, a verifier can verify the authenticity of credentials from specific users. is this use case currently feasible with Aries or Indy SDK? Side note:  As I am aware with the concepts of VON & ORgBook. It won't work for this use case.

oh, `{"attr::degree::value": "Maths"}` works what about for.. `{ "attr::degree::value": { "$like":"M%" } }` i tried this and saw the code based on the same file you sent
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 06:58:35 GMT):<br/>
I think that would only work for unencrypted tags. At the moment all the schema attributes are encrypted

I was trying to create multiple users in indy... 
but somehow all the users that I create with my code has same DID and Key.
I'm not able to understand why is this happening.

hi @Shubham-koli I am not an expert at this. But if I have to make a guess I would say its because your seed is constant. Try to randomise your seed

Sorry, I seem to have pointed you to the wrong file. Here's where I was actually thinking of: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-staticagent-python/blob/master/tests/test_dispatcher.py#L28-L74
</p>
<p><strong>rchristman</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:43:01 GMT):<br/>
Thanks! I think I need to run these tests in the debugger to understand how they work. A README page for the tests would be helpful, which I could write if you point me in the right direction. How do you usually run the tests? I'm guessing you pull the test module into the Python interpreter and type the method/function name in at the command line. 
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:45:24 GMT):<br/>
With the most recent updates I made, you can install test dependencies by creating a virtual environment (you don't need another if you've already made one), activating it, then running `pip install -e .[test]`. Then you can run tests with a simple `pytest`.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:46:05 GMT):<br/>
If you already have `pytest` installed globally on your machine, you might be able to just run `pytest` without installing it locally into the virtual environment.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:46:28 GMT):<br/>
I alluded to doing this in the main README but we can probably make the instructions more explicit

Hi, I was reading https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/README.md and just starting to run the Alice/Faber Python demo. The "Running in a Browser" section has a link to "Play with VON" (http://play-with-von.vonx.io/). The instructions have 3 lines to put in the command-line. The problem is that after creating an instance in this "Play with VON", I can't run anything. There is no shell. I tried in both Chrome and Safari. 
</p>
<p><strong>gcsfred</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 18:29:18 GMT):<br/>
From the comment it appears that this "Play with VON" site is provided by the BC Gov. Does anyone know if the demo is broken?

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 19:08:44 GMT):<br/>
@gcsfred That's because a credential has to be issued first before it can be proven, although that probably shouldn't throw an exception
</p>
<p><strong>gcsfred</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 19:09:47 GMT):<br/>
But I issued the credential first, with option "1" before option "2". The instructions say
'When ready to test the credentials exchange protocols, go to the Faber prompt, enter "1" to send a credential, and then "2" to request a proof.'

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 19:12:12 GMT):<br/>

I get an error when using the aca-py with the --seed option. I need the --seed so it has a public did in order to create schema etc. on the ledger. Looks like a wallet problem.  This is the associated issue.  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/113    and here is a synopsis of the bug.

aca-py doesn't register DID's on the ledger so you need to register your DID in advance, before starting aca-py

If you are running von-network you can register your did using the ledger browser UI.

As workaround I want to try using the postgres wallet instead of the default (i assume in memory wallet)  The help does not have a full example.  If I start postgres with this
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:07:06 GMT):<br/>
$ docker run --name demo-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres -c 'log_statement=all' -c 'logging_collector=on' -c 'log_destination=stderr'
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:07:19 GMT):<br/>
Then how would I configure these options:
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:07:32 GMT):<br/>
--wallet-key ? \
--wallet-name ? \

</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:09:09 GMT):<br/>
@ianco  I did register it on the ledger first.  I think I may not understand the problem it might be just putting the DIDits creating from the seed into the wallet that is the problem.

Re postgres wallet, there's an example of a docker compose file that runs aca-py with a postgres wallet here:  https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst-issuer-controller/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml#L99
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:14:02 GMT):<br/>
The parameters are set in the `manage` script in the same directory:  https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst-issuer-controller/blob/master/docker/manage#L87

Hi all, I'm setting up credential presentation requests on my project. I saw the tutorial for setting up automatic presentation requests, but I want alice to be able to view the request and respond to it manually. I'm wondering what the manual flow is for the credential presentation exchange. I imagine alice uses "/presentation_exchange/{presentation_request_id}/send_presentation" after recieving a presentation request but I'm not sure what to input for "requested_attributes","self_attested_attributes", and "requested_predicates"

Check out the code here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/runners/alice.py#L99
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:16:03 GMT):<br/>
The query at line # 111 fetches credentials that match the requested proof, you just need to have Alice select what to present (in the demo it just grabs the first option I think)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:20:21 GMT):<br/>
Did you get the Alice/Faber demo workign?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:20:21 GMT):<br/>
Did you get the Alice/Faber demo working?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:20:30 GMT):<br/>
(running on your local?)
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:23:05 GMT):<br/>
Yes but not with aca-py. What I have been trying to do is use aca-py and repeat the alice-faber demo. but with aca-py instead of faber.py alice.py ie use open-api but with aca-py. So I need --seed to create credential and thats where aca-py breaks
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:24:11 GMT):<br/>
If the demo is working then you can check to see if there are any differences between what the demo is doing vs what you are doing
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:24:35 GMT):<br/>
The demo runs aca-py, it just runs it as a sub-process, so theoretically it should work the same as a separate process
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:25:05 GMT):<br/>
It sets up all the aca-py args here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/runners/support/agent.py#L142
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:25:32 GMT):<br/>
I understand but theoretically is where config differences or bugs get exposed.
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:25:43 GMT):<br/>
But thanks I will try some more.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:25:57 GMT):<br/>
... and then runs the aca-py process here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/runners/support/agent.py#L240

<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:27:57 GMT):<br/>
thanks! I'll give it a shot. 
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:29:55 GMT):<br/>
One of my reasons or reproducing demo but with aca-py is because that is the target architecture not the combined controller-agent that is faber.py.  So I am trying to build confidence that it works as aca-py.  
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:30:39 GMT):<br/>
It's running as a separate process in all of our docker-compose deployments
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:30:42 GMT):<br/>
The config for aca-py is explicit whereas faber.py its hard to track it down.
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:31:15 GMT):<br/>
So it must be a config problem? some subtle difference?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:31:28 GMT):<br/>
That would be my guess
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:31:37 GMT):<br/>
... although your config looked ok to me
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:32:48 GMT):<br/>
The docker-compose for credential registry is here:  https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst/tree/master/starter-kits/credential-registry/docker
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:33:15 GMT):<br/>
... and for an indy catalyst issuer is here:  https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst-issuer-controller/tree/master/docker
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:33:39 GMT):<br/>
both of these spin up aca-py in a separate docker container
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:34:27 GMT):<br/>
You can see the args passed to each instance of aca-py in the docker-compose script, you can compare that to the values you are supplying to see if there are any differences
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:37:41 GMT):<br/>
interesting difference is that when I run the faber demo agent with postgres it never complained about not finding libindystrgpostgres.dylib  but when I ran postgres config with aca-py it complained.
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 21:39:02 GMT):<br/>
anyway I will use the exact postgres config that faber.py is using see if that fixes it. The onlyu difference I see so far is the postgres user
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 22:51:11 GMT):<br/>
sounds like you're passing in a string and it's expecting a dict
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 22:58:23 GMT):<br/>
i'm using the swagger interface so it shouldn't be a string
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 22:59:36 GMT):<br/>
unless you mean that cred_id should be a dict?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 23:02:38 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure offhand what the format should be, but that error message indicates that you're indexing into a string with another string
</p>
<p><strong>wadeking98</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 23:18:00 GMT):<br/>
okay I got it, this is the proper json  {
  "requested_attributes": {"33159178-5263-4f7c-9ee0-f0a023c10633":{"cred_id":"7894ed38-0ac7-434b-95a6-439ac948e936", "revealed":true}},
  "self_attested_attributes": {},
  "requested_predicates": {}
} where the first hex string is the referent in the credential presentation request, and the second hex string is the referent of the credential in the wallet

Hi! Please someone explain what is the difference between `ack` and `trustping` messages. Does anyone use `ack` for what? Which one should be used for confirming connection? or for confirming proof?
</p>
<p><strong>uNmAnNeR</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 13:14:40 GMT):<br/>
And how client can backup a wallet in aries? I could not find anything on this topic. Please advise

</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 13:23:41 GMT):<br/>
`ack` is a general purpose acknowledgement message that can be mixed in to protocols rather than each protocol defining their own `ack` like message. `trustping` is for testing the liveness of the cryptographic connection between agents. At one point, we talked about using `trustping` to confirm connection establishment but I believe `ack` has superseded these original talks. It's valuable to note, however, that sending an `ack` message is not necessary if you intend to immediately send another message after connection like a presentation request or a discover-features message.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 13:25:03 GMT):<br/>
You'll have to clarify what you mean by backup a wallet into an agent
</p>
<p><strong>uNmAnNeR</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 13:26:52 GMT):<br/>
i mean export wallet (indy.exportWallet) and then store it somewhere in agent to be able to restore sometime later.
</p>
<p><strong>uNmAnNeR</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 13:27:29 GMT):<br/>
thanks, seems clear

The Aries Cloud Agent?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 13:58:53 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure the ACA-Py team has exposed that ability yet or not
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 13:59:20 GMT):<br/>
Good question for @andrew.whitehead 
</p>
<p><strong>uNmAnNeR</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 14:09:16 GMT):<br/>
i am interested in conception in general, ACA-Py is nice case though.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 14:14:13 GMT):<br/>
In general, I think wallet backup has ties to the DKMS work and maybe even DIF hubs. We could definitely use more discussion on that topic as I don't think we have much in the way of formal discussions on it yet. Exporting and importing a wallet is possible but that is focusing more on data portability than wallet backup, I think. On top of that, import and export have a few issues that need to be sorted out since independent agent implementations use the wallet slightly differently so export from one agent and importing in another may not work in some cases.

Question on message threading: How long does an agent have to hold onto threading information? As an example, say I sent a message 30 days ago with a message id of `12345` then that agent decides to respond today using the threading decorator:
```
{
  "@type": "whatever_message_type_in_response_to_my_message",
  "~thread": {
    "thid": 12345
  },
 "...": "..."
}
```

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 14:29:54 GMT):<br/>
Is there a threshold for how long I have to remember the context of that original message?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 14:31:32 GMT):<br/>
Is it acceptable for some agents to be more forgetful than others like a static agent vs a full agent?

Seems inflexible to make the assumption that controllers and the Aries agent code will communicate via HTTP
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 15:47:47 GMT):<br/>
Would be nice if the underlying agent library was a DLL that could be interacted with directly with the HTTP rest api built on top as an option for those that want to go that route
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 16:22:54 GMT):<br/>
I believe websockets and HTTP are currently supported in ACA-Py ... our use case is for deployment in the government enterprise ... and so an HTTP transport lowers the barrier to adoption by our sometimes (often) older services 
This is if I understood your question correctly
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 17:31:50 GMT):<br/>
My go to, at least for a new application would be to embed the Aries logic as a DLL that directly integrates with the controller
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 17:32:19 GMT):<br/>
So the assumption that the Aries logic runs as a separate process with HTTP communication to the controller seems very limiting
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 17:53:07 GMT):<br/>
aries-cloudagent-python is just one instance of an Aries agent.  There are others in development, possibly one that will provide the Agent services as a DLL.  VCX for example loads as a shared library, and is in the process if being updated to support interoperability with other Aries agents
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 17:53:42 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 18:01:23 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 18:01:32 GMT):<br/>
Everything is moving so fast right now that it is difficult
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 18:02:23 GMT):<br/>
Building an agent for JavaScript / TypeScript that can be embedded into a controller would be one of my specific interests
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 19:07:48 GMT):<br/>
My $0.02CDN is that it a DIDComm protocol needs to be defined that will support this.  To date, I think the Indy support for the wallet is weak and that will need to be improved as the basis for the protocol.  Agree that the DIF sync-ing protocol could help, as at minimum, we'll need incremental backups vs. periodic full backups.

A good topic to dive into!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 19:17:26 GMT):<br/>
@joshgraber the `agent-framework` open source project from Streetcred is based on dotnet and can be embedded, so is more aligned with what you want. As well, the in development `aries-framework-go` is also intended to work in the way you are thinking about it.

<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 19:18:26 GMT):<br/>
Do you know who is heading up work on the JS agent? In the working group recordings it seemed like perhaps it was @kdenhartog ?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 19:55:39 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog was heading up those discussions initially at least. There was at least one call he organized but I'm not sure if there has been much beyond that recently.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 19:59:32 GMT):<br/>
There has been some "agent-y" work going on in javascript in the form of the Aries Toolbox @TelegramSam has been working on and recently I transferred ownership to DIF of a library I wrote that makes static agents in JS possible. There has been some conversation about that library in DIF from what I gather but aside from those efforts, I haven't heard much from those interested in a JS Agent framework as of late.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 20:01:30 GMT):<br/>
If heading up that work is something you're interested in, I and I'm sure others in the Aries community would be happy to provide support
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 20:11:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to spend some time exploring the .net and python repositories first
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 20:12:19 GMT):<br/>
I haven't been able to make it to any of the Aries working group meetings at this point... the time/day consistently doesn't work well for me unfortunately
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 20:12:39 GMT):<br/>
I've been working to get caught up on past working group meetings, but there are a lot of them to go through :grinning: 
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:04:43 GMT):<br/>
Is there a working list of protocols and messages somewhere?
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:05:03 GMT):<br/>
This information seems to be pretty distributed in a lot of places, very difficult to see what types of protocols have been proposed.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:05:39 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/index.md
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:06:30 GMT):<br/>
But those RFCs point to many concepts, with a large number of them having nothing to do with protocols, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:07:21 GMT):<br/>
Weeding through every RFC to determine what protocols have been accepted and / or proposed is tedious. But I should be going through these protocols anyway I guess...
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:07:52 GMT):<br/>
I wouldn't say "nothing to do with protocols" necessarily; the RFCs not explicitly defining a protocol still tend to contain information vital to successfully implementing an agent and understanding how an agent functions
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:08:17 GMT):<br/>
Having some way to distinguish which RFCs do define a protocol would be good though, I agree
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:08:24 GMT):<br/>
My point is that we will want a complete list of accepted protocols
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:08:32 GMT):<br/>
Right, we don't disagree
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:08:51 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman can we incorporate this into your updates to the indexer?
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:08:54 GMT):<br/>
Not sure where this should live, but work in progress
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:09:01 GMT):<br/>
Oh, that's a good idea
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:09:24 GMT):<br/>
Or perhaps add to the hyperledger wiki once we have protocols that move to adopted
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:10:30 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm , absolutely I can make the updated indexer expose this info better. I'll have a proposed update by EOD.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:11:18 GMT):<br/>
@joshgraber I proposed that the names of folder for RFCs should include the word "protocol" if they defined a protocol. Nobody commented one way or another. Maybe I'll push that a bit more. That would make some things a bit easier and more consistent.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:15:04 GMT):<br/>
Having info in the wiki could be a good idea though I do worry about it lagging behind or in general not being updated. The indexer is built into the RFC process at least.
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 23:05:57 GMT):<br/>
Big fan! :grinning: Thank you for jumping on this, much appreciated!
</p>
<p><strong>joshgraber</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 23:06:44 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, that's a good point. An automated system with the indexer would be more ideal
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 23:23:37 GMT):<br/>
It definitely should be with the indexer. Daniel is improving it right now to add (I think) the name and status, but more things could be added - feature/concept flags, etc.

My $0.02 on a JS framework.  I think it's of questionable value. I think once you have either an embedded (DLL-like) library (e.g. go-framework) or an HTTP cloudagent (e.g. aca-py) then you can use those to build controller logic in JS. 

In other words - the cloudagent/framework code does not have to be in JS and unless you are building the cloudagent/framework what it is implemented in.

There are a few potential advantages to JavaScript, but only time will tell. Primarily it would be around ReactNative and/or the feasibility of wrapping the go library into a mobile application.

Hello everyone. Could somebody explain correct behaviour for Propose Presentation message in 0037 doc? 
AFAIK this message belongs to case when Prover want to initiate verification process with verifier or
on response of verifier want to say: "Yeah, I saw you proof request and Im sure that I do not have attributes that you require, but I have different attributes that may suite you"

Additional question why in Propose Presentation message you have changed the format to https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof#presentation-preview
instead of using 
```
{
     "name": string,
     "version": string,
     "nonce": string,
     "requested_attributes": {

It's a long weekend in Canada, so the team will be looking at these tomorrow.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 17:37:59 GMT):<br/>
Not sure what you mean with this, but guessing it is this. Currently, the aca webhook fires on every event, notifying the controller. There is a short cut implemented with the "issue credential" via an extra endpoint (/send) where the controller says to the agent ("hey - you handle the back and forth on sending the credential and let me know when you are done"), but that is optional.  The controller could start with "offer credential" (/offer_credential) and handle each event in the process.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 17:40:23 GMT):<br/>
The ACA team is off today - holiday in Canada.  Someone one will check this tomorrow and get back to you.  In the meantime, could you provide a bit of info on how you are running the demo?  Are you using docker or running native on your platform?  If native, what platform are you on?

Thanks

<p><strong>Rick</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 17:47:09 GMT):<br/>
I'm running it on docker. sws: Docker Engine 19.03.1 , Python 3.7.3 , macOS Mojave 10.14.6.
i tried to connect to the swagger api via docker curl it seems to be able to respond too, not sure why it can't get the response.

<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 19:59:30 GMT):<br/>
Anyone, is there an RFC pertaining to an issuer notifying a holder that a credential has been revoked?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 21:15:41 GMT):<br/>
There is no RFC about that, but we've proposed that the "Credential Offer" be updated to include data to reflect that the offer is being made because the holder's credential of this type, from this issuer has been revoked.  This would then serve as the notification to the holder that their credential has been revoked.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 21:16:24 GMT):<br/>
There are some updates happening to 0036 (issue-credential) and once those are done, we're going to submit that as a new version.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 21:16:55 GMT):<br/>
Or maybe it should be included as part of the 1.0 vs. 1.1?
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 21:17:31 GMT):<br/>
It seems that we should have a separate revoke message so that it can be revoked w/o issuing a new one, right?
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 21:18:11 GMT):<br/>
I mean, notification that it has been revoked that is w/o issuing a new one
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 21:18:46 GMT):<br/>
True.  I think in practice I would expect that to be rare, but you are right, it would have to be covered.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 07:45:56 GMT):<br/>
I did some work to improve the indexing script. It's substantially cleaner and more useful. It counts and reports/hyperlinks implementations for each indexed item in the new impl section that swcurran added. It also shows the last status date of each RFC, so we can see what's stalled. And it supports tagging. I have defined and used 4 tags so far; you'll see them when you go look at the latest version of /index.md. 

I went in and added links to implementations for a number of RFCs. They are definitely incomplete/imperfect, but even so, it is very encouraging to see how much real progress we've made that we just weren't giving ourselves credit for. This change caused a number of RFCs to move from PROPOSED to DEMONSTRATED status. I went ahead and merged those changes, because this status change is not controversial; it's just a reflection of us having data about impl code. Many of the things that are now in DEMONSTRATED status should probably be in ACCEPTED status instead, but that's a more controversial move and one that I think others might want to advocate.

Please note: I also added a new unit test that is picky about the metadata at the top of each RFC. Your PRs won't pass unless you follow the format. To find out if you're following the format, run pytest code from the root of the repo.

Hi All, is there already an idea for a timeline in which code for Mobile/Edge Agents will be provided? It seems the only Agent resources available are concerning Aries, which does not work on edge/mobile devices. If I needed to implement and edge Agent now, do you guys have some suggestions on how to bootstrap it? Thanks

<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 15:47:37 GMT):<br/>
I have the same question as @lucafra. Which is the right repository to start developing an edge agent that will be compatible with the aca-py? Is it the [agent-framework](https://github.com/streetcred-id/agent-framework)?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 16:15:16 GMT):<br/>
agent framework is used by osma, and is a good starting place. You can also implement the protocols natively though that is a substantially larger engineering effort.

hello everyone, i'm tring to send a credential presentation request and I would like to filter the credentials by "type" (a field I added into attributes) instead of by "cred_def_id". Here's what I have so far for the presentation request json: ```
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "connection_id": "535c72fe-ea99-400a-b280-b909ef67b408",
  "name": "proof of immunization",
  "requested_predicates": {},
  "requested_attributes": [
    {
      "restrictions": [
        {"attrs":{"type":"imm"}}
      ],
      "name": "imm_name"
    }
  ]
}
```  but no credentials match the filter. I figure it's because "attrs" contains "type":"imm" but it does not equal {"type":"imm"} because it also contains "imm_name", "imm_id", etc and therefore will not match the filter. is there any way to filter by object attributes like "type" without including the rest of the attributes like "imm_name", etc?

But it states that "master: Could not introduce github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go@master, as its subpackage github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go does not contain usable Go code". Is it already usable? If yes, how can I import it into an existing project?

Hi everyone, we just started to run our own Aries agent, and we were wondering if aries agent is capable to accept connection invitations from Evernym agent?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:21:39 GMT):<br/>
As far as I know, the two are currently not compatible but the Evernym team is working on bringing their agent solutions up to Aries spec.

Are there currently any protocols in place for interacting with a steward to publish a public DID document to the ledger, for an issuer for instance?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 17:42:15 GMT):<br/>
I've been waiting for that to come up...using DIDComm to talk to the ledger.  Not happening yet, but I think it should...

- support for the Transaction Author Agreement (TAA) necessary for anyone deploying to Sovrin
- reorganization of the command line parameters to enable separate initialization parameters from operational
- timeout handling improvements based on feedback from users (thanks!)
- some demo handling cleanups based on feedback from users (thanks!)
- support for using public DIDs during the connection process.

sounds good.
you're using vendoring via toml files.. that should be ok, but you can upgrade to use go mod instead, you don't need a local vendor folder with go mod ... but if you wanna stick to vendoring, as long as it works and you can reference the project, you should be fine

E.g. setup a connection to a resolver URL (see for example https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/tree/master/resolver/java)?

We haven't built additional DID resolver methods into the project yet (we recently kicked off the Aries Framework Go project, and we started with the Peer DID implementation). I made note of the feature request to support DID resolution via the universal resolver Web API: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/issues/86.

Hi, looking in the aca-py, I would like to ask if a cloud agent is supposed to have a wallet. Since it is not an edge agent, I understand that it is just a data relay to other agents and ledgers. So what is the purpose of a wallet here? Is it storing the exact same private data as an edge agent?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 16:51:43 GMT):<br/>
Many of the uses cases targeted by ACA-Py at the present time are enterprise oriented. In the case of an organization-representing agent, the "cloud" agent holding the keys and credentials of the organization makes sense. Cloud Agents would also still need to maintain keys and relationships even in the case that it is not used as the main agent of an individual or organization. For example, if a cloud agent is operating as a moderator for the edge agent running on my phone, my edge agent and the cloud agent providing that service have a relationship with keys and potentially credentials associated with it.

So the cloud agent wallet does not store the same data as the edge agent and I would say it is discouraged to ever duplicate private keys or other secrets. Using the Indy-SDK, this is in fact not possible by design.
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 19:17:02 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the answer! 
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 19:47:24 GMT):<br/>
Another question is: can an aries cloud agent represent an enterprise/organization/company and at the same time be the relay for another edge agent of an end-user?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 19:49:19 GMT):<br/>
I don't think there is anything technically preventing that. Whether it's advisable in terms of allocating the appropriate resources to the agent and having a good separation of concerns etc may be another question.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 19:50:59 GMT):<br/>
I can imagine, for instance, that there may one day be an agent that is optimized for being a mediator. Given those optimizations, it may no longer be the ideal candidate for an enterprise agent. I can also imagine the reverse case where one agent implementation is optimized for representing an org and isn't particularly great at efficient routing or something.

I'm not familiar enough with react to understand the tradeoffs you'd be encountering picking one over the other. However I can say that when I tried using Java/Obj-C libraries as a bridge to build a PoC flutter app the solution felt very slow.

"Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) is a foundation for building decentralized identity applications and services running in non-mobile environments."
Is there a mobile Python-based Aries SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:29:11 GMT):<br/>
There is no mobile python-based Aries Agent. As far as I can tell, creating a python-based mobile app for Aries would be quite complicated and one appearing in the future somewhat unlikely due to iOS and Android devices being locked in to their respective Objective-C/Swift and Java/Kotlin ecosystems. However, there are significant efforts within the community to create mobile apps using frameworks like Xamarin and react native and a vanilla iOS or Android app is also possible.
</p>
<p><strong>gcsfred</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:36:22 GMT):<br/>
Ok. It's nice that there are people creating mobile apps. However, if I'm going to create Aries apps, it would be nice to start with an SDK, instead of just RFCs...

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:40:15 GMT):<br/>
Yep, we agree :slight_smile: the creation/migration of the Aries SDK is actively underway and you're welcome to join the efforts. Even prior to the official release of an Aries SDK, however, using one of the frameworks like the dotnet agent framework (https://github.com/streetcred-id/agent-framework) or starting with an app like OSMA (https://github.com/mattrglobal/osma) are viable options.
</p>
<p><strong>gcsfred</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:41:01 GMT):<br/>
Interesting. That's good to know.
</p>
<p><strong>gcsfred</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:42:27 GMT):<br/>
Is there anything non-.NET by any chance? Any open source mobile Aries agent?
</p>
<p><strong>gcsfred</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:44:33 GMT):<br/>
The same questions go to Indy. Is there any mobile Indy SDK by any chance?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:45:47 GMT):<br/>
At the moment, the OSMA is the most developed Aries compatible agent in the open having been graciously open sourced by the Mattr team. I'm not aware of any other open source mobile agents right now.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:47:02 GMT):<br/>
The Indy SDK is available for iOS and Android though I'm not the best one to ask for details. The Indy SDK is the basis for the agent framework.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 22:35:46 GMT):<br/>
@ptab-pawan I also lack experience here, but would only recommend using lib-vcx if in contact and coordination with Evernym so as to be ready for planned changes to that library as it moves (or doesn't move) to Aries.

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 12:06:06 GMT):<br/>
@gcsfred Agent Framework for dotnet (and all other wrappers) use Indy SDK static library for iOS and Android to invoke Indy methods and actions. Indy SDK itself only provides static libraries for all platforms, but relies on wrappers and application frameworks to call them. .NET core is entirely open-source, as well as the agent framework stack, all the way through Indy SDK.

<p><strong>ptab-pawan</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 13:23:28 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm @tomislav  : from the converstations  with @TelegramSam  and @cam-parra  still there seems 2 approaches for react native mobile app :indy-sdk - npm and libIndy wrappers.  libVCX is out of question as no wrapper for iOS. Any point of contact who has  tried indy in react native. Want to know which is the faster and better approach.

<p><strong>ptab-pawan</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 13:31:36 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm  : thanks . Just curious to know how  is connect.me different from https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-connector-preview 
</p>
<p><strong>ptab-pawan</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 13:34:52 GMT):<br/>
@jakubkoci : https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/connector-app#run-ios-on-device is dependent on contributor.   who is the active contributor to connect for these steps?  
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 13:38:05 GMT):<br/>
I guess it is. I think connector-preview is predcessor of connector-app (the same, but older version, before Evernym donated it to Sovrin. Connect.me diverged from that repo and continue as proprietary solution, developed only by Evernym.
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 13:45:26 GMT):<br/>
As you can see from commits there is no active development around this repo, so I don't know who is the right person to contact. I work for Absa and we developed our own version of mobile app in React Native (we started before connector-app code was available). It would be great to have open-source solution in RN, or at least wrappers around Aries/Indy. 
</p>
<p><strong>ptab-pawan</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 13:46:47 GMT):<br/>
So what was your approach. Is your solution mature to be opensourced? 
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 14:05:33 GMT):<br/>
We're currently using libvcx on both Android and iOS. Its maturity is close to be open-sourced. But 
1. We have some custom part/module for our specific use cases
2. There can be some legal stuff to be done before open sourcing. 
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 14:07:34 GMT):<br/>
There are also other questions/issues, highly related to your questions/list in the main thread. We don't know whether to continue with vcx or return back to pure indy sdk with potentialy new aries-js-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 14:11:52 GMT):<br/>
To be honest, I'm not sure how to approach it now. I would be glad if we open-sourced that, because we could potentially move faster and build better solution togheter with other participants. On the other hand, open-sourcing would require some effort for our small team and we need to handle that together with other our business priorities.

Hi Aries team: I am thinking of proposing a new RFC for "Biometric Service Provider" (BSP) based on a white paper that we worked on with Daniel and Lovesh at Evernym.  Daniel sent me the guidelines for RFCs and it suggests to pick a folder (concept, feature, etc.).  Where would people suggest I put it?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 15:37:47 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like a concept, unless you are proposing a concrete protocol or decorator.  I suspect from the sounds of the topic, it would go with concepts.

With the creation of the Aries project, we have been discussing the future architecture of the Indy SDK. Lots of it will move to Aries, leaving behind the Indy resolver. We haven't seen a lot of collaborative development on LibVCX, so it is likely to be deprecated instead of moving from Indy to Aries. People who need a long term support path for LibVCX should contact Evernym, who are continuing development for their customers.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 03:06:37 GMT):<br/>
No one has volunteered to update the Sovrin Connector App, but it could be updated to use the latest LibVCX and work against ACA-py without too much effort. The bigger lift will be modifying LibVCX to use the current Aries protocols, as it is based on the original credential exchange format and hasn't kept pace with the Aries standardization process.

I had a brief foray into genome data as part of the Blinding Identity Taxonomy (BIT) initiative.

</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 22:17:02 GMT):<br/>
DID Documents allow for specifying multiple service endpoints; I don't think anyone's been pushing for having only one endpoint but there also hasn't been lots of conversation about having multiple endpoints. I think this was recently brought up by @TelegramSam as a gap that needs filling. I believe he resolved to write up an RFC that filled out some of the thinking around multiple endpoints and other transport topics.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 22:18:30 GMT):<br/>
Many here are likely interested in wallets and how they are used in aries agents. #aries-sdk might be another good channel for a wallet discussion.
</p>
<p><strong>SteveMagennis</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 22:22:05 GMT):<br/>
i get the concept that a DID doc can spec multiple service endpoints, my question is from the service side. in particular, for example could aliases exist that would resolve to a single particular agent
</p>
<p><strong>SteveMagennis</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 22:22:39 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 22:30:55 GMT):<br/>
Is your interest just in the Indy term for wallets (aka secure storage of DID keys and credentials) or in the industry term - e.g. an agent-y type thing that runs on your device (usually mobile) and lets you store and use things?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 22:32:45 GMT):<br/>
I think the answer is yes. On the one hand, your agent will construct a did:peer DID/DIDDoc for every contact you have, and you could put have different paths in different DID/DIDDoc instances that lead to the same agent.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 22:34:30 GMT):<br/>
On the other hand, you could have multiple keys/service endpoints within a single DID/DIDDoc that you share that actually lead back to the same agent.  The recipient of the DID/DIDDoc would have no way to know.

The challenge is of course the user experience for that.  What triggers the entries to be put into the DIDDoc in that way.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 22:35:56 GMT):<br/>
So short answer - technically possible. Not clear on why you would do that. Once that is defined, how you trigger that might be easier to understand.
</p>
<p><strong>SteveMagennis</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 22:43:34 GMT):<br/>
let me re-read the protocol and make sure I'm asking the right question...

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 23:20:52 GMT):<br/>
Release 0.3.1 of aries-cloudagent-python is now available in github and pypi. This is (mostly) a cleanup release (TAA tweaks - thanks to the community) but with a couple of new features.

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.3.1

https://pypi.org/project/aries-cloudagent/0.3.1/
</p>
<p><strong>SteveMagennis</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 23:43:56 GMT):<br/>
Let’s say I have 3 public DID’s that I use to represent a personal persona, a work persona and a hobby persona. Let’s also say that the DID Docs associated with each persona expose the same collection of services with the same serviceEndpoints. In theory since all of these DIDs are public, someone could correlate my personas by matching endpoints. Not sure this would be a problem IRL, maybe a corporation wouldn’t want people to correlate a budget brand with a premium brand or something like that. Mostly it was nagging me and I wanted to make sure I was thinking about things correctly.
</p>
<p><strong>SteveMagennis</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 23:45:57 GMT):<br/>
probably the later. In thinking about how agents use wallets it quickly exploded into much more than keys and credentials.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:38:25 GMT):<br/>
The simple answer to your question is that they could have non-correlating endpoints. For example, each could have the endpoint "https://agents-r-us.com" that would be the end point for you and all of Agents-R-Us's clients (aka "lost in the crowd" or "herd privacy"). WIthin the Agents-R-Us agency, you would configure a unique route for each DID that would lead to the same agent. No one reading the DIDDoc could correlate the three DIDs. This is described in the (I think) DIDDoc Conventions RFC.

In the current vision, unless each of your persona needed to issue credentials, they would not need to have a public DID at all, but that might change. Or there might be a good reason to support credential issuance for each persona - for example, delegation of authority.  In that case, you might have many issuing DIDs, all seemingly independent, and all leading back to your agent.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 16 Aug 2019 20:32:17 GMT):<br/>
For did-exchange, we will likely just add did-exchange as a new protocol with it's own set of admin endpoints. Likely the same ones that are named "connection" today.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 16 Aug 2019 20:32:51 GMT):<br/>
Then we will eventually remove the connection protocol, which in turn will remove that from the swagger interface.

How are you running the ledger?  Have you got a ledger browser server running on this - http://195.128.101.205:9000/genesis?

I think there is a missing argument, but can't find it to be sure.  @andrew.whitehead Can you please take a look?
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 15:05:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes thats right, i have running the VON-Network on the same machine. 
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 15:59:06 GMT):<br/>
It must use `--wallet-type indy` as well at the moment
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 15:59:37 GMT):<br/>
Allright i try it 
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:00:16 GMT):<br/>
by the way what exactly is this flag doin ?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:00:21 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking there was an "indy" arg, but couldn't find it.  We should do a pass over the help text.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:01:05 GMT):<br/>
The wallet type is pluggable, and there are (I think) two version - base and indy.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:01:14 GMT):<br/>
In theory there might be more later.

The python3-indy module and libindy.so / dll need upgrading
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:05:42 GMT):<br/>
mh, my setup right now is that i got the indy-cli via ubuntu apt-get not python3 does that makes a difference ?
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:07:26 GMT):<br/>
also libindy.so is installed by that doesnt it ?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:08:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes it should be 
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:09:01 GMT):<br/>
ok after i started the VON-ledger it about indy version 1.9 
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:09:31 GMT):<br/>
does the ledger need to be also on the newest version ?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:11:06 GMT):<br/>
1.9.0 is sufficient I think 
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:11:49 GMT):<br/>
pip3 install python3-indy==1.11.0
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:12:27 GMT):<br/>
i was on 1.8
</p>

i see
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:12:48 GMT):<br/>
need a moment restart everything
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:18:31 GMT):<br/>
allright i got it, i could also fetch a schema from the ledger 
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:18:35 GMT):<br/>
thx a lot :)

by the way while someone reads that ;) 
What i have had a hard time was understanding the Swagger-Api by using the Demo Agents, the automatic arguemtns conused me a little. 
But anyway i think a short diescripting for the normal workflow how to make invites credentiels etc. as when to use which call would be an awesome Document :)

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:22:44 GMT):<br/>
You mean because the agents are configured to automatically do things, the swagger API is harder to understand. You make one call and all the rest just happen.  Is that what you mean?

Hello everyone! Could somebody point me out the document where I can read about goal of Aries agent. What problems it attempts to solve? 
Im interesting in location of wallets of clients that going to interract over this agent. F.e it Mobile client 1 and mobile client 2 wants to establish connection over Aries agent what it exactly will do? Provide transport for this messages or will it encrypt/decrypt this messages, if yes, then how Aries will get access to user's wallet? 
</p>
<p><strong>SergeyBrazhnik</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 09:40:03 GMT):<br/>
I had investigation of https://github.com/streetcred-id/agent-framework/tree/dbc429aa7bf9171fb6e5607c51addc2a7278590a and found that guys somehow have access to both wallets (of client 1 and client 2)
</p>
<p><strong>SergeyBrazhnik</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 09:48:54 GMT):<br/>
if take a look at parameters of test in this repo I could find both wallets of clients ( IAgentContext issuerContext, IAgentContext holderContext ). Agent have access to both wallets??? 
```
public static async Task<(CredentialRecord issuerCredential, CredentialRecord holderCredential)> IssueCredentialAsync(
            ISchemaService schemaService, ICredentialService credentialService,
            IProducerConsumerCollection<AgentMessage> messages,
            ConnectionRecord issuerConnection, ConnectionRecord holderConnection, 
            IAgentContext issuerContext, 
            IAgentContext holderContext,
            Pool pool, string proverMasterSecretId, bool revocable, List<CredentialPreviewAttribute> credentialAttributes, OfferConfiguration offerConfiguration = null)
```

One more question. I investigate a lot the python-cloud-agent a lot and found the module which connected to routing. 
Could somebody answer, what this routing module stands for? This is a place how f.e mobile edge agent could be connected to issuer edge agent over cloud agent? 
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 13:44:13 GMT):<br/>
I think that module enables the ACA to act as a Mediator as defined in this RFC: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays/README.md

Hi,
I am running Alice-faber demo of  Aries python cloud agent. 
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/README.md
I have done set up of faber agent and is up and running and while doing so 4 transactions get added to the ledger. But when I set up the alice agent as per the demo, no transaction is added to the ledger, so my query is how alice DID getting registered then?? @swcurran

Alice does not have a DID on the ledger.  Since Alice does not issue credentials, she does not need a public DID. She does have a did:peer pairwise DID for each relationship she has - e.g. with Faber and ACME.

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 14:56:18 GMT):<br/>
Yes, timezone differences are definitely a challenge, unfortunately. The call will be recorded at least and the US Morning call will be next week; though, the topic of discussion for the morning call is mostly focused on the Indy Agent -> Aries Migration and the afternoon call is focused on RFC and protocol discussions.
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 14:58:00 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @dbluhm . I am looking forward to contribute to the Aries Migration part, either to the aries-dotnet-sdk or aries-js-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 14:59:00 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 14:59:26 GMT):<br/>
Definitely, I would love to volunteer..

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 14:59:38 GMT):<br/>
The Indy JS wrapper provides a great start. You could move that into the Aries repo and see who else wants to contribute.
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 15:00:32 GMT):<br/>
Great. I have recently used Indy NodeJS SDK. Hopefully, that would help 
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 15:01:11 GMT):<br/>
We have discussed moving the afternoon call a few hours later, but it would be hard to move it late enough for India to join and we haven't seen much interest from East Asia.

The current routing module allows a connected agent to establish an inbound route, such that they can use the routing agent as their endpoint and receive messages packed for a certain key. There isn't an official RFC for this protocol yet, although the message formats are covered here: https://github.com/andrewwhitehead/indy-hipe/tree/inbound-routing-update/text/agent-message-routing
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 17:18:19 GMT):<br/>
It would also be necessary to implement message queuing in order to support a disconnected edge agent. I think Sam is discussing that on the call today
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 17:47:23 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead this RFC should be proposed to Aries
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 21:04:26 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam I was just thinking about the protocol you proposed on the call today, and realized I stated incorrectly that intradomain can be more trusted than interdomain. I think its safer to assume an adversarial environment exists within a domain too and we should still treat it as if its an interdomain by default.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 21:39:35 GMT):<br/>
all domains should be zero trust
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 21:39:39 GMT):<br/>
as much as possible
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 22:03:11 GMT):<br/>
Yup, I made a mistake in assuming that the trust would be inherently different originally. I agree we should be aiming to go to a zero trust architecture.

<p><strong>raj_shekhar</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 04:09:44 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran so if BOB wants to connect to Alice then how this whole process will look like?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 04:49:54 GMT):<br/>
There is an invitation message that must go between Alice and Bob - from one or the other. The invitation is an out of band message - perhaps delivered by email or a QR code. This is described in the "DID Exchange" protocol in the Aries RFC 

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0023-did-exchange
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 04:50:50 GMT):<br/>
The invitation includes a key and endpoint so that the connection request response can be encrypted and sent.

Hi, I want to make my own simple agent . Is it good idea to start with Aries project since it is in incubation or to use the old indy-agent project ? What is a good point to start?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 13:34:42 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger Aries is a continuation of the work started in Indy Agent. Indy Agent has officially been deprecated in favor of Aries; I strongly recommend you start in Aries. The incubation status refers more to the maturity of the processes of Aries as a community than to the maturity of the code itself.

To get a feel for Agents, if you haven't already, I recommend reading through this RFC: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md

The Aries Cloud Agent - Python project is a good project to learn and get started with but is also fully production grade. You can check it out here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python

<p><strong>emis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 13:56:25 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @dbluhm 
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 16:08:09 GMT):<br/>
Using decorators as middleware would be one way to add service types to the protocol that allow different trade-offs between reliability and performance.

<p><strong>SvenHammann90</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 16:28:20 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I believe you made the call-out to the "formal analysis guy" in the call :-) I'm listening to the calls, I just cannot attend as they are after my working hours in Switzerland. I would be very interested to talk to you at RWOT; I believe that formal analysis could make these kinds of assumptions (adversarial environment) much more explicit. I believe it is important to be precise about the desired security properties from protocols, especially with the DIDComm landscape becoming increasingly complex.

I was wondering if someone had information on what the status of agent authorization policies was? Is it implemented? if not what the timeline is / any documentation made for it. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 18:52:20 GMT):<br/>
@Alexi you mean permissions within an agent for what types of messages it is willing to process?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 18:53:37 GMT):<br/>
I would guess @Alexi is asking about the device authorization policy that has been talked about in the DKMS document and various other paper.  Or if he isn't asking about it, I'd love to know. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 18:54:33 GMT):<br/>

I think @swcurran  is correct in what I am referring to. Policy list of authorized agents for an identity holder. On this paper its described on page 9 https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/What-Goes-On-The-Ledger.pdf
</p>

well thats good, that means they can talk to each other, what i did was to differ from faber to acme. Dont know anymore if i got it working but it should be the same process wasnt it ? 
The thing is, if its working for faber it have to for acme ;) but yes its not that easy

In working through the swagger api the id on both sides of a connection or exchange are different for each side.  While its possible to figure out merely do the order of events what responses belong to a given connection/exchange it seems like it would be much easier if the API included the ids from the other side. I could see this manual matchup getting really complicated if there were more than one agent talking at the same time.  I assume (maybe this is a big assumption) that under the hood each agent is keeping track of the ids from the other side of any connection or exchange but only exposing in the API their side.  It would be helpful to understand why only one side shows up in the API. After the incepting event both sides should have both sets of ids or am I missing something fundamental here?

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 01:47:57 GMT):<br/>
The connection protocol does not include connection IDs, those are only used internally by the agent and with their controller, and not shared over didcomm. Each connection record does contain the (likely pairwise) DIDs used by both sides though.

Hi guys, how i can run swagger API with aca-py?
I tried to follow the tutorial by  the following commands:
`./scripts/run_docker start --inbound-transport http 0.0.0.0 10000 --outbound-transport http

Von-network 
./manage build
./manage start 
`

accessing localhost:9000 i get the Von Ledger web page.
But i don't know how i can access the swagger API equals demo Alice

Follow up to the discussion today. The "extra" fields in the did:key DIDDoc are NOT in the JSON-LD context.  Using the URL that was referenced (https://w3id.org/did/v1) resolves to this - https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/contexts/did-v1.jsonld  and none of those fields (`assertionMethod`, `capabilityDelegation`, `capabilityInvocation` and `keyAgreement`) are in that context document.

So - @drummondreed no need to panic about the context - the list looks reasonable. 

@tplooker - great if at RWoT you could get the did:key to resolve to (IMHO) just this:

```

Is there a current discussion (possibly RFC?) that is currently open about what the standard for an SSI mobile app URI/URL scheme is (i.e deep linking)? For application developers that would like to have functionality with all mobile wallets and not just a specific one this standard would be very useful (would also open up any mobile wallets being made to be used in the space without restriction).

This was discussed on an Aries call, but I missed it.  We (BC Gov) are very interested in getting this resolved.  AFAIK, we can do something like define a URL starting with didcomm://... (or something, maybe aries://....), and Aries mobile agents would register to handle that.  That process works smoothly on Android and works, but not as smoothly on IOS (not sure what the issue is, but's inflicted by Apple). 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 23:14:44 GMT):<br/>
Related to the threading discussion from this morning's Aries call.  In our performance tests, we've found that pack() is the major bottleneck.  Has any work been done into the performance of that code?  Any likely easy wins?  @kdenhartog @esplinr 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 23:16:58 GMT):<br/>
This is interesting and I don't have an answer at this point.  How are you testing this? Could I test authcrypt/anoncrypt API calls as well to see if they're faster, slower, or similar?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 23:20:12 GMT):<br/>
We're using ACA-Py in a script to issue and receive 300 credentials.  @andrew.whitehead is going to determine exactly the amount spent in pack.  It looks like we can horizontally scale to get more throughput, but it still would be nice to reduce pack() as it seems to be a significant bottleneck.

The discussion was mostly focused on how to handle invitations, not mesages generically. The problem arises when a user receives such a URI without a mobile agent.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 13:21:59 GMT):<br/>
For invitations specifically, we might want to avoid deep linking.

Do you know which aries call this was so I can look at the notes? The problem where a user does not have a mobile agent for invitations does not seem like much of a problem to me. Would be the same if an invitation is presented in QR form without a mobile agent its not much use, and as such an invitation can be presented in various forms this is up to the application developers to work through. But having a universal SSI URI is a definite benefit to the space as a whole

I have some questions about RFC 0036 and RFC0037. Can I send proofs to the issuer as described in 0037 as part of the credential request in 0036?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:46:10 GMT):<br/>
For example, In the ZKP case I want to blind some attributes from the Issuer and must include a proof of blinding correctness at the minimum. But the issuer might also require a proof from another credential and need to send both of these as part of the credential request
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:46:51 GMT):<br/>
If the issuer handles all proving in the physical world with no digital proof requirements, I still need to do the proof of blinding correctness
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:48:09 GMT):<br/>

AFAICT the aries cloudagent does only support anonymous credentials and not JWT-style Verifiable Credentials. Is there a reason for this? In particular for the OrgBook Case wouldn't JWT-style VCs suffice?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 20:14:15 GMT):<br/>
It doesn't support JWT credentials _yet_. That is not only the desire, but plans are being made. Leaving the comparison of ZKPs and JWT style VCs aside, the Goal of Aries is to support any and all DIDs, credentials, etc. supported in the larger community.

The last two days, Ken shared some thoughts and proposals in community meetings about the architecture of the future Aries SDK as the Indy parts are split between Aries specific functions and the Indy specific resolver that can plug into it. 

I know Ken speaks with a calming, assuring voice and rocks a very authoratitive beard, but please don't misconstrue his proposals as anything more than he intended. They were shared for the purpose of gathering feedback on the approach and as a community contribution. Next steps involve some experimental code that will help us see the effects of those design choices. That code, and the design as a whole, is not only open to community feedback but NEEDS it. There is absolutely nothing final about what was shared.

If you see problems with the approach in any way, please speak up and help the effort to arrive at the best possible solution.

This method is used to establish an inbound route using the draft routing protocol. ref_id represents an connection to an agent that supports the protocol, as aca-py does
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 22:06:24 GMT):<br/>
As far as the OrgBook use case, agreed that AnonCreds are not crucial for a Credential Registry with public credentials.  A big part of why we used Indy was that there weren't any other available solutions when we started.

However, another reason for creating OrgBooks is to enable Issuers that deal in verifiable credentials, so that when Orgs (and people) with wallets show up, the issuer is ready to provide them directly to the Holder. In those cases, the Issuer may want to give the Holder anoncred capabilities.
</p>

as first i thought it just introduce a new inbound from another agent ilets say i have agent 1 2 3. 1 talks with 2 and well  1 or 3 can excute that to intrduce a the inbound to 1 to 3. But that seems somhow useless since i can use the connection_id to just make requests for a connection which x to x is known through the connection_id

This is about mediators and being able to tell someone sending me a message - you need to encrypt the message multiple times (encryption inside encryption...) and sent to this endpoint. The message will then be passed through multiple agents before it gets to me, with each agent decrypting it's layer.

This is described here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0094-cross-domain-messaging

Look at the `RoutingKeys` array for the concept being described here.

To implement that, the agents in your domain need to coordinate the keys and endpoints to use for passing the messages.

Yes, you can do that. Although I would question whether that is to yourself. That is likely issued from a device to you, where the device could have been certified by an outside party to be trusted for what it issues.  E.g. a standards organization could certify the device meets the "start and stop vehicle" standard and so it's credentials can be trusted.

ACA-Py will borrow heavily from the von-anchor implementation, including having a tails server that we (BC Gov) will deploy.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 01 Sep 2019 17:26:14 GMT):<br/>
The elimination of the tails file mechanism is the important upgrade to revocation in anoncreds 2.0.  Instead of a tails file, a merkle tree rooted in the ledger will be used.

Hi All, I would like to have a Mobile Edge Agent based on react that will interact with the Aries Cloud Agent. The projects in Txamarin is not a good option because of the knowledge of the team. Is there already a codebase for the Aries Cloud Agent Controller? I would like to bootstrap a Mobile Edge Agent. As far as I understand, the main features would be a wallet and a REST API integration with the ACA-PY. Is there some code, documentation or resources I could use to build this solution?Thanks!

@swcurran @andrew.whitehead there is some kind of load test for authcrypt/anoncrypt that can be parameterized 
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/tests/crypto.rs#L643

I think you can easily adopt it for pack/unpack and I hope it may be useful in your benches to check not only python level but the library level as well

For anyone who is interested, I've been trying to get some folks together to confer a bit about a dependency management strategy among Aries libraries down at the core level (not at the framework level). I've reached out to the people who own the community calendar to get it listed there, but I don't know if they'll list it in time, so I also wanted to mention it here.

The meeting is entitled "Aries Dependency Architecture" and will be held Tue at 1930 Central Europe Time, 1130 US Mountain Time, at zoom link https://zoom.us/j/8013612445

This is a discussion about the internal dependency management strategy between libraries in Aries. It relates to the email thread that we started a few days ago.

Hey i tried now to create a self certified credential. Well what i have done is to create a connection with myself and that  seems fine. But if i try to create a credential offer request issue process .. thats the only thing i have in swagger .. i get the following error by requesting the credenntial 
cls.RECORD_TYPE, tag_filter
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/aries_cloudagent/storage/base.py", line 219, in fetch_single
    raise StorageDuplicateError("Duplicate records found")
aries_cloudagent.storage.error.StorageDuplicateError: Duplicate records found

Well i mean yes thats maybe about the same wallet with the sent recieve request etc logs .. 
well i think i do some mistake here from the beginning maybe ..
How exactly can i self certify a credential for myself :) 
Yes and you may be right about the device wich certify a credential but my case is that i have a device in a car that certify itself that its driven some miles.

The challenge with approach that is the ACA-Py agent would not be on the mobile platform, which is a questionable approach for securing the keys.  @andrew.whitehead might have additional input on that.

For documentation, you can look in the /demo folder of the ACA-Py repo. In particular, there is an OpenAPI demo that shows the full API exposed by ACA-Py for the controller to use.  Within the docs folder is the "getting started" guide that has lots of material that you can review or skip based on your knowledge of the Indy/verifiable credentials space.  You also have to pay attention to the webhook data sent to the controller as events occur.

Examples to this point have mostly been Web frameworks - django and Java.

@nbrempel is working on this as well, but from a proof standpoint. Our application (indy-catalyst) needs to ask itself for a proof and respond to it. Nick is implementing that much as you have done here - the controller uses the agent to connect and then uses the connection for the proof.  I'm not sure how issuing a credential would be different, but I wouldn't think it would be too much.

Nick, any thoughts?  Any code to point to how you are doing the proof?

NOTE - Nick ran into a missing feature in Indy related to the specific proof he is doing.  Shouldn't affect the DIDComm pieces (messaging with yourself), but it means he doesn't have a full implementation.

ok thanks for your answer. The idea is to have the ACA-PY on the cloud, but allowing users to manage the permissions of their cloud agent through their Mobile Edge Agent. The Mobile Edge Agent would be just. a way for the user to control the permissions of the Cloud Agent and the flow of information that this Cloud Agent is managing. The keys stored on the mobile phone would be just the keys related to identification of the mobile phone to the cloud agent, and related to the control of the Cloud Agent.The Cloud Agent would manage all the other keys(related to other agents, services, issuers, holders and so on..). If mobile is lost or robbed, a cold-storage secret key can be used for recovery, as well as social recovery(key sharding). As far as I understand for your answer, a HTTP/JSON API can be implemented based on the exposed endpoints of the OPEN API/ SWAGGER: this would allow the user to post request to their Cloud Agent, while receiving events through Webhooks.

What I did was:
1. establish a connection with mysef.
2. send offer to myself 
3. got a sent_offer received_offer the same time.
4. take the credential exchange_id of the received_offer 
5. send a credential request with the credential_exchange_id of the received entry
6. error as showed ..

Do we have any other names for the messaging protocols that we are using than:

1. The DIDComm Protocol is the mechanism for sending messages from one edge agent to another edge agent irresepective of the message content.
2. DIDComm Protocols are the definition of roles, messages, and state to accomplish some shared goal. 

In the first, you only care about message delivery, in the second, you only care about message content.

Do we have names for those two things?  Can we define names for those things?  The subtle "s" at the end of the second word seems to be an insufficient differentiator.

Probably needs to be an issue in aries-rfcs.  @danielhardman @TelegramSam @tplooker @troyronda @kdenhartog 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 05:55:49 GMT):<br/>
I recently updated RFC 0003: Protocols to discuss this issue a little. I think the verbiage I added helped a little bit, but it still did not introduce crisp terms. Here is what I wrote:

```
In the context of decentralized identity, protocols manifest at many different levels of the stack: at the lowest levels of networking, in cryptographic algorithms like Diffie Helman, in the management of DIDs, in the conventions of DIDComm, and in higher-level interactions that solve problems for people with only minimal interest in the technology they're using. However, this RFC focuses on the last of these layers, where use cases and personas are transformed into features with obvious social value like:

Connecting with one another
Buying and Selling
Negotiating
Enacting and enforcing contracts
Requesting and issuing credentials
Proving things using credentials
Discovering things
Putting things in escrow (and taking them out again)
Scheduling
Auditing
Reporting errors
Cooperative debugging

When "protocol" is used in an Aries context without any qualifying adjective, it is referencing a recipe for a high-level interaction like these. Lower-level protocols are usually described more specifically and possibly with other verbiage: "cryptographic algorithms", "DID management procedures", "DIDComm conventions", "wire-level message exchange", "transports", and so forth. This helps us focus "protocol" on the place where application developers that consume Aries do most of the work that creates value.
```

I would like to float the following terms:

**Application-Level Protocols** for the high-level protocols that RFC 00003 describes, that we mostly intend when we use "protocol" without any adjective.

**The DIDComm Protocol** or just **DIDComm** for the collection of conventions that is used as a foundation by all Application-Level Protocols.
</p>
<p><strong>iainbarclay</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 13:55:32 GMT):<br/>
A quick comment on this - the text "this RFC focuses on the last of these layers" - it wasn't really clear to me which was the last of the layers, though I would interpret it as the "application-level protocols". Its also a little unclear if "higher-level interactions that solve problems for people with only minimal interest in the technology they're using" refers to the end-users of the solutions, or to the application developers (who I guess are "application protocol users") - if the latter, I (as one of these people) would suggest that there is a strong interest in the technology, but the focus of the role is to understand the application level protocols in order to deliver the solution. Does that help at all?

I picked up an impression from somewhere that it's possible to configure `aca-py` as a relay agent just doing store-and-forward for edge agents running on smartphones etc. Am I correct, and is this easy to do? If so, how?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 17:53:56 GMT):<br/>
I like "Interaction Protocols" better than Application-Level Protocols, but am OK with either.

I'm good with going with just "DIDComm".

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 17:59:57 GMT):<br/>
I would say it is easy, but there is work to be done in doing that.  I'm not sure if anyone has an open source repo created with a controller that does this.  I think @sukalpomitra has done that already, and he might share some thoughts on this.  @tomislav has also done a version of this with aries-framework-dotnet.

The recent RFCs (last couple of days) that @TelegramSam proposed talk about the concepts for doing that - handling the queuing of message for the smartphone-based edge agent. The routing RFC is also relevant, as it shows what the cloud and edge agents have to coordinate to put into the service endpoint fields, particular the RoutingKeys array.

I think the workaround for this case would be in the manager, to null out the proposal in the credential exchange record if the originator was self (i.e., it's a free offer not a bound offer) once it creates the credential offer.

Then the search can look for the absence of the credential proposal as a substitute for the initiator=self.

There are a few ways into this method, so there might be some dancing about, which smacks of wrongness. Unit tests ought to cover the use cases.

Hi - I noticed when going through the tutorials on the Aries cloud agent, and especially the Swagger/OpenAPI sections, that connection_id plays a significant role, more so than individual DIDs - is this a reasonable observation, and as an agent developer, should I keep a record of connection_ids as well as or instead of DIDs?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 21:30:02 GMT):<br/>
I think internally that connection_ids are the primary entity to track.  Each represents a relationship/a connection that has DIDs for each party plus other metadata about the connection - possibly what I call the connection, what credentials I have issued from the connection, what proof requests the connection has asked me, what proofs the connection has provided me, basic messages to/from the connection, etc.  It's a lot more than just the DIDs.  We may even need to support reverse lookups of the public keys associated with the connection so that we can find the connection given a key.

You probably want to start with aries-cloudagent-python https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python  - There is documentation linked from the readme that you can use to figure out how to use it.

If you are interested in a dotnet implementation, you can look at aries-framework-dotnet for a library you can embed in an app for a mobile instance or for server based. You'll need to understand more about agents before you are ready to get going with a mobile agent.

That code base is a good demo of SSI, but is not really being looked at actively. If you plan on digging into Indy/Aries, you should be look at the Aries code bases.

 Not sure what you are trying to do.  As I recall, we removed the login parts of the demo. Not sure why you would want to have that in the demo.

Pondering this some more, I think the fix has to be in the connection itself. The invitation should include an auto flag to note that the same agent has both ends of the connection, and then the connection record should retain it. Then the operation should check the connection to avoid duplicating records that are really auto-connections. I think this is the most bulletproof approach.

My two cents only.

@sklump what is your answer? You referenced a thread but I don't see the schema issue was mentioned.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 10:48:16 GMT):<br/>
@PatrickLenert It's a different thread.

You can get schemas from the ledger without a DID, see the sample code: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/python/tests/ledger/test_build_get_schema_request.py
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLenert</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 10:51:14 GMT):<br/>
So if I want an REST API Endpoint for my ACA-Py Agent, I have to implement this interface in the python code myself?

</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 11:04:16 GMT):<br/>
You could write one there. But the aca-py agent necessarily has a DID on the ledger or else it won't start. Maybe you want something closer to the indy-sdk instead for this.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLenert</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 13:05:59 GMT):<br/>
@sklump I think you misunderstood my question. What I search for is a *global registry* or ledger method to retrieve schemas from other partys without the DID, only *using attributes*.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 13:07:53 GMT):<br/>
There is no API like that as far as I know.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLenert</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 13:09:10 GMT):<br/>
@sklump Is there any third-party solution you can think of? How would you implement this?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 13:17:34 GMT):<br/>
I believe it is the wrong question. There is no semantic value to an attribute in a schema. Any schema-issuer (origin) can publish any schema to the ledger. Relying on an attribute set's meanings and then getting candidate schemas from those are prone to bait-and-switch, and/or to accidental or malicious pollution of the schema space. For example, 'score' could refer to a credit score, a test score, a high score in some game, etc. Only when you know what schema you want by name/version/origin(DID) can you get a good bead on the target.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLenert</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 13:22:12 GMT):<br/>
what if I want to import schemas from the ledger? At the beginning I certainly don't know what I am looking for.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 13:25:04 GMT):<br/>
I think you need to go over the wrapper code tests to get a sense of what is typical operation in any case. As a prospective holder, you would be in contact with a credential issuer to ascertain the schema(s) against which it issues credentials.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLenert</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 13:30:29 GMT):<br/>
ok, from the Issuer perspective: How would you use existing schemas if you as an Issuer doesn't have the Schema ID and there is no method and concept to retrieve them all together?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 13:35:53 GMT):<br/>
As an Issuer you would have contact with the Origin (e.g. government defines drivers' licences). Ultimately the idea is that these live in some sort of publicly accessible space like schema.org.

For now you can poll the ledger transaction by transaction and inspect the ones marked as schema definitions (`transaction['type'] == '101'`).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries?msg=wwRRH2cZ7HGtSGFmm) This is not correct (99% sure - @andrew.whitehead).  An ACA-Py agent that is not an issuer does not have a DID on the ledger and in fact often will not.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 14:06:25 GMT):<br/>
@PatrickLenert - there is no schema discovery built into indy-node, no transactions to find schema or creddefs. What some have done, BC Gov and another instance, is to simply read the entire ledger into a database and using that for discovery.  This is implemented in von-network (https://github.com/bcgov/von-network - the /server code), and we have running instances that scan our test ledgers and the Sovrin MainMain (https://sovrin-mainnet-browser.vonx.io/).

Hello all, Our team has been working hard to create a v1.0 compliant agent and we are at the point of creating the messages for credential presentation. We are diving in to the creation of the proofs and are a little confused about what is going on here -> https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/python/src/getting_started.py#L1125
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:39:27 GMT):<br/>
We have been using the getting_started.py as a reference since there currently does not exist a revocation implementation in ACA-py. 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:40:31 GMT):<br/>
We are a little confused about why there is a tails reader being opened here. Our understanding was that the credential and the current value of the pertinent revocation registry would be enough to create a proof of non-revocation. Is this correct ? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:47:16 GMT):<br/>
No, a tails file is needed in preparing the proof on non-revocation.  We're looking forward to the day when that is not required, but it's still needed.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:48:03 GMT):<br/>
As we work on revocation for ACA-Py, we're anticipating that BC Gov will host a tails file server that others can use for the short term until anoncreds 2.0.
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:51:48 GMT):<br/>
Ah okay, so is the idea that each trust anchor would publicly host their tails file ?

@luckycharms810 or post to a public aggregator such as https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von_tails. Only issuers create tails files, but holders (provers) need a copy to create proof.

Tails files are burdensome to generate but public and immutable once created.
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:57:33 GMT):<br/>
So this tails file would need to get updated every time the trust anchor issues a credential ? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:57:44 GMT):<br/>
Tails files can be anywhere.  They just need to be referenceable. We're going to host a tails service (using von_tails that @sklump references).
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:59:16 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:07:04 GMT):<br/>
Okay so just for me to be sure I understand this 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:07:29 GMT):<br/>
If an issuer is no longer able to host the tails file, the holder can no longer create a proof of non-revocation for that credential
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:08:23 GMT):<br/>
Not quite: the holder ought to get a copy for itself. Or else a process on the issuer can monitor tails file directory as it populates and whisk the tails file up to a server once it's done.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:08:41 GMT):<br/>
Then as long as the holder can get to its own copy, or download one from the server, it will be fine.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:09:07 GMT):<br/>
For what it's worth, the issuer can also monitor the server in case it's sabotaged to get fresh copies from the server.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:09:07 GMT):<br/>
For what it's worth, the issuer can also monitor the server in case it's sabotaged to get fresh copies from the server (unlikely).
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:10:04 GMT):<br/>
But I think only the holders need the tails files once they're generated. Issuers, on revocation, operate on the revocation registry, not the tails file, and revocation registry states are on the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:10:28 GMT):<br/>
Since tails files are gargantuan, I don't advise downloading a fresh one every time.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:11:25 GMT):<br/>
Examples and configuration instructions for such sync scripts come included in von_tails
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:12:40 GMT):<br/>
For example, von_anchor only allows the holder to store a credential if it already has the corresponding tails file.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:14:07 GMT):<br/>
Cred def : revocation registry is a one-to-many relation. Revocation registry : tails file is a 1:1 relation. Once a rev reg fills up, the issuer must generate a new rev reg (with corresponding tails file) before issuing a new credential.

</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:19:58 GMT):<br/>
Given the 1:1 connection between revocation registries and tails files, would it be reasonable to include the path to the tails file in the revocation registry transaction? 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:23:35 GMT):<br/>
Ah i see this here - "Each issuer must also publish on the ledger a revocation registry. This metadata references a credential definition and specifies how revocation for that credential type will be handled. The revocation registry tells which cryptographic accumulator can be used to test revocation, and gives the URI and hash of the associated tails file."
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:23:37 GMT):<br/>
Probably not - these can live anywhere - there may be multiple services, or they may spin up and shut down over the weeks and months. An admin-API-like call to the Issuer would be a good place to get a tails file server, then query the server by rev reg id.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:25:29 GMT):<br/>
... yes, but in effect this is only for local file system writes. As it should be - tails file creation should not depend on this or that external service being up. This is where a sync script can watch over the local directory vs. a remote service, and copy deltas in the issuer direction (local->remote) or the holder direction (remote->local) until they match.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:28:17 GMT):<br/>
Not all holders may be interested in tails files from all cred def ids (or rev reg ids), and not all servers may be interested in hosting tails files from all cred def ids (or rev reg ids), so there is some configuration available to specify domains of interest.

</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 13:12:10 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Thanks for the answer. Couple of follow up questions. 

1. Is there somewhere I can view the exposed APIs from anoncreds 2.0 ?
2. Would it be right to assume that the tails file would not go away, but just that the holder would not need it to prove non-revocation ? 
3. Is there somewhere I can get a better understanding of how the tails file grows ? I noticed that a file with a record of 1 issued credential, and a file with 60 issued credentials both have the same size of 2.4mb. I can run some tests on my end to see how these grow but would love if you had a resource i could refer to for this. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 14:21:04 GMT):<br/>
1. There is a writeup on what AnonCreds 2.0 is somewhere - I've been looking but can't find the reference. @MALodder knows it. The API you are asking about is the revocation from an Indy perspective.  My guess it is essentially the same, with the URI for the tails file replaced with a reference to a transaction on the ledger for the root of the merkle tree construct that replaces the tails file.

2. The tails file concept (array of ints) goes away, replaced (AFAIK) with a merkle tree where the bits of the leaf nodes represent the credentials and status. The root of the merkle tree is in the ledger, and when credentials are revoked, the a new tree/transaction is written.  @MALodder knows better :-)

3. I have not been able to find the history that has the size of files. However, I know that the files get very large - on the order of GBs.

Thank you @swcurran, Fwiw I am trying to understand how I can sustainably implement this in production in the short term. Is it a reasonable solution for me to basically keep the max cred num low, and use multiple revocation registries to keep the tails files smaller ? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 14:49:09 GMT):<br/>
That's the approach we are taking. We need revocation now, but want to waste as little effort as possible on the tails approach. Hence we will use a tails server (building on von-tails work) and as you note, keep the tails files as small as reasonable. We're hoping the API stays largely the same - the same interactions have to occur, just with (naively stated) different parameters.
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 15:14:38 GMT):<br/>
Got it, just looked through this repository for the von-tails server.  Would it be reasonable to say we would be good citizens of the eco-system if we simply host tails files for any issuers that we represent ? 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 15:15:27 GMT):<br/>
I am seeing that with in von-tails, it seems to be the issuer that is responsible for pushing their tails files to the server to keep them current. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 15:19:39 GMT):<br/>
Yes. That's why I was mentioning that we are going to host a tails server.  Perhaps that will save others from having to have one.  May not be a big deal, but could make it a bit easier for everyone.  Not scalable, but it hopefully doesn't have to be.
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 15:30:14 GMT):<br/>
Really helpful @swcurran , appreciate it! How are you currently planning for the shift from the tails files to the on-chain revocation registry merkle trees ? 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 15:30:37 GMT):<br/>
Also curious if you have information on that timeline
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 15:33:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the synchronization must start with the issuer, who generates tails files, to push such to the server. The issuer (trust anchor) itself is not necessarily responsible, but an actuator (script) has to push from issuer to server. Note that a tails file, once complete for a revocation registry, is immutable (always current, tamper-evident).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 15:38:29 GMT):<br/>
We have a limited "in the wild" use case that will use tails (at least for now).  My guess is that we will try to reissue credentials to eliminate the tails based ones that exist as quickly as possible - send messages to those with old ones and get them to collect new ones.  Then we can drop support for tails files.  Not easy...

I don't know about the timeline, but assuming it will be within a year, hopefully well within a year.  Others might have different opinions on that.

<p><strong>janb</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 07:46:13 GMT):<br/>
about the tails files: in our current approach we hand over the tails file to the credential holder so they can generate proof without phoning home.. am I missing something?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 10:59:33 GMT):<br/>
@janb the issuer could include it with the credential, but (1) typically they are very large and (2) the same tails file pertains to potentially hundreds of thousands of credentials, so if the same holder gets multiple credentials from the same revocation registry [e.g., short-lived duty roster assignment], their tails files will be duplicates.
</p>
<p><strong>janb</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 11:26:04 GMT):<br/>
we check if the tails file already exists in which case we leave it as-is. My understanding is that it will never change after creation. When creating a tails file for <1000 entries the size is still a few KB ... so I'm still not clear on the following: will tails files be removed in anoncreds 2? I thought they are part of how proofs are generated and guarantee a certain anonymity on revocation checks
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 11:35:48 GMT):<br/>
Anoncreds 2.0 promises to change the process of revocation, using a Merkle tree small enough to put on the ledger itself. Truly these are the days of miracle and wonder.

Is their a recommended approach for credentials that need to be updated - eg. a golf handicap, or an athlete's Personal Best in an event - should the previous credential be revoked and a new one issued, or is there some mechanism to update the values within a currently held credential?

There is no way to update the value of a credential. Revoke and re-issue, or delete and re-issue*.
* philosophically, a superseded credential may still be valid as an assertion; e.g., yesterday my PB may have been 39:05 and today it may be 38:59. Both credentials `{'date': '2019-09-11', 'mile': '39:05'}` and `{'date': '2019-09-12', 'mile': '38:55'}` are both valid. To manage wallet fatness, the holder may want to remove old records.

<p><strong>iainbarclay</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:39:38 GMT):<br/>
Thanks - so if we retain and reissue, and another party asks for the "PB" credential - who decides whether they get them all, or just the latest - I guess I can see that both might be useful outcomes...
</p>
<p><strong>iainbarclay</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:39:38 GMT):<br/>
The stack of credentials is new to me, and interesting - I probably have terminology wrong, but could I write an athlete-alice-agent which provided  REST APIs to fetch 1) the set of all Alice's "PB" credentials and 2) just her most recent "PB"? (ignoring revocation for now) 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 17:25:04 GMT):<br/>
Its up to the holder/prover to decide what to deliver in the proof, and the verifier to decide what to accept. In the case the prover sends a proof based on time earlier than the last revocations, the verifier could request a proof of non-revocation from a later time.

Participants operate somewhat independently in what the deliver and accept. They can't fake the crypto, but the can control what the request and present.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 17:26:32 GMT):<br/>
The verifier can see on the ledger the time of the last revocations (but not what credentials were revoked) and the ledger data that the prover used to create the proof.
</p>
<p><strong>iainbarclay</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 17:43:51 GMT):<br/>
Thank you - its the "stack" of credentials that is new to me, and presents some interesting opportunities - I'm sure my terminology is wrong, but in the "PB" case - could I have an athlete-alice-agent which provides methods to return both cases - all Alice's PB credentials, and only the latest PB credential? (ignoring revocation for now)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 17:53:06 GMT):<br/>
Definitely. I think there is a use case to return an array of proofs. It's how to convey the need and understand the request.

Sure, but remember not to let the attribute names hypnotize you into assigning any kind of semantics to them. They are just commitments that this datum was in that hole. For example, you could issue a credential with `effective_date` and `expiry_date` in them, but that does not force any relying party to reject a credential at a date outside those markers.

With a bunch of dated performance records, Alice's coach (or interested punters, for example, if Alice were a race horse) could track her progress over the year, for example.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 17:58:04 GMT):<br/>
@StefanK - I've also been thinking about that scenario.  It would require code changes in how indy works, but I think technically it should be possible.  The use case I'm thinking of is a person without a public DID being able to issue credentials that can be verified by an entity that has been given the cred def. Basically, the credential and proof is not generally useful - only to those that the issuer has specifically shared the creddef. But it does open use cases like a person giving out delegations of authority to a number of people for access to a specific service, such as a bank.   There may be other ways to do delegation of authority, but that's not the only use case for this.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:01:17 GMT):<br/>
Awesome!  Where are the repos?

FYI - we're running production volume tests (2.5M credentials issued/received) through Aries agents right now and running into bottlenecks that we're starting to dig into.  Right now, it's appears to be the wallet that is holding us up (hence why I mention it). We'll keep you posted on the progress...

We have both a performance issue, and a wallet size issue.  It's early and we're sure there are things we can do, but the excessive use of tags in a naive implementation seems to be problematic. There is code in Indy to manage tags and we'll be using that as a first cut.

We think that we have managed some of the problems with caching. But our implementation is still maturing as well.

Speaking with @MALodder today and he pointed out that postgres might be another bottleneck. And he had concerns of reads and writes at a large scale with postgres
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 19:13:54 GMT):<br/>
We're pretty happy with postgres, but regardless, there is no other current option that meets enterprise requirements - not just volume of data, but scalability (multiple agent instances), and robust in the face of process restarts (e.g. running in kubernetes-type environments).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 19:15:28 GMT):<br/>
Another fun issue this week - being able to debug in the face of an encrypted wallet. We were hitting a problem that could only be solved when we hacked the implementation to be able to see the wallet contents.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 15 Sep 2019 00:31:25 GMT):<br/>
Also ... the bulk loading of credentials is a startup for a credential registry issue ... we are loading credentials from the B.C. registry service for all legal entities in BC ... normally there would not be that level of pressure on the wallet Implementation. Nevertheless there are some real performance tunings that need to happen. I’ve little doubt that postgres can handle whatever is thrown at it.

Hi All, I am learning about the indy-agent and very new to indy-agent part and indy-agent migrated to the Aries. We have created an application based on node.js  and running on the single VM. but now we wanted to split out into multiple pieces and  wanted to run all the pieces on different - different VM's. To run on the different VM's, we need the indy-agent on all VM's for communication between containers

I had the impression this was as grandfathered documentation. Now there is a new thread (214) about going back to Connections. In the Go framework, we have been implementing the DID Exchange RFC.

My interpretation of the Ursa line above means that Ursa will be produce several artifacts with different build items in them.  At least one of them will include the ZKP stuff needed for Indy-style verifiable credentials, while another would not include the ZKP items, but just the elements needed for an Aries agent that will not use Indy-style verifiable credentials.  That will allow different Aries agent implementations to support the features they want, but still be able to communicate.

Hi all! I'm new here and just reading through the RFCs. Really enjoying the clarity of thought/exposition so far. Quick question at https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0050-wallets#managing-secrets, where I'm trying to understand where secrets live.

* I see "You can’t get private keys out" but also...

* in the underlying design doc on wallets (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/design/009-wallet-export-import/README.md) I see "Export should contain the whole wallet data (including secrets)."

Are private keys (e.g. the private half of an authentication keypair referenced in my DID) stored in a wallet? Exported? Is this specified, or just an implementation choice?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:50:37 GMT):<br/>
In the current wallet implementation which was essentially grandfathered in from the Indy Agent community (in Indy-SDK), the private keys are stored in the wallet and are never returned to the library caller. Exporting your wallet is the only exception I'm aware of.
</p>
<p><strong>jmandel</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:51:20 GMT):<br/>
Okay -- so export is considered "a different kind of thing" from general API access. Fair enough (and thanks for the quick response).
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:53:51 GMT):<br/>
No problem! Yeah, data portability is a major goal but not something I would anticipate happening frequently
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 04:34:41 GMT):<br/>
So do we anticipate using export for backups, or would we expect to use tools from the underlying database?  I had been anticipating that export would be used, but that is limiting in that (right now), there is no incremental export.  But if we use the database, we get lots of tools, but no portability across wallet implementations. And in turn that is fine because when we do need that, we can use the export that we do have.
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:20:23 GMT):<br/>
Can't join the call today. My stance stand that we need to wait in order to make a decision on what direction we should take for the aries wallet.  That was clear from the call this morning. We need to have input from @MALodder , Ken, @nage , @swcurran , and @danielhardman  to make this decision. I suggest that after we all come back from conferences that we begin this process. 
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:29:23 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like a good IIW topic (Mike and Ken won't be there but Daniel, Daniel and Stephen should be)

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:53:32 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran: Backing up could happen at either layer (upper/outer surface of wallet, or underlying storage). If you back up at the low level storage, then you can only restore your backup to the same storage, and you don't have a view of the organization of data items that lets you pluck individual items out of the backup, restore a subset, only backup a subset, etc. You also have only an encrypted view of the data (when at rest in the storage, the data is already encrypted), so it makes no sense to use an encryption key. The wallet unlock key is inextricably intertwined with your data; you could add a new key, but you can't avoid needing the old one, so why bother? If you back up at the upper/outer surface of wallet, using the `export()` function, then you could choose to back up only half your relationships, and you could choose entirely different encryption and keys to do it.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:54:59 GMT):<br/>
There are reasons to do both; they just have different characteristics.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 01:30:46 GMT):<br/>
No @swcurran at IIW this time .. he is on another continent
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 04:21:19 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @danielhardman - so you agree with the concept that there be a single key needed for restore?  You are suggesting that actual wallet key would be sufficient rather than creating a new key for encrypting a backup package that consists of the wallet key with the backup (plus possibly other metadata).  That does mean that the metadata and some data from the backup - number of records per table, the unencrypted tags - would be visible to anyone with access to the backup.  I suspect that more metadata would be needed about the backup to restore it, but don't have concrete examples. 

If there was a need for more data and so a different key was used to encrypt a package, you don't see a concern with embedding the wallet key with the database backup?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 04:38:11 GMT):<br/>
If possible keep the key separate from the backup otherwise what’s the point of encryption 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 04:38:36 GMT):<br/>
I do believe in the idea of having a single key. However, you have to think hard about which key to use. If you're backing up it at the database level, then you should not put the wallet key with it, because that is the very thing that's needed to turn all the encrypted data into plain text. However, you could store the backup key in one place, and the backed up data in a different place. Or, you could use a different key to encrypt the wallet key. What you don't want is a situation where a database admin could turn all of the backed up data into plain text.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 04:39:52 GMT):<br/>
I think, if you are backing up at the database level, then you shouldn't call it a wallet backup. That is a storage backup, not a wallet backup. Backing up a wallet is the thing that's done through the export function.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 05:32:29 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder - there are two keys and the outer one that is saved is encrypting a package consisting of a database with encrypted contents and the key for the contents. I'm assuming that is safe enough.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 05:35:56 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman - the idea is put the wallet key with the database level backup as a package, then to encrypt that package with a key that you keep separate from the encrypted package. The whole goal is to keep those two things separate until you need them.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 05:37:15 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman - we should never use the term "wallet", but that's a whole other discussion.  At MyData I'm having to clarify the term "wallet" in the Indy usage.  AMS, please...
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 05:37:47 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran that approach is acceptable 
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 08:13:20 GMT):<br/>
I have a question I wanted to ask for a long time somehow related to export-import/backup. I know there is a plan to have a device revocation feature. I guess one of the purposes of it is when I someone steals my phone I can revoke all credentials in it by revoking the device. What if that thief do an export of the wallet before I do the revocation? Will be all exported credentials also revoked or not? (Maybe it's a corner case because I assume the attacker has access to that phone and into the app, which is, of course, a huge problem itself and both should be protected by TouchID or PIN, but it also can fail - more by a human than a technological error)

@jakubkoci: Whether the thief exports the wallet or not, before the device is revoked, does not significantly alter how much mischief can be done. Credentials are not revoked by device revocation; those are entirely separate. When a device is revoked, then the device's ability to prove something with the credentials is revoked, whether or not the credentials are valid. If you have valid credentials but an unauthorized device, you can't prove anything with them. For more on this, please see this whitepaper: https://sovrin.org/library/lost-phone/

Hi,
I have an update to my rfc: 167, data consent lifecycle, which may be of general interest. I have given several demos of how indy-sdk can be used can used for creating consent receipt and performing proof request without revealing any private information. The demo is based on getting-started and is now available as a reference implementation for anybody to check out. Once Aries is ready the plan is to adapt it over. The next step for the reference implementation is to add revocation example which is on the works. Welcome to come with feedback.

https://github.com/JanLin/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0167-data-consent-lifecycle

Best regards,
Jan

Note the new reference implementation is in a Pull Request #238 to hyperledger:master.

Hi, 
In the ACA-PY architecture deep dive its mentioned how one instance of a cloud agent is designed to be paired with one controller. What is the reason for this? Is it due to concurrency issues in having concurrent processes hit the same agent? Or other reasons?

I'm thinking of the scenario where within a business I have multiple processes executing that need verifiable credential capability e.g. I have a process to on-board customers that requires verifying credentials, I scale this out horizontally such that I can have multiple versions of this process, each on-boarding a different customer, running concurrently. How do I connect these up to an ACA-PY cloud agent, or multiple agents that all act as on behalf of the business entity.

If I write a controller that sits in front of an agent, then send the verifiable credential verify requests from my internal processes to it, then the controller forwards on to the agent, how is this different from having my processes talk to the agent directly? Is it simply because my controller will queue up the requests into a linear order to send on to the agent? or is there another reason for doing it? In such a system, to scale out agent capability horizontally I could create a cluster of controller-agent pairs and load balance requests from my internal services between them correct? 

I'm asking because if concurrency is the only issue then isn't it fairly trivial to have the agent implement a queue itself and avoid the need for the controller as described? I'm pretty convinced there's some reasoning behind the one controller to agent principle that I'm missing probably due to not knowing much about the ACA-PY implementation.

Cheers,
Ed

We mean one logical controller to one agent process. As long as Data is persisted, you can horizontally scale the agent and controller as necessary. We are running this architecture on a Red Hat OpenShift cluster (Kubernetes) and all works properly.

Hi @george.aristy , Good question! Delegation, as well as, guardianship are fundamental aspects of giving consent and getting access to data and data sharing. Eventually we will align with the verifiable credential as described by @danielhardman rfc.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 12:16:59 GMT):<br/>
From a privacy point of view, migrating to delegatable credentials would allow the holder, instead of the issuer, to set privacy policy -- an approach which seems at my naïve first look closer to the be-your-own-identity-provider bent of self sovereign identity.

Much as you've obviously put in a ton of work to build the RFP as it stands.
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 12:33:54 GMT):<br/>
@sklump That seems an unnatural flow to me as it could create a bottleneck in information exchange. On a practical level, that would mean I set some conditions for data sharing and, if they are not met, there is no conversation to be had. It also suggests that the holder has to be aware of every single purpose prior to setting those conditions. That to me is unrealistic. The more natural flow would be for the issuer to specify the purpose for data sharing and the holder can then either opt-in or opt-out. There is no danger of a bottleneck in natural conversation.

True, the delegatable credential approach, on its own, has no answer for the non-power-user.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 13:04:55 GMT):<br/>
The delegatable credential approach is not limited to power users. Non-power users register for services using Google's Sign-in, and this would be a similar flow.

Hi, what is an advisable way to quickly mass-create wallets, just empty wallets
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 14:33:54 GMT):<br/>
You can script this by repeated calls to libindy. What programming language are you using?

Note that every wallet you create will need an "unlock key", so this operation would also be creating a large corpus of keys...

nodejs, yes im using the postgres MultiWalletSingleTable config enabled. will there be quite a heavy amount of overhead because im assuming that the rust code is doing open-con and close-conn at the end of each all. i've tested that one wallet creation was around 1.6s SDK version 1.11.1 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:09:53 GMT):<br/>
Someone with deeper experience with the postgress wallet will have to comment on overhead. Yes, I think the underlying Rust impl opens and closes a wallet handle for each call you make. But I believe the postgres driver is using a table structure where the wallet identifier is just part of the primary key of each record, so creating a new wallet doesn't actually create new tables; it just adds a row to create the wallet identifier. Thus, I suspect the expense is just the expense of writing a row to a table (relatively cheap).
</p>
<p><strong>janl</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 19:53:01 GMT):<br/>
@sklump, Interesting question how delegatable credential is created. I am considering adding a level of abstraction to privacy questions with actors and roles in order to better describe the delegation process. In an earlier discussion of the rfc/hipe the holder or individual "actor" should not create credentials due to privacy because the individual would have to register on the ledger which is required for issuer. Better is that the issues (institution actor) has role  to manage creating credentials so they can be revoked. Not to try to describe how solution would look like but it would a combination of adding an option to delegate in the first or updated consent certificate so when delegation is required then holder needs to be able to respond to proof request by a verifier which is the one delegating to.
This is my initial thoughts how it could be done.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 14:15:21 GMT):<br/>
Note that to create a delegated credential, the holder need not have nor use a public DID on the ledger, as far as I read https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0104-delegatable-credentials. The delegation proof links to the original holder's credential, with some special sauce. I haven't thought about how to twist the idea of delegation into privacy policy. My gut says it ought to be possible, but of course that's hardly a standard.

```Motivation

Sawtooth/Transact (and many other ledgers) use anonymous (to the platform) public keys to identify transaction signers, verify that messages are correctly signed, and perform ‘light’ permissioning checks. For example, Sawtooth supports an on-chain transactor permissioning setting which is represented by a simple list of valid public keys (all keys are permitted by default).

An understanding of ‘who’ (person, system, organization, etc...) is associated with a public key is explicitly not handled at the platform level. This is delegated to the ‘application layer’. In Sawtooth/Transact, this is handled by the design of the transaction family (transaction formats, storage formats, and smart contracts). For example, if a transaction family wants to restrict the creation of certain record types to a set of ‘administrative users’, it needs to handle the mapping of the identity of those users (in the real world) to their public keys.

In a simple scenario, this may be a simple list of public keys that the smart contract reads out of state. Such transactions would only be considered valid by the smart contract when they were signed by a key in the application-specific ‘administrators’ list. In a more complex scenario, bootstrapped organizational administrative keys might submit transactions which update user identities and their associated rights. Smart contract logic would interpret this access control data to determine if the signer of the transaction had been granted permission to perform the action.

Sawtooth/Transact use an approach called Smart Permissions to delegate these permissions checks to ‘organization’ specific code. This allows organizations to provide their own implementation while sharing the same fundamental contract business logic. For example, two organizations may have radically different ways of determining who can create invoices, while the process for creating a valid invoice may be identical.

The root-of-trust problem is significant. How can we ensure that the bootstrapped administrative org keys are actually owned by that organization (and controlled by organizationally trusted parties)? How can we provide patterns which allow organizations to verify their individual’s identities, and publish the right evidence to the system to verify permissions? Is it possible for the individuals themselves to submit evidence of their permission to transact?

Aries’ DID and VC support potentially provides a path which addresses a number of the root-of-trust identity problems, allowing organizations to provide and revoke permissions to individuals, and allowing individuals to manage signing keys to close the loop on the ledger transaction construction/validation process.
```

The Aries Cloud Agent Python implementation has a concept of an admin interface which is a REST API + webhooks mechanism to build out your business logic in a "driver." The driver is essentially just a webserver that listens on the webhook routes and uses the REST API of the agent. To use the webhooks, ACA-Py needs to be configured to know the URL of the driver using the `--webhook-url` command line argument and . I'm not quite sure what step you are on so there's some general information.

To follow-up (and clarify) my comments about the "slide 5", "slide 7", etc. slides from this week's Aries call (presented by @danielhardman), I'm advocating that there be a common "query language" based on the DID _identifier architecture_ for all 3 types of data in the decision tree that was presented ...a common "query" box that runs across the top of multiple instances of the slide 5/slide 7 stacks ...based on DID identifiers ...for both the two categories of sensitive, verifiable data as well as all non-verifiable data.

Hi All. I am working on a DigitalID project and we want to use the HyperLedger aries/ursa and related technologies underneath. While I have been researching and reading a lot, I feel like getting more confused about especially the aries sdk. There are several repos on github for aries (rfcs, go, cloud agent, dot net), I wonder if they all will go in parallel or one of them will be the master repo (e.g. aries-framework-go). Digging the code I also saw some crypto codes that both exist under ursa and aries-go. I would appreciate if anyone can direct me a big picture of what is for what, maybe a Solution Architecture diagram showing what lies where?

To give some background in case you were not already aware, the Aries project was essentially born out of the Indy Agent community. Much of the code present in Aries today started as an Indy Agent project. While under Indy, most of us used the Indy-SDK which provides a "wallet," an interface to an Indy ledger, a credentials implementation using anoncreds, etc. As the community grew up, we realized that most of our work within the Indy Agent community did not need to be specific to Indy and so came Aries.

Many of us that migrated with Indy Agent into Aries still like the idea of having a common library that we can all build on. That is the idea behind the Aries SDK. We're currently working as a community to figure out how a common library for aries looks; this has been the main point of discussion in the Aries Morning calls. While that is getting sorted out, many are continuing to use the Indy SDK to perform the role that we eventually want the Aries SDK to play, with the downside of not yet having the interfaces to swap out ledger implementations, credential implementations, crypto suites, etc. This is the approach the cloud agent and dot net frameworks have taken.

Others prefer to work with their own language native or alternative implementations; this has been the approach to the Aries Go framework.

Ultimately both approaches are perfectly fine. As long as your Aries implementation speaks the protocols defined in Aries RFCs, the underlying infrastructure of your agent is not significant and we all should be able to interoperate.

Aries is an interesting mixture of code and ideas that matured in Indy, new code and ideas to make the original code and ideas more generally applicable, and completely new ideas introduced by those coming to work with us on Aries that were not previously involved in Indy. Given this mixing of ideas and the relative youth of the project, there is a definite need for more documentation. A big picture diagram of all the different parts is something we plan on producing and using at the beginning of calls and topics to help orient everyone in the discussion.

Thanks a lot for this long and supportive answer. I have been specifically dealing with aries-framework-go and also inspecting ursa. I know that libursa exports crypto functionality for signig, enc-dec and key generation. But for example aries-framework-go also has its own wallet functionality (I didn’t inspect the py and dotnet ones though) and AFAIS it doesn’t use ursa. Is the aries—ursa integration on the table? 
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 14:29:24 GMT):<br/>
Yes; however, that again is up to the implementation contributors. Ursa will likely provide the majority of the base crypto for the Aries SDK. I think it is also likely that other implementations that don't want to use the Aries SDK could use Ursa to get anoncreds style credential support.

Hi, I'm looking for the "right way" to initiate a topic of discussion/collaboration in Aries.  Is it to open an Epic in the Aries Jira that people can contribute to?  To be clear, I have no real proposal yet, just wanted to capture the user scenarios and possible requirements so that others with similar leanings can add to or critique what is there.  With the goal to make a real proposal at some point.

Hey folks, got another nice question from some colleagues, they asked me if its possible to take a schema from lets say a central service or ethereum entry and use this to create a schema definition on indy / sovrin is the interoperable like this ? Is this what the standard should be ? 
</p>
<p><strong>StefanK</strong> (Sat, 12 Oct 2019 21:34:41 GMT):<br/>
What i have in mind is that a schema in general is also only a DID Document which is referenced in in the schema definition .. well or maybe not :D .. furthermore thats why a schema should also be on-chain for immutatbility..  iam mean lets have the following thoughts. Some Schemas are online on a websites everyone creates definitions of that and a hacker manipulate a schema there .. interoperability will fail because new definitions does not match what some verifier expect...? 
Another thing is how does others do this.. like jolocom uport, can they all work togehter in the end ? Is that what the Universalresolver of DIF want to solve ? And btw have they also the schema and schema definition princip for creating credentials ? 
Well sry that are some more question in one :D needed to write my thoughts down..

Hey Will - just getting back online. It's because AgentBook needs to be able to access a public address for the other agent. Play With Docker has public addresses, but local agent instances don't - just localhost.  This could be rectified with a mediator cloud agent for your local agent, of course :-).  But that's a lot more work.

Hi, I have a general question. I understand that often, in a certain (Hyperledger) system users may have one or more DIDs. How are people implementing authentication in practice within a self-contained system? Is it with the common username and password?

DID Auth is a huge topic by itself. Most Aries work uses messages with mutual authentication on each message, so there isn't really a concept of login.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 18:11:53 GMT):<br/>
Using DIDs to authenticate to a site by proving key possession should kill usernames and passwords, and is contained within the DIDAuth Discussions.

We have a working OIDC Identity Provider (OP) that uses Aries protocols and verifiable credentials for authentication.  An RP can using stock OIDC protocols, the OP receives the request and then talks DIDComm with an agent to get a proof, and then uses the data in the proof to populate to the OIDC token to pass to the RP.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 18:57:44 GMT):<br/>
Here is the current approach.

Picture a login screen with various options to login - Facebook, Google, Email.  Add an option "Verifiable Credential".  When that one is clicked, a QR comes up. Scan it with phone in Mobile Agent app. A Proof Request confirmation screen pops up in mobile agent with credentials pre-populated. Tap "Send Claims" (or something understandable :-) ).  Back to the browser, the user is logged into the app.

The QR code and Mobile App is the equivalent of logging into Facebook.  The proof request confirmation is the equivalent of answering the "Do you want to share these attributes with App Foo".

The difference is that only you know that you were asked, and only you know what you shared.

Hi, I have a question about RFC 0023 (DID Exchange Protocol).  I didn't see in the RFC any way that the Exchange Request or Exchange Response is tied to the original invitation, though I do see that the Exchange Request and Response are associated with the thread id.  Is there an association with the invitation that I'm missing?  My thought is that I could target invitations toward different groups (or even different individuals) and I want to know which invitation spawned which of the Exchange Requests that I've received.

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Sat, 19 Oct 2019 01:33:29 GMT):<br/>
Since many of the Aries implementations originated from the Indy Agent work, Indy ledgers are currently the only ledgers implemented in many of those code bases. Support for other ledgers is one of the foundational goals of Aries but "high priority" first targets have not been identified by the community collectively.

Constraint is the limited implementations.  If you are building a mobile app, pretty much all you can use at the core is aries-framework-dotnet embedded in a Xamarin deployment. If you are building a non-mobile agent, you can use aries-cloudagent-python and use any language you want (doesn't have to be python).  If you want/need to code the agent itself, you have to use Python, but for the business application, you can use any language.

Aries Afternoon call, in 4 minutes: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=24772655
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 21:18:19 GMT):<br/>
Okay, @TelegramSam , here is an update to the Attachments RFC that uses `~sig` as we discussed on today's call: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/267
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:24:09 GMT):<br/>
I joined the call late, but I meant to bring up during the sig discussion that I think it would be useful for us to use JWS consistently in the non-repudiable work and the `~sig` decorator. What's others thoughts on this? I'll write it up if we think this is a good idea.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:27:25 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog +1
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:29:18 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam or @danielhardman any strong opinions against that? 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:35:32 GMT):<br/>
I don't mind ~sig's internal structure being reimagined as a JWS.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:35:52 GMT):<br/>
Note, however, that there are impls that will break. (BCGOV?)
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:36:03 GMT):<br/>
Nesting the `~sig` decorator inside `~attach` isn't exactly what I had in mind, I wanted to shoot `~sig` and move the functionality over :)
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:36:44 GMT):<br/>
It would break compatibility but switching to did-exchange is expected to do that anyway
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:36:50 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead : we need a way to sign an arbitrary scope smaller than a whole message. Attachments are just one example. It sounds like you wanted that to be the only example?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:38:15 GMT):<br/>
That's right, if I'm understanding you. Effectively sig is acting as an attachment anyway
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:38:27 GMT):<br/>
I can't think of an example where we need that arbitrary scope that isn't *also* doable nicely through attachments, so maybe we make it a non-decorator?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:41:38 GMT):<br/>
Make which one a non-decorator?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:41:44 GMT):<br/>
Okay. The thing that would change from my most recent PR is that I would no longer be linking to the RFC that defines `~sig`, and I would call it a field rather than an attachment. Then, if Kyle's JWS suggestion is taken, we redefine its internal structure to be JWS-compliant.

Separate from my tweaks to RFC 0017, we'd need to mark the `~sig` RFC RETIRED.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:42:23 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries?msg=CChHozMTjFYsd4G3Q) Make the attachment descriptor's `data.~sig` field into `data.sig`
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:43:26 GMT):<br/>
Okay. I'll update RFC 0017. ETA 15 min.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:54:22 GMT):<br/>
Okay, @andrew.whitehead and @kdenhartog : the attachments RFC now doesn't use a `~sig` decorator but instead a `sig` field--and its format is JWS.

@kdenhartog , will you take care of retiring the RFC about `~sig`?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:54:22 GMT):<br/>
Okay, @andrew.whitehead and @kdenhartog : the attachments RFC now doesn't use a `~sig` decorator but instead a `sig` field--and its format is JWS. At least, that's the way it looks in my PR.

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:55:53 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 23:29:12 GMT):<br/>
I thought it was interesting how this RFC basically describes anoncrypt and authcrypt (as the Base and Auth modes) while also defining support for PSKs and streams of messages, maybe it would make sense to define the envelope as a wire format in these terms: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke/

<p><strong>prieblinger</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 06:27:16 GMT):<br/>
Hello everyone! We are building a system to integrate Sovrin-based SSI into existing identity & access management solutions. For this, we would like to have a way to negotiate the attributes to prove before an actual proof request (Like "definitely prove attribute A, but you can choose if you want to additionally prove attribute B or attribute C. You can also add attribute D to this, but that's optional"). So we had drafted an Aries-RFC for this feature, but swcurran, who kindly took the time to talk to us on the subject, mentioned that this feature would rather be something to request from Ursa. Then again, all we could find when it comes to RFCs in Ursa was this  apparently abandoned RFC from march: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ursa/0000-OpenSSL-Interface . So basically, we are kind of confused as to where to request this feature and describe it in detail. What is the general opinion over here as to where this belongs? I have added a pdf showing a presentation on the idea. If you have questions on this, please do ask.
Also, can you tell us what you think of Aries RFC 0013-overlays? This might be something to build on for our credential negotiation idea, but that would only make sense if this is something that will actually find approval.
We are looking forward to your feedback!

@prieblinger I'm the chair of the #indy-semantics WG. Re Aries RFC 0013-overlays, I'm the inventor of the Overlays Data Capture Architecture (ODCA). The first real implementation of the architecture will be for a Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) project spearheaded by Novartis. The schema assets (i.e. schema bases and overlays) for that project will ultimately be issued by PSCI. If you DM me, I can point you to some richer documentation. The current RFC needs to be updated slightly.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:23:33 GMT):<br/>
@prieblinger : I suggest you get the attention of @brentzundel and @kenebert  here on Rocket Chat, and of Daniel McGrogan of Workday (probably not here on Rocket.Chat, but Brent and Ken have his contact info). They've been working on similar concepts (see, for example, Daniel's RWOT paper here: https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/verifiable-credentials-proof-request.md. I think the overlays idea may be fruitful for you as well, but I think parts of what you need may live elsewhere, so it could be a combination of overlays and other stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:25:23 GMT):<br/>
(I also agree with @swcurran that there is work related to this that naturally lives in Ursa. They're working on something called zklang which is a formal expression of a proof request. However, it's lower level than what you need. Think of it like assembly language instructions for proof requests, where what you want is a higher-level language.)

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 16:57:58 GMT):<br/>
A related question to the issue raised by @prieblinger. I think the general understanding of the community is that an Indy proof will be "True" only if all claims requested in the proof request are correctly provided in the proof. In reality, I think that a proof will be "True" if the things that are included in the proof are true, and if things are left out, that's OK. For example, in my experience with using a Mobile Agent app, the prover leaves out claims and hides claims as they want, and the proof will still be "true" in that the prover has the claims provided (without exposing their value and the things that were left out are not proven.  Thus it is up to the verifier to check what data was received to determine if what they need is actually included.  It would be nice to have a clear description of exactly what "True" means in the context of a verification and in relation to the proof request provided.

If what I suspect is true, that means there is/could be a separation between the crypto proof, and the business needs.  In @prieblinger's case, the crypto proof request could be the list of all possible claims being requested, and the business needs are information to the prover of what combination of claims the verifier will accept.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 23:27:46 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran : I would get even more nuanced. There are 3 questions:

1. Does the presentation pass cryptographic verification (all signatures are correct, nothing is expired/revoked)?

2. Does the presentation include everything that was requested (proof matches proof request, leaving nothing out)?

3. Does the presentation satisfy all relevant business requirements?

Item 1 can be tested entirely in a library.

Item 2 could be tested entirely in a library, IFF we had a standardized, formal proof request language AND a proof response message included a reconciliation against the preceding request. Today we don't have either piece, so you are correct to point out that it is missing.

Item 3 might be unnecessary in some cases, because if the expressive power of proof requests is great enough to capture everything that a particular verifier cares about, it has no greater scope than items 1 and 2. But I think it is still a logically separate question. Sometimes a verifier may want to consider factors outside the proof itself, such as "Does your score on this test [as proved by credentials] make you one of the top 3 applicants?" You could say that this is outside the scope of our proving, and I would agree--but I bring it up because verifiers should not expect to be able to express everything they want to know inside the proving protocol. There will *always* be business criteria that don't fit inside it. We should recognize when we run into stuff like that, and not try to overload the protocol with stuff that doesn't belong there. And we shouldn't equate verification of the first 2 items with verification that satisfies all possible business criteria.

All: I want to solicit feedback about this slide deck, which is my proposal for the community-requested diagrams that we can point at during discussions, saying, "we're talking about this thing here". It also includes some thoughts about how architecture of what we build in aries ought to map to installable packages, rust crates, libraries, and github repos. Note the questions in some of the callouts.

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L5L4QcZOATrn9rj4bEMmlbvij9XWyqgQRoWO-HNiUGw/edit

If we like it, maybe we can reference part of a relevant diagram when we write the readmes for various git repos, and when we create RFCs about KMS, VDRI, etc.

I think that's a good high level overview for the direction that the Aries project is heading. What I don't see in this that I suspect we'll run into quite often is the architecture of the agent/framework aspect. For example, where pointing to people to say we're talking about decorator processing and pointing to the agent-framework layer would be correct, but not frame the discussion enough to cut through the unimportant details to identify the important details.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 02:04:26 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman Thanks for putting this deck together. I particularly found it useful in presenting the boundaries between each pluggable components. From my perspective on working on the Go framework, I had a few thoughts (but a bit into the weeds):

(1) The topic of this presentation seems to be more specifically the Aries Plugin Architecture.
(2) I assume each component wrapper is also useable independently from each other wrapper (like was shown for the component boundaries).
(3) For a component that can have multiple plugins loaded at once, I would assume the framework would load each plugin and route appropriately.
(4) A framework for a particular language can also load its native format for code/plugins, in addition to the c-callable rust plugins supplied by the core libs. i.e., not every component in the ecosystem is written in rust.
(5) As an extension to the last point, a framework can also include some of these native components as "batteries included" defaults.
(6) On slide 4, you might want to remove the individual red lines.
(7) I think of a backing storage component/plugin as being injected into the overall KMS component/plugin (at least when I think of a Go design).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 02:09:39 GMT):<br/>
Re slide 11. In our efforts, so far, we started with HTTP binding and peer DID as sensible "batteries included" resolvers. (It's not entirely clear that every resolver fits as an in-process library so it would seem good to have an easy way to reach out of process too.)

Hi Daniel, Great work with slides. Here are few comments from my side:
- slide 4 - mapping for agent/framework   on the current slide there is just one mapping of the agent to layer two which suggest that it is very limited to the simple communication. But in my understanding Agent is mainly in Layer Tree where all complex use cases with VC are implemented. As well from perspective of someone who would like to build something on top of that stack I think they should mainly build against agents not core components. It would definitely make the adoption much easier. 
-  I got the point of not calling aries yet sdk but overall it is inevitable to use i t as a SDK otherwise Aries would need to become something much bigger (like ready application but this would blow up the scope)
-  slide 8 - adding other components like payments, smart contract etc. expand the scope of aries defined on slide 2. If we are focusing on SSI technology having stuff like payments does not sens (remember that some of those components would be huge - payment is good example).
- slide 15 - funcs does not seems to need plugins build in but maybe we cold think of allowing for implementing own "business logic"/flows which reuse existing components to make it easier in higher levels to fulfill the user cases in the TDA. You could imagine that someone would build the flow for credentials specifically for driving license, this could be part of the functions sets which you can import. 

I think the key point here is to define the scope of the Aries and try to stay within its boundaries. SSI has a huge impact on a lot of components not necessary we want to have them in aries (like payments -> blockchain and regular, sending files, exchanging securely information (IM) etc..) 

Base on above comments I took liberty to modify a bit your deck and include above comments as well put a bigger picture on the vision of Aries within connection of Trusted Digital Agent (aka Digital wallet) - user friendly interface towards decentralized economy. You can find it here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ot2SersaBdFwt1KrkE9X5S7oIx-7h8l-9bhHvDfzvgs/edit?usp=sharing

btw. it is allow to comment in the document. Would be nice if you would allow as well in yours make live easier.

@nbrempel, @jljordan_bcgov  - FYI about this. This gets to the definition of "verified" from an Indy sense today.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 15:00:15 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda Your feedback makes me realize that I took an overly simplistic view of the relationship between a framework and the components of Aries that it may use. I assumed that every framework got its SSI features from Aries core, rather than implementing them on its own. What you're making me realize is that it's possible for a framework to pick and choose--maybe for example getting resolvers from Aries core+core plugins, but getting KMS from its own internal constructs. Perhaps we need some slides that highlight this alternative possibility...

Re: JWS. Who knows this spec? Can anyone tell me where the verification key goes into the token? As far as I can see, a JWS has a header, dot, a base64url-encoded payload, dot, and a signature value. How to recover the verkey to try to verify the signature?

A query if anyone can help.
I have the **aca-py** agent up and running with the postgress db and it set up to connect to buldernet. 
I previously used https://selfserve.sovrin.org/ to ledger the DID as an Endorser, this is the public DID in the wallet which I can retrieve after startup.
Then I tried to create a Schema and I get this in the logs
```
aca-py_1     | 2019-10-25 16:45:25,530 indy.ledger DEBUG sign_and_submit_request: <<< res: '{"reason":"client request invalid: InvalidClientTaaAcceptanceError(\'Txn Author Agreement acceptance is required for ledger with id 1\',)","identifier":"8EscMmKWP89KZCYDotgneQ","reqId":1572021925105906503,"op":"REJECT"}'
``` 
What steps have I missed to setting up my agent?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 18:30:31 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead - can you help with this?  I think we have the TAA support in ACA-Py, so should be doable.

</p>
<p><strong>DibbsZA</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 18:35:37 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 18:36:42 GMT):<br/>
The agent should be run with `aca-py provision (wallet args, ledger args)`, then it will prompt for TAA acceptance
</p>
<p><strong>DibbsZA</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 18:38:56 GMT):<br/>
Doh! I skipped that part. 
For the args you mention, are they the same you would use for a normal start?

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 18:39:30 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>DibbsZA</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 20:10:35 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead How would one do the provisioning if aca-py is inside a container?

I tried starting the container with attach and interactive, but I still get this 
```

In the aries-framework-dotnet the provisioning configurations all report "This class will no longer be used" but that's what's in the docs. Is there something updated I'm missing?
</p>
<p><strong>magicindustries</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 09:40:29 GMT):<br/>
ah never mind, finally found this "If you are using Indy SDK today to build a decentralized identity solution, keep doing so for the time being. Aries is not yet mature enough to build upon, but when it gets there, a reasonable transition process will be provided, and announcements will be made in community channels."  I will keep an eye on the channel but keep building directly with libindy
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 14:28:09 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 19:11:22 GMT):<br/>
@sklump the `jwk` header is better IMO: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.3

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 20:15:48 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 20:33:23 GMT):<br/>
@magicindustries - it depends on what you are doing. If you are creating a PoC that only involves your own code, it's fine to use libindy and your own design. If you want to do something that interoperates with other code bases (agents), then you need to use the concepts in the Aries RFCs. And if you are building on Aries, then you might want to consider aries-cloudagent-python or aries-framework-dotnet as completed implementations that you can use as a black box.

I personally think you will get a lot farther a lot faster if you use an existing Aries agent. Both of those code bases come with 2 years of experience building on the indy-sdk.  The python implementation is a second iteration where we started the new version from a blank repo.
</p>
<p><strong>mxs1491</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 21:46:57 GMT):<br/>
Daniel, does this same framework hold for an embedded or resource constrained device?  In general I should think so, but are there any special considerations that will be needed in addition?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 21:49:29 GMT):<br/>
I haven't thought that through very deeply. In general, I would guess that the answer is "yes, it applies". Part of the reason to have a plugin model is that it lets you select different implementations depending on the needs of your platform. For example, we don't want everyone depending on postgres KMS (even though that's an excellent KMS plugin for enterprise servers); we want an embedded platform to be able to use flash memory or something else that's equally light.

But I'm sure there are interesting angles to your question that we should reflect in the diagrams before we're fully happy.
</p>
<p><strong>magicindustries</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 10:33:34 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran thanks for that. I guess it's a bit hard to tell what's complete and what's not at the moment, the docs have code in them that doesn't seem to be applicable any more. I'd like to use the dotnet aries agent but one thing that's hard to find clarity on amongst all the moving projects and repos - does/will Aries cover the basic agent functions like wallet management, secret storage, did generation etc, or is it purely for credential exchange flows?
</p>
<p><strong>magicindustries</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 10:34:35 GMT):<br/>
I have a slightly odd use case so I have to take the instructions and modify them to suit, which makes it difficult not know what docs are up to date etc.  And how does Aries tie in with libVCX?

<p><strong>prieblinger</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 08:07:55 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I suppose what I am looking at is a RFC on item 2. For the features we want to request, I think that extending RFC-0037: Present Proof Protocol would be the thing to do. 

One thing I am currently struggling with is that the RFC0037 only mentions attributes in the presentation preview (= where requested proof elements are listed), it leaves out credentials and openid, which are used in the DID credential manifest (https://github.com/decentralized-identity/credential-manifest/blob/master/explainer.md), which we would like to merge into this for our feature request RFC. Would it be make sense to you to pull the "type" differentiation for proof elements into my RFC, extending the RFC0037 even further? 
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:32:01 GMT):<br/>
Has anyone looking into trying to use aries messaging for sending files? Would this need a new protocol?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:01:11 GMT):<br/>
Yes - in the two "complete" (nothing is ever complete), all of those functions are covered.  This document that lists the implemented Aries RFCs in ACA-Py (Python implementation) gives a good feel for what's implemented, and the linked RFCs define in detail exactly what each supported feature includes.  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/SupportedRFCs.md
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:02:59 GMT):<br/>
Some, including work at putting images in credentials (@sklump did that).  The ~attach decorator is can handled files, but is not an explicit file exchange protocol.  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:04:03 GMT):<br/>
libVCX does not currently play well with Aries, but I'm told work is happening now to make it work with Aries. @esplinr would have more details.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:48:53 GMT):<br/>
@prieblinger : I don't know enough about what you're imagining to give you an intelligent answer. Maybe share an RFC draft and I can give better feedback?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:37:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking this might be a separate protocol from 0037 that is used to negotiate what proof request to generate.  I'm thinking something along the lines of 0214 - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0214-help-me-discover, but about what credentials the issuer has.


</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:38:21 GMT):<br/>
That would make it a "business protocol" and definitely out of the realm of Ursa and being a crypto protocol.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:42:58 GMT):<br/>
I still would like to know about what guarantees that Indy gives between what was asked for in a request and what is "true" when the crypto returns a result. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:44:28 GMT):<br/>
In other words, can the Request include a super set of things, the holder prove the claims it has, and the proof still be "true"?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:45:54 GMT):<br/>
That's why the response to a proof request needs to include a "proof reconciliation". The proof in a response should be true or false on its own merits, but the relationship between the presented proof and the requested proof is a separate question that should *also* be evaluated by the library.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:37:32 GMT):<br/>
I think those should be separate though.  I want to know from the crypto what's correct, and the connection between the proof and proof request, since the later is not crypto related.

And to include support for value equalities, we need encode/decode built in. 

Those are the places things are not working right now.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:40:09 GMT):<br/>
If you use ~attach in indirect mode, you can signal to the receiver that there is content for them, but tell them they have to go download it from somewhere else, using a different protocol (e.g., HTTP, FTP, bittorrent). The DIDComm message should include a sha256 hash of the content so that when the content is fetched, there's a guarantee it has not been tampered with.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:48:02 GMT):<br/>
There is a sha256 slot in the attachment decorator for links mode

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 20:55:54 GMT):<br/>
This one might be a tricky one to do across all RFCs.  Basically, when the use of "wallet" means the mainstream use of the term ("digital wallet" as in Google Pay, Apple Pay and so on), we want to keep the term.  When the use of "wallet" means "storing keys and metadata for an agent", or what is called "wallet" in Indy, it needs to change to KMS.

Does that make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 20:57:16 GMT):<br/>

Re KMS, it might be worth updating the Sovrin Glossary too. Just a thought.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 21:32:04 GMT):<br/>
Regards KMS and the storage of credentials.  Per the call today, KMS is to be limited to keys and metadata. As I understood the discussion, that means DIDs and connections (in metadata), and creddefs. There may be some other misc. keys for the operation, and LOX holds the keys to the wallets.

Specifically excluded from KMS (from the discussion) are credentials. I would assume that the other major content we have with Aries (protocol state) would also be excluded.

For portability, the import/export functions are intended to enable moving your data, so that would have to include at least so that would include at least - DIDs, connections, creddefs, and credentials.

Questions:

0. Did I get that right?
1. Where do we expect credentials to go?
2. Is Aries Core going to opinionated about the APIs used to access the data that's needed but not in Aries?

I would be pretty suprised if we don't reference storage in the RFCs, and when we did that, the usual way was "wallet".  Could be wrong - we'll see.

Agree that 0050 is the place to start.  Note that 0050 is accepted, so I think this should be in addition to 0050 and we'll archive 0050 when appropriate.

As long as we are talking about wallets, kindly humour a naïf for a moment. Suppose a holder (say) has multiple agents (one per device, say). On storing a credential, one of these agents writes it to its wallet. What makes this credential subsequently available to the wallets of all other agents? Or is this a work in progress? I may have missed a whole lot of discussion on this sync problem; if so, I'd appreciate a link to it.

The work we are doing is intended to make it easier to migrate to Aries from LibVCX. But the Aries community has decided not to adopt the approach taken in LibVCX (implementing agent functionality as a C-callable library). I wouldn't recommend it for a new project.

@wip-abramson You might need a new protocol, but I'd use the attachments pattern over a new file encoding method. This allows better support from existing code, as well as easier protocol adoption.

I think that myself and other who have been working on architecture and code for Aries-KMS have done a bad job at explaining what a KMS is. There seems to be a lingering belief that KMS is just a rebranding of the name wallet but that is not true. I would invite the community to look over the Aries proposed architecture slides prepared by @danielhardman and take a look at what a KMS does. I am trying to make a RFC and a POC to show how this architecture would work at a personal level. It's a slow process since its a combined effort and gathering of information from different meetings.  Here is a table that i believe outlines some of the main differences that can show you how a KMS is not a wallet 
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:17:57 GMT):<br/>
```| Aries-KMS     | Indy-Wallet |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Securely creates, deletes, manages keys and their metadata| Securely creates, manages keys|
|Does NOT manage general storage|Manages general storage|
| Integrates with OS keystore / ACL / biometrics (LOX)|No LOX support|
| Leverages HMS / TEE / secure enclave when present |Is enclave like|
| Plugins for different persistence mechanisms   |Multi threadeding enforced |
| Plugins for different crypto approaches   |No puggable crypto|```

Suggest having every line be one issue.  I think the "Plugins for different..." and "Multi-threadening..." are two different attributes of the two solutions.  Right?

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:45:27 GMT):<br/>
This description of the current Indy Wallet is not accurate. Indy Wallet is not intended to be a place for general storage, and it already has pluggable persistence mechanisms.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:46:21 GMT):<br/>
Wouldn't non-secrets storage be "general". It's certainly being used that way.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:46:23 GMT):<br/>
We keep using the term LOX. I keep forgetting what it means. Can someone remind me?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:46:43 GMT):<br/>
It is often used that way, but it wasn't the intention.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:47:06 GMT):<br/>
Where should that be going?  I asked that on a previous note, but didn't get a response.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:47:16 GMT):<br/>
Somewhere outside the wallet. grin
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:47:19 GMT):<br/>
Just, somewhere else?

To be clear, I like the definition of Aries-KMS. I think it's better communicated that the Indy-Wallet. But I don't think the vision is that different.

Definitely communicated better, since I've been in the community for a long time and never knew that credentials shouldn't be going into indy-wallet :-)
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:49:06 GMT):<br/>
I know that some credential stuff is considered metadata for keys, but we put some credential stuff outside of the wallet storage. We were never very clear on that line. I'm glad we are improving that in Aries.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:49:51 GMT):<br/>
The question I have is does that data need to be encrypted?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:50:17 GMT):<br/>
Specifically, credentials and protocol state.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:50:21 GMT):<br/>
I think that is still one of the big open questions.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:50:43 GMT):<br/>
This is where I admit I'm not an architect, and let smarter people tell me the right answer. grin
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:52:08 GMT):<br/>
Pretty surprised that's a question. Since credentials are likely to contain PII, and protocol state is likely to contain credentials, then it seems to me that they should be encrypted at rest.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:52:46 GMT):<br/>
I would encrypt Credentials. Not sure what you mean by protocol state
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:53:41 GMT):<br/>
A tool for accessing various keychains or secure enclaves
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:54:34 GMT):<br/>
Again this conversation leads to me to belive that we don't have a clear picture and that it is worth waiting a week or even less for an RFC. Where we can openly discuss this 
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:55:57 GMT):<br/>
Google isn't helping me. Is it an Aries specific thing, or a general purpose thing?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:56:01 GMT):<br/>
When you run a protocol (e.g. Issue Credential, Present Proof, etc.) you have a sequence of async messages and you need to persist that state, so when the next message is processed, you can get the state. Generally, that includes the messages in the protocol instance.

Many of those messages will have credentials and other PII in them.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:56:23 GMT):<br/>
gotcha, then I would encrypt those as well
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:56:33 GMT):<br/>
It's an aries RFC hold on let me link you to it

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:57:19 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Cam. That's the level of information I needed.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:57:37 GMT):<br/>
If so, then I would recommend including that in some sort of storage managed by Aries.  KMS or another storage module.

Especially since credentials MUST be part of the export from an agent.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:57:56 GMT):<br/>
I can see four areas of data then to manage:

what             |   managed by
keys              |   KMS
protocol       |    wallet
credentials  |    wallet
other data   |   ????
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:59:02 GMT):<br/>
There is no storage thing called a "wallet".  A wallet is a mobile agent in the common parlance and we should not try to redefine it.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:59:31 GMT):<br/>
alright then a secure storage
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:59:55 GMT):<br/>
:-)
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 22:00:06 GMT):<br/>
It's really weird to have the implementation of a command line tool defined in an RFC. That seems like something that should go in an Aries Core / Aries-SDK set of libraries.
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 22:00:37 GMT):<br/>
It will. It will be part of KMS 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 22:01:59 GMT):<br/>
So maybe AMS and KMS will be used.

FYI - in ACA-Py, we have different implementations for secrets and non-secret storage.  We can use different plugins for each.  That sounds like we are talking about here.  All credentials go into "secrets", which I believe is defined by Indy.

Hi Team, I am trying to learn and understand the concepts of Aires and from what I have learnt is, using Aires, we can build agent apps which can support W3C standards (like verfiable credentials, dids etc.) and use these agent apps to interact with the underlying blockchain network which will be most likely Hyperledger Indy in this case. Now based on my understanding, I have below queries:
				
1) Is my understanding correct ? (Stated above)
2) How mature is Aries project ? If we want to start fresh development, should we consider using Indy SDK or go with Aries ?
3) Can we develop custom agent apps using Hyperledger Aries which can interact with any other underlying blockchain network ? (like Hyperledger fabric, R3 Corda etc. ?)
4) If yes, are there are any reference projects/artifacts which are using Aries with any other blockchain network ?

Yes, your understanding is correct. Aries is not super mature yet, although there are pockets of maturity in aries-cloudagent-python, aries-framework-dotnet, and maybe Aries-framework-go. Re reference integrations with a blockchain other than Indy, I know some work has been done against R3 and Ethereum, but I don't know if it's been packaged as a reference. Others will have to weigh in. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 15:55:46 GMT):<br/>
For 3 and 4, I'd say know.  We've talked about how it could be done now, and a planned architecture going forward, but there are no reference implementations.  The plans of the aries-framework-go team are probably closest there as they don't plan on building on the indy-sdk, but rather plan to support initially a different ledger (Fabric, I believe).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 18:03:00 GMT):<br/>
re: aries-framework-go. So far we included a ledger-agnostic DID resolver following https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/#bindings-https. In addition, a developer using the Go framework can inject their own DID resolver implementation when instantiating the framework.

re: fabric Externally, yes, we also have a Fabric ledger version of the Sidetree protocol (https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric). The Go framework integrates with the Sidetree implementation using the https binding interface (^^).
The Go framework's BDD tests also include steps that execute against a mock ledger that implements the Sidetree protocol.

The network must ideally retain enough information about issued credentials to provide data-driven metrics and analysis to node owners (I.e. number of creds issued of type X by node Y) - unsure at the moment if this must include PII. We'd like to use Aries for cred exchange and DID resolution as it is properly aligning itself with W3C specs and we feel that's essential for the utility of the greater vision. I am wondering if people in the community know of any projects that are trying something similar? 

Seems there are two glaring gaps in Aries at the moment: 1) Lack of non-Indy ledger support, 2) Lack of multi-ledger workflow support (I.e. resolving DID on ledger A, credential revocation status on ledger B). Is this accurate? Really appreciate any feedback. Including suggesting other forums / communities. Difficult to navigate

Our latest RFC might help with understanding the context of various projects (Indy, Aries, Ursa), other ledgers and so forth. 

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/README.md

In terms of getting support for more DID methods/ledgers etc ... we are a friendly group and would welcome folks in that would like to help build out these capabilities

All: we've recently had an RFC submitted that I would like to renumber. It's RFC 0289--a proposal about how to think about the self-sovereign and decentralized identity problem domain at the highest level of abstraction. Its main authors are Drummond Reed, John Jordan, Darrell O'Donnell, and Dan Gisolfi. (I am also a listed author, though I'm really more of a mechanical helper. I converted some graphics and assisted with git mechanics).

I think this particular RFC ought to be RFC 0001, because it explains the entire problem that Aries is trying to solve, and how a solution must involve layers of technology that includes DIDs at the bottom, DIDComm in the middle, protocols like credential exchange above that, and so forth. Other foundational concept RFCs like the ones about protocols, agents, and didcomm as a concept use similar small numbers.

Please separate this proposal about numbering from the question of whether the content of the RFC is correct. Undoubtedly there are things in this RFC that are not yet optimal, and we should fix those things using the normal process we go to when an RFC is proposed and the community begins looking at it. Until we are happy with it, I wouldn't advocate any status for the RFC other than PROPOSED. But I'm suggesting that the RFC number "0001" is appropriate for a doc that provides the overarching context / background for everything else in the repo, so I'd like to adjust the RFC's number and designate it as the place where we put our best consensus thinking about how to orient a person to the problem space that Aries has carved out for itself.

I will make this proposal again on a community call, but wanted to put it here in written form as well. Shall we let the proposal accumulate feedback for a couple weeks, as we have done for proposals about changing an RFC's status?

An idea to float to the group.  In the KMS discussions, it has been stated that verifiable credentials (and things like them, including protocol state) should not be in the KMS. Obviously, if that's the case (and it makes sense) we'll need another encrypted place to keep that data.  I'm wondering if that is actually in alignment with DIF's idea that hubs contain (among other things) verifiable credentials that are only accessed with owner-controlled keys.

Does that lead us to where Aries should have a local hub component?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:24:46 GMT):<br/>
- I think Aries should have a local hub component and structured as being syncable to a remote hub.
- I think KMS supports this hub component by enabling owner-controlled access / encryption.
</p>

- I think Aries should have a local hub component and structured as being syncable to a remote hub.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:25:50 GMT):<br/>
With that comes three other topics: Getting a new device, Losing my device, Multiple devices.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:51:45 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is KMS should only manage/store keys... It can sync the storage with a local hub if needed. Other artifacts should be managed by a separate service, I believe vrdi component is meant to be this service
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:52:35 GMT):<br/>
correct :) 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:52:46 GMT):<br/>
vrdi is intended to be the ledger interface, but I hadn't thought of it for storing VCs.  I definitely didn't see it handling protocol state, which must be encrypted.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:52:46 GMT):<br/>
👍
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:53:38 GMT):<br/>
It can use the crypto service to encrypt its artifacts
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:54:24 GMT):<br/>
Sure, but it's not part of vrdi, I don't think.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:54:37 GMT):<br/>
Protocol state should be managed by a separate component maybe if vrdi is not meant to manage them
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:54:45 GMT):<br/>
it could be the vdri or it could be another service to use as general storage for credentials or whatever artifact your blockchain stores
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:55:49 GMT):<br/>
Isn't blockchain supposed to store peer DIDs only?
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:56:13 GMT):<br/>
what you store in general storage is not up to the KMS 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:56:58 GMT):<br/>
Agreed, KMS should only deal with keys, to my understanding
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:57:28 GMT):<br/>
And it has its own underlying storage
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:57:45 GMT):<br/>
I'm agreeing with the KMS part. I'm questioning where the other encrypted data that must be stored should go.  I don't see it as vdri.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:57:46 GMT):<br/>
Separate from the general storage
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:00:56 GMT):<br/>
vdri-storage ?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:01:08 GMT):<br/>
For KMS, in Aries framework go,we intend to have two separate storages, one as a keystore and another, metadatstore, for persisting keys relationships (private/public key references +signing/encryption key references)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:01:53 GMT):<br/>
Yeah..vdri can have its own store... 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:02:36 GMT):<br/>
VDR is for the ledger - it's in the W3C standard. Nothing (AFAIK) to do with the storage that we're talking about. 

And, it does align with what DIF talks about with hubs, I think.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:03:11 GMT):<br/>
Verifiable Data Registry - it's for the DIDs and DIDDocs, and other metadata from a public ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:03:19 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:04:47 GMT):<br/>
is protocol state meant to be part of VDRi?
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:04:54 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:05:16 GMT):<br/>
then it should be in its own storage
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:05:31 GMT):<br/>
I don't think protocol state fits under any of the stores in the pluggable component layer

<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:13:20 GMT):<br/>
we intend to
but as far as I understand the plugin interfaces themselves are uncertain as yet
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:14:35 GMT):<br/>
crypto component is pluggable in the Aries go version we have.. only that they must be implemented in Go.. we haven't implemented the more general (C-Callable) plugins yet 
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:15:16 GMT):<br/>
we should probably find a way to merge our efforts here. We want kms to be as solid and adoptable as possible 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:15:40 GMT):<br/>
and our interface is custom for now.. as we don't have a community interface to follow
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:16:30 GMT):<br/>
sure.. it does make sense to have 1 interface for Crypto another for KMS, VRDi, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:17:36 GMT):<br/>
for crypto we certainly need plugins for HSM and for wasm
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:17:48 GMT):<br/>
We plan to allow plugable crypto as an option, in addition to native Go crypto.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:17:59 GMT):<br/>
same for kms
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:18:59 GMT):<br/>
Note: this requires creating a C-Go wrapper of C callable plugin interface and exposing the Go interface to the framework.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:19:09 GMT):<br/>
come to think of it, my current concern with the design is that the KMS and crypto service are split, when both need to touch secrets
unless the KMS is supposed to rely on the crypto service interface for all key wrapping etc
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:19:37 GMT):<br/>
meaning we want to make sure the API surface is well aligned :)
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:20:00 GMT):<br/>
my design of the KMS includes a plugable crypto layer 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:32:11 GMT):<br/>
yes definitely
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:35:57 GMT):<br/>
@cam-parra since KMS is responsible for managing keys... wouldn't the Crypto service the one depending on it to get/store/update keys? i don't see why we would plug a Crypto service into KMS
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:38:15 GMT):<br/>
I would rather say the Crypto service has a pluggable KMS layer, what do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:44:08 GMT):<br/>
KMS has a pluggable Crypto.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:44:08 GMT):<br/>
I think of it as KMS having a pluggable Crypto.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:50:39 GMT):<br/>
then this Crypto service should be used to encrypt/protect keys in the storage.. this would be a different service than the one use for Encrypting/Decrypting a DIDComm envelope
</p>

right?
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:52:03 GMT):<br/>
we have key wrapping, if I understand correctly that goes through LOX, and then we have the keys in the KMS being used in crypto operations
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:54:04 GMT):<br/>
but i see the crypto operations as the ones needing the KMS to `get` the keys 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:54:04 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:58:42 GMT):<br/>
and that's fine, because key wrapping uses a key from LOX
so you don't get a circular dependency

This is me being in way over my head, but seeing a pattern.

Can you make the native go implementation so that it is pluggable?

In the indy wallet, a native and pluggable implementation was created and our devs found it to be a pain in the butt. Two paths to support, to sets of tests (but the pluggable tests not created...) and so on.  

From that I took that having only a pluggable implementation as a preferred approach.  Does that apply here?

Great discussion... sorry to jump in kind of late. I split my time with other reponsibilities at Kiva and the community. 
Anyways my question is: should we design the interface for these various layers in our KMS RFC? if so could we set a time where we can do this. I think @MALodder could really help us with the crypto layer api as well
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 20:33:27 GMT):<br/>
I think we're saying the same thing, so all good.

You have one crypto API and you can have plugins that implement that API. One plugin is the native go implementation.

The indy design was two APIs, one API to a "native driver" and another to a pluggable API, with several plugin implementations.  The two APIs was (IMHO) bad.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 20:34:13 GMT):<br/>
Yup - all good.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 01:34:13 GMT):<br/>
It sounds to me like some of the foregoing discussion mixes pluggability issues at multiple levels or layers.

Big Aries subsystems are things like VDRI, KMS, and Creds. Each of these big subsystems needs to see the other subsystems through abstract interfaces, without worrying about the details of how they are implemented--and each also needs plugin capability such that we can supply the features of that subsytem in different ways. So, for example, we ought to be able to plug different implementations into the Creds subsystem, so we can support various flavors and versions of credentials in a single process or product.

As I understand it from comments by @troyronda , there's another kind of pluggability that's also desirable, which is replacing entire subsystems. That is, the subsystem of Aries that supplies KMS features could be either built using Go, or built using Rust. This is an interesting feature, and I get why it is desirable--but I don't think it's the same pluggability as the other one I just defined.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 02:02:38 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I think I am missing the nuance. The Go framework plans to allow each of these subsystems to be replaced (pluggable). These pluggable interfaces are exposed individually for each subsystem. The interfaces are exposed as Go, but a c-callable library can be wrapped into this interface. Hence either Go code or Rust code can be plugged into each subsystem interface.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 02:26:19 GMT):<br/>
I will also argue that it is beneficial for the larger community to enable development beyond rust. The rust sub-components will be much less useful / interesting if we can’t mix-in.

I will also argue that it is beneficial for the larger community to enable development beyond rust. The rust sub-components will be much less useful / interesting if we can’t mix-in efforts from other languages. In our case Go ... (and also hopefully WebAssembly also becomes an option).

I'm not arguing against the strategy the Go framework is taking. I am saying it is an additional type of plugin, over and above the other type of plugin that's contemplated. The other type of plugin isn't a plugin of KMS or VDRI; it's a plugin of a service layer below KMS or VDRI that has no public interface--only a contract with its KMS or VDRI host.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 05:00:23 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps the difference would be best illustrated by a more concrete example. Suppose I am writing an agent. I begin with features for the encryption envelope and message routing. Maybe I implement them in F# from scratch. Now I would like to use Aries to improve my feature set in 2 ways:

1. I'd like to replace the informal key management that I have been doing with something more structured and spec-compliant, leveraging the Aries KMS.

2. I'd like to implement credential exchange, say using JWT credentials.

It seems to me that plugins could help me in two different ways.

Approach A: I introduce a dependency between my F# codebase and Aries core. This gives me standard C-callable interfaces for a KMS component and a Cred component. I then have to choose which plugin *underneath* these codebases I will activate to give Aries core the flavor I want. These plugins are libraries that I can either static link against, or install and link dynamically at runtime. I don't care what interface they provide, because I don't see any of it; the generic KMS component and Cred component call these plugins for me, as an indirect result of the C-callable functions I invoke against the generic KMS and Cred interfaces. I decide I will activate the plugin for JWT creds, and the plugin that activates mongo-DB-based persistence for KMS. 

Approach B: I don't care if there is such a thing as Aries core, except as a theoretical concept on paper. I consume an implementation of KMS that suits me, and an implementation of Creds that suits me. Alternative implementations of subsystems may or may not have a common generic interface; that's an uninteresting detail as well. Subsystem plugins like this bind tightly to specific details like which programming language's ABI [no, that's not a typo of "API"] they support, which persistence technology is behind the KMS, which cred ecosystem they use, which blockchain they like, etc.

I'm not arguing for or against either approach here; I see that each of them has pros and cons. I'm just trying to highlight the difference. Did I clarify enough to accomplish that?

VDRI = "verifiable data registry interface". This is not the thing that contains credentials; it's the thing outside your local storage that you check when you want to know if credentials are valid. In other words, VDRI is the interface to a blockchain, IPFS, or something similar.

I think @swcurran is correct that we need an additional component that occupies the same logical spot as data hubs. However, I don't think it needs to be very sophisticated for now. For example, a simple folder on disk would provide a reasonable (though somewhat feature-restricted) starting impl.

This idea of needing additional components, one of which might be a "hub" thing, is mentioned on this slide in the red text: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L5L4QcZOATrn9rj4bEMmlbvij9XWyqgQRoWO-HNiUGw/edit#slide=id.g6f6594a78a_0_91

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 05:15:22 GMT):<br/>
I think it does need to be encrypted (PII in the common case), so that involves keys, and it needs to be part of both backup and restore and export/import, as without it, the "Digital Wallet" is not backed up or portable.  So I think it very quickly needs to be more complicated.

As well, the place to keep the protocol state also needs to be put somewhere, needs to be fast, and needs to encrypted, as it too will hold PII in the common case.  This does not need to be part of the export/import process.

I would also suggest that the additional component may desire to use the same backing store as KMS (and that could be a locking in-process DB like LevelDB). It would be beneficial if the storage could be injected into KMS rather than KMS wrapping a storage.

FYI: I've been working to extend the original did-spec work into a concept called Universal Digital Identifiers (Universal DIDs). In addition, I’ve started building an end-to-end platform and network that instantiates these capabilities called the Trusted Digital Web (TDW).

I've just published a fairly extensive #whitepaper (60 pages) describing the #TrustedDigitalWeb project.  The Preview Draft can be found here: https://hyperonomy.com/2019/11/06/trusted-digital-web-whitepaper/

Feedback is welcome.

Hi Team, Need some information on creating and resolving DIDs. 
Actually I want to implement a custom Identity platform based on SSI standards with an underlying DLT platform (permissioned one, but not finalized it yet). To achieve this, wanted to understand, can we make our own custom DID method for creating DIDs for this platform or should we use existing DID methods (like sovrin,uPort etc.)

If you are running a seperate network, then you have to register a new DID method so that the resolution of that uniquly points to your network. 
If you new network is a copy/past of an existing one then you can cookie cutter the current specification (with anme change) UNLESS your network implements specific new rules or crypto etc

<p><strong>DibbsZA</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 13:17:56 GMT):<br/>
According to Sov DID spec:
```
Namestring Generation Method
The 16-byte uuid underlying a Sovrin DID can be generated in various ways--using standard uuid methods, for example, or by selecting the first 16 bytes of a 256 bit Ed25519 verification key (the public portion of the key pair). In the latter case, there may or may not be an active verification key for the identity owner; that information is only available in the key descriptions in the owner section of the DID Document.

A convenient regex to match sov DIDs is:

^[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{21,22}$

A convenient regex to match the entire did string is:

^did:sov:[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{21,22}(?<namespace>(?::\w[-\w]*)*)$

There is no "ARIES" method as Aries is meant to enable multiple network support. 
Aries would just call a DID create method provided by the underlying network connector.

Hey Guys
I have two questions regarding the Aries-Cloudagent-Python(https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python)

My run command: `aca-py start --inbound-transport http 0.0.0.0 8080 --outbound-transport http --invite --admin 0.0.0.0 8100 --admin-insecure-mode --seed $SEED --genesis-file ./genesis.txn`
1) After this request: `curl -X POST "http://localhost:8100/ledger/register-nym?did=V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f&verkey=GJ1SzoWzavQYfNL9XkaJdrQejfztN4XqdsiV4ct3LXKL" -H "accept: application/json"` i get a 403: Forbidden - where do i need permissons? (DID im using is a Trustee on the Testnet)

2)When trying to issue a Schema I get a "No instance provided for class: BaseLedger" error" (see screenshot)

It could be that im missing the Wallet-Parameters but then i would wonder how i can "store and create" new DIDs - In memory?

Im also just playing around with the Admin-API (which is awesome) so all the needed values should be there

Hey all, trying to catch back up on the latest changes of cloud agents with Aries. I have my aries-cloudagent-python container running but I 403 when I try to get the Verkey of my agent's DID from the ledger (i.e GET 
​/ledger​/did-verkey). Is that 403 due to the connection to the ledger? 
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 04:04:42 GMT):<br/>
It looks like it can raise that for two reasons, either because the ledger hasn't been configured (no genesis-url or genesis-file, or not using an Indy wallet) - or because the current public DID doesn't have permission to do that
</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 18:38:48 GMT):<br/>
Gotcha, I was looking into the container to find log entries, but could not find any. Do I need to use the ptvsd debugger to get a full readout?

I am using the AcaPy agent for the first time to issue a credential to the StreetCred app. 
I get the notification that a message has been received, but then I don't see anything in the app. No prompt, no credentials.

Great idea! That becomes a controller-generator, available in all languages supported by swagger.

FYI - the team building the go framework is using the same Admin API as aca-py, which means your generated controller has a decent chance of working with both implementations.  We've not done a lot to ensure that yet, but so far we're compatible.

Folks, per the discussion at last Wednesday's afternoon Aries WG call, we've submitted a PR to the aries-rfcs repo that defines in an RFC a process for establishing a version of Aries Stable, and proposes the contents for Aries Stable v1.0.0.  Please see the README in the PR for RFC 0302-aries-stable for details. Glad to hear thoughts from others about the process and about the contents of the first version.

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/d2e8df9d37a0622a0f013224023b41733fb377a5/concepts/0302-aries-stable/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 10 Nov 2019 05:48:47 GMT):<br/>
Note that Aries Stable denotes a suite of protocols ... it’s not “stable code” but a defined set of specific RFPs that an Aries agent can implement 
</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Sun, 10 Nov 2019 07:23:32 GMT):<br/>
It's has been working great so far! If this can be apart of the build process then everyone could use that as general controller logic across all languages Aries supports

On the topic of swagger gen clients, I would suggest using Autorest (https://github.com/Azure/autorest). It's a great tool with support for Authentication and much more. It's also easily integrated in CI.
(example https://github.com/streetcred-id/service-clients/blob/860d1eeb0a9f82f2c3d89f32e97e844bc1504372/azure-pipelines.yml#L44)

@andrew.whitehead can help.

FYI: Sean on our team (not sure he's on rocketchat yet) has been working on an aries-cloudcontroller-node project that might help. He's close to wrapping up a couple of projects using it, and building a third.  Very lightly documented at this time, so may not be too much help yet. You could ask Sean questions on github issues.

I also used the swagger client gen method with both Angular and dotNet. the only problem is that you tend to forget completely about the webhook that you have to implement and there is no easy generator for that.

Is the swagger not auto generated when the agent is compiled? Is the python code just not missing the relevant decorators?

@danielhardman @swcurran @brentzundel @kenebert I would like to provide you with a draft of the RFC on a procedure for proof negotiation, as described by me a while ago. You can find the draft on @CHempel 's Github, right here: https://github.com/CHempel-esatus/aries_draft/blob/master/Aries_RFC_draft.md
We are looking forward to your feedback on this before we make this a feature RFC. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 09:23:58 GMT):<br/>
@prieblinger : I did a quick scan, and what you are proposing makes pretty good sense to me. Some points of feedback:
1. Have you reconciled this work against similar work being done by Workday? If we can have one aligned mechanism instead of 2 competing ones, that would be desirable...
2. I think the response to the proof request needs to include something I'm calling a "proof reconciliation" which shows which of several valid paths to satisfy the proof request is the one taken by the prover.
3. The use of weights is mysterious to me. Aren't we assuming that you either do or do not satisfy the request (binary) rather than satisfying a request in some partial degree?
4. I don't get the openid stuff. Need more explanation/commentary about that.
5. How can you deal with self-attested attributes that have no other source than the prover's say-so?

</p>
<p><strong>prieblinger</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 09:46:32 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for your feedback, we appreciate that!
1. That's a valid point. We don't want no redundancy. Can you point me to the content you are referring to? I'm having trouble finding it on my own.
2. We will think about how we can implement this and come back to you.
3. Weights come into play when talking about OR-connected attributes, like "you can provide a passport *or* a driver's license". The weight is meant to enable the verifier to express that they prefer one of the options over the other.
4. The openid-thingy was taken from the Credential Manifest. I think it includes access to OAUTH into a proof. It is not relevant for the scope of this RFC draft, so we might just kick it out to prevent confusion.
5. As we are talking about the negotiation of a proof here, I was considering self-attested attributes as undesired and out-of-scope, as we are only talking about provable attributes. Am I wrong in this?

*Naïve question*
Suppose Alice has two Aries agents (e.g., laptop, mobile). Alice gets a credential via her laptop agent. What is the process by which she can use this credential with her mobile agent? What RFCs/discussions should I be looking at to understand how distinct wallets sync up for the same holder? Or is the assumption that they share a wallet in the cloud?

Hi All, I've been wading through documentation and demos for a few days now (which are really impressive), just want to confirm what we intend is possible.

A team of us at PwC aim to build a PoC to confirm the hash for a certificate has been included in a BTC transactions, then issue a verifiable certificate to a Connect.me wallet.  We plan to have an agent (running a Dockerised version of `aries-cloudagent-python`) and a controller (a NodeJs app running in a separate process sending HTTP requests to agent).  Could anyone confirm that this approach is feasible.  Some concerns we have are:

1. Will we be able to communicate between the running instance of `aries-cloudagent-python` and the Connect.me wallet over DIDComm?  
2. Once the `aries-cloudagent-python` agent and the Connect.me wallet are connected, is it as simple as sending the like of a POST `/issue-credential/send` request to the agent and DIDComm will ensure it reaches Connect.me?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:46:39 GMT):<br/>
We haven't dealt with this topic yet in a specific technical implementation. Cloud wallet is obviously the most straightforward solution to cross device sync. Another option is to leverage vendor specific app data syncing that only works across iOS and Android devices. This means if you create the wallet in a location that the mobile OS considers app data, it will be synced in almost real time across user's devices. We've only briefly tested this with iOS and it seemed to work pretty well.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:49:18 GMT):<br/>
There are some challenges to be solved here, like which device gets the message from the mediator agent first, do all devices get push notification, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:51:13 GMT):<br/>
Does it look like a bits-to-bits duplication (since, by design, copying a credential is not a libindy feature)? Like I said, naïve question.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:52:18 GMT):<br/>
I remember at the Utah thing last February the vision was to have agents:wallets look like nodes:ledgers, but that was a stretch goal.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:53:59 GMT):<br/>
It's still a stretch goal. The app data syncing is just leveraging an existing feature mobile OS offer today and consider the wallet is just a sqlite file, the syncing can be done without much friction
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:54:36 GMT):<br/>
This is how apps sync data today in most scenarios
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:55:08 GMT):<br/>

The current Connect.Me isn't using DIDComm yet, so is not compatible with ACA-Py (`aries-cloudagent-python`), but I understand that the Evernym team is working on that with a new release expected shortly.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 14:47:23 GMT):<br/>
ACA-Py exposes an HTTP interface to a controller, which sounds like the app that will issue the credential. As such, yes, to issue the credential, you will just need to POST to `send` endpoint of your ACA-Py agent. There will some setup needed, but the bulk of your app will just do that.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 14:48:25 GMT):<br/>
We've got several examples of ACA-Py controllers in Python and node (and I think a bash script using curl :-) ).  You can use any language you want.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:37:40 GMT):<br/>
@sklump We have not had a good discussion about that yet, nor relationship sync between agents in the same scenario.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:51:30 GMT):<br/>
I think the idea of having agents:wallets look like nodes:ledgers has been abandoned. I think replication in some form is needed. Interesting about the mobile agent option at the OS level.  @tomislav - does that include the handling of the biometric-protected key to open the wallet?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:59:20 GMT):<br/>
In general, yes, this should work. The current build of Connect.Me and the current build of aries-cloudagent-python speak different variants of DIDComm, but by the time of the connectathon at the beginning of Dec, we expect that to be resolved.

You need an acapy expert to answer question 2.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:10:08 GMT):<br/>
BTW - we have a repo - `aries-cloudcontroller-node` that is a node controller for ACA-Py. It's brand new and not well enough documented, but it could be your starting point. We'll be polishing it over the next short while.

https://github.com/bcgov/aries-cloudcontroller-node
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:16:34 GMT):<br/>
Correct. The keys are synced through keychain syncing, which is technically different from app data syncing, but the result is the same.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:17:03 GMT):<br/>
keychain syncing outlives the app installation, which is great for key recovery
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:18:45 GMT):<br/>
This works well within agents produced by the same vendor, but doesn't well serve agents from different vendors.

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:32:09 GMT):<br/>
hi guys I have quick question, is there any RFC currently in Aries which covers request of encrypting decrypting content by the wallet (if not would make sens to create one).  The case here is that the Service provider does not have access to the keys. So the flow could be like this:
Service App sending request to Wallet to decrypt the payload - wallet get the request checks which key (fragment) is assigned to that service and use it to decrypt the payload and send it back. 

So wallet serves generic purpose of encrypting/decrypting stuff on demand. 
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:40:34 GMT):<br/>
I think you can achieve thos flow quite easily using the aca-py. You just need to create your own controller to talk to aca-py

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:50:25 GMT):<br/>
I believe the new terminology is key management service that does have access to the keys. Whoever encrypts/decrypts data must have access to keys. I view the wallet as an app
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:56:39 GMT):<br/>
I am just wondering if there is any protocol (message family?) which allows to have standardize feature within agent which provides feature of decrypt/encrypt of given payload  
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:57:10 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure if there are messages for handling encryption as a service in agents yet
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:57:39 GMT):<br/>
There is not, but this can be achieved by adding your own web hooks in aca-py
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:00:01 GMT):<br/>
True. To use the same agent on your iOS and Android device you would have to roll your own sync mechanic, or use cloud agents.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:11:52 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean by webhook? 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:12:30 GMT):<br/>
obviously knowing how to do it is one part letting everyone know to do same way is other and this is why thinking about RFC to cover that.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:13:15 GMT):<br/>
I am pretty sure that it should be on the level of the agent feature so you can discover it. 
</p>
<p><strong>ruairiq</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:14:34 GMT):<br/>
Also, is https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/connector-app the best place to find the most up to date Connect.me code?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:14:53 GMT):<br/>
I get your point, this can be a diff message type. What I was pointing is that you can add your own apis (web hooks) in the aca-py to call the pack/unpack wallet methods and then call them from your controller
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:15:26 GMT):<br/>
but the pack/unpack works against any key within did document? 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:15:36 GMT):<br/>
or it use the "master" keys?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:17:50 GMT):<br/>
Not any key, only works if the payload is encrypted by the aca-py wallet's public key
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:38:39 GMT):<br/>
ok so once more I am looking into use case where anyone (who I allow to) can request from my agent to encrypt or decrypt the payload 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:39:44 GMT):<br/>
any payload but in most cases I think it would be AES key or other key. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:40:59 GMT):<br/>
so let say that I am sending you a encrypted document which lands in your gmail inbox. Gmail is asking your wallet to decrypt the attachment to be able to show it to you. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:42:04 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam @dbluhm would be a good reference for how agents currently would do this
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:49:58 GMT):<br/>
Generally if I am not wrong as of now a single wallet cannot cater to multiple keys. Maybe what you need is a tweak of how routing keys work. So the cloud agent having a record for each service and its corresponding private key. And each time a different service can register itself with its private key. But then the user who is sending the encrypted message should also have a similar record of service and a corresponding public key. But why will I use a service to send an encrypted message? Why cant i simply connect with the recipient and do the message transfer directly? I am just trying to understand the use case.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 18:13:46 GMT):<br/>
That's the level of sync I think we need to discuss as a community.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 18:34:00 GMT):<br/>
The metadata (DIDs, state) and the public keys in a KMS should sync from agent to agent. The private keys in a KMS should not sync, though they could be backed up. This means that simple bitwise copy of a KMS's persisted storage will work for backup, but not for sync.

The use case which I am having in mind is a platform which allow you to send and archive your invoices. Each invoice is encrypted in a way that only receiver can open it. It is backed by blockchain for tracking who got what and when. To keep separation between service and identity - service does not want to see or touch the key which allow to open the document. Why not sending directly to the user/agent? The reason is simple not every agent is able to handle this type of service. e.g are not always online (mobile agent), you do not have proper storage to keep everything on your side etc. And I can think of other services base on same concept - encrypted storage, payment etc... So is just a simple feature for agent as a key keeper to be able to do to this simple encrypt/decrypt sign/verify methods which then unlock you everything else. And you are still in charge even if service is on AWS or hosted by 3rd party companies (like IM with e2e encryption - they provided service but are not able to spy on data flows). Does that make any sens in the context of what I asked?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 00:06:16 GMT):<br/>
It does. Though I want to contradict your point of "The reason is simple not every agent is able to handle this type of service. e.g are not always online (mobile agent)" - This is why we have a cloud agent for a mobile agent. The cloud agent stores the messages for the mobile edge agents which when becomes online, can then  get these messages from the cloud agent.

If I am wrong, when you try to create a public DID in Sovrin, thats when you assign a role of trust anchor. The step to create a public did in sovrin is manual where you need to mail the sovrin team with your public did and the role and need to sign some legal agreements. The demo does not need that. I may be wrong but thats what I understand.

That’s right, it uses the /register API endpoint of von-network to establish the DID as a trust anchor on a development ledger 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 07:59:44 GMT):<br/>
Yes the thing is that not always everyone would have cloud agent. Another thing is that using cloud agent in connection of data vaults is something which probably will be common (like storing you life time picture collection or documents) and this is exactly how you could secure it.

<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 10:11:00 GMT):<br/>
But if Faber is not a Trust Anchor, then how come it has the capability to issue a credential to Alice in the demo?
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 10:32:43 GMT):<br/>
I am interacting with the ledger using Swagger UI for the aries-faber-alice demo. After Faber sends in a credential offer, Alice has to send in a request corresponding to that offer. What I see, the credential exchange ids for the same process are different for both, and that's fine. I queried all offers made to Alice and it shows one such record having Faber. But when using the same exchange id, Alice is trying to send in a credential request to Faber, an error message "WalletItemNotFound" is displayed.
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 10:35:42 GMT):<br/>
Running one such instance of aries-cloudagent-python, the payload sent to /issue-credential/send-offer has a key "auto_issue" which is set to true by default. What does that mean?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 11:57:54 GMT):<br/>
The runner setup invokes the DID registration that anchors Faber to the ledger.

@mxs1491 It's mostly still a goal, with too little code to show for it. Several codebases work have beginning support for Peer DIDs, and can be used without the Indy ledger.

We are working on a use case where organizations interact via Aries and DIDcomm. Therefore, we'd like to the base the interaction on public DIDs. We configured the Aries agents with the "--public-invites" flag, such that we can initiate a connection just by giving the one agent the public DID of the other. However, still the connection is based on two new pairwise DIDs. This means also that the second agent does not learn the public DID of the other agent. Currently, we use a workaround that we use the Public DID as the label, but this is not ideal. Is there some configuration to no use new pairwise DIDs for every connection? 
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 07:29:45 GMT):<br/>
Another question I have is the following: In the ACA-Py demos the agent gets initialized with the Genesis transaction of the Indy network. I'm wondering if this a convenient fix for the demo or if this would be used in practice. AFAIK, the Aries agent itself does not verify the ledger itself, so we have to give him IPs (and keys?) of at least one trusted node. Is this correct? Is there any other reason for giving the genesis transaction to the agent?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 14:42:18 GMT):<br/>
The genesis transaction is used to inform the agent of how to communicate with the nodes of the ledger. This is how the Indy SDK loads information about a ledger so if you're looking for more detail on the reasoning, #indy-sdk is probably the channel to ask in.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 14:50:27 GMT):<br/>
How do you intend to use the Public DID(s) in the interactions between these two agents? If you want one agent to know that the other is a specific organization or that it owns the Public DID, you can prove that with a verifiable credential and a proof of ownership of the DID. The use of pairwise identifiers for communication even between two public entities helps to reduce linkability and in general that is desirable but a little more detail of your use case may highlight why that isn't desirable in this case.

* Issue credential protocol.
* WebAssembly and WebSockets.
* Introduce protocol

thx. I dug a bit deeper. I think I was wrong on the claim that the Aries agent does not verify the ledger. I think the indy-sdk allows to verify the pool ledger based on the pool genesis transaction file. But I'll check in #indy-sdk

@danielhardman @TelegramSam As a continuance of the discussion in yesterday's WG call, it would be great to hear any updates or next steps to achieve DIDComm having wider interoperability and usage. (thinking about the project principle of shared protocol interoperability on slide 3). What's next for having more engagement with other communities like DIF?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 19:41:49 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda : Several of us are actively talking with DIF in various ways. Right now these are not formal channels, but informal ones, and the conversations are ad hoc (somebody sends an email here, a couple jump on a phone call there, etc). Feel free to do your own informal socializing.

The inhibitor is clarity around IPR issues. Rouven has some action items on that front; until those are completed, all conversations have to remain informal.

The operation deletes such records once it has completed the issue-cred protocol. Alic should have the cred in her wallet.

Using aries-cloudagent-python, when calling `/schemas` it submits a credential schema on behalf of the Agent's DID instead of taking a User's DID (i.e a non Agent-owned DID) essentially showing the Agent submitting the DID owns the schema. Is this by design?   
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:14:48 GMT):<br/>
There aren't any implementations that I know of. ACApy does have a very basic queue mechanism for return-routing messages that couldn't be delivered to an endpoint, but there's no way to inspect it. If there's enough interest the spec could be turned into an RFC

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:41:59 GMT):<br/>
That sounds more like endorsing a ledger transaction for another party? It's not something that has come up
</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:56:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes. So Pre-ACA, when I was hacking together an agent, I assumed the agent was an endorser (gatekeeper?) for the network so I would have my agent "sign off" on schemas and credential definitions submitted to ledger, then store the IDs in the submitter's wallet.  
This was working code from my previous agent to do this. 
```
    async def create_credential_schema(
        self,
        schema_name,
        schema_version,
        schemajson,
        tags=None,
        wallet_handle=None,
        pool_handle=None,
    ):
        try:
            did = await self.getwalletdid(wallet_handle)
            record_tags = {}
            schema_id, schema = await anoncreds.issuer_create_schema(
                did, schema_name, schema_version, schemajson
            )
            schema_request = await self._build_schema_request(did, schema)
            record_tags["schemaName"] = schema_name
            record_tags["schemaVersion"] = schema_version
            if tags:
                record_tags.update(tags)
            await ledger.sign_and_submit_request(
                pool_handle, wallet_handle, did, schema_request
            )
            await self.store_wallet_record(
                wallet_handle,
                self.cred_schema_record_type,
                schema_id,
                record_tags,
            )
            return schema_id
        except IndyError:
            log.exception("Error occured while creating schema")
            raise
        except Exception:
            log.exception("Error occured while creating schema")
            raise
```

<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 17:01:36 GMT):<br/>
ACA uses ledger.sign_and_submit_request when calling /schemas but uses its own DID as the submitter did and signing off in which returns its DID in the schema id. With my code example above, the Agent is signing off on the request but the schema request is built using the User's DID in turn returning the User's DID in the resulting schema id.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 17:39:47 GMT):<br/>
I only see one did used in that example

</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 17:56:01 GMT):<br/>
That DID being used is a User DID. Actually, I misspoke, the User DID is signing off on its own schema request in my code example. However, with /schemas call I cannot specify a User's DID to sign off on their created schema. 
</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 17:57:02 GMT):<br/>
Basically I would like to show a schema is owned by a User instead of a agent
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 17:57:48 GMT):<br/>
ACApy does not have the concept of users, there's just the agent and its associated DIDs
</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:23:36 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking the cloud agent acts moreso as a router. So it is responsible for storing various the  ID's in its wallet?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:29:05 GMT):<br/>
It could be an endorser and do what you would like, but there is currently no mechanism to do that - so it is by design that it doesn't currently support that.  I would think that would need to be some sort of DIDComm protocol to enable that.  A user agent would create, sign and send a "create schema" (or execute transaction) request, and the endorser agent would sign the request and send it to the ledger.

FYI - we had to do that sort of sequence manually to create some transactions on the Sovrin network and it was manual and painful. The process is documented here:

https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/blob/master/docs/Writing%20Transactions%20to%20a%20Ledger%20for%20an%20Un-privileged%20Author.md
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:29:51 GMT):<br/>
Another complication for this, at least on Sovrin. Payments are needed to execute writes on the Sovrin mainnet, and likely this protocol would have to take that into account.
</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:46:43 GMT):<br/>
In the service I was imagining, wallets and agents (other that an agent wallet used to store various routes) were loosely coupled. User's devices would have wallets and send schema, cred_def, creds or whatever kinda of requests to a cloud agent sitting behind a service API. The agent would   do things on behalf of a registered User's DID. This was possible because  a User's DID had to first be "registered" first by the Agent using a nym request, then the User's DID could create any other type build requests to send to ledger.

Unless there is some kind of security concern; I may fork ACA to see if it is possible because it is possible using the indy-sdk. I greatly appreciate the ACA, it makes it easier to not have to worry about agent code.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:55:40 GMT):<br/>
The controller API is basically for an administrator to direct ACApy, it sounds like you're talking about adding an additional API for to support users.
</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:59:32 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I guess so, unless I am using ACApy wrong. Now that I think about it, the only way I could access the API was to set an Admin port. Is there an API to access without turning on admin port?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 19:01:42 GMT):<br/>
That's why I'm suggesting you define a protocol for this. Then you are just using agent messaging - no need for a separate interface.  The protocol is the new API for doing what you are trying to do.
</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 19:57:04 GMT):<br/>
Hmm I will look into that.

General announcement from Manu Sporny, for all interested parties in the Aries community:

Hi all,

There have been a set of discussions happening over the past several
months across the DIF, Aries, IIW, RWoT, and W3C CCG communities related
to personal data storage (aka Identity Hubs, Encrypted Data Vaults,
Secure Data Hubs, Solid Pods, etc.).

I've been speaking with a number of people in each community and it
seems like there is momentum to avoid duplication of effort. Key
individuals in the various communities have agreed to participate in a
call on neutral territory to work on the following items:

1. Discuss a plan on how we work together.
2. Discuss where the work could happen.
3. Discuss the Intellectual Property regime for the work.

To be clear, this call will not involve any discussion concerning
Intellectual Property or technical details. The purpose of the call is
to come to consensus out how all three communities will work together on
a common foundational layer related to personal data storage.

Please come to the call if you have an opinion about how you would like
this personal data storage work to progress across these various
communities. Please share this message with anyone that you feel should
be on this upcoming call.

Reading the following documents will help prepare yourself for the call:

Hi guys, couple of days ago I mentioned about the need for crypto service in Agent from side of some projects which I am involved. I talked with few people about possible way to implement it including the pros and cons. Base on that I complied draft of RFC which I would like to challenge here . I would like to know what you think about it and if the purpose of that feature is clear enough. https://github.com/mitfik/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0312-crypto-service

Please let me know what do you think. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 10:21:29 GMT):<br/>
If topic would be interesting enough I can talk a bit about it during one of our tomorrow call @esplinr @TelegramSam (morning or evening does not matter) 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 17:18:02 GMT):<br/>
@mtfk the article looks like a good start to having a crypto-service protocol design. However, from reading it, it feels like it overlaps with KMS a lot and there needs to be some distinction drawn between the two.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 19:59:03 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder The boundary between a crypto service and a kms, as far as I see, is often blurry and inconsistent from one telling to the next - for example, the crypto service could be a collection of functions which consume the KMS and access secrets for crypto operations, or the crypto service could be in charge of wrapping secrets for storage and unwrapping them for use, with the KMS being a lower-privilege storage (that does metadata work like asking the crypto service to generate new keys when it's time to rotate, but never sees unwrapped secrets), or both might be provided by the same object, like an HSM, in which case the split between the interfaces is down to convenience

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:03:09 GMT):<br/>
@filip.burlacu I get that but the RFC mentions sending encrypted files. I get that the service is often in front of the KMS similar to an HSM/TEE but the RFC gives the idea that the service is acting like an agency and there is key exchange which feels like duplicated work from other RFCs which already define some of this
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:05:05 GMT):<br/>
good point, it looks like a crypto server that's at the very least on its own process
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:05:23 GMT):<br/>
Its muddled between what the service is doing and what the agent is doing
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:05:52 GMT):<br/>
okay a crypto server to me reads like a cloud HSM
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:06:03 GMT):<br/>
or an enterprise CMK
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:06:27 GMT):<br/>
I'm not opposed to standardizing this but the distinction should be clear
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:10:32 GMT):<br/>
do you see the agent <-> service coupling as being more loose, like microservices?
My assumption was that this would be tight, with plugins using C-callable APIs
but any user requiring looser coupling could implement the plugins using separate services behind a thin plugin in the agent executable itself
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:12:02 GMT):<br/>
the example that immediately comes to mind being an HSM plugin for the agent
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:16:09 GMT):<br/>
then with the RFC being meant to define the plugin interface, for aries agent/plugin interop, it shouldn't assume the plugins are loosely-coupled services, separate processes, whatever
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:17:08 GMT):<br/>
conversely neither should it assume that plugins are synchronous and nonblocking
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:27:31 GMT):<br/>
usually the service is tightly coupled with the KMS. The KMS can be wrapped in an agent or a KMS can act like a service for multiple agents. It depends on the use case, but I get where you're going with this

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:04:18 GMT):<br/>
As you noticed it is indeed a start. Overlapping with KMS/Lox is not intentionally basically I was thinking about extension for Lox in form of crypto-service which expose some crypto magic to the 3rd parties services. Basically the idea is to have features within agent which allow to use my KMS/Lox to lock/unlock stuff outside of the wallet. It could provide some more advance features like proxy re-encryption,  Shamir's Secret etc... So instead of letting developers include URSA into their products nor implement own stuff they could use user agent to do what is needed. This way keys never leaves user wallet/lox and speed up adoption of SSI within all sort of software. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:08:59 GMT):<br/>
that sounds like a extrapolation of LOX
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:09:08 GMT):<br/>
turning LOX into an agent
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:09:33 GMT):<br/>
is it bad? 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:10:29 GMT):<br/>
Not necessarily. LOX's purpose is to handle the authentication layer of an agent to storage and KMS. LOX should return a session handler to the caller who then handles it from there
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:11:05 GMT):<br/>
LOX can talk to another LOX if needed. To keep keys on a mobile agent you have an authentication protocol that doesn't involve sending keys or passwords
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:11:18 GMT):<br/>
like ZKPs 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:13:01 GMT):<br/>
the question how this can be exposed via Agent features. 
I could imagine that you login to a service where service ask your agent do you support "encryption/decryption" feature if so please tell me which key you are planning to use. Then each time when 3rd party service want's to encrypt something for you just send the message to your agent, agent already know that service and check if they have permission for this operation and encrypt stuff for them
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:14:32 GMT):<br/>
Okay this is very different than the RFC comes across. The RFC gives the impression to have the crypto service function as a crypto as a service layer in the agent. The CaaS can be integrated into the agent directly or as another microservice and the purpose of the RFC was to expose the crypto functions
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:14:45 GMT):<br/>
at least that's what I thought you meant by it
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:15:13 GMT):<br/>
for me "crypto as a service" is LOX which this service would use. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:15:41 GMT):<br/>
`crypto-service` just expose that in a form of feature (message family) which agent can talk with external world 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:16:08 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, I'm intrigued
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:18:58 GMT):<br/>
My idea behind LOX was to handle the storage and security of credentials to open agent storage and the KMS. The storage layer could be a postgres database and LOX would securely store the x509 certificate or username and password to log into postgres by storing those in a keyring or hsm. LOX passes the authentication stuff to the user to perform then uses those credentials to securely connect to postgres. At this point, LOX is done and returns the connection handle to the caller. The OS for example would prompt the user to enter their biometrics/password/access card separately from LOX which doesn't see those. LOX only knows if access was granted to the edge or not
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:19:20 GMT):<br/>
So you want to propose a message family if LOX was a service outside of the agent?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:22:32 GMT):<br/>
Basically that was one of the purpose to expose Lox to the outside so through the agent feature 3rd party services can use crypto to secure your assets without knowing your keys. As Lox can unlock it for you whenever you needs it.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:23:52 GMT):<br/>
One problem I foresee is when LOX is tightly coupled to the agent, there is no authentication between the agent and LOX. If LOX is separate, how does  LOX know what the remote agent know can access?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:24:12 GMT):<br/>
or are we talking about LOX-to-LOX communication?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:28:30 GMT):<br/>
Good question. I tried to find a mechanism for that, basically is all about permission saying how I know that this service can use my key to decrypt stuff or sign ... 
One of the solution which I could think of is as this:
- you register on a service K via did auth. 
- service K request to add to your did document their service endpoint with pub key dedicated for that service.
- when service wants to decode something for you sent a message to your agent with prove that they are owner of the pub key which was used in the registration process (could come directly from did document or in form of VC)
- agent can resolve that and confirm that the keys match and can do the operation.  
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:29:00 GMT):<br/>
Not sure if there is better way of doing it but seems like did doc and VC are best option to achieve simple permission mechanism 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:29:37 GMT):<br/>
Agreed
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:30:23 GMT):<br/>
So this a way of situating LOX to handle more complex stuff in a central way and having simple agents at the edge
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:30:43 GMT):<br/>
Agents at the edge will still need some crypto to perform did auth or VC
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:31:21 GMT):<br/>
If I were you, I would turn this RFC into a messaging one between the edge agent and their KMS
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:32:15 GMT):<br/>
My local agent may use Azure keyvault, AWS Cloud HSM as the KMS, but there is no defined method for agents to use CMKs yet
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:34:37 GMT):<br/>
Let's continue discussion tomorrow during the morning call. I am sure we can figure out how to do it right. Are you  able to join that call?

I'm not sure I understand what you are describing here.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 14:50:29 GMT):<br/>
DID Exchange requires both agents to have a reachable Inbound from the other Agent.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 14:51:46 GMT):<br/>
In this case, the Agent doesn't technically have a reachable endpoint. Except from the PoV that the Agent could "bootstrap" an endpoint on the mediator... but this needs to happen before DID Exchange and Route Coordination.

My connection during the Aries WG call wasn't great so I may not have got my point across re schema and CredDef implementations. The ZKP-related constructs should definitely remain with Ursa. However, there are a number of different implementations / scenarios that won't require ZKP and it would be nice to have a stable home for those discussions and subsequent implementations. In my humble opinion, the Aries WG should stay on course with the foundation architecture of the project. An Aries semantics WG could take care of all non-ZKP schema and CredDef implementations.

My connection during the Aries WG call wasn't great so I may not have got my point across re schema and CredDef implementations. The ZKP-related constructs should definitely remain with Ursa. However, there are a number of different implementations / scenarios that won't require ZKP and it would be nice to have a stable home for those discussions and subsequent implementations. In my humble opinion, the Aries WG should stay on course with the foundation architecture of the project. An Aries semantics WG could take care of all non-ZKP schema and CredDef use case implementations. (Thoughts? Bueller? Anyone?)

DID Exchange should support one agent without an inbound transport the same way the Connections Protocol does (and currently works between ACApy and the Toolbox): Return Routing.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 21:48:49 GMT):<br/>
the agent WITH inbound transport functions as the inviter, and places the websocket endpoint in the invitation.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 21:49:23 GMT):<br/>
the invitee opens the websocket connection to complete the protocol, and can receive return responses over the same connection.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 21:49:38 GMT):<br/>
How about a PR to fix that?  Hey, you already created it!  Thanks!

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 21:54:07 GMT):<br/>
Actually works both ways.  For example, either Streetcred agent can connect to another by letting the mediator know how to (return) route the message and putting the mediator endpoint in the invite. This was demonstrated at the end of the IIWBook demo flow.  The agents can also ask each other for proofs after connecting.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 23:12:38 GMT):<br/>
Thanks.. perfect. So with RFC92 (Return Routing), the edge agent declares that the WebSocket should be treated as duplex.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 23:13:28 GMT):<br/>
I assume that the edge agent endpoint field is then omitted from the exchange request in this situation?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 23:28:13 GMT):<br/>
In the edge agent-to-mediator relationship there is no endpoint needed.  The edge-to-edge relationships (e.g. Alice to Bob), the mediator's endpoint is provided.

Does that cover what you are asking?

Hi all,

It has been some days now since I started following the Hyperledger Aries documentation.
Its concept for creating decentralised identity is simple to understand and I hope also to implement.
So I thought we might use it for a production project for issuing credentials.

I know that Aries status is still Incubation, But is it safe to use it in a big production project?
one other thing, How long do you think it will take to be active ?
</p>
<p><strong>DibbsZA</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 10:06:27 GMT):<br/>
What is your timeline for your project @muddahany ? 
I am eager for it to mature too, but I think there are too many pieces still outstanding (and even undecided) for more than a POC at this stage.
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 12:25:31 GMT):<br/>
@muddahany Even, I have the same concerns over Aries, whether it can be used in production given its current status.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:58:53 GMT):<br/>
I think it depends on your use case. The code is solid, works very well and the community is active such that there is support if something isn't working as designed. So while it can be used in production (and BC Gov has a production app using it), it really depends on your use case. Mobile Agents are few and far between (but coming), so if you rely on that, and you aren't building it, you'll have a challenge. Long term viability is still unknown, although that's what we are building towards. If you want to be a leader in the field, this is the time, I think. But if not...

What names are being used for non-edge agents? I've seen "Cloud Agents" and "Enterprise Agents" so far.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:37:09 GMT):<br/>
E.g., https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/img/fig-3-agent-ecosystem.png has "Cloud Agent".
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:37:52 GMT):<br/>
Enterprise agents are definitely Edge Agents.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:38:14 GMT):<br/>
They aren't mobile but are edge.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:38:22 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Good to know, thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:38:31 GMT):<br/>
Would you call a mediator agent a "cloud agent"?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:38:56 GMT):<br/>
Yes - that's the understanding - mediators and relays are different from edge agents.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:39:09 GMT):<br/>
There is just not a concise word.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:39:13 GMT):<br/>
:-(
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:39:44 GMT):<br/>
And of course, you can merge different kinds of functionality into a single agent.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:39:50 GMT):<br/>
Yeh - I was hoping to attach a higher-level name to the "thing" that is doing mediation and relays :).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:41:31 GMT):<br/>
I have a fairly big chunk of a chapter of our aries online course on the various types of agents. But the community hasn't really settled on "Thing".
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:41:46 GMT):<br/>
Tried, but nothing has become de facto.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:42:31 GMT):<br/>
Closest is "Cloud" and "Edge" (Sovrin was first mover on that), and then you have to add the caveats that we just discussed above.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:42:54 GMT):<br/>
Gotcha.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:42:54 GMT):<br/>
Gotcha. Thanks as usual!
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 18:06:19 GMT):<br/>
So it looks like I end up with Edge Agent (User), Edge Agent (Enterprise), Cloud Agent. I had alternatively been thinking about categorizing as Edge Agent (User Device) vs everything server/cloud based.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 18:31:30 GMT):<br/>
I would disagree with the vs. everything.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 18:33:18 GMT):<br/>
Yeh. To be honest, it was mostly thoughts on code organization. :).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 18:37:15 GMT):<br/>
What you don't want to do is create dissonance between the developer conversations and business.  

But it ain't easy.

Enterprise also has two different flavours - the issuer/verifier (line of business) and the true agent of the enterprise, that holds the creds of the enterprise.  Much closer to the personal edge agent.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 18:38:45 GMT):<br/>
Agreed.

</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 23:35:39 GMT):<br/>
Enterprise Agent is usually high availability, holds keys, has fiduciary responsibility to the enterprise it serves, not typically controlled by a human.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 23:46:46 GMT):<br/>
On the latter, I wouldn't necessarily agree on "not typically controlled by a human".  I think for an enterprise agent that is other than an Issuer/Verifier - e.g. one that holds the credentials of the enterprise - it will have a controller piece of software, including a UI that is invoked as needed to facilitate decisions. Which is much like how a personal agent works on a mobile phone.

In other words, I think the handling model will be very similar.

Pure opinion though. I think that does impact the words we use.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 23:56:45 GMT):<br/>
I consider that 'remote control' by a human (UI) or by automation (controller). the UI bit is fuzzy, as it can be built in a variety of ways.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 23 Nov 2019 00:14:19 GMT):<br/>
IMHO - there is always a controller - it's just the number of decisions it makes vs. the number of times it presents a UI for a human to answer.  A mobile agent is a controller with a UI that defers to the human.

But now we are just splitting hairs :-)

Hi, Can anyone please help me to understand , the difference between dummy cloud agent, Indy agent (agent to agent protocol) and aries agent. My understanding is, dummy cloud agents acts as a cloud agents and does the communication between agents built using Libvcx. Aries agent can be configured to act as edge agents as well as cloud agents and can be configured indy ledger being used.Then why do we need libvcx integration here.  What about Indy-agent. Can we create both cloud and edge agents using this?

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 20:37:07 GMT):<br/>
@bansatya Indy Agent was superseded by Aries. Everything that was going on on that front has been migrated to Aries or discontinued. Aries today is more accurately defined as a collection of implementations that are striving to match the protocol defined in Aries RFCs. Using the codebases in Aries, you can implement cloud or edge agents. LibVCX was developed by Evernym and significant amounts of that work occurred before even the Indy Agent community had started up. It represents some of the earliest forays into Identity agents and as a result some of the approaches it takes don't align with thinking now commonly held within the community. Evernym is actively working to make libVCX Aries spec compatible. The dummy cloud agent fulfills a dependency in libVCX based agents in the simplest possible way. @esplinr can probably provide more detail on that if you're interested.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 21:01:48 GMT):<br/>
That's a pretty good summary @dbluhm . Dummy cloud agent is a testing tool. It acts as a cloud agent.

@dbluhm , Thanks for the summary. So, an agent can be build (that uses indy) without Libvcx using Aries (ACA-py). Is this correct understanding?
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 02:04:57 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @dbluhm . I understand that using Aries I can build my own agent (that uses Indy) and there is no dependency in libvcx. 
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 02:13:57 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr , we can build indy agents using libvcx. Can those communicate without dummy cloud agent? Because initialisation of a libvcx agent needs an agency URL which has to be the dummy cloud agent URL for successful communication. Apologies, for asking multiple questions on this. But, dependency of libvcx on other agents(ex. dummy cloud agent) is confusing me

LibVCX was designed by Evernym around the use cases in our products. It uses the mediator pattern to rely on the commercial Evernym Agency as a cloud agent for persistent connectivity. We contributed the Dummy Cloud agent to show how the Evernym Agency can be abstracted away, but I haven't seen anyone do the work to get it to communicate with a different cloud agent.

When there's only one credential issued for the corresponding revoc reg everything is fine.
But if I issue another credential, every following proof is verified as false.
I'll attach some code, using mainly the indy sdk and also some functions from the Aries Framework for .NET. The Agent is running inside a docker container based on ubuntu 18.04 as libindy 1.11.1 from https://repo.sovrin.org/sdk/deb xenial stable is used. Would be great if anyone can help.

We've put together the set of docs and demo code you can find here: 

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev

We plan to use that as the basis of an edX course that will extend the one just published about Indy, Aries and Ursa.  The material is not complete, but it gives you a decent start in using the aries-cloudagent-python.  Many of the same principles apply with aries-framework-dotnet, and aries-framework-go uses the same agent+controller architecture of ACA-Py.

This might seem dumb but with aries-cloudagent-python exposing every agent on a separate port altogether, is that a scalable solution at all?

@swcurran This might seem dumb but with aries-cloudagent-python exposing every agent on a separate port altogether, is that a scalable solution at all? I am not talking about an enterprise agent but a mobile one which has wide adoption in the general public.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 28 Nov 2019 18:46:26 GMT):<br/>
It depends on what you are doing and how you are configuring agents.  Seems like you have a specific design in mind?

We're using horizontal scaling for what we are building and that's working fine.

I pushed a PR to make the Aries envelope JWE compliant: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/334 .. hopefully we can enhance/improve the envelope structure and streamline interoperability between Aries agents..  @kdenhartog @danielhardman @troyronda

Hi All, I am exploring Aries and identity related concepts and have below doubts:

1) Is there any document/paper which explains how credentials are verified when presented to a verified? 
I understand that Ursa's cryptographic methods handles this for us, but want to know the underlying concepts of this verification.

2) Why do we need to store revocation registry along with a credential definition? 
As per my understanding, creds can be issued to multiple users from a same cred definition. Then if we revoke a cred def, will it revoke that credential for all the users?

Hi, I setup aries agent (python packages) and tried to access the admin endpoints. While it's being accessed within same machine, it 's working fine. However, while trying to access from remote machine, I am not getting the swagger UI even though required ports are open. Anyone face this sort of issues?
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 07:42:09 GMT):<br/>
HI, I am using python package, I started the agent using "aca-py start --inbound-transport http 0.0.0.0 8001 --outbound-transport http --admin 127.0.0.1 8000 --admin-insecure-mode --log-level debug" options. However, I could access the admin url only if I am accessing from local machine (ubuntu). However, if I use cloud terminal (ubuntu) to start the agent (with the respective port open) and then access same from local machine, I am not able to access. Any additional configuration is required for same? Can anyone share any thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 08:57:39 GMT):<br/>
Have you deployed your aries agent locally?
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 09:53:44 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 10:14:10 GMT):<br/>
In that case, those endpoints are only accessible remotely over a LAN and that too, only after you allow those particular ports to accept all incoming connections.
</p>
<p><strong>SwapnaliDive</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 10:16:29 GMT):<br/>
 Hey, Can we have more detailed document of aries aca-py to setup it locally and run it
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 10:16:36 GMT):<br/>
The port where this is configured are open for outside access. So, should be accessed remotely using IP and port
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 10:34:10 GMT):<br/>
With locally, I meant localhost. Is that the case?
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 10:34:10 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 10:34:10 GMT):<br/>
With locally, I meant either localhost or the Private IP. Is that the case?

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 12:54:06 GMT):<br/>
@CHempel This can be an issue with multiple things. Maintenance of the revoc file, usage of the revocation interval in proof request, updating the ledger with delta.
Can you provide more info on the specific usage?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 13:10:03 GMT):<br/>
@CHempel I would verify that the tails file is correctly created and updated after the second credential is issued. The flow in your code looks to be correct.
</p>
<p><strong>CHempel</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 13:15:11 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav when I revoke the second credential, proofs using the first credentials return true again.
When I issue another credential, same as before, all proofs return false. 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 13:16:33 GMT):<br/>
Do they return true even if you set the `timestamp` of the revocation in proof request to something way in the past?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 13:18:17 GMT):<br/>
Oh, I see what you're saying now
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 13:23:21 GMT):<br/>
Interesting. I don't think revocation has been tested extensively by the community, past simple issue/revoke scenarios.
Some agent implementation don't support revocation at all.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 13:24:01 GMT):<br/>
I would love to dive deeper into this. Perhaps create an integration unit test inside the aries framework .net testing out multiple issuance and revocation.

There was a very detailed description created by someone as they deployed it locally on MacOS.  Would that help?

https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/766fec3c7fdde5ee01ac432e2c6bd92ab929a111/demo/DemoMacOSRunLocalTLDR.md

The problem with that description is that it is so detailed, it is out of date re versions and so on, and we can't take on the burden of maintaining it.

<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 19:20:24 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog I think we may need to scrap multi-recipient messages entirely
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 19:23:50 GMT):<br/>
as far as I can tell, they only offer convenience
a recipient cannot be guaranteed that the other recipients received the same message, since a malicious sender could give one of its recipients a bad CEK, so they get a garbage message which fails to authenticate, while other recipients think the message was completely fine
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 19:47:13 GMT):<br/>
How is that fixed by splitting it into multiple messages?
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 19:54:24 GMT):<br/>
doesn't fix that, but it does get around a vulnerability
where any recipient of a multi-recipient message can send arbitrary messages impersonating the sender to any subset of the other recipients
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 19:55:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm saying that multi-recipient messages don't seem to offer anything with reliable guarantees over just sending multiple messages
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 20:14:36 GMT):<br/>
@filip.burlacu we are aware of the vulnerability you are citing, and as far as I can see there are two options

1. Different messages entirely so we have unique CEK's and ciphers per recipient (this exponentially increases the computation required to create a multi-recipient message)
2. Include a hash of the original message from the sender encrypted to each recipient along with the CEK which allows a recipient to confirm the cipher has not been swapped
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 20:20:48 GMT):<br/>
1. good point, the cost is multiplied by the number of recipients, which is a cost we'd have to bear unless we have a
2. good cryptographic guarantee
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 20:20:48 GMT):<br/>
1. good point, the cost is multiplied by the number of recipients, which is a cost we'd have to bear unless we have a
2. good cryptographic guarantee like this
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 20:22:24 GMT):<br/>
Correct, in-fact I think you could just hash the resulting cipher text and encrypt that per recipient like we do with the CEK
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 20:22:35 GMT):<br/>
Need to investigate further though
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 20:26:19 GMT):<br/>
I suggested encrypting the auth tag the same way we encrypt the CEK
since the auth tag is a hash construction anyway
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 20:28:01 GMT):<br/>
but encrypting a hash of the ciphertext is less ...bespoke
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 20:30:32 GMT):<br/>
We will explore a couple of options in regards to this and come back to the community with some suggestions
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 20:51:46 GMT):<br/>
How can the malicious recipient successfully impersonate the sender with arbitrary authcrypted msgs?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 23:23:15 GMT):<br/>
if the malicious recipient was able to decrypt the CEK (using the compromised recipient private key), then they can impersonate the sender with that CEK and the use of the corresponding JWE headers
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 23:25:55 GMT):<br/>
i'm more concerned about JWE compliance, how would this fit in a JWE, what field would be used for this `encrypted` hash
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 23:36:51 GMT):<br/>
I agree JWE compliance is very important to have. I intend to reach out to the author of the ECDH-1PU draft and ask if he would consider defining a new JOSE header field in the draft and describes its application in the context of ECDH-1PU
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 23:37:51 GMT):<br/>
Do you have any alternative approaches?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 23:46:04 GMT):<br/>
The ietf draft of ECDH-1PU does mention wrapping the contents with a JWS as a solution for forging vulnerabilities....

Why would a DIDComm router support the entire list of protocols? It's still a Hyperledger Aries Agent, acting in the mediator role.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries?msg=k8fgfF3un7zdNrFTt) A couple of nearby spots that are open at 8AM:
Enliten Bakery and Cafe: https://goo.gl/maps/xxs6zgFpPS8QxDDu8
The Spoon: https://goo.gl/maps/E6QxxCHPnyiQFtHf9
Guru's: https://goo.gl/maps/2JgEz6bbNMZNxHsU8
Not a sit down location but Provo Bakery is fantastic still: https://goo.gl/maps/2W9D1Jz1sDz1jMF9A
Another tiny place with only outdoor seating but great food is Hruska's Kolaches: https://goo.gl/maps/kM3jMHFst1wYMZbPA

Haven't personally tried Enliten or The Spoon but they seem decent.

We are looking at how well tink (https://github.com/google/tink) might fit into aries-framework-go.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:45:23 GMT):<br/>
Would that be an alternative to libsodium?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:55:41 GMT):<br/>
KMS will manage keys for the aries agent.. which can be plugged into to Tink
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:56:30 GMT):<br/>
Tink will be the keys interface to the agent.. with the help of key handles to be used in the agent (something like an ID of the key to be used for crypto operations)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:57:20 GMT):<br/>
i believe Tink has Chacha20Poly1305 key and crypto providers.. these are alternatives to libsodium
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:57:20 GMT):<br/>
i believe Tink has Chacha20Poly1305 key and crypto providers (or what they call Tink lingo primitives).. these are alternatives to libsodium. One can also create their own primitive (to call libsodium)

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:58:45 GMT):<br/>
We are particularly interested in a multi-language library (in our case Go), so we can retain a native Go implementation of aries-framework-go default packages.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:00:12 GMT):<br/>
Python and Java are among the other languages supported too

So that framework users can easily just fetch the Go package and use it; and so we can compile to other targets like WASM.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:36:26 GMT):<br/>
you are going for FIPS then Tink is not an option other than it does NIST approved algorithms because its not a FIPS approved library
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:36:26 GMT):<br/>
If you are going for FIPS then Tink is not an option other than it does NIST approved algorithms because its not a FIPS approved library
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:38:06 GMT):<br/>
not sure what you mean by `its not a FIPS approved library` .. AESGCM is a FIPS approved algorithm.. libraries implement the algorithm as per the specs
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:38:38 GMT):<br/>
right but implementations also need to be FIPS approved like OpenSSL or Microsofts NCrypt
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:38:56 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder is correct @Baha-sk .
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:38:57 GMT):<br/>
Java Crypto
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:39:31 GMT):<br/>
there aren't many because its expensive and grueling to get FIPS approved
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:39:50 GMT):<br/>
The goal should be FIPS algorithm usage and pluggable crypto implementations.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:40:08 GMT):<br/>
(obviously the default "out of the box" implementation is not FIPS approved).
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:40:55 GMT):<br/>
a common configuration is to have software wrap a FIPS approved component like hardware and call into that
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:41:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:41:28 GMT):<br/>
in this case, we don't have many options then
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:42:20 GMT):<br/>
NIST hasn't looked at verifiable credentials and mandated any signatures or implementations so for now its open

It could be possible to create cryptographic modules using a TEE that could be FIPS compliant. The main reason for FIPS compliant is either gov or healthcare

agree you... the goal is to create a pluggable Crypto and KMS modules where we can plug-in our own implementations that supports NIST/FIPS curve... but can also be replaced by modules that wrap a compliant library. The point is to offer flexibility to the framework user without constraints

I just wanted to repost a note that Ivan Herman sent to the W3C folks recently. Apparently there is a github handle `@context` (and I dunno, maybe `@id` and `@type` as well) -- so when they were having conversations in W3C github PR/issue streams and  used `@context`, a random person was getting tagged in the conversation. The owner of the `@context` github handle asked to not be tagged. The solution is to always encode `@context` inside the backticks so it's viewed as code by github, not as a reference to a github handle.

Since our community occasionally discusses JSON-LD's `@context`, and regularly mentions `@id` and `@type`, I thought we might want to observe the same etiquette.

Hyperledger has a new process for managing calendars. Administators of the mailing list group have the right to create calendar appointments. I requested to become an admin so that I could migrate the WG A and B calls to the new calendar. Hopefully my efforts are helpful. It would be great if others are admins and can manage this process.

In the last session of the connect-athon I asked the question why DIF is using regular signatures over the ZKP-based ones and the response was to avoid the three-step process of offer response and receive. The same for presentations here is why I don’t think that works, anything short of the three-step process is subject to forgeries and replay attacks because one side of the interaction needs to make sure that this is a new presentation or a new credential request that can only be guaranteed by getting a unique session ID like a nonce or random number from one of the parties which requires the three-step process. So unless they can address this in another way there is no difference between the ZKP-based approach and the simple signature based approach and this argument is not valid. Anything that works around this in a secure way can also be applied to the ZKP-based approach
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 23:29:01 GMT):<br/>
No arguments so far that I have found has been strong enough to sufficiently mandate the non-ZKP method over the ZKP method

@swcurran @TelegramSam 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 23:31:05 GMT):<br/>
If they claim to only want a two-step process that doesn’t address the uniqueness of forgeries and replay attacks then their solution is completely insecure
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 23:32:52 GMT):<br/>
There are very limited and effective secure cases of 1RTT
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 23:34:15 GMT):<br/>
I get that ZKP’s are not necessary for every use case. But the decision to use ZKP’s or not should be based on use case not capabilities and perceived benefits of round-trip times
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:06:26 GMT):<br/>
The advantage of the ZKP-based approach is that the cryptographers designed and approved the **protocol**. For those implementing the other approach using non-ZKP-based credentials have to invent their own protocol and then get it re-certified by security professionals

The advantage of the ZKP-based approach is that the cryptographers designed and approved the **protocol**. For those implementing the other approach using non-ZKP-based credentials have to invent their own protocol and then get it certified by security professionals
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:08:23 GMT):<br/>
I personally prefer a protocol designed by a cryptographer rather than a credential implementer
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:14:48 GMT):<br/>
Implemented typically have little to no experience designing security protocols 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:15:08 GMT):<br/>
And designing security protocols is hard
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:17:21 GMT):<br/>
It’s hard for even the cryptographers and security engineers to get right. Look at Z cash and Monero which were both designed by security professionals and the most recent vulnerability I just attended a talk on this:  https://crypto.stanford.edu/timings/

Is this nonce or session ID to be provided by the Holder?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:26:05 GMT):<br/>
Never. It must be supplied by the issuer during credential issuance or the verifier during presentation 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:28:07 GMT):<br/>
Issuer or verifier could specify ahead of time that a reliable source they trust could also serve as the random session Id or nonce like the current root hash of the ledger but then the holder must go to another source instead of the one he needs to
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:48:15 GMT):<br/>
I suppose an issuer or verifier could specify that the holder generate the random number that meets certain requirements but then both ZKP and non-ZKP methods can do that
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:49:44 GMT):<br/>
This approach then requires the issuer or verifier to track these to prevent replays and handle collisions of numbers between holders

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 02:47:33 GMT):<br/>
did:peer going to DIF is an entirely separate question, and its outcome is not obvious at the moment, though going to DIF is probably more than 50% likely.

The higher level protocols remain in Aries.

Hello, i saw this RFC: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/d2e8df9d37a0622a0f013224023b41733fb377a5/concepts/0302-aries-stable/README.md . Are there any prediction dates about the Aries Stable v1.0.0?

Hi, we’re planning on creating a new RFC for simplifying gaining access to a physical and virtual point or service.
The idea is to connect a MultiPartyInvitation with something that we call Transaction-ID.
Instead we will query for an existing connection matching the endpoint and routing keys in the MultiPartyInvitation.
If there is no existing connection it’ll be possible to accept the MultiPartyInvitation and connect.
This way it’s not required to create a new connection, for example when trying to login to an application.
The biggest benefits kick in after this.
The idea is to append a Transaction Record with a ProofRequest and or a CredentialOffer.
So, after sending a TransactionResponse from the receiving agent, the appended types will be sent automatically. This time using a direct connection, which was either already established or established in the steps before sending the TransactionResponse.
I’ll describe what’s happening in detail in an RFC draft within next week.
I’ve already implemented it on a fork of the Aries Framework for .NET and it’s going to be included in the Lissi Wallet App.
The fork of the Aries Framework for .NET can be found here: https://github.com/CHempel-esatus/aries-framework-dotnet/tree/feature/transaction
What do you all think about this new feature?

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 21:33:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm not quite clear what the intent is. Is it to create a workflow where you send a credential based on a previous presentation, or is it to authenticate based on established connection where discriminator is endpoint + key?
</p>
<p><strong>CHempel</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 21:53:10 GMT):<br/>
The main purpose is to send a proof request after scanning a qr code. Without establishing a new connection.

The QR Code content should look like:
http://endpoint?t_o=TRANSACTION_ID&c_i=BASE64_CONNECTION_INVITATION

On mobile look for a connection to endpoint + routing key.

Send Transaction Response to Endpoint using existing connection or establish new connection an send Response afterwards.

This way it's possible to map a multiparty invitation to a transaction. Like a Browser Session.

The possibility to send and attach something like a credential offer and or a proof request is useful in my opinion. This way you can automate these kind of workflows without changing the main workflow for normal connections.

Sounds like connectionless transport. Would the code scanning be an encoded presentation request?
</p>
<p><strong>s.weidenbach</strong> (Sat, 07 Dec 2019 09:22:48 GMT):<br/>
I like the feature because it keeps the amount of connections managable (the existing one can be used for multiple purposes) and the QR code remains small enaugh to scan it comfortably.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sat, 07 Dec 2019 14:56:25 GMT):<br/>
I think you can achieve the same functionality by using connectionless transport. A connection is not always needed to facilitate presentation, or even issuance of credentials. I'm still unclear on the exact use case for this, but I'd be happy to dive in deeper.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sat, 07 Dec 2019 14:58:07 GMT):<br/>
On the small QR code size, we are currently solving this by utilizing URL shortening services. You take a big URL, shorten it, and use that to encode a QR.
In LISSI, you would then scan the code, determine if it has required query params, if not, follow the URL once and get the redirect URL and process that one again.
</p>

Just saw this. I want to be sure @devin-fisher is aware, since is solving a similar problem. I would say that we need a general solution to the problem of trying to accomplish workflow X (e.g., request proof, but also lots of other stuff) independent of the connection status (we might already be connected, or we might not, but we just want to show you a QR code that kicks off the whole process and makes things run to completion). I think that may be a more general use case than what the proposed RFC targets.

Where is the best place to start if you want to DIDComm-enable a hub/data registry?  I've looked at: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm ...too conceptual.  Is there a good sample that uses DIDComm for something simple like the Alice Buys a Car scenario?  I significantly updated the documentation for original Getting Started Guide (https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-gsg-ea/blob/master/python/doc/getting_started-enterpise.md#scenario-alice-buys-a-car), so I understand the concepts.  The GSG used some initial ad-hoc messages.  What does a more formal version of these messages and message flows look like in a DIDComm context?

<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 16:09:47 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I was thinking of a concept that I called `Protocol Invite` (likely a bad name, so very tentatively calling that). Basically, it would be static, out-of-band data structure that would express that a protocol interaction could be started and may provide some additional data to help start that interaction.  

Additionally, this data could contain information that would allow the scan to find an already existing connection or provide info that would allow it to start the did exchange protocol. I was think of using a publicly resolvable DID that I public entity would associate with all pairwise DID. Using service endpoint and routing keys would not work for Evernym echo system since we use a common service endpoint for all users of our agents and we don't reuse routing keys so there would not way to match.

Another think we were thinking about is a alternative path of the DID exchange protocol. I calling it a redirect (also maybe bad name). But basically, if the invitee think that it already has a connection with the inviter, he could send a message redirecting to a already existing connection (maybe provide evidence that it controls that connection via signature). This would result in the protocol not forming a new exchange DID doc but redirecting to already existing connection.

Anyway, some thoughts. 
</p>
<p><strong>CHempel</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 16:59:05 GMT):<br/>
Correct me if I got this wrong, but this way you can use your public DID only in one agent?

@tomislav @andrew.whitehead - there is an issue on aries-cloudagent-python (PR https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/240) that needs to be resolved.  ACA-Py and aries-framework-dotnet are out of sync with the standard.  Can the two of you look at this and figure out how to resolve this?

Ideally, this would be done to be backwards compatible so that we can independently implement this change without breaking existing code.  Is that possible?

I've thought of a protocol that allows an agent to share proof of being related to a DID.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 18:56:34 GMT):<br/>
Th agent doesn't even have to 'own' the public DID necessarily, just prove that it's authorized for representation.
</p>
<p><strong>CHempel</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 19:09:46 GMT):<br/>
Ok I think I got it, so you want to match endpoint + DID?
Wouldn't it make sense to add the public DID to the connection invitation an the connection record  in that case?
So every agent has the possibility to query for an existing connection either by routing key or DID.

<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 22:33:19 GMT):<br/>
I believe what you're looking for is something called Verifiable Credential Authentication, or VCAuth for short. The British Columbia Government has created an implementation: https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc 
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 22:33:40 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran is who you're looking for :)

<p><strong>gcsfred2</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 22:35:25 GMT):<br/>
If you or anyone else has comments on my diagram - specially about the authentication part - feel free to do so. My initial question would be what is encoded in the QR code. My first thought was that somehow a  request-credential message is decoded by the mobile app, and that it sends an issue-credential message. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 22:35:40 GMT):<br/>
It uses:

- https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc as an Identity Provider that is called by an IAM like keycloak or gluu.
- That in turn uses ACA-Py to interact with the Mobile Agent.
- Currently only the Streetcred.id agent (IOS only) works with it, but others are coming Real Soon Now (we hope)
- Streetcred's agent is built on aries-framework-dotnet
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 22:37:06 GMT):<br/>
@gcsfred2 - the QR code is described in the presentation linked to from the instructions above.  It is a "request-presentation" method (not a request-credential per se), but that's the same concept that you are thinking about. 
</p>
<p><strong>gcsfred2</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 22:37:28 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 20:48:37 GMT):<br/>
is there any other toolbox which works out of box with aca-py? or any other UI?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 21:07:13 GMT):<br/>
There is the swagger UI that is described in the /demo folder.  There is the https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-toolbox that @TelegramSam  and @dbluhm developed.  I've not had a chance to play with it, but will Real Soon Now...
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 21:11:04 GMT):<br/>
I am aware of swagger and I am using it already but wanted to try aries-toolbox but don't get the connection between aries-toolbox and aca-py plugin what was the reasoning behind it. I think we would need to wait for @TelegramSam or @dbluhm to get a bit more info about that.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:49:22 GMT):<br/>
The toolbox works with ACApy out of the box, but with quite limited support.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:49:49 GMT):<br/>
We have developed a plugin for ACApy that can be loaded via an argument that adds additional protocols for administrative tasks.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:50:05 GMT):<br/>
So if you use the plugin, you can do more with ACApy.

@TelegramSam - please note that with 0.4.0 of ACA-Py, there is a change to how plugins are deployed. If you haven't already, please update to use the new approach.  Thanks

@swcurran do you have documentation on how to deploy ACA-Py on aws? if you do and can share that it be awesome :) 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 23:11:03 GMT):<br/>
but why a plugin instead of extending toolbox?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 23:12:04 GMT):<br/>
my understanding is that toolbox is just set of rest api calls which allow you to interact with the agent (isn't that the case?) Means if aca-py provides some features it should be added directly into toolbox to support aca-py agent

I don't think so. Lots about using docker locally and using OpenShift (k8s), but I don't think there is anything on AWS.  We've also deployed it to Digital Ocean, but I think a dev did that undercover, so I don't have the docs.  Sorry.

Hmm...also deployed by another dev I know to AWS, but he's out on an extended break until into 2020.

If you deploy it, please keep rough notes and let me know what you have.  I can polish and publish.

I going to make an Android mobile agent for a PoC. I'm not sure on how to do it as there is no aries sdk available for now. So my question is should i use libvcx or something else ?

Hi! I'm a bit confused on how the connection protocol would work on a mobile device. Let's the scenario where an edge agent (mobile) would want to register with an agency (running aca-py). I'm assuming the interaction happens like 1. Edge agent gets the invitation from the agency (say by visiting a particular endpoint that just churns out invitations for simplicity). 2. Edge agent receives the invitation 3. Edge agent accepts the invitation and sends a connection request (this requires an endpoint for the edge agent) 4. Agency responds with a connection-response and 5. Edge agent sends an ack. My question is why does the edge agent require an endpoint at step 3 if they can a duplex channel open say over WebSockets?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 15:20:06 GMT):<br/>
Fastest starting point is probably OSMA (Open Source Mobile Agent) - https://github.com/mattrglobal/osma
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 15:21:43 GMT):<br/>
It embeds the aries-framework-dotnet (formerly called agent-framework) into a Xamerin package that can be built for Android and IOS. I know that others have successfully deployed an Android agent based on that stack.
</p>
<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 15:23:19 GMT):<br/>
Seems to be a fair starting point

FYI: Aries Cloud Agent - Python Release 0..4.0 has been tagged and posted to PyPi. Release notes can be found here - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.4.0. 

This release has some internally breaking changes to the location of protocols and the handling of external plugins.  The `--protocol` start up parameter has been changed to `--plugin` to reflect the broader range of capabilities that can be added through plugins. Other changes include the unit test coverage being significantly increased, the demo apps now using the v1.0 credential exchange protocols and support added for requesting connection-less proofs.

Code reference documentation has been generated to ReadTheDocs - https://aries-cloud-agent-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

another related question is if the cloud agent is supposed to relay all the messages to the edge agent, wouldn't it have the ability to correlate all the pair-wise DIDs for a particular domain? If the cloud agent is provisioned by the agency, wouldn't this give the agency the ability to correlate pair-wise DIDs?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 17:12:26 GMT):<br/>
Short answer - yes. The idea is that the agency is semi-trusted - it can relay messages to (and optionally, from) the edge agent, but it can't see inside them - who they are from, what they are about. As such, it's possible to prevent it from learning a lot except about frequency and timing of messages.  That said, while we expect the mobile agent and the agency to be from the same vendor, it is definitely possible (because of the standardization of the protocols) for the mobile agent to be independent of the agency, to use multiple agencies, and even to receive and send messages for the same relationship using different agencies. Lots of options, depending on the use case.

how about this for an alternative: say the agency is serving `N` edge agents and it maintains `K` buckets (where `K` << `N`). Every edge agent subscribes to `k` out of `K` buckets where `k` depends on the DIDs it wants to receives communications for. On receiving a message, the agency determines the bucket it belongs to and broadcasts all edge agents the message. Now only the one having the private key for the message would be able to retrieve the actual message. Now while this is expensive on the network, it would prevent the agency from correlating DIDs. Is there anything that I'm overlooking here?

Hello devs of aries-framework-dotnet, you don't allow issues in your GitHub repo, so it is hard to tell you when something doesn't work. Using port 5037 as the grok control port makes add fail silently, making it difficult to develop mobile wallets in android that talk to your agent!

I'm writing an RFC that involves aries agents acting as relays, where the relayed message is transported over DIDComm on one side, and on some non-DIDComm channel/protocol. My question is, do the RFCs already define behaviour for such relays? For example, how to handle threading when you have DIDComm on one side and a duplex protocol on the other. Should I work on defining this myself?
</p>
<p><strong>jrallen</strong> (Mon, 16 Dec 2019 15:55:07 GMT):<br/>
Yes. ./scripts/start-web-agents.sh and web-agents-ngrok-config.yaml specifies port 5037 for grok control, which is the default port for adb. and adb silently hangs when talking to an HTTP server.

CRED_PREVIEW_TYPE = (

Why is this particular DID (did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg) always listed? Is it like a reference or there is something else to it?

<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 13:59:55 GMT):<br/>
That's because when the agent is started, the wallet is initialized with a context that contains the seed (core/conductor.py:131). The seed creates and saves the same DID in the wallet as was registered on the ledger (config/wallet.py:48, wallet/base.py:166, wallet/indy.py:338). The public did is read from the wallet (wallet/base.py:177, wallet/indy.py:377) when you do a GET request

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 16:24:35 GMT):<br/>
when we moved the repo over to Hyperledger, we didn't change the packages and namespaces immediately

osma is the only game in town for open source mobile agents. and yet Osma seems to be not actively maintained? Not criticising, just trying to understand what are realistic things I can/should build upon.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 16:26:09 GMT):<br/>
aries dotnet is actively maintained and we are building at least two commercial mobile agents on top of it.
I'd be happy to help you get started with it.
</p>
<p><strong>jrallen</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 16:26:28 GMT):<br/>
Also, I'm not understanding how "AgentFramework packages are obsolete" goes with "4.3.0 released last month".
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 16:27:02 GMT):<br/>
It means they will not receive updates. All updates are pushed to Hyperledger.Aries packages
</p>
<p><strong>jrallen</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 16:27:14 GMT):<br/>
I'm having good success with the server-side agent. I'm having trouble understanding where the focus of community effort related to mobile agents are.
</p>
<p><strong>jrallen</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 16:27:47 GMT):<br/>
Ok, got it. Do Osma committers (you?) would be open to a PR that changed Osma to Hyperledger.Aries, then?

Hi  @tomislav, quick question,  is aries dotnet interoperable out of the box with aries cloud agent or only the comercial streetcred mobile agent version ? 
</p>
<p><strong>victor.martinez</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 18:36:26 GMT):<br/>
The other question that I have is , a part from Osma and .net Aries framework , do you know if in a near future there will be any open source mobile agent framework available for native Android ? If not, then the available comercial option would be vcx java libraries from Evernym ? (not sure here if vcx libs are interoperable with aries cloud agent)
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 18:42:42 GMT):<br/>
aries dotnet is compatible with acapy
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 18:44:06 GMT):<br/>
I'm not aware of a native java framework. Vcx java wrapper is an option, and I believe Evernym is working on the interoperability piece.

I'm planning on merging the PR later today, barring objections.

You can start with aries-framework-dotnet. However, It really depends on your tech stack preference and use case you're trying to build...
</p>
<p><strong>IWontDiscloseMyIdentity</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:03:04 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>IWontDiscloseMyIdentity</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:03:16 GMT):<br/>
so i think i will go for .net framework
</p>
<p><strong>IWontDiscloseMyIdentity</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:03:18 GMT):<br/>
and one thing more
</p>
<p><strong>IWontDiscloseMyIdentity</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:03:33 GMT):<br/>
are both libraries compatible with each other
</p>
<p><strong>IWontDiscloseMyIdentity</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:03:44 GMT):<br/>
suppose for mobile i used aries and for webapp i used indy
</p>
<p><strong>IWontDiscloseMyIdentity</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:03:57 GMT):<br/>
will it be able to read and share the Vcs to WebApp
</p>
<p><strong>IWontDiscloseMyIdentity</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:04:05 GMT):<br/>
which is using indy-sdk in backend
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:14:15 GMT):<br/>
You should use an Aries library for the web app as well.  All Aries libraries should be compatible with each other.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:14:47 GMT):<br/>
If you use Indy for the web app (but not aries) you won't have the full application-to-application protocols available
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:18:11 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  The holder is the OrgBook itself.  The credentials are not issued to the organizations until they have their own agent to hold them.  All of the claims contain public information.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 16:03:41 GMT):<br/>
I think for the forward messages I agree with updating the RFC to indicate a) a message in string format for version 1.0, and b) a version 1.1 which uses a JSON object. Presumably the object is the 'newer' version we want people to adopt
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 16:30:22 GMT):<br/>
I agree with this. It would preserve existing compatibility, while providing pathway to support both protocols in future.
</p>
<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 16:37:14 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone! I wonder if RFCs 0103-indirect-identity-control and 0104-delegatable-credentials are on the development roadmap in the near future for an agent. I'm working on something that requires delegation and I'd love to use this opportunity to contribute to aries :)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 17:23:05 GMT):<br/>
I don't know the steps to get them in, but I think they are awhile from being accessible at the Aries level. @danielhardman might have more knowledge in this area.

<br/><a href="./assets/dQsvotAtgdarsW7Hk-generic-flow.png">generic-flow.png</a>
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 21:39:26 GMT):<br/>
The idea behind RFC 0351: Generic JSON Message is to allow two parties, which communicate via some protocol, to communicate with each other using DIDComm as a "tunnel", to transport the messages from one to the other. This RFC stitches together various features already present within the Aries design, and adds the missing piece, a message type which can itself be used to carry payloads of usage-dependent format.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 21:45:03 GMT):<br/>
To that end, the new message type provides fields for namespacing the message contained within, so one agent could transport multiple types of message, perhaps for multiple clients, also allowing the recipient of a message to know how to process it. This is analogous to how DIDComm messages themselves have a type specifier, but this is not meant to be standardized since the expectation is that further protocols could standardize types/schemas on top, while developers deploying Aries agents for a tunnelling purpose could define their own types and schemas for their specific use case.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 21:47:46 GMT):<br/>
HTTP over DIDComm is one such protocol, using this same specification to transparently carry HTTP messages between a client and server.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 01:07:48 GMT):<br/>
I don't believe this is possible without impacting the security guarantees of the CL signature cryptography. My understanding is that a part of the generation of the proof is that the verifier needs to generate a nonce which if the holder can predict then they can generate invalid proofs that appear valid. In the case of none CL signature based credentials, not including that nonce means that there's potential for replay attacks.

@MALodder or @brentzundel would you mind confirming this for me or providing the correct answer?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 02:17:16 GMT):<br/>
Technically it can be done - we've used that technique for a couple of reasons. How you achieve trust in the proof is up to you.  For example, we used it in proving that offline credentials could be  proven.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 02:19:49 GMT):<br/>
Hmm that's interesting. I'm curious what the other two think of doing this. I was under the impression the nonce was need for the cryptographic security, but this opens up a new set of possibilities if it's acceptable.
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 04:05:52 GMT):<br/>
The nonce is necessary, and it shouldn't be supplied by the holder, but that doesn't mean the verifier needs to supply it. It could come from an agreed upon public source, like the root hash of the ledger at a specific time and date.

Aries WG Afternoon Call recording posted: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=24778954
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 19:37:12 GMT):<br/>
Just to be clear: the security issue that @kdenhartog raised and that @brentzundel commented on is not unique to ZKPs or CL signatures. If you prove something with any credential type, without someone asking you for the proof, there is a problem with replay attacks. This is because anyone can capture your proof and replay it at any time. The thing that protects the verifier from replay, with any credential type, is a nonce that the verifier supplies.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 19:43:52 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran what did you use as the source of randomness to get that working?

@danielhardman thanks for clarifying that.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 19:51:11 GMT):<br/>
In our case, we were looking at the use case of in-person proofing. In the envisioned scenario, the holder would proof image and older-than.  The inclusion of the image in an in-person proof is sufficient to get around replay attacks.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 19:52:33 GMT):<br/>
Could be used in many in-person scenarios, with different standard proof requests being used, generated by the holder, proven and provided to the verifier.
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 20:01:12 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I get the point of risk of replay attack by capturing my proof. 
I was thinking of the UX for presentation scenarios where digital proof generation need not be as formal as applying for a job. E.g. a) Proving my age to the bartender, or b) standing in the fast movies queue at the entry to the airport and showing/waiving my digital passport to the security personal. In short, generating a proof without someone requesting for it.
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 20:03:51 GMT):<br/>
Exactly, both the examples I mentioned are in-person scenario...
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 20:03:51 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Exactly, both the examples I mentioned are in-person scenario...
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 20:07:24 GMT):<br/>
even in-person, what guarantees does the verifier have that the proof is fresh without some sort of nonce?
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 20:10:14 GMT):<br/>
@brentzundel so we need to think of some sort of randomness, in any case
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 20:10:19 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 20:10:59 GMT):<br/>
I  think we do.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 20:28:46 GMT):<br/>
The point is the freshness of the proof doesn't matter in the use cases we're talking about.  The picture provides the necessary information for trust.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 20:30:53 GMT):<br/>
Not that in an online use case, there is no need for the prover to generate the proof request.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 20:31:25 GMT):<br/>
The original question was whther it was technically possible and the answer is yes. Is it a good idea?  Different question.
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 20:34:24 GMT):<br/>
Okay, that's easier.
Can it be done? yes.
Is it a good idea? in almost all cases, no. And even those cases that seem okay should be very closely examined and rare.

Depends on the jurisdiction.  I'm told that in Chicago, when they scan your driver's licence, they (a) store the data, (b) take and keep a picture of the licence and (c) take a picture of the person presenting.

This is used to show evidence that minors are not being served.

That's a privacy breach!

But yes, that is a fair question.

Also arguable because of the consent in presenting the picture.

Daniel Hardman has suggested the approach of providing a fuzzy version of a biometric (such as a picture) that is not precise.  Might apply in the case.

It would really help to have a solid set of servers and clients to be able to evaluate this technology.

Hello Team, may I know where can I find the tutorials about how to use Aries DotNet Framework? From below website, only the initial setup of the environment seems like with latest Aries framework information, but in the sample folder's code is still using AgentFramework's version of code, so may I have anyone's instruction about after setup one local environment, how can I make this agent work with the indy test network? Thanks a lot.

@HarpreetNanda is a develper at ISED (Government of Canada).  He's been looking at vc-auth-oidc for SSI and has some questions.
</p>
<p><strong>HarpreetNanda</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:18:29 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to replicate the bc law society demo. I have an oidc controller and an agent and a realm def similar to the one  in the demo ( in my k.c on openshift). I  created a presentation req and an passing that as an argument from the K.C
</p>
<p><strong>HarpreetNanda</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:18:55 GMT):<br/>
I end up on the verification flow and I have setup streetcred.id on a test iphone
</p>
<p><strong>HarpreetNanda</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:19:12 GMT):<br/>
but when I scan teh QR code ..it just crashes
</p>
<p><strong>HarpreetNanda</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:20:05 GMT):<br/>
I simulated  the bc law society demo with this URL - https://vc-oidc-controller.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/vc/connect/authorize?pres_req_conf_id=verifiable-credential&scope=openid+vc_authn&state=YcUfyIrG27Ctzr_e8qzkxfBI4u9ddWrib-PWFOnilb8.FgOZoksqMW4.law-society-demo&response_type=code&client_id=keycloak&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fsso-dev.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca%2Fauth%2Frealms%2Fvlv1c2en%2Fbroker%2Fverifiable-credential%2Fendpoint&nonce=d5514147-4ddd-43f0-8377-11188fc319ae
</p>
<p><strong>HarpreetNanda</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:20:24 GMT):<br/>
and I am able to scan teh QR code and process the proof on my digital wallet
</p>
<p><strong>HarpreetNanda</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:20:53 GMT):<br/>
so obviously my setup is not correct...just trying to establish whats my missing piece
</p>
<p><strong>HarpreetNanda</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:21:44 GMT):<br/>
I did examine the hwt tokens and it seems the once in teh bc law case has the request encoded in base64

Just a quick question though.. I am using the http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/
</p>
<p><strong>HarpreetNanda</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:24:49 GMT):<br/>
to register my seed.. should I be using this or the dev?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:26:04 GMT):<br/>
You'll need to use `test` since all of the other agents are connected to that ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:27:14 GMT):<br/>
With the streetcred app, did you make sure it was switched to use the `test` ledger too?
</p>
<p><strong>HarpreetNanda</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:27:24 GMT):<br/>
I did. 
</p>
<p><strong>HarpreetNanda</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:28:41 GMT):<br/>
Just a quick background. We have an IDM solution that is based on Keycloak ( migrated from forgerock). We are supporting multiple IDP(s)  and we have been tasked to explore the SSI concept.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:40:22 GMT):<br/>
Hi @HarpreetNanda - awesome stuff. We really want to prove that the vc-authn-oidc IdP works with an IAM other than keycloak - and to document the process.

We'll need to get Emilliano involved and learn more about your setup. It might take a bit - shouldn't be too bad.  But easier if it wasn't holidays. :christmas_tree: 

I'm going to create a discussion for us to use starting from the next message.  We can add anyone that is interested.

AgentFramework reference were just renamed to AriesFramework when we moved the repo. All AgentFramework.*** packages became Hyperledger.Aries.***, but everything should be similar to how the samples are structured.
I would refer you to look at the Test projects as well as the TestHarness, which showcase usage of connections and credentials flow. We are looking for community contributions to work on the documentation. In the meantime, feel free to ask questions here.

Can anyone please confirm while establishing connection between two agents , what details are exchanged which ensure the trust between themselves (without  keeping anything in ledger)?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 26 Dec 2019 17:24:40 GMT):<br/>
@banat
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 26 Dec 2019 17:24:40 GMT):<br/>
@bansatya - good question - I just answered essentially the same thing on the indy-sdk channel - copy of the response:

The flow is defined in https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0160-connection-protocol

However, what the agent does to respond to the invitation and prepare the request message is implementation specific, hence the complexity. Offhand it will likely be at least creating a message thread (to be able to recognize the response), creating a connection object, creating a DID for the connection object (including the keypair for the DID). There may be other things needed, depending on factors such as whether the agent uses a mediator.



</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 26 Dec 2019 18:12:40 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead @tomislav - where are we on the Forward message change to align with the RFC? Sergey updated the PR to ACA-Py.  Can we merge that?  It would be nice to do this over the holidays to minimize the impact on deployments.


</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 26 Dec 2019 18:27:54 GMT):<br/>
We spoke with @andrew.whitehead about this right after the Aries call. Aligning the two codebases seems to be a trivial effort. There are however complications in providing support for existing app due to dependency on mediator agents that are in production. We will most likely roll out this change with the updated app for iOS and Android sometime in January.

Hi everyone. I have a small question. How can we protect the holder's identity (for example with anonymous usage) from everyone, even the issuer? Is there a working use case online where a user registers itself and creates an identity and only that user knows the details? 
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 07:34:35 GMT):<br/>
An Aries Mobile Agent has no local wallet on device. Can anybody please explain me what happens in the background while a mobile agent is being provisioned? If the mobile agent is using a cloud agent as a mediator to talk to the ledger, then in that case do we need a separate cloud agent for every mobile agent? Is that even scalable? I guess I'm missing something here.
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 07:34:35 GMT):<br/>
Thank you. You were a savior. One question though, how are two mobile agents supposed to talk? Is it via the mediator agent?
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 12:58:32 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran , Thanks for your response. But again Does these exchange of DID and DIDDoc privately build trusted p2p communication?
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 13:03:58 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran , Also while issuer issues any credential, does it keep anything in ledger as a proof?
</p>
<p><strong>dgunseli</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 13:12:20 GMT):<br/>
As I know, issuer issues the credential with the credential definition and then send credential to the user, during this process there isn't any ledger operation as I know. But for issuing any credential with a schema, you have to write your schema and definition to the ledger before. Correct me if I'm wrong
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 13:40:15 GMT):<br/>
@dgunseli ,Thanks. That's correct. However, as part of issuance whetehr there is any proof  in ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 14:57:36 GMT):<br/>
Also, does mobile agent create and store pseudonym in local storage or it's the cloud agent who generate and stores on behalf of it?
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 15:13:30 GMT):<br/>
Currently when an issuer sends a credential, the values that are present with the preview sent along with the credential offer does not have to match the values that are part of the actual credential when issued. Are there plans to change this? or what is the design choice behind this?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 15:27:24 GMT):<br/>
If revocation is used, issuer will send an update of the revocation registry to the ledger. This is effectively proof that they issued a credential and that credential is valid until revoked.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 15:28:28 GMT):<br/>
Mobile agents can work directly managing dids and credentials, or they can connect to cloud agent who does it on their behalf. Both scenarios are valid
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 15:34:57 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @tomislav . That means even though there is no issuance proof as such , but revocation registry can be used as issuance proof ( in case no entry)..
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 15:38:12 GMT):<br/>
In case mobile agent manages all, does it need cloud agent for establishing p2p connection?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 16:36:56 GMT):<br/>
Normally, an Aries Mobile Agent does have storage (called in Indy a "wallet"). Were you not aware of that, or are you asking about a use case where it had no storage?

In the normal use case, a mediator agent is provisioned (more on that below) for the mobile agent with a connection is established between the two, so the mobile agent can have an persistent endpoint.

For scaling, a single mediator agent can be used to handle many mobile agents. In that case "provisioning" is really just establishing a new connection. Care must be taken in doing that to adequately separate out the services and storage per mobile agent, but since messages intended for the mobile agent are encrypted for the mobile agent only, that is doable.

With ACA-Py, we've deployed agents on OpenShift (Kubernetes) that handle auto-scaling - deploying multiple containers for an agent to handle heavy loads.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 16:42:16 GMT):<br/>
@bansatya - no proof of issuance is on the ledger. The issuer can retain that they issued a credential, and the holder has the credential, and can prove it at any time to anyone that needs to know. Nothing on the ledger is needed.

Revocation is recorded on the ledger, but is done in a ZKP manner, such that the verifier can't tell who the holder is based on any sort of revocation ID. It's not suitable as any sort of info on the ledger that others can look at.

The bottom line - nothing goes on the ledger that others can be used as proof of issuance. That's not a concept used (or needed) in the verifiable credentials model.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 16:43:15 GMT):<br/>
On your last question about a mobile agent - yes, a mobile agent needs a cloud agent (mediator) as a persistent endpoint.
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Sat, 28 Dec 2019 06:06:58 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Thank you, you were a savior. One question though, how are two mobile agents supposed to talk with one another? Is it via this mediator agent?
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Sat, 28 Dec 2019 07:08:50 GMT):<br/>
Thanks a lot @swcurran  for the clarification
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sat, 28 Dec 2019 14:12:52 GMT):<br/>
@priyashankar Yes.
Mobile1 sends message to Mediator2 addressed for Mobile2. 
Mobile2 retrieves the message from their configured Mediator2. 
Mobile2 replies to Mobile1, by sending message to Mediator1 addressed for Mobile1.
Mobile1 retrieves the message from Mediator1.

Hello Team, I am trying to explore the ACA-py Open API demo. I was able to bring the agents up and do some transactions (connection, credential exchange etc). 
However, I have few queries:

a) Where does the wallets gets created? How can I access those wallets directly (without swagger REST APIs)?
b) How data is stored inside wallets? I guess it internally uses SQLITE or POSTGRESQL DB?
c) Is there any way I can check the credentials issued by the Organization? For e.g. how to check the all the credentials issued by Acme Corp to different users?

I wanted to make everybody aware of a post that I just made to the email list of W3C’s Credentials group, raising a red flag about trying to standardize swagger APIs for credential exchange. If you are already on that mailing list, you will have seen the post in its original context. If not, here is a link to the google doc that contains the same content: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BW07ev8lI5qgw2vU0zgDoJJqBRhMt81fYMr54w1zMI0/edit#
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 30 Dec 2019 23:22:57 GMT):<br/>
a) Wallets (storage) is created locally if necessary on startup of the agents.  They are just databases and you can use database tools to access them. However, all of the data in them is encrypted, which makes accessing them kind of boring.

b) Depending on the startup options selected, data is stored in SQLite or PostgreSQL databases.  For aca-py, checkout the startup options.

c) There is not currently a standard way to do that. A couple of approaches that might be useful for this.  Read and create a searchable database of transactions, and use it for discovery.  Find out the DID of Acme, and then find all of the Credential Definitions associated with Acme, and all the schema associated with those credential definitions.  However, you won't know how many of those are still in use, and you may not even be able to tell the which DID is Acme's.   Another way is that an Aries RFC could be created that enables such discovery. For example, after connecting with Acme, your agent sends a "discover-credentials" (made that name up...) protocol request, to which Acme replies with a list of credentials it offers. I don't know a lot about this protocol, but I think it is intended to be used for this type of thing - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0214-help-me-discover

d) Take a look at the demo agent implementations in the /demo folder.  In that are a couple of customer controllers (Alice, Faber) that interact. That might give you a starting point of what is needed.

3. I'd have to do more checking to be certain, but I believe the endpoint you are referencing is the one that enables another agent to reach the starting agent. Without that, there is no way to send a message to the starting agent. Its the inbound transport endpoint, but a publicly accessible version of that endpoint. It is put into the DIDDoc so other agents know to where messages should be sent to get to the starting agent.

4. It's not really trusted, since the two entities don't really know who each other are from an identity perspective. But it is secure as each party create a keypair for the relationship, and exchanged that keypair between only each other. Thus, they are the only two parties that can see the messages being exchanged. It is trusted if later the two parties exchange messages, they know who they are. So it is the equivalent of a service creating an account for the user, but not getting anything more than an email address - a way to know the account when the user returns, and a way to connect the user.  By using verifiable credentials on top of that, the two parties can establish trust about who each of them are.

Make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 31 Dec 2019 18:19:47 GMT):<br/>
Bit of a long reply here .. 

I'll further unpack what we mean by trusted ...

1) there is a connection between the two parties that only those two parties participated in establishing. That is they successfully created a DIDComm connection between them with DIDs and Keys they created and exchanged securely.

2) Once that connection is established, as @swcurran stated ... this is a secure DIDComm messaging channel ... the parties do not know anything about their "real world nature"

3) Now messages can be exchanged between the parties via DIDComm channel .. they could be simple text messages and if the parties are human beings controlling their agents this may be enough to establish some level of trust based on their decision to believe that the messages decribing common experiences that they share via text messages are genuinely from the person they think they are texting with

4) If the parties need a more formal verifiaction of who/what they are ... this is where Verifiable Credential exchange protocol comes in. 
    a) Party one (verifier) can formally request a presentation of a verifiable credential the other party (holder) may hold which comes from a third party (issuer).
    b) The verifier party decides what credential(s) to request from the holder based on their needs. This is where the trust decision occurs ... the verifier, by requesting a credentials that the holder may hold from a third party issuer, is making a decision to trust that third party issuer. 
    c) This trust decision is based two key aspects ... 
        i) Cryptographic verifiability - that the holder can present the requested credential (attributes) in a way that satisfies the verifiable credential exchange protocol 
        ii) Human / Process - the verifier and the holder mutually believe/agree that the processes executed by the issuer are trustworthy. For example, the government has the legislative authority and has trustworthy processes to issue the first and last name attributes to the person they belong to.

If all of 4) is true then I would say that the verifier party has verified the origin of the holder's first and last name attributes from both a technical and process perspective and they can they decide to ascribe a level of trust to that digital relationship.

Bit of a long reply here .. 

I'll further unpack what we mean by trusted ...

1) there is a connection between the two parties that only those two parties participated in establishing. That is they successfully created a DIDComm connection between them with DIDs and Keys they created and exchanged securely.

2) Once that connection is established, as @swcurran stated ... this is a secure DIDComm messaging channel ... the parties do not know anything about their "real world nature"

3) Now messages can be exchanged between the parties via DIDComm channel .. they could be simple text messages and if the parties are human beings controlling their agents this may be enough to establish some level of trust based on their decision to believe that the messages decribing common experiences that they share via text messages are genuinely from the person they think they are texting with

4) If the parties need a more formal verifiaction of who/what they are ... this is where Verifiable Credential exchange protocol comes in. 
    a) Party one (verifier) can formally request a presentation of a verifiable credential the other party (holder) may hold which comes from a third party (issuer).
    b) The verifier party decides what credential(s) to request from the holder based on their needs. This is where the trust decision occurs ... the verifier, by requesting a credentials that the holder may hold from a third party issuer, is making a decision to trust that third party issuer. 
    c) This trust decision is based two key aspects ... 
        i) Cryptographic verifiability - that the holder can present the requested credential (attributes) in a way that satisfies the verifiable credential exchange protocol 
        ii) Human / Process - the verifier and the holder mutually believe/agree that the processes executed by the issuer are trustworthy. For example, the government has the legislative authority and has trustworthy processes to issue the first and last name attributes to the person they belong to.

If all of 4) is true then I would say that the verifier party has verified the origin of the holder's first and last name attributes from both a technical and process perspective and they can they decide to ascribe a level of trust to that digital relationship.

Is there any sample Node.js based implementation of controller available which can connect with ACA-Py agent ?
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Wed, 01 Jan 2020 18:55:17 GMT):<br/>
 I have some doubts on the wallets w.r.t ACA-Py agent:

1) As per my understanding, agents can only have a single wallet (storage) attached to them for storing keys/connections etc. But can we configure agent app to have multiple wallets ? For e.g We can have a use-case in which same agent is used by different users of the same organization, in this case, is it possible to create individual wallets for each user?

2) Where exactly the wallet (db) should be created? Should it run on the same machine where Agent is running or can we change the wallet location to some other instance/machine ?


</p>

One doubt about @type param: what does this type denotes and whose DID is it using ? ("@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/connections/1.0/invitation"). It is also hard-coded in demo file for Faber in CRED_PREVIEW_TYPE param.

For (1) - this is a use case we are seeing more and more, and we've not fully thought it all the way through.  Its really how you define "storage" per agent. For example, you could have a different database per agent, a different set of tables per agent or even just a wallet-id in one set of tables and filter what each agent sees using their wallet-id. I expect the latter is the best option, but TBD. As well, different encryption keys should be used per agent. With that, you have one agent service, and depending on the messages arriving, different storage is accessed based on the agent in the message.

For (2) - currently you can use either sqlite or postgres. For sure postgres can be on a different machine - we do that with Kubernetes, where postgres is it's on pod, effectively a different machine. I suspect that you can do that with sqlite, but I'm not certain.  As we rethink storage for a pure Aries solution, we are thinking perhaps it should be behind an HTTP interface, further enabling the separation of the agent from it's storage.

I am using Aries .Net SDK with android mobile, and I am facing problem with the API call Pool.CreatePoolLedgerConfigAsync(poolName, poolConfig) of .Net Indy SDK. It is failing with the exception IInvalidStructureException. My Pool Config is {"genesis_txn":"/data/user/0/com.osma/files/pool_genesis.txn"}. There is valid genesis file at the path "/data/user/0/com.osma/files/pool_genesis.txn". Not sure what I am missing here or doing wrong ? Does it have anything to do with slashes in the path ?

The DID is a magic one that was created by someone in the community. It is used to have namespaces for DID Message Protocols and Types - e.g. the "issue_credential" protocol, and the "offer", "request", "issue" types.  It's really just a string, and the plan was to publish the DID as a pointer to the specs.  Recently, a decision was made to change that prefix to an HTTPS user - "https://didcomm.org/" for core protocols, followed by <protocol>/<version>/<messagetype>, and the URL will point to the spec.

In order to start the agent (ACA-py) from the CLI, what all flags are required to be specified? 
I tried starting the agent with below command but was not able to view Admin APIs page mentioned on the HOST:PORT.

`scripts/run_docker start --inbound-transport http 0.0.0.0 8000 \
						 --outbound-transport http \
						 --admin 0.0.0.0 8001 \
						 --admin-insecure-mode`

Do I also have to provide wallet related flags while starting the agent to view and access the Admin APIs? ?

Easiest way I'm aware of is to use ACA-Py and create your controller in Java or Node.  The controller connects to the ACA-Py component via HTTP calls to control and receive events from ACA-Py.

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 03 Jan 2020 17:53:30 GMT):<br/>
You can see all the command line parameters for start with this - `./scripts/run_docker start --help`
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 03 Jan 2020 17:54:31 GMT):<br/>
The examples in the `/demo` folder show various examples of starting ACA-Py.  The alice/faber start parameters are embedded in the code.

Hi all
What are the existing open source mobile agents for SSI?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 06 Jan 2020 16:04:28 GMT):<br/>
The most mature are aries-cloudagent-python and aries-framework-dotnet.  For mobile, .NET is the only option right now. AFAIK, either will work  for non-mobile and are pretty mature.  ACA-Py uses an Aries+Controller architecture (using HTTP between the components) and so can be used with any language to build the application code. The .NET framework produces a library that must be wrapped in a compatible language.  As I understand it from comments here - ACA-Py has more information on getting started and sample code.

We (BC Gov) are primary maintainers of ACA-Py and use it in many PoC and (very near) production use cases.

Thanks @swcurran , @jljordan_bcgov . This really helps. Just another question  while issuer issues the VC to Holder, the same short of trust has to be build.And this has to be done the same way as now is happening?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 06 Jan 2020 22:02:56 GMT):<br/>
Building up the issuer to holder trust can come in different ways. Initial issuers will likely use their existing ways, and later may (or may not) transition to using proofs based on other verifiable credentials.

Example - a BC Services card (similar to Driver's License) will use in person verification as the basis of its identity assurance and then enable citizens to get digital versions of their credential on the basis of that in-person assurance. This is a very high assurance process and hence credential.

Existing services currently have an account management, authentication and authorization process -e.g. how a university student logs into their account. The university may decide that login/authentication process is sufficiently secure to issue credentials using that process. This would likely be a medium assurance process.

Our existing email service https://email-verification.vonx.io/ is very simple - it prompts for an email address, sends an email with a unique link in it and issues a credential to whomever accesses that unique link - presumably the owner of that email address.  Low assurance.

@swcurran Pair wise DIDs used by Identities built on Indy are creating an issue for me.
I need an identity to sign a message whose origin can be verified by any recipient of the message - I can assume that all recipients have a connection with the originating identity.
I are using a signing facility provided by Indy/Aries agents but that seem to be specific to one pairwise connection even though signer uses a public DID. I am considering self-issued credentials as a work around but I would like to explore simpler options before I do that as it will proliferate the number of credentials created.
A second option is to use Indy credentials as PKI certs with public key as an attribute. This requires that the key management, signing and verification to be done by the application external to the Aries/Indy agents. What is the recommended practice or is there a third option?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 05:26:32 GMT):<br/>
Not entirely sure of the use case, but I can think of a couple of things.  First, a verifiable credential might meet the criteria, and we see a lot of uses for it. In that model, an Issuer issues the verifiable credential to a holder, and the holder can then prove that the issuer issued the credential to anyone else. The issuer puts metadata for the verifiable credential (a DID, a schema, and a credential definition) and it is that information that can be used to verify the validity of the proof.

Alternatively, an entity can have a DID on a public ledger, and sign a message using that DID, and then deliver it (using Aries Agents over pairwise connections) to many recipients.  Each can use the DID on the ledger to verify the signature, and can connect to/message the DID owner for proof of control of the DID.  That's pretty similar to the verifiable credential mechanism, so you might be able to fit your use case to that.

Not sure I've answered your question, but hopefully given you something to think about.

How are you defining a single "agent" in that case, Daniel?  For example, would you expect that each cloud agent  to have it's own endpoint or could they share an endpoint?  Would they be in their own container?  Own process?  Would each have their own database?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 17:50:05 GMT):<br/>
Each needs to have its own set of keys and its own unique responsibilities. How isolation is achieved is of secondary interest; each could use its own Docker container and endpoint, or could run on the same endpoint and in the same process. But it should be clear that one has the responsibility to serve the interests of agent-owner A--and only A--and the other has the responsibility to serve the interests of agent-owner B. There should be some barrier that's trustable, that prevents the software from picking up the keys that allow it to service A, then putting them down and picking up the keys for B instead.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 17:50:41 GMT):<br/>
If there's no meaningful barrier, then you have a shared service rather than an agent, and I think you have deep trust problems.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 17:51:23 GMT):<br/>
Evernym achieves this barrier by running separate actors within the same process, and making those actors incapable of opening one another's wallets.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 17:51:48 GMT):<br/>
And we use docker containers sometimes, too.

That's what I thought, but I think that subtlety might be lost on someone those not steeped in Aries lore.  

You don't have to have a single agent container/process (with corresponding endpoints) per mediator, but there must be a separation of the virtual agents by at least their keys/storage.

Folks, just added this Aries project JIRA - https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/ARIES-6, with the following text.  We'd like to get community feedback on this:

As the BC Gov VON Team has been refining Indy Catalyst (a Verifiable Credential Registry) and making it work with Aries protocols for both the Issuer and the Holder/Prover/Credential Registry, we've realized that the Indy moniker is probably not appropriate. For the same reasons that "Indy Agents" have become "Aries Agents", we think it is more appropriate to have the Credential Registry moved from the Indy project to the Aries Project. As such, we are proposing to move the project to Aries and use the name "Aries Verifiable Credential Registry" (Aries VCR) in place of Indy Catalyst.

This ticket is a request for community approval to create the aries-verifiable-credential-registry repo as part of the Aries project to house the product formerly known as Indy Catalyst.

Hi everybody! I continue studying the Indy and Aries projects, together with my partner we have installed both locally.
I have the following doubts:

What Indy-SDK components does ACA-Py require? I ask this because in Docker's images I find that for Agent Aries, Indy-SDK is also installed. I guess it's for the storage and wallet components, but I'd like someone else to confirm it.

The other question refers to the Aries agent for mobile devices. I would like to know why it is more appropriate in that case to use the .NET implementation.

thanks in advance!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 22:48:03 GMT):<br/>
On the first, ACA-Py currently uses most of the Indy-SDK - certainly all that an Aries Agent requires.  Part of our team is currently working on a project to split apart the Indy SDK to make it easier to consume in an Aries context, as pluggable implementations. For example, an Aries agent might support multiple ledger interface (VDRI) implementations.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 22:49:58 GMT):<br/>
On the second issue, it's just that so far, the aries-framework-dotnet is the most advanced framework that is (relatively) easy to get going for mobile. By using Xamarin, the the .NET framework can be dropped into a Xamarin project and deployed to iOS and Android.
</p>

In our use case we need to deploy agents and clients to issue and verify verifiable credentials and thus complete a proof of concept. According to what you tell us, we understand that given the immaturity of Aries, it would be best to implement it with Indy-SDK
</p>
<p><strong>sebastillar</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 22:57:09 GMT):<br/>
What would be the disadvantage of implementing only cloud agents and not implementing mobile agents? I ask this because in the course of edx it says:
"But personal agents don't have to be mobile. They could be run on a laptop or desktop computer as applications. Agents directly controlled by individuals might also be operated by a service and run entirely (including all keys) in the cloud. That model, however, is at odds with our goal of controlling your own agent — and your data. If an agent is running in the cloud, someone else is operating the agent and you are not fully in control. how much you trust the service. "
Then I am in doubt if the web agents would not maintain the privacy of personal data or could not use local wallets.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 23:47:29 GMT):<br/>
Aries not immature and I would highly recommend NOT using just the Indy SDK.  You will have to recreate all of what is in the Aries Agent repos and you will waste a ton of time. If you want to be able to interop, your implementation will have to implement all the aries-rfcs that are already supported in the Python and .NET code bases.

The reasons against using only cloud agents are covered in the quote. You could implement a native app on for the different platforms (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux) rather than a mobile agent and then at least the keys and storage would be kept with the user.

If you are doing a PoC, a short cut of implementing a server-based PWA with just the UI on mobile is probably fine. It's just not a production approach, and the use of a secure/safe agent must be in place before production.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 23:52:30 GMT):<br/>
As well, there are commercial mobile agents you might be able to use. E.g. Streetcred, which has an IOS agent and a "coming soon" Android agent.

Thanks for your prompt response. Your suggestion sounds like something we can use,

How do I get this DID that I put on the public ledger. is this one of the pairwise DIDs or another one that is not associated with any pair? If prover gets its agent to sign using this DID, prover application can supply this DID as part of the message along with the signature to the verifier application. I am assuming that the verifier application can get its agent to verify the signature knowing the DID. As I know, verification always takes the local end of the pair as the DID to verify a credential. is there a facility to use the remote DID that is not part of this pair wise connection?

How do I get proof of ownership of the remote DID that is not part of a pair? Can this be done via the Aries agent APIs or do i have to use libindy or another interface.

Thanks for the help.

Hi team. I'm trying to reproduce the following sample https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/tree/02617cfa24c796eedfdb9549f9200a92a714e1a2/samples/aspnetcore with the latest version of the framework.
For now, I'm able de create an invitation but when accepting it I got the following error:
```HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request.

<p><strong>ashlinSajan</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 04:22:46 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Thanks for your prompt response. Your suggestion sounds like something we can use,

"Alternatively, an entity can have a DID on a public ledger, and sign a message using that DID, and then deliver it (using Aries Agents over pairwise connections) to many recipients. Each can use the DID on the ledger to verify the signature, and can connect to/message the DID owner for proof of control of the DID. That's pretty similar to the verifiable credential mechanism, so you might be able to fit your use case to that."

How do I get this DID that I put on the public ledger. is this one of the pairwise DIDs or another one that is not associated with any pair? If prover gets its agent to sign using this DID, prover application can supply this DID as part of the message along with the signature to the verifier application. I am assuming that the verifier application can get its agent to verify the signature knowing the DID. As I know, verification always takes the local end of the pair as the DID to verify a credential. is there a facility to use the remote DID that is not part of this pair wise connection?

How do I get proof of ownership of the remote DID that is not part of a pair? Can this be done via the Aries agent APIs or do i have to use libindy or another interface.

Thanks for the help.

One more question in indy document walkthrough in connection establishment section of onboarding part its written that the steward sends the NYM transaction for did created for feber. Is that mean the Pseudonym did is stored on the ledger ?

Hi all, Can I refer to "https://github.com/hyperledger/education/tree/master/LFS171x/indy-material/nodejs" repository for implementation of agent in node? Is it good enough?

Hi team. I could use your help on this issue.
I'm trying to make a simple web agent using latest Aries framework following the sample folder from below repo.
I've been able to recreate the agent but when accepting an invitation message, I got the following error
```
IOException: The response ended prematurely.

System.Net.Http.HttpConnection.FillAsync()
HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request.

System.Net.Http.HttpConnection.SendAsyncCore(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```
Apparently the error comes from this piece of code.

```
[HttpPost]
        public async Task<IActionResult> AcceptInvitation(AcceptConnectionViewModel model)
        {
            var context = await _agentContextProvider.GetContextAsync();
            var invite = MessageUtils.DecodeMessageFromUrlFormat<ConnectionInvitationMessage>(model.InvitationDetails);

            var (request, record) = await _connectionService.CreateRequestAsync(context, invite);

            await _messageService.SendAsync(context.Wallet, request, invite.RecipientKeys[0], record.Endpoint.Uri);

            return RedirectToAction("Index");
        }
```
May I have anyone's instruction about accepting a invitation message ? Or some advice on where to look to fix this.
Thanks a lot

@swcurran @danielhardman I have a similar use case where I want to use a single Aries cloudagent to manage multiple identities (each one with its own wallet and keys). When you mention that you can have a single endpoint, how you make that endpoint to be able to switch wallets. Currently I was thinking of firing a docker container per user, but we have thousands of users and it won't scale really well

Hi team, I provisioned a wallet using aca-py and trying to assign the created DID as public. I am facing issue : 

aries_cloudagent.ledger.error.LedgerTransactionError: Ledger rejected transaction request: client request invalid: could not authenticate, verkey for 55GkHamhTU1ZbTbV2ab9DE cannot be found
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 17:22:56 GMT):<br/>
We've added a channel #aries-cloudagent-python so recommend asking there.  I think the issue is just that you are trying to write to the ledger with a DID that either is not on the ledger or doesn't have write permission.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 17:28:43 GMT):<br/>
While the approach is viable, it is not handled by any of the currently defined aries protocols (list is here - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs),  To write the DID to a public ledger you have to use the DID method that you want to use, and an instance of that ledger.  For that you could Sovrin (Indy), Veres One, Ion, Etherium, etc.   Aries gives you a way using pairwise DIDs to connect and communicate, so the pairwise DIDs could still be used for communicating. They just are not appropriate for creating publicly signed messages verifiable by anyone.

The use case is fairly far off what we are doing in Aries, and I think is covered by verifiable credentials, so I'm pretty much out of my depth on how to actually do it. I meant it was conceptually possible, but there are a lot of details.

Hello, what is level of JSON-LD support in Aries ? after reading the Aries RFC 0035: JSON-LD Compatibility it is my understading that is part of the road map but not yet fully implemented ? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 17:39:30 GMT):<br/>
At this point the plan is to be in line with JSON-LD, but not to make full use of it. There is not a plan to embrace it, so I would not say it is a roadmap item.

I have few doubts on how trust is built within the Aries demo application:

1) As an end user, how can I trust the organization while making the connection request? For e.g. Faber generates invitation url and publishes the QR code on its public website and Alice scans it to connect with the Faber.
But is there any way to check if Alice is connected with the valid and authorized Faber organization ? Someone can hack the website and change the invitation url and its endpoint, then how will the Aries handles this scenario?

2) Once the connection is established, Faber issues the credential to Alice, but how Faber authenticates if it is issuing credentials to the correct Alice?

3) After receiving the credentials, Alice connects with Acme and Acme sends Alice a proof request. When Alice shares her credentials on that request:
a) How Acme verifies those credentials ? What exactly happens behind the scenes?
b) If proof request says that one credential should come from Faber then how Acme validates the authenticity of Faber in the presented proof by Alice?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 19:04:18 GMT):<br/>
I agree with Stephen's answer but wanted to add one point of clarification: RFC 0035 is about JSON-LD compatibility as it relates to DIDComm, not to Aries as a whole. What the RFC says is basically that we've structured DIDComm to be JSON-LD compatible but not to use it aggressively; JSON-LD experts who show up in the DIDComm world can use it in protocols they write, but developers who don't know a lot about it don't need to learn anything unless/until they encounter such protocols.

Aries is all-in on JSON-LD compatibility for verifiable credentials, since the VC spec (no matter what style of creds you build) needs JSON-LD. And on DID resolution, where JSON-LD compatibility is being debated by the working group at W3C, Aries will support JSON-LD as much as is required to get full support for DID resolution features.

Are you accepting invitation created by an outside agent?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 21:13:23 GMT):<br/>
Are you running the agent locally or using the docker instance?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 21:39:03 GMT):<br/>
Answer from our DM - might be useful to others:

1) Simple answer - they can't. Making a connection doesn't establish trust - it just provides a secure communication path between two parties. Verifiable credentials would be used to establish trust.

2) They have to have a sufficiently high assurance process. That might be that they have had a website for years that has strong enough identity proofing that they can issue a credential. In the future, they would likely use verifiable credentials to establish that - a gov't ID for name, in person interview, etc.

3a) That is described in the Indy anoncreds materials. Its too much for me to put here. In short, Alice makes a proof, and Acme verifies that the prove is correct.

3b) Acme must know the DID of Faber (and has decided to trust it), or when first encounter must decide if they trust that DID, by finding out who that is. See this paper that I wrote about how this might be done. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nYq0iakgtyC21oUGWa5hLuJUoKeJFpURtGz6HcLIltY/edit We have the idea of a "Credential Registry" that is operated by a trusted party that might enable short circuiting the traversal process. E.g. to find out if a company exists, go to the Credential Registry for the jurisdiction in which it is registered. This is a production example of a Credential Registry: https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca. It contains verifiable credentials about every company registered in BC.

Thanks for your inputs. Is there any detailed document available related to indy annon credentials process ?

I'm running the agent localy. 
What do you mean by "outside agent" ? 
</p>
<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 08:05:34 GMT):<br/>
I'm running an instance of the web agent sample and an instance of my agent.

Thanks I will check
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 15:52:26 GMT):<br/>
The problem looks like the web agent can't reach the endpoint of the other agent
</p>
<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 17:03:44 GMT):<br/>
Ok, here's what I did.
I create an invitation message with the agent made with latest Aries version (let's call it Agent A).
Then I view it with the second agent, the one made with Agent Framework (let's call it Agent B).
Until then, everything works perfectly. Then I try to accept the invitation but it fails, displaying the IOException.
Wireshark see the POST, and the the invitation state goes to Negotiating.
Do you have an idea on where should i look to fix this ? I don't fully understand what I'm doing to be honest, so I'll take any idea on where to look.

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 18:17:37 GMT):<br/>
Interesting. Are you able to at least create and accept invitation on the same agent using the web agent sample for .net?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 18:18:22 GMT):<br/>
Can you also send the invitation data you're trying to paste in to the web sample?
</p>
<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 18:21:26 GMT):<br/>
With agent B everything works fine, it can connect to itself
</p>
<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 18:22:40 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure to fully understand your second question.
Am i able to paste the invitation message from agent A to agent B ?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 18:23:20 GMT):<br/>
No I meant can you send the invitation  data that you're pasting in here. Id like to see if something may be causing the agent to break
</p>
<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 18:27:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm working on it may take some time
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 18:28:53 GMT):<br/>
No worries. If you're using the latest version of acapy, this may be related to the difference in the Forward message format.
If you could, try running the sample from this repo and branch which has the updated format.

Hi @tomislav , am following the sample to build my app from scratch, I may raise lots of questions here, hope you could help on this.

My first encountered question is in Startup.cs, below codes are there, am not sure what does DI mean, and why do we need these two services. Kindly advise. Thanks.

// Register custom handlers with DI pipeline
           services.AddSingleton<BasicMessageHandler>();
           services.AddSingleton<TrustPingMessageHandler>();
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sat, 11 Jan 2020 10:59:46 GMT):<br/>
ok, I saw the steps to create message protocols part, so I think these two messages type are created here, but still not sure DI's meaning, still need your advise.
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sat, 11 Jan 2020 11:00:38 GMT):<br/>
then another question is in CustomMessageTypes.cs, whether below did:sov is also applicable for Indy? 

BasicMessageType = "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/basicmessage/1.0/message";
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sat, 11 Jan 2020 11:52:51 GMT):<br/>
in TrustPingMessageHandlers.cs, there is one line of code

var pingMessage = messageContext.GetMessage<TrustPingMessage>();

But seems new agent framework's MessageContext doesn't have GetMessage function, may I know how should I change for it?
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sat, 11 Jan 2020 12:11:14 GMT):<br/>
in ConnectionsController.cs, there is one line of code

private readonly WalletOptions _walletOptions;

But there is no WalletOptions in Hyperledger.Aries.Models, if refer to old framework, may I know where should I find it?
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sat, 11 Jan 2020 12:13:38 GMT):<br/>
still in ConnectionsController.cs, there is one line of code

return invitation.ToJson().ToBase64();

But there is no ToJson function defined in ConnectionInvitationMessage

The ACA-Py (aries-cloudagent-python) team has created the ACA-Py User Group (ACA-Pug) has add three new resources for community members interested in learning about using and contributing to the ACA-Py Aries sub-project:

First, there is a new rocketchat channel #aries-cloudagent-python available specifically for discussion about using and extending ACA-Py.

Next, we'll be holding bi-weekly ACA-Pug meetings, starting on Wednesday, January 22, at 11am Pacific -- the slot immediately prior to the Aries Working Group meeting. Zoom info: https://zoom.us/j/900111661

Finally, we've create an ACA-Pug Hyperledger wiki page about the project that will be used to manage and document the meetings and as another starting point for discovering ACA-Py. Checkout the page, the meeting appointment information and the new ACA-Pug logo at:  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=24780322 

If you are interested in ACA-Py, please use (and contribute to) those resources!

Hi all, Can I refer to "https://github.com/hyperledger/education/tree/master/LFS171x/indy-material/nodejs" repository for implementation of agent in node? Is it good enough?
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 10:07:50 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav In this case, for each Mobile Agent, there is a dedicated Cloud Agent due to which the Cloud Agent knows who to forward the message to.

Consider the situation when there are multiple Mobile Agents tied to a single Cloud Agent. What happens with that?

Hi all. I have a use case where I would need to use a single Aries cloudagent to manage multiple identities (each one with its own wallet and keys). Currently we are thinking of starting a Docker container with the aca-py software but that would present problems as we have thousands of users and currently the mobile application cannot have native code to comunicate with the company cloud agents. There is any way to adapt the Aries Cloud Agent to run with multiple wallets instead of having hundreds (or thousands) of them? I have seen that in the Faber/Acme demo it starts a Cloud Agent per entity, and in the iiwbook demo they use the .NET aries framework for the mobile. Also I am seeing multiple commits around VCX in libindy. Would it make sense to use VCX for the users code instead of the Aries Cloud Agent? According to this VCX does not support messaging with the aca-py agent: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-1377
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 15:19:51 GMT):<br/>
No, don't use it.  It's using very old code and while good for showing concepts, you don't want to build on it.  It's definitely not Aries compatible.

If you want to use node and aren't building a mobile agent, I recommend you use ACA-Py (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python) and create a node controller. We have a current pull request to the repo that provides examples of controllers in node, angular and .NET.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 15:23:57 GMT):<br/>
ACA-Py does not yet support that use case as you describe, but we are planning to do some work in that area for that exact use case.  We have used ACA-Py for a single wallet/millions of credentials use case that showed it scales on Kubernetes quite nicely. We have some ideas on how to do that for the mobile mediator use case.

We've started ACA-Pug (User Group) (announcement above ^^^^) and that's one of the topics at the first meeting. If you want to get a jump start, use the #aries-cloudagent-python channel to discuss.

Thanks for your prompt answer! For the moment I am going to write some custom container manager to fire and kill containers with aca-py on the fly until a better solution is available. Just to ensure I am in the right path, I assume is better to start multiple docker containers with aca-py than trying to write VCX code that works with aries cloud agent, no?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 15:42:32 GMT):<br/>
I think that's the right short term answer - please share when you do that.

I would not recommend that you write the VCX code to be compatible, but I believe that Evernym has been working on that and it will be available Real Soon Now.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 16:40:39 GMT):<br/>
The mentioned jira ticket is in `unresolved` state but as far as I know VCX generally works with ACA-py ( Evernym demo-ed here https://youtu.be/OSpssHQXlOI?t=516 ). Just keep in mind the limitations mentioned in the ticket, I think those still apply.

hi, all. I have some stupid questions on decentalized identity foundation(DIF). DIF has no official channel like this one.  So I post my question here. The following is my questions: As an organization, if want to join DIF to become a member, is there any  fees to be paid? if needed, how much per year and what would be the benefit of this behaviour for an org?  thanks for any replies.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 03:44:23 GMT):<br/>
They have a slack channel - not sure how access is provided. Yes, there are annuals fees to join that scale by the size of the organization.

If you are interested in being a contributor to the DIDComm Working Group, you can also contribute as an individual if you sign the appropriate Intellectual Property release.

but if I want to develop an edge agent for an organisation in that scenario what you will suggest @swcurran ? 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 14:27:33 GMT):<br/>
Depending on what you mean by edge agent ... if you mean for an enterprise to be able to connect existing enterprise software (say like the software they use to issues insurance policy cards) then ACA-Py is designed for that. It is a full agent and has an API which can be used by existing enterprise software. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 14:47:03 GMT):<br/>
f you mean mobile agent - the only complete choice is to use aries-framework-dotnet with Xamarin.  The OSMA agent is an open source mobile wrapper for Xamarin around aries-framework-dotnet (or perhaps it's predecessor - agent-framework from streetcred).

https://github.com/mattrglobal/osma

aries-framework-dotnet was contributed by Streetcred from the agent-framework code base. OSMA should be updated to use the contributed code.

The DIDcomm protocols in Aries are based on repudiable authenticated encryption. Assuming I'm a relying party and I've received two different proofs over the same connection. Am I able to prove to a third party that both presentations are provided by the same entity?
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 20:00:51 GMT):<br/>
Not if all you have are the messages - since you as the recipient could forge the messages. You would not be able to forge valid proofs from someone else without the relevant secrets however, so if the proofs you've been given provide an assertion of their origin then you could prove the proofs came from a particular source to a third party
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 20:12:30 GMT):<br/>
Verifiable credential exchange protocols (issuance, presentation requests, proofs) are separate from the DIDComm protocols 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 20:12:57 GMT):<br/>
It seems like this question is crossing those two sets of protocols over .. but perhaps I misunderstand the questino

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 20:15:47 GMT):<br/>
ZKP/Indy Proofs contain a blinded link secret which a verifier can make use of to verify that the holder is common across offered proofs, the issuer of the credentials.. if that is what is in question .. are these credentials from the same issuer .. then within the proofs there will be a reference to the credential definitions used to issue the credential, these definitions can be resolved from the ledger and the DID of the credential definition issuer can be used to determine the origin of the credentials .. hope that makes sense and is right :0
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 21:33:16 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam so, mental models!
I'd like to hear about yours :)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 21:44:37 GMT):<br/>
I think the answer to the original question is no - you can't prove to a third party using just the proofs that they came from the same entity.  Of course that assumes the claims in the proof are anonymous (the proof does not contain a claim that is a unique identifier).  The connection across which the proof was received has no bearing on the the guarantees provided in the proof.

Further, since the messages in which the proofs came are repudiable, they would not help you prove to a third party.

Note - there is a capability to send a message that is non-repudiable in DIDComm, so with that, you could proof to a third party that the proofs came from the same party.  The proofs themselves would have the same properties.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 21:46:22 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure how in the currently used Aries messages if the non-repudiable message flag is exposed.
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 22:01:06 GMT):<br/>
The word _encode_ is used for both _binary-to-text encoding_ (e.g. sha256) and _character encoding_ (e.g. utf-8). Having spoken to @kdenhartog , we decided that it would make sense to change the name of the current "encode overlay" to "character overlay" so that we have room to manoeuvre when we start working in the _binary-to-text encoding_ space. In other words, we will eventually have both a "character overlay" and a "binary-to-text overlay". Problem solved. Thanks, Kyle.

<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 04:41:06 GMT):<br/>
I also need to perform same functionality. Need some guidance around this. In my use case: 
1. Govt issues cred_1 to Alice. Faber sends proof request (of cred_1 from Govt) to Alice in order to issue cred_2. 
2. Alice responds to the proof request by sharing her cred_1. Faber verifies the proof.
3. After verification, Acme sends proof request to Faber (Acme needs cred_1 of Alice and some other value from Faber) in order to issue cred_3.
4. Faber responds to this proof request. Acme validates this request and issues cred_3 to Faber.
5. Faber then finally issues cred_2 to Alice.

According to point 3, is it possible for Faber to share Alice's cred_1 on the proof request sent by Acme and can Acme verify the attached proofs?
If not, what should be the recommended approach to handle such scenarios ? 
Basically, what I want is, Faber should be able to attach and present credentials on behalf of Alice (shared by Alice to Faber in proof req) to Acme's proof request. And Acme should be able to verify those credentials.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 05:28:08 GMT):<br/>
No, step 3 is not possible (cryptographically), and it goes against the principles of SSI. If Acme needs proof of cred1, they need to ask Alice - the holder.  Faber should not be presenting credentials issued to Alice to anyone.

Can you provide more more about why Acme needs the proof from Faber about a credential issued to Alice?
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 05:38:33 GMT):<br/>
yes, agree with your points, but what I want to achieve is, Alice should be able to give consent to Faber to use her credentials (which I believe will be one time activity for her) and should not directly connect with other entities like Acme, XYZ etc and these entities can verify the proofs shared by Faber. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 05:49:31 GMT):<br/>
What you probably want is delegatable credentials (aka Chaining Credentials) - see aries-rfcs 0104.

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0104-chained-credentials

This feature is not in Indy/Aries today, but is coming.  It is scheduled to be in the next Ursa (very soon), but it will take longer to get into Indy/Aries.

I still don't get what the use case (business case) is.  I could envision a few, but your phrasing makes it seem that Alice is giving control away to Faber.  With Delegatable Credentials, she would have revocation capabilities such that she could take back control when needed.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:22:56 GMT):<br/>
A few thoughts: First I think of Applications as Protocol Handlers.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:23:06 GMT):<br/>
Protocol handlers can relate to an agent in a few ways:
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:23:27 GMT):<br/>
1. Be written into the agent directly. This is very useful for foundational protocols.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:23:58 GMT):<br/>
2. Be loaded at boot time from an external module into an agent. This allows new protocols to be supported without changing the core agent code.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:26:17 GMT):<br/>
3. Be 'registered' at runtime from an external process.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:26:40 GMT):<br/>
I think (3) is what you are thinking of. Is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:27:24 GMT):<br/>
1 and 2 are most useful for enterprise agents
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:27:49 GMT):<br/>
3 is a model that could serve individuals well, particularly in the case of a mobile device.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:28:01 GMT):<br/>
> Is that correct? 
More or less, yeah
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:29:09 GMT):<br/>
There is another mode here worth exploring: in some cases, we think of a user having one and only one 'agent'
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:29:40 GMT):<br/>
There is space for protocol specific agents: One for handling credentials, another for chat, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:30:04 GMT):<br/>
however I also see DIDComm as a communication mechanism that offers a lot of strengths, with agents managing the details
Then if you want your apps to communicate with each other, and you want the communication to have the features of DIDComm, and you want the connection to be transacted in the way that Aries agents do, then why not use the agent to send/receive messages?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:30:16 GMT):<br/>
This is not unlike having a browser and an email client being separate applications. Both interact with the internet without relying on each other.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:32:43 GMT):<br/>
There are a few ways of using DIDComm for an Application. One can be through registering with an agent. This does require establishing trust between application and the agent. Another could be to just be an agent itself, but only support the protocols you need for the application uses. This is not unlike using an http library in an application.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:32:57 GMT):<br/>
Ultimately, all are workable models.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:34:25 GMT):<br/>
The basic concept is that the mediator needs to have an established connection to the mobile agent, and knows how to identify which mobile agent should be the recipient of a message it's asked to forward.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:35:38 GMT):<br/>
here are two early stage RFCs that describe protocols that can be of use in this scenario: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0211-route-coordination/README.md

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0212-pickup/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:38:11 GMT):<br/>
Exactly, and we wanted to introduce the first option (a way for an application to register with an agent) so you can build and deploy your application and agent separately - ideally, you could deploy your agent in front of your application without changing the application at all.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:39:10 GMT):<br/>
Right.

My question then (about the Purpose Decorator) is what advantage it gives over just the protocol message type?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:40:12 GMT):<br/>
(also, it might be useful to write an RFC describing the various ways of plugging in protocol handlers)
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:41:46 GMT):<br/>
hmm, if we support the idea of "external applications registering to receive certain messages" then we might be able to do without the purpose decorator, as long as we can do flexible-enough filtering on the protocol message type
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:43:38 GMT):<br/>
personally, I don't like relying on regex matching within a type string, I'd rather that the system be broken into tokens and matched precisely so you avoid all sorts of problems (two message types happen to repeat a substring you're matching against, for example)
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:44:35 GMT):<br/>
the type string is designed with protocolfamily/version/msgtype to allow just that type of matching.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:45:01 GMT):<br/>
you can match all of a protocolfamily, or just specific versions, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:47:50 GMT):<br/>
on external registration, you would specify a list of prefixes you want routed to you. That enables support of multiple protocols or versions to the same application.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:55:22 GMT):<br/>
I guess the issue then is that a protocol could carry messages of the same format but for different targets
for example, the current version of RFC 0335 (HTTP over DIDComm) defines a request type and response type. A request message incoming to an agent could be for any of its registered HTTP applications, and they should be able to specify, in more precision, which messages should go to them
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:56:37 GMT):<br/>
in that case, more detail would be needed to filter.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:57:22 GMT):<br/>
you could use the URI of the forwarded request as a filter, but that is beyond the concept of general protocol forwarding.
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:57:57 GMT):<br/>
then we need to define a filtering mechanism which depends on the protocol
I guess we can consider that the responsibility of the protocol's RFC
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 18:28:41 GMT):<br/>
I'll leave @kdenhartog to respond to the question - I think what's in the RFC covers it well.

I did want to note that I think the the consensus is that the signature decorator is going away in favour of using an attachment that is signed.  Again, Kyle should comment on that - and possibly update the RFC if that is the case.

I've had some success in invoking libindy over JNI using the Java wrapper. Would that help you?
</p>
<p><strong>AdrienViolet</strong> (Mon, 20 Jan 2020 10:00:19 GMT):<br/>
I had a similar success, however, as far as I understand, the aries protocol is not implemented as part of libIndy. So if you would be using this protocol you would have to re-implement the whole protocol which seems like a sizeable piece of work
</p>
<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Mon, 20 Jan 2020 10:05:06 GMT):<br/>
that's true indeed. If you're fine with react-native then you might want to have a look at aries-framework-javascript and https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/issues/12 in particular. aries-framework-javascript itself isn't as mature as the others but it's something that all mobile platforms can benefit from

All the Aries frameworks except for the Aries-Framework-Go currently use LibIndy. It is expected that LibIndy can be replaced once there are Aries specific shared libraries.

Could I get a recommendation from one of the aries RFCs regulars - should I squash my PR commits, and does the repo have any best practices for PR commit messages? (I noticed that almost all PR commit messages were _very_ short)
</p>
<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 15:46:13 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam I took a look at removing the purpose decorator from my RFC, and it seems to me like removing it would be more trouble than benefit - if every protocol needs to define a custom mechanism for registering message listeners, rather than having a general mechanism
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 16:15:16 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 16:24:45 GMT):<br/>
Yup...still no production ready implementations of revocation.  A team in the States was working on it, but we've not heard progress.  We have a branch in the ACA-Py that has the current state of where we are on it, but we've not had the time.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 16:25:08 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>s.weidenbach</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 16:33:12 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for the update, Stephen. Are you specifically talking about the missing functionality in ACA-Py or is it related to the buggy proof verification in Ursa that stops working after a second or more credentials have been issued for the same recocation registry?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 16:34:00 GMT):<br/>
I'm just talking ACA-Py. I don't know about the latter issue. That makes me sad :-(.  Not good...

<p><strong>CHempel</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 16:36:12 GMT):<br/>
I've tested it with the indy-sdk without using an aries agent with the same problems as mentioned above.
When all but one credentials are revoked, proofs are working again.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 16:37:05 GMT):<br/>
Odd.  Stephen Klump did a lot on revocation in von-anchor and it was definitely working in his tests.

<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 15:33:38 GMT):<br/>
Thank you ! 
So when using the method createCredentialAsync, the credential issued is automatically signed
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 15:35:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes - otherwise it wouldn't be much of a credential. The signature is a Camenisch-Lysanskaya signature. There is plenty of literature on the algorithm, but it is intense.
</p>
<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 15:37:54 GMT):<br/>
You're right. Quick question, how can i retrieve the signature from the credentialRecord ?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 15:47:35 GMT):<br/>
I need more context than that. No idea what you want here.
</p>
<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 15:54:04 GMT):<br/>
When the holder receive the credential, is it possible for him to retrieve the ```signature_correctness_proof```, to print it on his screen for example ?

Get it out of the credential. But what is the user going to do, elliptic curve crypto with 300-digit numbers on a napkin to check? I cannot imagine a use case where showing the signature will provide a humane user experience.

Show one to your boss then such as the sample above - maybe he doesn't know what a credential looks like.

<p><strong>s.weidenbach</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 16:25:21 GMT):<br/>
OK. So at least we are not alone right now. I filed an ursa bug yesterday. But we are still not sure if it is really ursa-related.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 16:27:20 GMT):<br/>
I swear this used to work. It must be that von_anchor tests do not exercise this case. I am still flailing a bit in identifying what makes it fail. Yesterday I couldn't make it fail; today I can't make it succeed. Sing ho! for the life.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 17:18:57 GMT):<br/>
OK, I see that my foray yesterday was off the mark. I am satisfied that you've found something genuinely puzzling.

Here is some code to reproduce it. See Olga fail verification after any positive number of revocations until her cred is the only one left unrevoked, then succeed.

Hey Folks, I posted a Status Change request for RFC 0302 Aries Interop Protocol.  People should vote, including comments if they have any objection to the set of protocols and versions of protocols that are included in AIP 1.0.0.  Once (if) this PR is merged, builders can self-assert adherence to AIP 1.0.0. The goal in future versions of AIP 1.0.0 is that there will be a test suite to demonstrate adherence.  *Deadline is 2020.01.30* - we'll discuss in the call next week.  PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/388

Hey Folks, I posted a Status Change request for RFC 0348 Transition to HTTP-based Message Type. Per the upgrade plan, once this PR is merged, agent builders are expected to upgrade their agent deployments to accept either DID- or HTTP-based Message Type strings by the proposed deadline of 2020.02.29.  No deployed agent will send out the new (HTTP) format until after we complete phase 1 of the process.

*Deadline is 2020.01.30* for voting on this status change to start the transition.  We'll discuss in the call next week.

Folks, an issue has been raised about interop with AIP 1.0.0 regarding specifying the algorithm to use for attribute encoding in Indy credentials.  If you are building an agent framework that issues credentials, please monitor and weigh in on https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/391.

I'm not opposed to the idea, but I do think it needs some name attention. `purpose` is pretty general, and I worry about unintended consequences.

<p><strong>filip.burlacu</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 18:45:19 GMT):<br/>
That's fair, I welcome ideas to make the term more specific. It's intended for (external) listeners to register, so maybe something to do with that

Calling for a volunteer: We have a few issues with the GitHub action that is supposed to generate the index.md file in the RFC repo. There are a variety of github configuration issues that have been giving me grief.

If you want to help the community by figuring this out, let me know. I'll help you get oriented.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 22:46:31 GMT):<br/>
How about we back it out for a bit and leave it on the maintainers to generate and push the index.md after a merge?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 22:46:45 GMT):<br/>
Then we can sort out the github action issue separately.

We don't want to go back to everyone generating their own...

2) I think evernym is using the agency but my question is how the message/requests delivered to the mobile app as the mobile is not having persistent end point?```
3) I checked the QR code data which is displayed for the connection in evernym demo the url is same for all then how it manages which request should be sent to which mobile phone?```
4) Is it having single cloud agent with multiple wallets for all the mobile users?

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 15:52:45 GMT):<br/>
Currently, there is no opensource codebase for an entire agency.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 15:53:56 GMT):<br/>
An agency typically comprises two things: a routing agent, and cloud agents for customers of the agency.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 15:55:02 GMT):<br/>
The routing portion could be done with open source codebases- the router itself doesn't hold any user keys itself, it's just a single agent representing the agency with the ability to route inbound messages to others.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 16:02:08 GMT):<br/>
there are a few conceptual ways to host cloud agents. One is to host actual processes for each user. Another is to swap out the storage layer of running code to represent a new user on demand. Yet another is to connect each inbound request to each user for processing, being careful to separate the data of each user in the backend storage.

Note that none of the open source software packages are out of the box capable of any of these options. Custom development would be required for make it work, and make it work at scale.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 16:03:26 GMT):<br/>
If you are willing to forgo each user having a cloud agent, you can simply route messages for users, and their phone apps retrieve the messages from the routers. This is an active area of development right now. It isn't ideal for all situations, but it's a start.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 16:04:39 GMT):<br/>
I believe the QR code displayed initiates a connection that is unique, so the non-uniqueness of the QR code is not a concern. The unique relationship is set up which does include a unique key/endpoint situation.

</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 09:41:35 GMT):<br/>
Well, I got around with the following solution.

The INDY_TXN_TYPE for SCHEMA & CRED_DEF are 101 & 102, respectively.

Now, if I query the Ledger Browser at http://localhost:9000/DOMAIN?type=101, I get all available schemas posted on the Ledger.

Hello everyone,
Which type of Message should I use if the holder want to correct a credential offer ?
In my scenario, the issuer send a credentialOffer to the holder with attributes already set. In case their is a error in the offer, how the holder can correct it and notify the issuer ?
Should i use an offerMessage or a requestMessage ? Or maybe something else?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 14:10:37 GMT):<br/>
There is a credential proposal message that should be used.  The proposal allows the user to initiate an issue protocol instance and to counter an offer.  Details are here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0036-issue-credential
</p>
<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 14:14:56 GMT):<br/>
As far as i know there is no methods in the framework to work with this type of message, is it on purpose ?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 14:18:35 GMT):<br/>
You mean in indy-sdk?  That is correct. Indy doesn't have that capability. It's provided in Aries.
</p>
<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 14:32:11 GMT):<br/>
Even in Aries, the CredentialProposalMessage (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/02617cfa24c796eedfdb9549f9200a92a714e1a2/src/Hyperledger.Aries/Features/IssueCredential/Models/CredentialProposalMessage.cs) is defined. But as i'm reading the rfc  you provided, I don't understand in which field the correction should be made.
</p>
<p><strong>Yoroitchi</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 14:34:36 GMT):<br/>
The rfc mentionned the field `"credential_proposal"`, i guess it's here the correction should be made.
But I don't see such a fields in Aries implementation 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 14:35:34 GMT):<br/>
I'm not familiar with the .NET framework details.

Is the protocol for routing defined somewhere? `aries-framework-dotnet` uses `did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/basic-routing/1.0/` and ACA-Py uses `did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/routing/1.0`.

RFC 94 defines just the forward message. I think we have few independent implementations now that is enough material to start talking about this topic.
Aries .NET used types are defined here - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/master/src/Hyperledger.Aries.Routing/RoutingTypeNames.cs

Hey folks, a notice that Aries Interop Profile (AIP) 1.0 has now been put into the Accepted status.  Those implementing agents should follow the guidance in that RFC (and the included links to specific versions of other RFCs) to have the best chance of interoperating with other agent deployments. When you are ready to self-assert that your agent implements AIP 1.0, please submit a Pull Request to add the relevant information about your agent(s) to the "Builders" table in the RFC.  Hopefully, when we update to the next AIP version, we'll have a conformance test suite that will enable the eliminate of the self-assertion.

Hey folks, this is to notify all agent builders that Step 1 of the transition from using "did:sov..." to "https://didcomm.org" as the Aries Message Type prefix has begun.  From now until the start of Step 2 of the process, every agent implementation and deployment should be updated to accept messages in either form, while still sending out messages only in the old ("did:sov...") form. When you have completed (and deployed as necessary) the changes for Step 1, please do a pull request to update the builders table. That will help us to decide when to move on to step 2. We'd like to start Step 2 on March 1, 2020.

Details of the transition plan are here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0348-transition-msg-type-to-https

There is a currently disabled rest endpoint for creating a static connection in ACA-py (I can get you a patch to enable it) or you can use the toolbox to create a static connection. There's a bit of extra setup but having the toolbox is handy.

Hello folks! We have been working on a mobile wallet app prototype that can show the received credentials in the UI and also use the credentials for proofs when using (different) credential-supporting services. Lately we’ve encountered some issues related to credential metadata. 

1) When rendering the credential in the  app UI, we would like to show the issuer logo in view. We would also like to sort (and possibly group) the credential attributes in the order the issuer defines. What we would like to get rid of is to hardcode these rules to the mobile app.
2) There are different kinds of credentials that need different level of security. For example, when verifying a passport (issued by national authority), it may be required that the user is (bio)authenticated by the mobile device when the proof is done to make sure that it is actually the same person using the credential that it was issued to. In the other hand, when a movie ticket is verified, this level of security may not be needed.

Does anyone know if we have any way in the Aries/Indy-world to define and provide this kind of credential-related metadata? Thanks!

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 13:45:07 GMT):<br/>
Indy provides a way to store custom data using the NonSecrets API. Aries implementations leverage this API to store any metadata in the wallet associated to a credential, connection, proof, etc.
Aires Framework for .NET, for example, provides a way to attach any metadata to credential records using searchable Tags.
</p>
<p><strong>lauravuo-techlab</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 13:47:05 GMT):<br/>
But we don't have any schema or agreed convention for this metadata so that it would be compatible between different agents i.e. provers, issuers and verifiers?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 13:48:12 GMT):<br/>
we have not yet discussed standardizing those things.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 13:49:22 GMT):<br/>
On the topic of logos: We've been wary of logos as yet, because if done wrong they make phishing/spoofing much easier.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 13:50:58 GMT):<br/>
I'm hoping that we can end up with a verifiable credential that the issuer holds that contains a logo. The trust for those VCs would be rooted in orgs trusted to prevent copycat logos, etc.

In yesterday's meeting, @danielhardman mentioned that having a step that required acceptance of terms of service would be needed for them to use the protocol (in a bring-your-own-agent scenario). It got me thinking that in addition to the user accepting the mediators terms, it would be cool for the user to present terms the mediator would need to accept.
To avoid the complexity of runtime terms evaluation, it seems likely that the mediator would have a list of user-terms they were willing to accept, and the user could indicate which they wished to be in force.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 14:35:53 GMT):<br/>
Terms would be useful to have in an immutable or content addressable location. As a first version, we may be able to get away with using URIs that link to those policies.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 14:36:41 GMT):<br/>
Also, it would be awesome if a mediator could get paid for their services. This may not need to be in the same protocol, but we should discuss how that plays.

I think the context is different in this case from what's we've been talking about with logos in the past (which is on connection).  Agree that a verifiable credential from an authorized entity about the issuer would be nice, if you have decided to trust the issuer enough to get a credential, getting a logo/background for the credential directly them is likely not a stretch. An Aries protocol for that seems like a good idea. 

Likewise, we could define protocols that allow us to ask "What credentials do you offer?" via a connection we have made.

I think that's more of a message than a protocol (it's stateless), and it's already in place in aca-py - but it's by cred def id, which may not be what you have in mind here.

That would be what the Mobile Agent would use for connection with other agents. I think Sam is talking about between the Mobile Agent and its mediator - or perhaps a service that it wants to use as its mediator.

Likely you are not running an instance of a ledger - e.g. von-network.  Faber is issuing credentials so must write data to a ledger, while Alice is not.

You can use a different pool by using an envrionment variable to indicate where the genesis file is. It defaults to assuming you are using von-network (hence the ":9000" reference). Format is something like:

GENESIS_FILE=<file> ./run_demo faber

The second error is likely because you have it running multiple times.

To check what docker things are happening use something like this:

`docker ps;echo "";docker volume ls;echo "";docker network ls`


</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 19:39:20 GMT):<br/>
By using that environment variable, you don't have to use von-network.

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 19:39:25 GMT):<br/>
I don’t think indy-pool will work as the demo agent registers its own DID. The von-network issue is due to running an old python version. It’s easier to use the docker deployment

</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 20:50:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure what you mean by identity. For managing ACA-py you can use the administration API: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/AdminAPI.md
</p>
<p><strong>daveek</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 21:01:28 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 21:06:42 GMT):<br/>
Then you might need to import aries_cloudagent as a python library and go from there, but we don't currently support or document how to do that. Lots of the administration logic is contained in REST API handlers at the moment
</p>
<p><strong>daveek</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 21:09:35 GMT):<br/>
We are developing an application, in which devices would be able to store their identites, show the prove, organization would be able to add/remove identites...Is arries-cloudagent could handle this?

* issuing a credentials, prove them and revoke them
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 21:14:01 GMT):<br/>
Simple answer is yes.  ACA-Py fits very well in an enterprise for managing credentials. The REST API it exposes makes it easy to integrate with existing systems. We've used it for a number of use cases in Government.

I'm interpreting step 1 to mean that we "MUST update all agent code bases" and we "MUST update all deployments". The first part is easy. The second is surprisingly hard, as we do not have a relationship with whoever has deployed the code, and do not even know, in principle at least, who they are nor how to contact them. Does anyone have a plan for satisfying that last requirement?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 23:52:28 GMT):<br/>
Agree that it is difficult. Good idea to think about this now.  Ideas:

- define some announcement channels that you will use for updates - twitter, rocketchat, blog etc. - whatever is best for your community
- document the announcement channels you will use in all the places from which folks get the package or access the documentation.

It could be too late now for this instance of the process, but that's why we are trying this - to learn. You should definitely at least define the announcement channels and document them.

FYI - github has the "watch" feature and that could be a place. Encourage people to watch for at least the "Releases Only", and use the github release feature as a mechanism.

That sounds about right, but I would defer to our devs on that.  I'll ask them what they did as soon as the work is done in ACA-Py.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 31 Jan 2020 19:49:11 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran is correct: It cannot be the mediator (cloud agent) endpoint, because it doesn't have one yet.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 31 Jan 2020 19:51:23 GMT):<br/>
After the agent arranges for routing services from a mediator, it would use that's mediator's endpoint as it makes connections with other agents.

FYI: Aries Cloud Agent - Python Release 0.4.1 has been tagged and posted to PyPi. Release notes can be found here - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.4.1.

This release has a change that impacts interoperability with other agents in the handling of forward messages (RFC 0094). We'll upgrade our deployed instances of ACA-Py immediately after the public availability of the Streetcred mobile agents in the app stores to retain interoperability. Others should do the same. A list of other changes in the release are in the release notes. We're particularly pleased that the code base now has just a shade under 90% code coverage in unit tests. w00t!

Code reference documentation has been generated to ReadTheDocs - https://aries-cloud-agent-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Hi, I have few questions

1- How to dynamically add the agents (users(e.g. alice), organization(e.g. Faber, Achme)), In demo/ there is alice.py, fabir.py, how to add new agent when user/organization signup to app?
2- How would they make connection, exchange credentials and issue identities e.t.c, in demo/ one have to do it manually, is there any option to do it automatically by interacting with frontend?
3- I don't need these too many REST API endpoints (Available in demo/ swagger UI),
3a- How to remove the unnecessary endpoints?
3b- How to add more endpoints?

Hi Team, Can we connect and exchange messages between a mobile based agent (built with aries-dotnet-framework (osma app)) and a web based agent (ACA-Py)?
I have my web based agent running locally (backed by von-network), so what will be the procedure to connect a mobile agent ( currently using osma app) with web agent?

Hi all, I am Cyril, which interested in aries project. I have play around with VON network and ACA-py. And want to go further on mobile side, I have similar case with @HLFPOC. And I am try to connect ACA-py by using libvcx, but not success, and error raise when finding agent info.

Is it I should use the agent in aries framework dotnet to do so ? or Can I ask is coming aries framework go will support libvcx ?
thank you very much.

I suggest starting with https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/python/tests/interation/test_interaction_several_credentials.py and incrementally changing toward your test to see where it goes awry.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 14:43:46 GMT):<br/>
There is an incompatibility on forward messages in libvcx with ACA-Py/Aries-Framework-Dotnet prior to the ACA-Py 0.4.1 release (not sure about the A-F-D version).

There is work going on with OSMA that should be available fairly soon that brings it up to speed with A-F-D and the latest Aries RFCs (AIP 1.0). The current version is on the agent-framework predecessor of A-F-D.

1 - spin up more agents and connect them using the same techniques as Alice and Faber. There is a demo of adding ACME that talks with Alice and Faber.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 14:46:53 GMT):<br/>
2-Yes - build the controller into a GUI. A community member recently did that with the Alice Faber demo. https://github.com/petridishdev/aries-acapy-controllers - this will be soon be in a Hyperledger repo. We've built many web apps around ACA-Py.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 14:48:22 GMT):<br/>
3a - you will at sometime need all of those endpoints if you build a sufficiently complete app. But you can hack the ACA-Py code if you want to remove the endpoints.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 14:49:14 GMT):<br/>
3b - there is a command line parameter "--plugins" that you can use to add Python external modules to ACA-Py, and in those external modules you can add endpoints.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 14:50:25 GMT):<br/>
Events from messages come back to the controller via a webhook interface. Configure your app to receive HTTP requests there and you will receive the basic messages and all of the other events happening in ACA-Py.

What I meant from the first question was, that, when ever a new agent register, will a new port be assigned to agent.. e.g. 5001, 1001.. just as in demo/, script/ with every agent, there is different ports e.g. inbound, outbound, administrated API Swagger UI... How will this be managed in Production with Unlimited User Base....

We are implementing certificates (not in the sense of x.509 certificates, but more in the sense of ISO or IATF certificates)  as verifiable credentials. Those certificates will probably share a common schema, but will be different certificates and we are thinking about the best way to implement them
- 1. Define different schemas although they are the same
- 2. Specifiy the cerrtificate type as a credential definition tag
- 3. Specificy the type of a certificate within the credential, i.e. specifiy a type attribute.
We currently tend to implement the 2nd approach. Because it seems valuable to have the information which issuer issues which certificate on the ledger. However, the implementation does not allow to request a certificate of a specific type without specifying the issuer, since we would request by a list of credential definition ids. 
Has anybody thought about this? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 14:41:40 GMT):<br/>
When we think about the claims in a credential, we tend to think of how the holder would be likely to use them.   What are the foreseen use cases (easy) and what are some possible ones that aren't intended but could be done.  If the verifiers are only within a consortium, it's less of an issue, but if there is a general use for the holder, it's something to consider.

Next I would look at what is the obvious pattern that verifiers would expect. On that, I'm torn between 2 or 3 and it's probably a coin toss. In 3, verifiers have to do a claim = value restriction in the proof request, while in 2, they have to know about all the cred defs and restrict on that.  Which would you rather use when generating a proof request?

Interesting question!
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 15:37:32 GMT):<br/>
We usually do #2 with our use cases. Are you planning to use your own Indy network or a production one like Sovrin? If you're using Sovrin, Option #1 would be quite expensive :smiley:

@swcurran how can i make a mobile app using python but not .net?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 16:03:33 GMT):<br/>
I've heard there might be a way, but that's a python/mobile question vs. SSI that I know about.

Regards questions above:

1. In an enterprise system, you don't need an agent per user in the majority of use cases.  Not sure of yours, but for what we do, there can be one agent that scales up as needed - e.g. instances of the agent that are all processing requests, much like a web server. All share a common database (agent storage); protocol state is persisted, so any instance of the agent can handle any request.

The authn/authz question is too broad, but if you are looking for Open ID Connect auth with verifiable credentials, you can look at https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc. In the /docs folder there is a "DemoInstructions" document that you can run.

The multiple host app question is complex and depends on use cases. I would say there has been some theory provided on what to do, but no implementation of which I'm aware.

The challenge with your approach (e.g. that the mobile agent is just a UI, with the agent and agent storage/wallet in the cloud) is that the keys are not in the control of the user, they are in the control of the vendor hosting the service. What you want is that the keys are in the direct control of the user and that's hard to do in the cloud service model. And that loss of control may compromise the SSI element of the solution.  Something to think about.

Thank you @swcurran for explaination, and I had one more follow up question is how to  use one agent to serve multiple user?  
And I should use libindy wrapper instead of libvcx wrapper to connect to the agent(ACA-PY) ?
Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 07:51:56 GMT):<br/>
Thx @swcurran and @rileyphughes. We are currently on our own testnet, but this might change. #3 is obviously the cheapest (only one schema def and one cred def per issuer) and most flexible solution. However we have to standardize the possible values of the type attribute somewhere else. AFAICT the claim=value restriction is not really implemented in ACA-PY today. The prover would have to set the attribute as a tag and the verifier would set a restriction using the wallet query language. So many things that can go wrong here...
Another approach to restrict only on a specific type using #2 would be to match only the tag of the credential definition id. However, currently this also only works if the prover has set the credential definition id as a tag.

Hi all, I've been working with Aries for the last months and are now going to do my thesis on Aries. The question I want to answer is how I can design (and later implement/contribute to) an open source and interoperable Aries Agency so that agents without an inbound route (public endpoint) can receive messages through an agency. Excited to see that in the Working Group meeting from last week this exact topic got discussed and taking inter-vendor edge-agent -> agency setup into account.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 13:17:02 GMT):<br/>
Hopefully during (or otherwise afterwards) my thesis I can contribute to the Aries SDK Javascript project and create an Edge Agent (with ARNIMA) -> Agency setup

@TimoGlastra You can also see an agent (without an inbound endpoint) receiving messages via a mediator by running these BDD tests in aries-framework-go: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/master/test/bdd/features/aries_router_e2e_sdk.feature.

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 14:39:31 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. I see that in the BDD tests the router always creates the invitation, is this to overcome the problem of missing the serviceEndpoint at the Edge agent side?

What should be in the `~thread.received_orders` field of the response as shown at https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/64e5e55c123b2efaf38f4b0911a71a1c40a7f29d/concepts/0008-message-id-and-threading#threaded-messages ?  It is supposed to be of the form `{"<senderDID>":1}`, so where do we get the sender's DID in this case?

May I have a question regarding the storage of pairwise connections? I was considering to use pairwise methods in JS framework, but I went through dotnet and aca-py and it seems they use non_secrets instead of pairwise API (thanks @gnarula to pointing out that). Are there any specific reasons? Just to be aware :)

only an agent will run seperately in another system for this  do I have to modify the von network?
Is it enough to modify the agents code in the demo folder

Since you will be running VON remotely, in that case you need to pass LEDGER_URL while setting up the demo agents.

For example, LEDGER_URL=http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo faber

Good Morning.

Is it possible for an aca-py agent to issue a credential to OSMA (Mobile) Agent without having a Mediator in between? 

The aca-py agent sends a credential offer, but the Mobile Agent does not react to the same. 

Thanks.
What is going wrong here?

Well without a mediator also it should work, just as connection request and response happened. When it comes to credential exchange, please check if the aca-py version that you are suing supports crdential exchange protocol 1.0. Again, I have not tested with the OSMA master branch

I was using the /issue-credential/send endpoint and that failed partially. Although, it was successful in sending the offer.

Is there a way to do that with OSMA?

</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 05:18:31 GMT):<br/>
I am guessing one error is because of the protocl-discovery is not supported and the other because there is no service endpoint.

@andrew.whitehead it seems OSMA master branch still points to protocol discovery. Also this last error -- dont know if its a continuation of the service discovery or not - aries_cloudagent.protocols.connections.manager.ConnectionManagerError: No services defined by DIDDoc
</p>

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 05:36:01 GMT):<br/>
Looks like it's trying to return a problem report due to the unknown protocol. Not sure why it isn't using return routing, I guess the connection was dropped
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 05:36:21 GMT):<br/>
There's no service endpoint in the DID doc, presumably because it doesn't have one

@andrew.whitehead The Mobile (OSMA)   Agent, though was able to connect with aca-py without this service endpoint.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 06:05:35 GMT):<br/>
If it drops the connection while using return routing then the agent will try to route it according to the did doc. I'm not sure if that's what's happening there
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 06:06:16 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean by dropping the connection?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 06:06:40 GMT):<br/>
Return routing only works with a connected TCP socket
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 06:08:00 GMT):<br/>
Can you please provide me some docs for the same?

@andrew.whitehead I will try to change the protocol to feature discovery 
</p>
<p><strong>priyashankar</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 06:09:59 GMT):<br/>
So, an aca-py agent can issue a credential to Mobile Agent without a mediator. Can you please confirm?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 06:10:07 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 06:10:17 GMT):<br/>
but as you can see its not reliable
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 06:10:25 GMT):<br/>
@sukalpomitra I think the response format changed a little as well, but it's pretty similar
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 06:10:43 GMT):<br/>
i will compare with my version

I am fairly new to Indy and Aries, cloned the aries-framework-go, viewed the old indy screencast demo, and launched the openapi demo and played with the clients a few steps. Trying to run the bddtests, I get an error when I run "make checks":```

Hi folks! We have been implementing Aries-compatible mobile app that can acquire credentials to the wallet. In our current flow, the mobile app user is reading a QR code in the issuer web page with her mobile app. This QR code contains both the pairwise information and the credential proposal data and thus, after the pairwise is established, the flow continues automatically with the credential issuance. i.e. the user doesn't need to read another QR code for the credential offer. I was wondering that does Aries actually support this kind of flow at all? And if so, do we have this kind of invitation example available somewhere? Or is the purpose in this situation to first establish the pairwise and after that the issuer continues (automatically) by sending the credential offer to holder?

This looks similar to VCOIDC flow developed by the people at BCGov. OSMA supports it. I am a little confused when you say the user don't have to scan another QR code for credential offer. For credential offer we generally dont scan any other QR codes.
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:39:36 GMT):<br/>
MetaDigital built a demo with the Streetcred API that does this - just scan a QR to connect and then the credential is issued after. I believe they used webhooks to have the issuer wait for the connection establishment before sending a credential offer. https://www.metadigital.tech/demo/

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 19:28:37 GMT):<br/>
It depends on the change.  If it is minor update (V1.0 to v1.1).  You do an update to the RFC and put in a "Version Change Log" entry in.  You can look at 0036 as an example, but notice that we changed in that one only a single message version and we should have changed ALL versions of the messages to 1.0.  Side note - we'll soon have a new header where the version ID will go there.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 19:29:06 GMT):<br/>
FYI 2 - if the RFC is in "Proposed" state, I think you are OK to update without a version change.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 19:30:48 GMT):<br/>
FYI 3 - a change does not affect an existing AIP (Aries Interop Profile -- RFC 302) version.  It would only be updated in an AIP with a new AIP version and agreement of the agent-builders.

@sukalpomitra so I was basically interested how to handle that kind of flow where the holder initiates the process (both starting the pairwise and the issuance). But yes, now I see that it may be reasonable to change our flow so that issuer will make the first initiative in this case. And yes, of course, no additional QR-codes are needed if we know the connection in question :slight_smile:

I tried interoperating aries-framework-go with aries-cloudagent-python and got stuck at a few places. Here are some of the differences I found:

* Go framework expects Content-Type "application/didcomm-envelope-enc" while Python expects "application/json" || "application/ssi-agent-wire". .NET expects "application/ssi-agent-wire"
* Go framework doesn't implement connection protocol which preceeds didexchange. The former is a part of AIP.
* Service blocks in DIDDocs have references of public keys in routingKeys and recipientKeys fields. Other agents expect the base58 encoded value there
* Service blocks in DIDDocs have type of did-communication whereas other agents expect "IndyAgent".
* Connection Signature creator in Go uses (bytes(str(int64_timestamp))|connection) where | is actually used as a separator, as the message to be signed.
  Other implementations use bigendian(int64_timestamp)||connection as the message to be signed (no separator, 8 dedicated bytes for the timestamp)

I'm not sure which implementation's correct, but it would certainly help to have all agents adhere to the same thing. @troyronda  @swcurran  @tomislav @jakubkoci

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 17:33:42 GMT):<br/>
FWIW, ACApy has a command line option to enable outbound queues. I've found this useful for connecting to edge agents with no endpoint. The messages stay in a queue until another return-routeable connection is made.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 17:37:12 GMT):<br/>
Part of the confusion here was uncertainty around the future of the DIDComm work over the last 4 months or so. We should definitely work to accept more, and potentially align on what we send.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 17:51:06 GMT):<br/>
post-post thought: it's possible we'll need to migrate to something else in the future. If your software doesn't accept multiple mime-types already, it might be a good idea to add it. (Yes, we should consolidate. No, it won't be instantaneous.)

A question about the architecture. What is the current thinking on the secure storage, wallets, and sovereign domains? On this Indy presentation page 7 https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d35TtEAP-f1tTh88XSZ2uQ2qnuPh6JIPluIWno_P3b0/edit#slide=id.g3437d91afa_0_15 it talks about one wallet per device, with it being stored on each hardware device, and one owner with many wallets in their sovereign domain. That precludes something like LastPass storing someone's identity/credentials that are simply retrieved from each of their devices as needed, and requires duplicates of many things on every device they own. 
But this getting-started page https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev/AriesBigPicture.md puts wallets and cloud agents in the blue circle - and then talks about agents embedding the SDK ... but doesn't that mean each agent contains a wallet? Seems contradictory.
Also I see some go framework code which seems to have the kmsCreator for the wallet inside the Aries framework and thus inside the agent.

As @gnarula has noted per https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/369, the DIDDoc that the https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/9b0aaa39df7e8bd434126c4b33c097aae78d65bf/features/0160-connection-protocol connection protocol employs is not in line with the W3C DIDDoc specification, which has since solidified to v1.0. In particular, a key by reference in the Aries RFC looks like
```
{
      "type": "Ed25519SignatureAuthentication2018",
      "publicKey": "did:sov:QUmsj7xwB82QAuuzfmvhAi#1"

```
whereas the W3C spec expects
```
"did:sov:QUmsj7xwB82QAuuzfmvhAi#1"
```
.

The Aries Interop Profile v1.0 includes the Connection Protocol document.

What is the best way forward, procedurally, toward the W3C standard? I'd be keen to know what we ought to do, when.

First - wallet's is confusing, so let's call it "agent storage" with it covering the KMS (keys) plus other agent storage - connections, credentials, protocol state objects and other things.  "Wallets" should be reserved for the mainstream use - mobile agents with secure storage of credentials and keys.

The cloud agent can hold encrypted blobs but should have no access to the keys - those should be held on devices.  I think that is how LastPass works, so it is a bit cloudy. The important thing is that the keys for decrypting and doing things are not copied to a central store - they remain tied to the agent's device.

Replication should be possible through  the edge agents directly sharing data through Aries protocols.  That's are expectation.

While we never expect keys to be moved from one agent to another, the one thing that might in an Indy world is the "link secret" which enables proving a credential.  We think that will need to be able to done from multiple devices, and so that is a quandry. There are some other proposed protections for that, but it's a tricky question.

Thanks @george.aristy  and @swcurran ; some details are still elusive, but it is getting clearer. I read the DIDs are stored on the blockchain. How/When are they put there?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 23:32:57 GMT):<br/>
They are put there according to the DID method being used. For example, the Indy DID method has a client SDK that is embedded in agents.  Other DID methods use similar techniques, but different details - different ledgers, different write mechanisms.

They are usually put there when initializing an agent and configuring, but it somewhat depends on the DID method. For example, with Indy, only credential issuers generally have public DIDs (put on a ledger) and so only agents that issue credentials need to write a DID.

Wait - does that mean theoretically we could run some "free agents" as edge agents and as cloud and router agents,  that do nothing more than run application software to store and exchange items from their wallets - WITHOUT needing a blockchain? Would the underlying communication protocols allow them to find each other (assuming the agents all bind in and run the same protocols)?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 22:31:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes. Running DIDComm establishes secure peer-to-peer channels. On top of that you can do DID/Verifiable Credentials things that need blockchain. But the underlying messaging system doesn't need blockchain.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 22:32:37 GMT):<br/>
We're not really expecting the blockchain component to be the discovery mechanism (although it can be).  We are counting on it for verifiable credentials.

Hi all, I have a question about the Faber-Alice demo. 
On startup, the Faber agent creates a new DID using the parameters 
`{"alias": "FaberAlias", "seed": "00000000000000000SomeSeed", "role": "*TRUST_ANCHOR*"}`
But in the ledger, the NYM transaction role contains the value *ENDORSER*.
As indicated in the https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/auth_rules.md, the role TRUST_ANCHOR do not exist.
So I think that TRUST_ANCHOR is somewhat deprecated ? Is that correct ?

<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 23:26:23 GMT):<br/>
sorry. i'm GNU/Linux user, windows isn't my think.. Maybe it's because of some Configuration or any Proxy (by osma or visual studio)
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 23:28:36 GMT):<br/>
i also blocked firewalls, and check for all the inbound and outbound request.. no blockage by OS
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 02:20:53 GMT):<br/>
@davidd this really appears to either be an OS level or visual studio issue for you, as you are unable to download the dependencies for OSMA when building
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 02:21:27 GMT):<br/>
Do you have any trouble when building node projects or any other languages and downloading dependencies for them?

Good Morning! Hope you're having a great day. I was actually registering two aca-py agents using the same seed. Turns out, both had the same public DID. In that case, how would I be able to differentiate between the two from the ledger?

HI guys, during semantic call I presented our set of tools for dealing with OCA and how to conect it directly to the VC with concept of DRI (hashlinks). recording can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zkXr--0DG7I1k62vaFuotEzIaTIUH0ou?ogsrc=32
What we showed:
- web version of aries toolbox 
- building in resolver for OCA in aries toolbox (when VC is issued and include hashlink it resolves it and load the structure and data directly from data vault
- repository for OCA 
- data transportaion within VC

Due to lack of time I still didn't manage to get out proper RFCs for above topics sorry for that but will try to catch up with it. One of them would be the concept of DRI and another related with extending VC with "big" data structure 
If you would be interested to see the demo live and discuss those topics I am more then happy to show on one of the aries call.

@tplooker @sukalpomitra  any update regarding my issue? i spent more than 2-3 days on just that 'failed to install package form api.nuget.org'...
I check firewalls, proxy, os/visual studio setting, osma config files, .nuget files, reinstall/update nuget pakage installer, install packages manually... did every possible thing but no luck.

anyone, please?

@sukalpomitra @tplooker Is there any possiblity that we create docker image of OSMA (on a pc which runs it properly) and then run it on my pc (which can't run it)?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 17:48:54 GMT):<br/>
try it out

ok
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 17:54:37 GMT):<br/>
A docker image for dev work would be great.  Is that doable for mobile development?

I imagine that it is possible but the IIWBook running on the local host would need to be configure to point to the same ledger as the issuer services (email-verification)
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 23 Feb 2020 16:43:40 GMT):<br/>
The error you are getting looks like iiwbook local can’t find the ledger ... 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 23 Feb 2020 20:17:11 GMT):<br/>
You need to run with the ledger being the BCovrin Test network, make sure that Streetcred is using that network, and you need to use something like ngrok to allow your service to be visible on the internet.

But other than that...yes, it should work.

We have another demo - identity-kit-poc that uses ngrok that way so that you can run it locally, but interact on a mobile agent.

We'd like to see @amanji 's repo of ACA-Py controllers pushed to the Hyperledger organization.  Any objections?  It's a great contribution, showing three examples of ACA-Py controllers using different tech stacks (nodejs/express, .NET and angular). Cool stuff!

Based on recent discussions on Aries Working Group calls, several of us ( @andrew.whitehead @TelegramSam @george.aristy ) have been working on a HackMD doc about a new "Out of Band" protocol that will encompass the invitations in Connections/DID Exchange and the ephemeral challenge - things that are often displayed as QR codes.  Please take a look.  @esplinr @KitHat 

A big goal of this is to enable a connection to be reused vs. a new one created each time a QR code is scanned.  Note that some changes to DID Exchange (and perhaps connections) will also be needed.

https://hackmd.io/duAskli3QHSfx35yd3VDlw?view

I'd like to move it into an aries-rfc PR soon - ideally later this week.

We try to give conceptual q&a for the framework in this thread. Given our bandwidth for support (we're a small team that helps maintain the dotnet framework), it is probably better to ask for any additional support on this channel. we can consider making a dotnet channel, but it's better to log your errors as an issue: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/issues. Can you please post any additional error messages you have received as an issue, and we'll work through ti?

Hey all, not sure if this is the place for this kind of thing, but I thought I'd share for those who are interested. Streetcred just announced our 1. Updated developer portal, and 2. Cross-platform (incl Android) mobile app. I know a lot of folks have been asking for an Android app that works with other Aries codebases. All our stuff is based on the aries-framework-dotnet. Read about the story of this launch on our blog: https://streetcred.id/2020/02/24/launch/

RFC 36 v1.x series includes indy-isms in the credential proposal. 

This is my beginning attempt at RFC 36 v2.0: https://github.com/sklump/aries-rfcs/tree/issue-cred-2.0/features/0036-issue-credential

Github won't take it in a PR. It could be because of its status? Is it PROPOSED if it's a new major version, or should it retain ACCEPTED?

Anyway, this version
* relegates all indy-isms to attachments consistently
* uses angle brackets to denote variable content consistently
* introduces named states and a transition table between such.

It doesn't address batch issue at the moment. @esplinr maybe take a look and comment?

How to create a new credential type or customize credential definitions in OSMA  / aries-framework-dotnet?

<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:12:13 GMT):<br/>
Creating schema and credential definitions are done by issuers. OSMA is an edge agent that is used by holders. So OSMA wont have the features of doing such stuff. I am sure aries-framework-dotnet will have those capabilities. But I have used ACA-PY before to create schema and cred defs

Hi all, I dont know if this question has been asked here or not, or if someone has tried it or not. As indy provides pluggable storage, is it possible to use google drive or dropbox as the storage. I want to run cloudagent for others with their respective clouds as storage. Basically I have trying to eliminate the need for an edge agent like smartphones without compromising privacy. Is it possible? I dont know where the master key that encrypts the wallet is stored though? Is it even possible to do this with just web agent?

Does anyone have a guess what `reject-presentation` is in RFC37? Is it a dressed-up `problem report`? At present the pic cites both messages but the text only refers to `problem-report` as an import.

This means that there is a node in the network that is listed but not participating.  That's OK - as long as the rest of the ledger can achieve consensus.  So think of these as warnings.

When you get to the SelfServe part, please be patient.  Each Endorser DID takes 5-10 seconds to write to the ledger, and each is sequentially queued so if 20 people try to do it at the same time, it could take a couple of minutes for the last person to complete the process.  If you click `Submit` multiple times, the wait gets that much longer...

The credential should be issued by the Sovrin Agent automatically and will appear in your “Credentials” list. If it does not appear within a few seconds, click the refresh button.

@dbluhm - I deleted Bob (admin) from the Aries toolbox, restarted the docker container, (re)added Bob to the Aires toolbox, and then retried steps D and E at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jxdt64wS1k6hrDE21VVRHsU7qtajX0hIVYp-BNiEeVE/edit

2. ctrl-C both shells running docker container and Aries Toolbox UI
3. Delete both docker images created by docker-compose, just so we are indeed starting from scratch

Hello, I am a graduating student hoping to use Aries to make an application for verifiable university certificates, but I kind of got lost on where to begin and how. I've tried starting with ACA-py but got overwhelmed and lost on how to start my own code. Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 14:58:02 GMT):<br/>
I'd start with a vanilla example using an agent, and see how it currently works and plan how you want to use it. ACApy is a good one to start with.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 17:16:32 GMT):<br/>
Not sure how much this has been tried, but an Indy Proof involves processing each claim individually, fully supporting claims coming from multiple credentials.  It's very unlikely that this process would not include getting a proof of non-revocation for the credential that sourced each claim.

FYI: Aries Cloud Agent - Python Release 0.4.5 has been tagged and posted to PyPi. Release notes can be found here - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.4.5.

Includes a fix to the handling of self-attested attributes.  And we now have a NOTICES file - the only Linux Foundation required file we were missing from the repo.

Code reference documentation has been generated to ReadTheDocs - https://aries-cloud-agent-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


NOTE: We have merged the "support anoncreds 1.0 revocation" PR into the master branch and will include that in the next ACA-Py release. Not too much in documentation, but for those interested, check it out! w00t!!

A note on the tails location when going in production. URL's should be served over https, otherwise iOS will have issues fetching them.
I'm assuming the production ones will be publicly available, the ones I found seem to be behind an internal network.

Indy uses a number of different crypto primitives, consult the indy sdk docs for that.
OSMA uses Xamarin Essentials, which stores keys on in secure storage (iOS keychain)

Is there any open source implementation available which demonstrates connecting edge agent (mobile apps) with a web based agent apart from OSMA ?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 13:58:44 GMT):<br/>
I don't think so.  There are two React Native projects that are getting close but I don't know how far they go.  Both are in RocketChat, so better they reply, but I can point you to the repos - https://github.com/ayanworks/ARNIMA and https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 14:40:22 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for giving a call here @swcurran about the ARNIMA agent.
@HLFPOC - We already have open sourced base version of the React-Native agent and are working on next set of features as I write. There is potentially next update going to come in some time from now.

FYI - we are removing the 0.1 versions of the credential exchange (issue, presentation) APIs from ACA-Py.  These were deprecated quite awhile ago when the Credential Exchange 1.0 (RFCs 0036 and 0037) were added.  This will be part of the next release, which will be numbered 0.5.0.

Hi Everyone, I’m wondering if someone here can help. I have the goal of comparing the approach of the aries-protocol-test-suite to the aries-agent-test-harness. While trying to run the aries-protocol-test-suite, I get a problem that looks like a bug in the code. I’m just following the [Quickstart Guide here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-protocol-test-suite), when I run ```protocoltest``` if give the following error.  Maybe someone has a quick fix to save me time diving into it? Thanks. I believe I have narrowed it down to the line of code in the test suite project that causes the error. If you need to see the whole trace I can add an attachment. This code in question I believe was added in Nov.

Thanks for the link, I actually looked into OSMA code once and also read this file, but what I mean by that asking was, how it communicate with Aries .NET Agent and how it knows that the provided QR Code is the right one? I didn't get that part from the Code!

The standard invitation format is a URL with a Base64URLEncoded json object as a query parameter.

The Invitation URL format is as follows, with some elements described below:

https://<domain>/<path>?c_i=<invitationstring>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 13:10:37 GMT):<br/>
No - credentials are issued to the holder and can only be proven by the holder.  As such, VCs as defined today can't be transferred to anyone else.
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 13:11:29 GMT):<br/>
okay, so we will have probably look for a non-VC approach...
</p>
<p><strong>Audrius</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 13:54:56 GMT):<br/>
Credentials are not transferable, but I guess to implement mentioned ticket transfer case could be (or will be) possible with Chained Credentials approach (RFC0104)? @swcurran what is your opinion?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 14:01:38 GMT):<br/>
Funny -that was the reason for my caveat in my response. 

There might be a way with RFC104, particularly for a uniquely identified resource that might be used on a first come, first serve basis -- e.g. where there is not a strict double-spend prevention requirement.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 14:02:23 GMT):<br/>
I consider 104 to be a futures thing in that the crypto for it is not yet in Indy. I understand it's in Ursa (that's great), but it will be a bit before it is in Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>Audrius</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 14:17:29 GMT):<br/>
My thought was related to the car rental use case which is in RFC104. Delegation authority through issuing VC could be useful for enterprises. Shareholders->CEO->..etc. up to asset ownership at employee level. And again transfer such ownership... 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 14:49:35 GMT):<br/>
Absolutely!!!  That's why we are anxious for them to be available.

@dbluhm I seem to be through that error by using pytest 4.6.3. 
I'm wondering now if someone could help me understand the config.toml file? I'm not entirely sure what endpoints are for what. Are you starting an agent internally to the test suite or is the test suite pretending to be an agent? Where is that endpoint defined in the config (endpoint reported to other agents section)?  Is that internal agent to connect to a ledger already running? 
What are the HTTP Server options for?
The endpoint for the agent under test (one I already have running) I assume is in config.subject?
Can you explain how the ManualBackchannel works and what are the other options for the backchannel?
If some or all of these could be answered it would be greatly appreciated.

Hi all, I recently wrote about how we are tackling including images into credentials using ipfs - https://hackmd.io/pwZVCvXnTAy2qtxJ2L2lJQ Be interested to hear peoples thoughts. Has anyone tried this before? 
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Fri, 20 Mar 2020 14:55:24 GMT):<br/>
Interesting! What's the size limit of a credential attribute?  I thought a simple hack would be to really just encode the image an interpret it is a string on the indy level. Then the hash of the string would be actually signed, and on the application level one could interpret the string as an image again.

Change this line to `master` from `stable` - `RUN add-apt-repository "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/sdk/deb xenial master"`

1. You can use docker to host your asp.net core process that will run an agent. We use this strategy and it works pretty well
2. No need for ngrok, since your agent is hosted in the cloud. You just need to find a way to pass the hosting URL to the AgentOptions. You can configure this in appsettings.json. The actual Aries agent code doesn't care what host/IP you run your service on, it just wants to know what public host/IP is configured for them so it can pass that to invitations.
3. When your mobile agent scans an invitation generated from your WebAgent it will have an endpoint that points to your WebAgent URL. This is the same endpoint I mentioned in point 1.

Hi, I want to know about how aries agents works in Production e.g. Pools, Wallets etc. and how to scale them? Here is an example of our system and about our requirement.
Banks (Issuer) will have Web Agent (aries-framework-dotnet) and Customers (Holder) will have Mobile Agent (e.g. osma).

1- Ledger: For now we want to use private ledger. In future we will likely to consider Sovirn network, but now for Pilot project we want to run our private network. How to setup private network/ledger?
2- Pool: Is the pool will be same for everyone (issuer & holder) and how to connect with it from production?
3- Wallet: Every issuer and holder will get their own wallet.
4- Issuer: How can we add multiple issuers (with steward role) that they are able to issue credentials for their customers? 
5- Branches: Bank have hundreds of branches, Is there any possibility that all branches can work on behave of one bank (issuer)?
5- Scale: We have multiple issuers (bank) and every bank has millions of customers, how to scale this (things we should consider)?
6- How will mobile agents connect with web agents (making endpoints public)? 

If there is any doc or related resources which could help us to understand this, it will be very helpful!
Thanks

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 21 Mar 2020 23:30:23 GMT):<br/>
A couple of thoughts.  First, the proposed hashlink protocol might be helpful for this. It combines a URL location and a hash of the contents -- which is kind of like what IPFS does implicitly.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sporny-hashlink-04

But that doesn't help anyone with where to store the image, which is where IPFS helps.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 21 Mar 2020 23:33:19 GMT):<br/>
The concern though is that once the verifier has the hash of IPFS content, they have the identifier for the image - the content, without (as I understand it) any access control. For general content that might be OK, but a bit concerning for biometrics such as a picture of the person. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 21 Mar 2020 23:35:18 GMT):<br/>
The IPFS solution is great for a range of use cases where the issuer can attest to the content by putting the hash in the credential and the holder can prove the content via a hash to the full content.
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 11:12:06 GMT):<br/>
Interesting, thanks Stephen. I guess it would depend on the trust placed on Verifiers within the domain. E.g. if all verifiers are inside a single organisation and only this org has access to the IPFS network this could mitigate some of these concerns
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 11:28:44 GMT):<br/>
Also, what my understanding of decorators correct?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 12:29:51 GMT):<br/>
IPFS links (and now hashlinks) is a great way to express links to external resources in a credential where public access to the data isn't a concern.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 14:20:14 GMT):<br/>
Decorators don't really come into it. You are talking about a value inside a credentials (a claim) and decorators are at the DIDComm messaging layer.  An IPFS reference is just a URL, and that is the value you will put in a claim.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 14:20:56 GMT):<br/>
Same as if you put the image in the credential via base64 encoding - that would be a string.
</p>
<p><strong>daveek</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 16:33:51 GMT):<br/>
It worked thanks, now want to use this docker image to run web agent but it returned this error message.
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/issues/72#issuecomment-602235560
If u could have a look, thanks :)
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 18:00:44 GMT):<br/>
But as I understood it decorators are a suggestion for communicating images or more generally files along with proof (a hash) that this file was issued to you.
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 18:03:25 GMT):<br/>
Also are you saying that it is possible to base64 an image and store it in an attribute. I was under the impression that this was not feasible because of the size. @domwoe I don't actually know the attribute size limit, perhaps @swcurran knows though?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 19:03:24 GMT):<br/>
It is definitely possible to put an image in a credential - we've done it.  And use, with the attachment decorator, you can attach a document (or link to one) in an Aries message, but that doesn't get it in the credential.  Credential attributes (claims) are just singleton data elements.  So there is not really a connection between a decorator (something at the Aries level) and a claim within a credential.
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 07:31:37 GMT):<br/>
I experimented a bit yesterday with base64 encoded images as attributes. Tiny images work without issues, but with reasonable images I get an error when trying to store the received credential in the wallet. 
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 09:08:16 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran yep I think I understand that. But if I was to use a decorator to send an attachment over a DIDComm channel, then over the same channel prove that I had been issued a credential with an attribute attesting to the hash of this attachement would that not be the same as proving the attachment was "issued" to me. Or at least vouched for by some other entity?
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 10:03:57 GMT):<br/>
I also just published this - https://wip-abramson.dev/usable-credential-schema Would greatly appreciate hearing other peoples thoughts on defining credential schema and proof templates for a specific domain. I strongly believe the data model should be normalised, but open to be shown why this is not right. Cheers

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 13:47:23 GMT):<br/>
Yes I think we would absolutely agree that there will be many credential ecosystems ... and this is touched upon in the Trust over IP governance stack (RFC 0289). In fact, this RFC will be updated this week to make it even more explicit.

<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 18:28:14 GMT):<br/>
I think we are perhaps talking at cross purposes. I am discussing how to define credential schema within a single credential ecosystem. Which I mean as a set of credential schema defined to meet the needs of a specific domain. I imagine by this definition there are already many credential ecosystems deployed on Sovrin and other Indy variants
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 18:36:07 GMT):<br/>
I think that looks reasonable. We do something similar in the OrgBook (now aries-vcr) where we start with 'foundational' credentials which include the basic identifying information, and related credentials which generally have a domain-specific ID field in common. FYI I find the text color a bit light on that site for comfortable reading
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 18:40:02 GMT):<br/>
The rich schemas effort is largely about producing reusable schemas for particular domains of course
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 19:29:23 GMT):<br/>
and I think a real benefit of the Indy ledger is that it contains both the credential schema (after it is agreed upon by the trust community ideally :)) and it contains those that may be using the schema (credential definitions) ... so there can be discovery
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 19:29:45 GMT):<br/>

Hi, I'm defining custom Schemas and creating Credentials in Aca-Py and Aries .Net Framework.
How to see if they successfully defined and created on indy ledger?
How to retrieve the existing one?

Interesting @jljordan_bcgov I heard talk that in the future it may no longer be necessary to have credential definitions on the ledger. But I agree having this information on the ledger provides some useful markers when making trust decisions

In the project I am working on we refer to templates and the object used to generate proof/presentation requests. And the requests themselves as the actual transaction sending that template to a specific holder

<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 10:54:24 GMT):<br/>
If you are creating it on Sovrin network, one way is to find them via https://indyscan.io
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 10:55:20 GMT):<br/>
You can also easily deploy indyscan against your local network or AWS, there's a tutorial in github repo https://github.com/Patrik-Stas/indyscan/

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 15:34:36 GMT):<br/>
I can't see cred defs of some form not being on a ledger/trusted utility.  They contain per-claim public keys for signing (tamper proofing the data) and a link to the Issuer (Issuer's DID). Those are necessary for a verifiable credential.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 16:31:06 GMT):<br/>
@zossimov thanks for catch! Fixed now, there was mistake in the readme. The actual command to run was `npm install`, not `npm run install`. Also fixed the package.json
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 19:48:12 GMT):<br/>
What's the argument for requiring individual signing/verification keys per claim or even per cred def? If an issuer does not need this it could also add a global verification key to its DID document/
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 19:51:55 GMT):<br/>
It's part of the AnonCreds mechanism. It's necessary for the ZKP tech and for the business needs of using ZKPs. It allows claims from multiple credentials and multiple issuers in a single proof.

The "key per claim" also enables selective disclosure.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 19:52:52 GMT):<br/>
Just as a matter of interest, what is the objection to having cred defs?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 20:01:32 GMT):<br/>
ok, this might be out of my depth, but I imagined I could prove that I know an attribute under this schema with the signature corresponding to the following verkey which belong to this DID. And I could repeat that for different attributes part of different schemas signed by different DIDs.
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 20:04:52 GMT):<br/>
I think it might make sense for an issuer to publish on the ledger which types of credential it issues and the credential definition might also be required for revocation, but in some cases it seemed to me like an unnecessary write to the ledher
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 20:05:08 GMT):<br/>
A bit out of my depth as well, but The problem with that is that you can rotate your key for your DID and then there would be no way to verify the issued credentials.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 20:05:08 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 20:06:06 GMT):<br/>
But this goes deeper than I understand, so you have to start to look at the full anonymous credentials design.
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 20:07:22 GMT):<br/>
yeah, but it would be the special key to sign credentials and not your authentication key. The same is true if you rotate the keys in the cred def. Ah, no, the cred defs are versioned, aren't they?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 20:10:11 GMT):<br/>
hm, no, only schemas are. Thanks anyway Stephen. I've still a long road ahead of me ;)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 22:14:57 GMT):<br/>
Cred Defs are tagged so they can be versioned.

I wrote this a while back when I was grappling with CL Signatures - https://wip-abramson.dev/cl-signatures essentially a cred def is the public key for a CL Signature. This key requires a unique BIG number for each attribute in the credential

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 15:00:18 GMT):<br/>
I suppose you can, but you have to know how to interact with the wallet and open it first.

What are you trying to do?  Use indy-cli or just see the transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 15:08:16 GMT):<br/>
You use the `ledger` commands in indy-cli to see what's on the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 15:08:41 GMT):<br/>
Try using the cli's built-in help, try `help` at the command prompt, or `ledger help` for example

Thanks for replying. I've run the demo play-with-docker and it worked when using streetcred but osma is not work (May be streedcred have an cloud agent right?). With Streetcred, first we need to set the network same with the URL_Ledger (for me is BCovrin Test network) we run on acapy-controller demo. After that, on Faber Controller, I created a *connection invitation* and convert it to QR code for Streetcred to scan. The connection is set, but the *connection state* I checked on Faber Swagger is "*respone*" not "*active*". So that we can not issue credentials. Then I sent a "trust pinging" to connection-id we created and magically the state of the connection has changed to "*active*". Finally I can issue a credential from Faber Controller to Alice using Streetcred agent.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 15:40:44 GMT):<br/>
Great, glad it's working!  That's pretty much the same as our experience.  We updated the Faber script to allow sending credentials when the connection status is "response", in case you don't have the latest code.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 15:40:58 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure about OSMA but there is a developer working on it!

Hi, to build a mobile agent using dotnet agent framework with xamarin, how does the mobile agent get a static endpoint so that other agents can reach it? Is a cloud agency required?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 31 Mar 2020 12:08:36 GMT):<br/>
well yes, it needs a cloud agent. But as of now the response is sent back through the same http connection
</p>
<p><strong>bricg</strong> (Tue, 31 Mar 2020 12:48:46 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, I don't follow. Can you elaborate please?
</p>
<p><strong>bricg</strong> (Tue, 31 Mar 2020 13:12:09 GMT):<br/>
If I deploy a mobile agent on an iPhone, what http endpoint is used for communicating with it? Can you explain what happens as of now versus what will happen when fully implemented. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 31 Mar 2020 13:17:50 GMT):<br/>
so if you want to talk to a verifier or an issuer, the mobile edge agent talks to the service endpoint of the verifier and the response to any request comes in the same live http connection. If somehow, the mobile gets switched off or it moves out of coverage, the message is lost. A cloud agent gives the guarantee of each message. The phone can pick up the message once it gets the coverage back. And if someone wants to send a message to an edge agent, it cannot happen without a cloud agent.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 31 Mar 2020 19:04:21 GMT):<br/>
@bricg The mobile agent requires a web agent called Mediator to accept messages for delivery.
Aries .NET provides a sample mediator agent that can be used in conjuction with an Edge agent.
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/tree/master/samples/routing

Configuration is simple. Use `RegisterMediator` on your web service, and use `RegisterEdge` in your mobile device.
During provisioning, the Edge will connect to the mediator and configure itself.

@tomislav Execuse me sir... In the routing sample of aries dotnet framework. Now I want to expand the sample, so that Edge Agent can connect with an Issuer, and get a Credential from them. I tried with that edge agent

@tomislav  Execuse me, sir. Please help me this stuff.... 
In the routing sample of aries-dotnet-framework. Now, I want to expand the sample so that Edge Agent can connect to an Issuer, and get a Credential from them. I tried but I faced error related to Pool config when calling  *ProcessCredentialRequestAsync()* ... So, do we need to create a normal Agent ( I mean the agent is created *RegisterAgent()* ) and combine to the available Edge Agent?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 12:06:25 GMT):<br/>
`RegisterAgent` will create a regular agent that has ability to issue, verify and hold. `RegisterMediator` will create agent that can only forward messages.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 12:07:03 GMT):<br/>
The error you're getting is probably because the path to pool file genesis isn't specified. You need to pass a full path name to a valid genesis txn file
</p>
<p><strong>thinhnnd</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 13:13:42 GMT):<br/>
You mention that "*RegisterMediator* will create agent that can only forward messages". So does the *RegisterEdgeAgent* right?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 13:14:25 GMT):<br/>
No. RegisterEdge creates an agent that can do everything. In addition, it configures that agent with a mediator agent.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 13:14:25 GMT):<br/>
No. RegisterEdge creates an agent that can do everything. In addition, it configures that agent to receive messages from a mediator agent.
</p>
<p><strong>thinhnnd</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 13:15:54 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I got that. May be I config wrong for the genesis file as you said. Thank you

@swcurran - Is it possible to use the Aries Agent as a standalone wallet? Like how this video describes it 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km4IoUdb3Lc 
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:20:02 GMT):<br/>
Is there an implementation we can look at ? Thanks alot
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:22:47 GMT):<br/>
last week's call posted (sorry I was so slow this round): https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=31197042
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:26:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  Right now, most Aries frameworks (ACA-Py, AF-.NET) use the indy sdk as the secure storage (aka wallet) layer.  AF-Go uses only golang native dependencies so I'm not as sure, but would guess it has comparable capabilties.  As such, the storage layer handles what (I think - I didn't listen to the whole thing, but know the context) is covered in that video.  I believe that video describes that Indy implements.
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:28:45 GMT):<br/>
ok.. Do you know if the ACA-Py has a REST interface to access the wallet?
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:29:10 GMT):<br/>
We just want to use the core wallet functions, being able to store and retrieve secrets and search for them
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:39:54 GMT):<br/>
Not sure for your use case.  This demo describes how you can quickly spin up an instance and look at the rest interface in swagger.  You don't have to do the whole process - just use the instructions to start up one of the agents (e.g. Faber) and look at the exposed API.

</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:40:58 GMT):<br/>
we did look this and its more for issuing and sharing verifiable credentials..
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:41:17 GMT):<br/>
we want to just the wallet part of the agent and not really the verifiable credential part
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:41:22 GMT):<br/>
if thats possible
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:41:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes - that's the main purpose for both Indy and Aries.  If that's not your use case, then it may not be what you want.
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:42:08 GMT):<br/>
we were wondering if we can just use the wallet portion of the agent
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:43:30 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like you would want to use just the wallet portion of Indy.  If so, I would look at what it does.

Having said that, we hope to soon deprecate that and have an Aries secure storage component. However, that will be even more focused on Agent functions - connections, credential exchange, and use cases around that.'
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 17:04:08 GMT):<br/>
can you point me to the wallet portion of Indy
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 17:04:15 GMT):<br/>
any documentation?
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 18:33:23 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean by wallet?
what is the use case you are thinking of? 
the purpose of storage in Aries is to have a place to store keys, store credentials and increasingly to store things like state of connections, protocol exchanges and so forth. each of these types of things that need to be stored have a bit different requirement around how the objects are handled for security.
it is likely that trying to "just use the wallet" doesn't make sense separate from the other agent services

Hello team, currently working on a mobile app in react native and have tried using rn-indy-sdk + Indy.framework (generated from the iOS wrapper) but have been unable to get the framework to compile in Xcode. I've also tried aries-framework-javascript + indy-sdk but continue to get binding errors. I've been at it for two days straight. Does anyone have any suggestions on a way forward?
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 22:11:34 GMT):<br/>
we were thinking of using the Aries as a general purpose wallet, for storing keys, signing transactions like a Key Management System
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 22:27:16 GMT):<br/>
I don't think aries is likely going to fit your needs, but you can look at this - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/docs/design/003-wallet-storage

The code and test for the wallet is in that same repo.

Greetings everyone. I am going trough the Python samples in this url: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/how-tos/write-did-and-query-verkey/python/utils.py I have seen that for the DID creation and all other ledger actions, the ledger interraction is bein local with DOCKER containers, the 4 ones. I have now got test tokens for the Sovrin Builder Net. Does anyone knows similar Python samples from Sovrin so that one can play around with the "pool" of Sovrin builder net or staging and to do writes there and not on the local indy Docker nodes? Thanks in advance,
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 15:39:11 GMT):<br/>
thank you @swcurran .. does it support encryption natively or something that can be plugged in?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 15:41:48 GMT):<br/>
Not absolutely certain.  My recollection is that the storage target is pluggable (e.g. sqllite, postgres) but the encryption is not.
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 15:42:18 GMT):<br/>
can we use it to store secrets?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 15:44:46 GMT):<br/>
Yes - it has a "secrets" and "non-secrets" storage API, both of which result in the data going into encrypted storage.  The data model is very simple - an "items" table, and a "tags" table that contains values and links to items.  You can search tags to find items.
</p>
<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 15:45:47 GMT):<br/>
cool..thx..is it supposed to be used as an sdk or as an application?
</p>

OSMA (Open Source Mobile Agent) has been moved to Hyperledger as Aries MobileAgent Xamarin. The old Repo has been archived, with the current repo code submitted to the new repo to begin clean DCO history. If you have cloned the old repo. you'll need to clone the new one and migrate any fixes in the form of patches. Issues will similarly need to be re-opened on the new repo. Thanks for Mattr Global for the contribution and help!

Trying to follow. In this thread. Is "the wallet portion of Indy" (which is being deprecated and replaced by an Aries secure storage component) the same thing as "Indy SD" (which is built into the aries acapy/.net, but not go framework)?

<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:25:40 GMT):<br/>
As was indicated, aries generates and stores its own keys, for example, for the didexchange protocol to handle messages being sent and received. Thus, there are methods to use the keys to encrypt with their public key and decrypt with my private key. For @PradeepJaligama to provide his own keys and use the KMS to store the private key, I think his external application/controller could (maybe through a new rest API function) call a new function in the storage level, to store his keys. And another call to the KMS to decrypt something upon demand and return it back up to the outside application. Does that seem doable? A good idea?  It would allow reuse of a lot of great work being done here, but may require additional pkg and API.

Hi, I want to know about how aries agents works in Production e.g. Pools, Wallets etc. and how to scale them? Here is an example of our system and about our requirement.
Banks (Issuer) will have Web Agent (aries-framework-dotnet) and Customers (Holder) will have Mobile Agent (e.g. osma).

1- Ledger: For now we want to use private ledger. In future we will likely to consider Sovirn network, but now for Pilot project we want to run our private network. How to setup private network/ledger?
2- Pool: Is the pool will be same for everyone (issuer & holder) and how to connect with it from production?
3- Wallet: Every issuer and holder will get their own wallet.
4- Issuer: How can we add multiple issuers (with steward role) that they are able to issue credentials for their customers? 
5- Branches: Bank have hundreds of branches, Is there any possibility that all branches can work on behave of one bank (issuer)?
5- Scale: We have multiple issuers (bank) and every bank has millions of customers, how to scale this (things we should consider)?
6- How will mobile agents connect with web agents (making endpoints public)? 

If there is any doc or related resources which could help us to understand this, it will be very helpful!
Thanks

1. Just use an instance of von-network running on a private cloud/VM for the PoC.  Or you could just use ours - http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/.  https://github.com/bcgov/von-network.  If you are familiar with Fabric -- this is NOTHING like that.  It's trivial to run a test/PoC ledger.  Even a production one is orders of magnitude easier.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 19:54:06 GMT):<br/>
2 - Pool is just an agents way to connect to the ledger. Each loads the genesis file for the ledger all are using.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 19:54:43 GMT):<br/>
3 - yes.  The issuer one will be large, because it has a connection to every holder.  This is standard Enterprise scaling.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 19:55:48 GMT):<br/>
4. You would likely have just one issuer, no need for the Steward role.  The Issuer would write (via a Steward) the need handful of ledger transactions. Every other participant can just read the transactions/cache them.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 19:57:42 GMT):<br/>
5. Yes.  If they are using an enterprise system, there would be one agent for the bank - the issuer.  Build it as a REST service and allow apps to connect for services - issue credential, prove presentations, etc.  That needs to be a scalable service on an enterprise platform.  We use OpenShift (K8S) with auto-scaling, postgres DB, etc.  Standard enterprise configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 19:59:02 GMT):<br/>
5 - The issuers are the element to be scaled. Think of them like a web app receiving requests from all of the customers.  Scale them the same way - stateless requests, persist state, auto-scaled resources, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:01:56 GMT):<br/>
6. Common model is a user goes to web site of the issuer (bank) and clicks a link that displays a QR code.  The QR code is scanned to establish a connection and then an interaction (say, an issuance) happens.

You can see this with these two demos:

- ConfBook - chained Issuers - https://vonx.io/how_to/confbook
- Once you have the ConfBook credentials, log into a simulated service using a Verifiable Credential IdP with OIDC to the service. - https://csb-audio.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/

Presentations show a nice design with a resolver interface to use aries with various blockchains. Unless I missed it, the go framework code and docs do not seem to have a resolver interface defined for implementing blockchain functions. Does ACAPY? Where can we find it?

Hi all, I am trying to solve a problem that requires both the blockchain network i.e. indy and fabric.  Seeing that aries is blackchain agnostic with a resolver interface, I was wondering has anybody tried to use other blockchain with aries?

My dockerfile contains the exact same content as the dockerfile.demo used to run alice normally (I have just added the extra stuff to run node) so I don't see why this wouldn't work. My version of python is 3.7.3 (also tried with 3.6.10 get a different error but it still doesn't work) Can anyone help? (the python configuration seems messed up)

In the meantime, you can use any apps out there that will help you work with the web agent.
Streetcred Identity Wallet (iOS and Android) is built with the Aries .NET and should work well

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 14 Apr 2020 14:58:59 GMT):<br/>
Yes, you can use the example as a basis for it
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 14 Apr 2020 14:59:19 GMT):<br/>
One thing you may want to consider is clearing your wallet cache, since the agent may be provisioned with your old endpoint

Hi, 
Just demoed in the Aries semantics WG usage of Aries Toolbox that may be of interest to this group. These are some of the findings from implementing a demo COVIN-19 immunity proof using Aries Toolbox:
- Complete reset should be done through “manage down” to reset ledger + in docker “Aries” container move to trash
- To setup issuer for creating schema no simply troubleshooting. Need to perform very exact steps, easy to miss steps and no message what went wrong.
- Verifiable Credential disappears from Issuer but can be found on Holder. Unclear why.
- Creating proof request can ONLY be done with attributes and not predicates. Get error “Error deserializing message: Schema validation failed” when trying to use predicate.
- Cannot perform complex proofs across multiple schemas, option blocked to select schema def in proof request.
- Presentations option has no effect. Unclear if anything supported.
ToDo
- Add a 3rd agent.

Plan to document some of these findings so others wanting to simulate using Aries Toolbox can do it with extra pain.

Hello everyone,
I am new with indy and aries.
I have just finished the two courses about aries and indy LFS172x and LFS173x in edx.
I have few questions:
1) How to create a public did: Anyone could create it or it depends on the deployed indy network (in its configuration)?
2) Using the aca-py agent, how could you obtain the diddoc?
3)In order to get a list of credentitals or schemas published in the ledger, we will need their id? we could not get all the lists of schemas for example?
4) My main goal is to use a local indy network with a deployed fabric blockhain, we have to gaurantee the interoperability between these two BCs. Mainly, some chaincode deployed in fabric should check some claims for the user. Is it possible to use the indy sdk, or aries inside the chaincode?

Thank you in advance for your help/responses

Can anyone tell me that where the credentials uploaded in server (which was hosted somewhere i.e. aws). Custom blockchain was deployed on that aws server. All the credentials uploaded by agents will be stored in server or not? If stored in which format (encoded or not)?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:02:32 GMT):<br/>
1) In general it depends on the configuration of the Indy network.  On the "sandbox" networks (the ones based on the dev configuration in indy), there is an endorser with a known seed that can be used to create DIDs that in turn can be endorsers.  On Sovrin Mainnet, there are a set of endorsers who have private keys that can be used to sign transactions for authors.  No one can create a public DID on Sovrin without contacting an endorser and getting the transaction signed (endorsed).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:04:27 GMT):<br/>
2) When you create a connection in ACA-Py, a DIDDoc is created based on the configuration of the agent - e.g. the endpoint that is defined, if there is a mediator, etc.  All of that is managed in the connections handling - both creating the DID for the agent and receiving/managing a DID/DIDDoc from another agent.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:07:45 GMT):<br/>
3) Simple answer is yes.  The ledger does not inherently have a "search" or "discovery" mechanism. However, since the ledger is public and reads are free, people have created tools that connect with a ledger and download every transactions, classifying them, putting them in a database so that they can be searched.  The result is a way to get a list of schema.  See http://indyscan.io as an example.  Deploying your own is easy, although there is not a lot of need.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:11:06 GMT):<br/>
4) I don't know that much about Fabric so can't really help. Claims/Credentials are held by individuals (not on the ledger), so the interactions that you describe would not be with chaincode connecting to an Indy ledger, but by a connection to the agent that is holding the claims.  I suppose in chaincode you might be able to verify a signature of a participant against a public DID on the ledger.  That would not be used from claims, but just control over the DID.
</p>

Hope that helped!

In our project, we have a one use case where an entity A will receive a proof presentation of  claim C1 from another agent B.
Is there any possibility that the entity A provides this  proof presentation about C1  for A to another agent D. 
Thanks is advance :)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 19:31:54 GMT):<br/>
Funny - I just asked a similar question on the Indy channel.  Technically, they can do share the proof, but what it proves in re-sharing is the question.  The issue for D is whether A just made up that proof themselves?  I"m not sure of the answer for that.

I'd be interested in the details you have about the use case - what you are trying to do.

Hi all, Can someone tell me the roadmap of untying aries-dotnet-framework from indy-sdk. I am still stuck at the question of using fabric ledger with aries-dotnet-framework. I looked at the go framework which seems to be written more modularly providing us with a interface to use any storage we want. But it doesnt seem to be production ready and has many bugs and lack implementation of schema and credential definitions. It is not a hard requirement to use fabric ledger but how much it is possible to do so with dotnet-framework

Aries framework is built with the idea of using schemas and credential definitions for issuance. How would you represent this using a fabric ledger? If you do want to go to that length, it should be possible to provide your own implementation of ISchemaService, ILedgerService, ICredentialService that uses Fabric as a ledger
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 20:20:10 GMT):<br/>
As far as roadmap, once we have another mature implementation of credential platform, we will add support for that in Aries. There are many efforts which are becoming very good candidates for this

Hi all, I have a question regarding aries-framework-dotnet. I'm currently writing my thesis on agencies/mediators in Aries and one of the goals is to allow inter-vendor edge agent -> mediator relationships. While looking through the code of aries-framework-dotnet I found an implementation based on the `basic-routing` message family.  (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/master/src/Hyperledger.Aries.Routing/RoutingTypeNames.cs ). The aries-rfcs have no reference of this protocol or message family. Is this protocol documented somewhere, and are there any plans on making this an Aries standard? Using a combination of existing protocols (routing/forward, mediator coordination, transport return route / pickup) a part of this is already achievable, some parts are not. I think it would be great if for example an edge agent based on aries-framework-javascript could use aries-framework-dotnet as a mediator.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sat, 18 Apr 2020 13:06:53 GMT):<br/>
This protocol is experimental and not part of an RFC. There have been some efforts to standardize edge/mediator protocols, but nothing specific. In general, edge/mediator transport is considered to be "vendor specific" and isn't required to be standardized. While it would be nice to have other codebases being able to hook up to any mediator, it also introduces another interop family to maintain across code bases.
If someone is looking to champion this effort, I'll be more than happy to provide my help.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sat, 18 Apr 2020 13:44:50 GMT):<br/>
It would indeed introduce another interop family, but I think this would be totally worth the trouble as it fits the interoperable nature of Aries. Aries-framework-dotnet already has an internal protocol and other implementations probably want to achieve approximately the same at some point. Maybe the inbox / device info could be an optional extension to the coordinatemediaton message family. As it fits great with the subject of my thesis, I would like to pick this up. I'm however relatively new to Aries and not fully confident i'm going to take the right approach. Thank you @tomislav, your answer was really helpful
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 18 Apr 2020 13:58:11 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra - having an RFC created for this would be great - much appreciated.

I've tried to wrap my head around this issue today, but have some unresolved thoughts.

It doesn't seem right to introduce a new protocol when there are already protocols in place to achieve most functionality.

the `basic-routing` protocol in `aries-framework-dotnet` achieves the following:
- Retrieving messages
- Deleting messages
- Add keys for which messages should be stored
- Add device info (for push notifications I assume)

The adding of keys for which to store messages could be achieved using the already existing Mediator Coordination Protocol. This allows to separate the storing of messages from the forwarding of messages. When an endpoint is available for the recipient the Mediator Coordination Protocol in itself is sufficient to setup mediation.

When the recipient of a message does not have an endpoint a way is needed to retrieve messages. Currently the pickup protocol can be used for this. This is however only for picking up pending messages and doesn't have an inbox. Compare it to POP where messages are deleted after retrieval. As per PR 414 (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/414#issuecomment-594466265) an error in the flow could introduce for lost messages. To solve this retrieval of messages could be separated from the deletion of messages . This is how the `basic-routing` protocol in `framework-dotnet` currently does this.

In a comment on explicitly separating the pickup from the release-from-server-storage process, Daniel Hardman said that it would be so close to how IMAP works we maybe should abandon the pickup protocol all together and let agents use IMAP instead (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/414#issuecomment-594689457). Although he makes a valid point, I think the complexity of integrating IMAP into agents is way above that of a simple message access protocol in Aries. Also the implementation of the `basic-routing` protocol shows the need for something like this.

I created a quick 'Message Access Protocol' document based on the pickup protocol, inspired by the `basic-routing` protocol. It would replace the pickup protocol. It is nowhere near complete, but gives an idea of the  goals: https://hackmd.io/BFh1ZQN4SNWxLgybqzazkA  I did not add a the concept of an inbox. The implementation  in `aries-framework-dotnet` where this design is partially based on does use an inbox. Would it be useful to introduce the concept of inboxes? It could also be implied that when an agent is granted mediation trough the Mediator Coordination Protocol an 'inbox' is automatically created.

This would only leave the 'Add device info' functionality. For this maybe some metadata functionality could be added to the protocol. Or maybe something like out-of-band notification info that the mediator could use to notify the edge agent of new messages (e.g. device id for push notifications)

I think the impact of not defining a protocol for this would be that interoperability between different code-bases would be harder.

I would really appreciate some thoughts on this topic. If we can come to an agreement I will invest the time of creating an RFC. @swcurran @jljordan_bcgov @tomislav 
also pinging @danielhardman  due to the comments on IMAP, and @TelegramSam  as the author of the pickup protocol.

Hi! I want to create an edge agent, which is capable of generating a QR-Code with the aries connection protocol (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0160-connection-protocol) to establish a connection with an existing wallet app (eg. esatus wallet app). I started the aries cloudagent and a local Pool on my server. Does anyone know where I can find how to create an edge Agent with Aries? Or are there some samples that I could use?

Hi tom, isnt credential def and schema and Did are just key value pairs on the ledger? Say in case of indy ledger when i ask for a credential def lookup dont i just get the value and then use it? Maybe I am missing something. I havent really gone into the functioning of indy or how and why it does what it does. I just want to know if changing underlying key value pair storage will do the trick or it is going to take much molre than that

Hi all for those who are not connected over at DIF where I placed a similar message in the claims and credentials working group, we (Mattr) will be demoing a new digital signature approach to ZKP capable verifiable credentials at IIW that have the following properties. 

- Do not require credential definitions so hence are ledger agnostic i.e only require a did on a ledger
- Assertion format agnostic (i.e you could render them as a JWS or linked data proofs) we will be showing how to use with linked data proofs (i.e JSON-LD)
- More performant due to the underlying crypto used (ECC based rather than RSA)
- Smaller in size also due to the change in crypto primitive used e.g (ECC based rather than RSA)
- Verifiable credential spec compliant

Following this we will be open sourcing a reference implementation along side a specification for the scheme

I went through the Aries RFCs. To the contributors of the DIDComm protocol, was there a strong reason for preferring JSON (and related frameworks) over Protobufs (+gRPC)? 

This question isn't directly related to the Aries project, but rather keen to learn, in the general sense, the reasoning for preferring JSON for a messaging protocol over a fast and compact alternative like Protobuf. 

I've been evaluating the two for a cross-chain communication protocol and looking for a convincing case for why I would need to pick JSON instead of Protobufs+gRPC
</p>
<p><strong>philippede</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 11:18:59 GMT):<br/>
Or are there any ready-to-use Agents that I can use?

<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 13:16:48 GMT):<br/>
This sounds cool. Does the signature scheme allow for all anon cred goodness? I.e selective disclosure, composition of attributes from multiple credentials etc
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 14:28:17 GMT):<br/>
It was a discussion of interoperability over efficiency. The main contender in the discussion was cbor vs json, but the same argument goes for protobufs. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 14:28:30 GMT):<br/>
DIDComm is message based (on purpose), so RPC approaches are not a great fit.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 14:30:44 GMT):<br/>
We didn't forever exclude other formats, but did want to start with a single one and get traction there first.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 14:31:28 GMT):<br/>
I think one argument for JSON over Protobuf in the early stages of discussion was the ability to work with human readable format.

That was certainly one of the 'developer friendliness' points.

I have worked with Protobuf quite a bit and I can say it worked very well to define the Sawtooth messaging protocol, so I personally prefer it over JSON. There are some nuances to keep in mind, like the Any type, inheritance, platform specific behaviors (nulls to empty strings, etc). Other than that, it's a great choice and combines with gRPC can be a great base for a messaging protocol

Thanks @TelegramSam and @tomislav .

@TelegramSam I would have thought a message-oriented protocol can be built quite easily over a general-purpose transport like gRPC, so long as the message semantics have nothing to do with the gRPC procedural semantics, i.e. each message is a self-contained unit that can, in theory, use any transport. 

From my readings of the Aries RFCs I get the impression this was one of the core design principles for the protocol. Decoupling the message from the transport protocol makes a lot of sense. 

I also agree on ease of debugging. Readability without having to rely on deserilaiztion code is a plus.

Hi all, I have a question regarding  Aries MobileAgent Xamarin. What is the proper way to get a credential offer(issuer sends it) and process? There is a method called ListOffersAsync on ICredentialService but seems like it's not what I'm seeking or it does not work as I thought.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 12:33:45 GMT):<br/>
If the issuer sent it, you should see it using `ListOffersAsync`
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 12:34:17 GMT):<br/>
Next step would be to send back request using `CreateRequestAsync`

Hello All, Wanted to understand how the below mentioned scenario can be handled in Aries/Indy ecosystem:

a) Alice gets her Degree Credential from Faber University.
b) Her Degree Credential has a `gpa` attribute and its value issued to Alice is `7`.
c) Alice now applies for job at Acme and Acme sends proof request to validate Alice's Degree Credential.
d) Acme has a strict criteria mentioned in the proof request that `gpa` of the candidate *must be greater or equal* than `7`.
e) Alice fulfills the criteria from her Degree Credential and gets the Job at Acme.
f) After few days, Faber university realizes some issues with the `gpa` of Alice and revokes her previous credential and issues her a new credential with a corrected `gpa`, which now is `6.5`

Now the question is, as Alice has already got her job offer from Acme and also started working there, how Acme can be notified about the revoked/updated credential of Alice's Degree certificate ?
This notification to Acme might be important because as per the new credential, Alice does not meet the required criteria for employment.

Hi everyone. I am taking a look at the: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/README.md  is there some good example of an already built agent on indy/Aries with sample code and demo? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 20:51:50 GMT):<br/>
There are several.  Check out ACA-Py - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python  It's in use in a few places and lots of demos in the /demo folder.  The aries-framework-dotnet is the other mature Indy/Aries agent framework.
</p>
<p><strong>ultimo2020</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 20:54:45 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. Those are cloud demos. Is there maybe a particular example of a local agent wallet demo with basic functionality, like did writes to Sovrin  builder net maybe? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 20:57:48 GMT):<br/>
The ledger being written to/used is just a config for any of the agents.  You just pass in a genesis file to connect to any network.

By wallet, do you mean a mobile agent (which should be the only thing we call a wallet :-) ).  If so, the most advanced is aries-mobileagent-xamarin. It is based on aries-framework-dotnet and can target Android or IOS.

If so,

The short answer is that there is no mechanism for that except for Alice to notify Acme (aka "Do the Right Thing"), and that is OK. Consider the same scenario in the paper world - it's exactly the same (which is what we want).  If Acme can monitor verified credentials without the holders permission, we wind up in a surveillance situation.

- Since Faber has no idea where Alice used her credential, they don't know who to notify.
- Since ACME got a trusted credential, they have no need to assume it is otherwise good.
   - If ACME later discovers the error, they might stop trusting Faber (since they are not authoritative, not trustworthy), but they aren't going to continually ping Alice or Faber to ask "Is that information I received still right?"
- Faber could announce that they had a problem with the issuance of credentials, but that is use case specific.  Might work for a ubiquitous issuer - e.g. the gov't or a credit card company.

For example, proof request with "`issuer_did`" restriction only allow the credential that issued by the party has *did * same as the "issuer_did". Is it right? And what field can be restriction? On the aries-acapy-controllers sample, the `restriction` is `cred_def_id`.

Hi all, I have run into a blocker and been banging my head since. 
REQUIREMENT - I want to run postgres with the aries-dotnet framework
SOLUTION - I figured it can be the same as it is done with python-cloudagent. Basically load the library before calling any wallet functions and indy-sdk will take care of the rest
PROBLEM - I didnt find any dll for indystrgpostgres and decided to build from source. I followed the steps exactly for building libindy for windows and the image build out without any errors but I get "Unhandled exception. System.BadImageFormatException: Bad IL format." when I try to load the library using "AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath". 
REASON - I want to run mediator for large number of users and hence need HA and thus need a better common wallet storage for multiple instances of dotnet mediator containers running

Any solution to the problem will be really helpful

Hi All, wanted to understand the flow of credential verification in a credential registry. I went through the OrgBook and this is my understanding so far:

--An Issuer will issue credentials to a public registry
--This public registry will receive credential and will have a mechanism populate the claims on a public website (using APIs) whenever a user search for it.
--Once the claims are displayed to the user, verification of the claims can also be done from the website.

How does this verification takes place? Which agent sends the proof request and which one validated the credentials? 
And how the verification result is displayed back to the user?

At the moment the public registry (which is an agent) simply sends itself a proof request, then fulfills it with a proof and validates it. It's not a great example of a proof because that's usually between a separate holder/prover and verifier

@zossimov Both OSMA and the Web Agent are open source. I invite you to look through the code and find answers what is supported there. A good starting point would also be to get familiar with Aries and its main protocols, issuance, did exchange, presentation, etc.

In Hyperledger.MobileAgent.Xamarin (Osma), the implementations of an IAgentProvider and IEdgeProvisioningService are found through the magic of IoC and Autofac.  These appear to be from Hyperledger.Aries.Agents.Edge.  See https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin/blob/master/src/Osma.Mobile.App/ViewModels/RegisterViewModel.cs#L19
My C# solution is not using Autofac or ReactiveUi (but currently MvvmCross).  How can an AgentProvider and EdgeProvisioningService be created or found explicitly?

Quick question, where is the appropriate place to discuss proposed RFCs ?  RFC023 introduces the ~service decorator but then doesn't actually use it.  Seems to be a case of not changing this from the superseded RFC0160 to use the decorator technique.

MvvmCross has been largely lacking support for modern patterns. Aries .NET relies on the dependency injection packages using `IServiceCollection` and `IServiceProvider`. Most DI frameworks support these. MvvmCross still rolls their own thing. Having said that, you would have to register all services yourself to work with MvvmX. As someone who has used MvvmX in the past quite a lot, I would advise against it. It's a very opinionated framework that lacks good support. An alternative I can suggest is a framework designed and maintained by the Xamarin team which is very lightweight and open source. In fact, it's a copy/paste kind of solution - you pick the features you want and just add them to your code. https://github.com/xamcat/mobcat-library

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 04 May 2020 13:45:59 GMT):<br/>
Raise an issue on GitHub is best.  There is a major change to DID-Exchange (0023) coming shortly that references the use of the Out of Band Protocol rather than the invitation that is in DID-Exchange. Suggest that you take a look at that - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/454.  I'll check on why that has not been merged as we have mostly got agreement on it.

@sklump could probably answer better.  I would assume making the values an empty string would be fine, null, possibly OK as well.  Do you care between those two?

so before i make an issue on the github, i wanted to ask here in case this is a simple answer and i'm just missing something. Reading through RFC 104 (Chained Credentials) it seems to imply that there exists a way currently for a NON public DID holding entity to issue a credential to a connection. Is that possible with current aries tooling?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 02:50:24 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK - no, there is not a way to do this in the anoncreds 1.0 implementation. I believe that it is in Ursa (not certain), and I'm not sure the effort/path to get it into Indy.

Hi, when I start my Aries Cloudagent it can't connect to my Ledger. It says "Ledger instance not provided". I setup a pool with docker and started the Aries Cloudagent with the following command: 
aca-py start --inbound-transport http 0.0.0.0 8070 --outbound-transport http -e http://<mydomain>/endpoint --admin <myipadress> 8073 --admin-insecure-mode --genesis-file /var/sovrin/temp.txn --debug --log-level DEBUG 
I started the Pool with the IP adress of my domain.
Does somebody know what the problem is? Thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:09:27 GMT):<br/>
All attributes are mandatory. In aca-py, null values come out as `"None"`. An empty string `""` is another possibility. Raw values must encode to some integer, and so attributes must have (string) values to encode.

<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:11:40 GMT):<br/>
but its fine

<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:11:45 GMT):<br/>
it will work for me
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:12:54 GMT):<br/>
All attributes are mandatory in a schema/cred def. Rich schema may provide optional attributes - that spec continues to evolve: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0420-rich-schemas-common
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 23:32:16 GMT):<br/>
I believe this is theoretically possible, but not implemented as @swcurran pointed out. I also think this would run into verification issues if the verifier couldn't resolve the issuing DID. In the case of an n-wise relationship this could be useful though.

When you create it the first time, it gives you back an ID in a form of Guid. You can store this and reference it later. Most of the time, you want a single link secret

Yes but i thought the id was the seed to generate the master secret and anyone that had access to that seed could derive the same master secret. Can you point me to some, more detailed, explanation about the master secret?

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 14:05:42 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately, this doesn't fix the problem. There's a disconnect between `dlopen` and `otool` on Macs. `otool` can report that the library is linked against certain path, but `dlopen` may load it from a different location. This is what is currently happening, specifically with `libsodium` dependency. The packages are built against `libsodium.18.dylib`, but most of us have `libsodium.23.dylib` that is also installed with the Mac build script. One workaround I found is to copy the libsodium.23.dylib file directly in the same folder as the runtime application, but this adds a lot of friction. For the time being, I've moved to developing under Windows because of this specific issue. @Alexi I'm curious if you have a found a solution to this.

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 14:11:29 GMT):<br/>
Currently, if you copy the lobsodium lib in your `bin/netcoreapp3.1/` folder where the compiled app is located, it should work.

When i read the standard seems like "123456789" should be encoded as string but in the tests done in the raised issue (and in ACA-Py) it is encoded as integer

Although now I see that the tests use the term `raw` where the input is not always truly an indy raw value. Indy raw values are stringified input. Sorry about that.

Bools are 32-bit ints and so str(int()) turns them into "0", "1".
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:18:23 GMT):<br/>
However the string "True" is not a 32-bit int and so the process hashes it as-is.

<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:19:21 GMT):<br/>
Yes, in JS i'm doing a workaround to get the same result. But is "True" and True have the same raw values and different encodes wouldn't that be be?

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:20:05 GMT):<br/>
The purpose of encoding is to produce a numeric string for indy so that the Camenisch-Lyasanskaya algorithm can operate on it. It would use numbers but I don't think the underlying languages can handle numbers that big.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:23:07 GMT):<br/>
`"True"` and `True` do not carry the same raw values. `"True"` carries a raw value of `"True"`, and `True` carries a raw value of `"1"`, into indy-sdk.
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:24:58 GMT):<br/>
So i should put "1" or "0" in the raw value when encoding booleans for the credential?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:26:18 GMT):<br/>
This might be the sample of what you are seeking: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/2e874b905d8626151ec61c02c9a7b687174c8849/aries_cloudagent/issuer/indy.py#L200
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:27:35 GMT):<br/>
The raw value is the stringified input value. The encoded value is the encoded input value.
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:32:43 GMT):<br/>
I was following ACA-Py to implement the encoding in JS. But in python str(True) is equal to str("True"), which would collide with what i was saying above.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:38:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but in python bools count as 32-bit ints: the encode() function takes bools and turns them into "0", "1".
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:39:19 GMT):<br/>
What indy calls a raw value is not the original input but necessarily a string.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:40:03 GMT):<br/>
So (raw, encoded) = ("True", "1").
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:42:17 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but (raw encoded) = ("True", "27471875274925838976481193902417661171675582237244292940724984695988062543640") as well if the original value is the string "True". So there would be two encoded values for the same raw value. My question was if that was a problem or not.
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:42:32 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:45:15 GMT):<br/>
Oh, the function is not invertible. "None" also ends up with the same encoding as null. There are other such cases (e.g., float 0.0 and string "0.0").
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 10:46:10 GMT):<br/>
It's OK because the (raw, encoded) pair are inseparable: display the raw, work on the encoded, and check for bait-and-switch on proof verification.

That's a ledger timeout error code. Your runtime can't access the ledger you're using. Could be for few reasons. If you're running a ledger in another container, perhaps the port aren't open.

I think the issue might be connection to the mediator agent from your device/emulator. You can use ngrok to make a public ip like it is mentioned in the documentation (and the video ) in the repository. (You devices localhost is different from the localhost:5000 that the mediator is running on). But please confirm it by debug.
</p>
<p><strong>shonjs</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 12:50:56 GMT):<br/>
If you are using android emulator with Vstudio, there is a constant IP address that you can use that will route it to the machine localhost, but using ngrok is better to keep things consistent across.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:35:11 GMT):<br/>
On Communicating with Mobile Agents with websockets (Thread)
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:35:52 GMT):<br/>
I believe that using a websocket for mobile agent communication is an excellent idea. In fact, the toolbox is written to use websockets as a transport when supported.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:36:10 GMT):<br/>
There big question is, who hosts the other end of the websocket?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:37:17 GMT):<br/>
And related: That other end needs to queue messages when the mobile agent is disconnected.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:37:36 GMT):<br/>
One answer is a cloud agent: Your mobile agent connects to this cloud agent, who performs the routing functions for messages bound for the mobile agent.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:38:11 GMT):<br/>
Another more limited form is the use of a mediator: an agent that will receive messages on your behalf (but cannot decrypt them), and sends them to you when you connect.

The third, more generalized but less ideal form, is that any agent could support that sort of queue.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:39:54 GMT):<br/>
My general vote is the mediator approach. A mobile app has a direct connection (the last option I mentioned) with a mediator, and the mediator queues messages for retrieval (likely over a websocket connection).
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:40:31 GMT):<br/>
Other agents are given that mediator as an endpoint: they don't need to know how the message gets to the mobile app.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:41:25 GMT):<br/>
Use of the mediator also provides some herd privacy. If many people use the same mediator, the party on the other side cannot use the serviceEndpoint or mediator to correlate me.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:41:58 GMT):<br/>
that does require that a mobile app has a mediator. This could be provided by the mobile app vendor, but may also be selected in a different way.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 20:42:39 GMT):<br/>
I believe we can make this process smooth for the user, to the point where the technical details are hidden and managed for them in a privacy respecting way.

<p><strong>RSeitzberg</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 21:15:41 GMT):<br/>
I am not the most technical person and this may be slightly off subject, but I had an idea that I think might be useful for this conversation about agents.  Protonmail is opensource so I realized that you could use the same code base/technologies to make a cloud credential wallet instead of a cloud inbox.  their mobile agent is open source as well so if you didn't want to completely re-invent the wheel you could create a cloud credentil wallet agent and mobile agent designed the same way as protonmail and you could piggyback off there technology and benefit from their community security updates.  Does that sound like a good way of doing it?

I don't think the options need to cancel each other out. Option 1 is a good option if you're willing to host your own agent. Option 2 I think is the best for a lot of people as they don't want to set up any infrastructure of their own. Option 3 is less desired in my opinion as picking up messages becomes increasingly more tedious as the number of connections grow.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 21 May 2020 09:19:19 GMT):<br/>
In aries-framework-javascript we are also aiming at the second approach. Maybe we could formalize how a websocket connection is created as just opening a websocket is not enough. Without the party that opened the connection sending a message to the mediator, the mediator has no way to identify who opened the websocket connection. In my propsal for framework-javascript (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/issues/40) I proposed to use the `noop` message from the pickup protocol with a `~transport` decorator for return routing. This indicates to the mediator that it can be used to send messages, authenticates the party that openend the connection, and also allows to determine which messages (from the sending did) should be send over the connection.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 21 May 2020 09:20:06 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam If we can agree on an approach I would be happy to add this to one of the RFCs.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 21 May 2020 20:30:40 GMT):<br/>
Agree on not necessarily one or the other. Option 3 is usually best employed between the mobile app and the mediator. Other connections use option 2, enabled by option 3.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 21 May 2020 20:31:59 GMT):<br/>
If this isn't already in an RFC, I'd love it to be. Note that this mechanism is not required in the strictest sense: it is optional if the mobile app and mediator are provided as a bundle by a vendor.

I would like to know how attachments work (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/64e5e55c123b2efaf38f4b0911a71a1c40a7f29d/concepts/0017-attachments) in each of the frameworks for aries (python, go, dotnet).  

I'm particularly interested in knowing what happens with images attached to credential.   

Who is best contacts for each of these frameworks to answer my question?
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 14:55:37 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 15:12:10 GMT):<br/>
@sklump has done a bunch of work with images in credentials using ACA-Py.  A lot of work was put in to make sure that such values could be encoded.

Note that ~attachments RFC has nothing to do with putting an image in a credential though. A claim in a credential is an encoded value and it's raw representation.  To represent an image, the raw representation will be a string-encoded image (so you would likely use base64 encoding) and as just a string, the encoded value is the same as for any string.

The ~attachment decorator is available to attach "documents" (however those are defined) into Aries messages.  Examples of how those can be used can be seen in the issue credential RFCs (there are now 2 - v1 and v2), but not related to values within credentials.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 15:29:07 GMT):<br/>
An image is an attribute like any other, it needs a non-null `mime_type` (e.g., `image/png`)and hence the encoding is base64.

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 18:30:42 GMT):<br/>
Adding image attachments to any message, even existing credential exchange should work fine. They will just be ignored by the runtime. You can attach images as data or links, both are supported in the attachment decorator rfc

<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 18:46:30 GMT):<br/>
The reason I'm asking is our experience we could not save credentials with images into the wallet using indy sdk.  Our solution was the credential contained a hash of the image and we retrieved/stored the image separately.   It sounds like we will have this same problem using Aries agents .

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 19:14:41 GMT):<br/>
mmm .. I think @swcurran is saying that it is possible to store an image as a claim in a credential. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 19:16:54 GMT):<br/>
The RFC does not change anything.  If you tried to store the binary representation of the image, that would not work.  If you encoded the image as base64, that will definitely work.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 19:23:42 GMT):<br/>
If that was the issue, agree that the hash+link (or hashlink) method is a good approach from an integrity perspective.  The challenge is where to put the image such that privacy is preserved for use cases that require that.  In those cases, simply knowing the hash should not be enough to access the image.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 19:59:27 GMT):<br/>
Hash + attachment :) not that the issue- credential protocol supports it
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 20:00:47 GMT):<br/>
If you have the "attachment" in a claim, then you wouldn't need the hash.

We just went in a circle.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 20:01:50 GMT):<br/>
Ah, you mean attachment as an external reference I'm guessing.  But that wouldn't solve the access authentication, would it?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 20:01:59 GMT):<br/>
The claim is the hash. The attachment decorator holds or links to the data
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 20:05:24 GMT):<br/>
So sent outside of the credential. Ah, got you.  That's an interesting idea.  So the holder has it and shares it as raw data attached to the proof (so it's not proven), but the hash in the proof is sufficient to proof the image was issued by the issuer.

Cool idea.  There should be an RFC for that :-).

We could extend the v2 issue and include it in the "soon-to-be-written" v2 present proof RFC.

That would add a new requirment to the storage.

From the tutorial in edx:
"The issuer will monitor the revocations through the period, track the IDs of the credentials to be revoked, calculate an update to the accumulator to revoke those credentials and write the new accumulator value to the ledger"

Why does the issuer need to monitor? It's not better to create credentials with expired dates, and it's up to the verifier to decide if to accept the credentials? Like any ID paper or license card?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 25 May 2020 22:44:43 GMT):<br/>
There is a difference between expiring a credential and revoking it and both can and should be used.  As you note, an expiration can happen on a time schedule. However, what if something changes with the claims data on the credential before it expires?  An example is a person moving to a new address.  With paper, we get a sticker to go on our license with the new address (at least that's what happens in BC). With verifiable credentials we can revoke the credential with the old address and issue a new one.  Revocation can also be used for when Bad Things happen, such as when a driver permit to drive is revoked because of a bad driving record.  Another example is when a permit for something (for example, a building permit) is issued to a company, and later that company is dissolved. It would be good to be able to revoke the credential so that the permit cannot continue to be used.

Thanks for your response.
If I understand, it makes sense, only when you have another primary central system that saves all data of the issuer, for example, database with all address of holders, so when the holder updated his address in this system you need update credential of the holder, but if the data own only by the holder when the holder changes his address he needs to come back to issuer to update in his credential with his new address. 
So in this case, it's up to the issuer to make an investigation to find fraud (to save his reputation in front of verifier)?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 26 May 2020 17:12:50 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but the issuer should be the authority for the information it issues, and if necessary, have a mechanism for retaining the accuracy of the data it issues.  Usually, that does mean keeping information on matters of which they are the authority (e.g. a school issuing a degree, a Medical Authority tracking Doctors, etc.). 

The only case I can think of an issuer issuing data for which the holder is the authority would be that of a notary that is given some data, verifies it and then issues it back to the holder.  In that case, they would not likely need to track the data or revoke it in the future.  Their "authority is saying, "based on what I knew at the time, this information was accurate".
</p>
<p><strong>Moshe7</strong> (Tue, 26 May 2020 18:47:44 GMT):<br/>
Your explanation was what I was looking for, the difference between notary and authority make it clear,  thank you.

Posting this notice on the Aries channel because the issue is relevant to Agent/Agent Framework Builders:

This week's Indy Contributors call will mostly be about how we can enable dynamic access to multiple Indy ledgers --- allowing an agent (for example, a Mobile Wallet app) to access multiple Indy ledgers in a single session with minimal effort from the agent owner. An example for those that have used the Streetcred and esatus wallets: using both Sovrin Staging and Sovrin Mainnet without having to switch the settings over and over. We'll also cover the latest progress on Revocation 2.0 work.

The call is Monday, June 1 at 8AM US Pacific, dial-in information: https://zoom.us/j/244779296 Agenda can be found here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy/2020-06-01+Indy+Contributors+Call

Hi all. I'm trying to write an custom controller for aca-py and was wondering how to do self-asserted claims. I was thinking about creating a connection with myself and then issue a credential to myself, for which I then can send proofs to other agents. But this all requires that I publish a schema and CredDef on the ledger for each agent that wants to do that. Is that a good approach or is there a simpler way to do this?

There's an example of a self attested attribute in the Alice/Faber demo, Faber asks for the attribute here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/runners/faber.py#L298
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:03:56 GMT):<br/>
Alice provides it here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/runners/alice.py#L144
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:04:46 GMT):<br/>
There's no credential involved, basically in the proof request you just ask for something with no restrictions and then the prover can provide whatever value they want
</p>
<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:20:18 GMT):<br/>
Thank you. I've already seen that in the code but wondered how that would work.
</p>
<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:20:27 GMT):<br/>
So basically I can just provide additional attributes in the proof than defined in the schema and the verifier can then handle that however he wants?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:20:50 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:20:55 GMT):<br/>
Is there a way to store such data in the wallet? Let say Alice has some claims she wants to make about herself and include that in future proofs. Or is that something that has to be stored in the controller application?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:21:45 GMT):<br/>
For that you need to self-issue yourself a credential, as you originally described.  Including registering a schema and cred def on the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:22:30 GMT):<br/>
The controller can deal with this separately, i.e. keep profile data that it uses to fill in proofs where there are no claims available
</p>
<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:22:57 GMT):<br/>
ok, so that approach wasn't that bad then? Also considering when I want to be able to revoke stuff, I basically have to go the credential way if I understand it correctly
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:23:20 GMT):<br/>
For self-issued credentials, the verifier would have to accept these, and would have to include the appropriate restriction for these claims in their proof request
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:23:48 GMT):<br/>
yes to revoke credentials you need to use the indy revocation
</p>
<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:28:32 GMT):<br/>
ok. now just one more thing: when I want to revoke a credential, I have to provide a cred_rev_id. when I issue a credential I get that information from the agent, but as far I've seen, that isn't stored in the agent itself. So if I want to handle such cases, I have to store all relevant credential information used for revocation in the controller in order to be abel to revoke that in the future. is that correct? or can I find information about issued credentials somewhere in the agent?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 16:29:05 GMT):<br/>

Just a reminder about the Identity Implementer's WG Call tomorrow morning (June 4th @ 9am MT). This is a chance to get updates on the WG calls you may have missed this week.

Our guest presenter will be Matt Norton from Streetcred.  Matt will be presenting on some of their new health-related credential work.  

Here are links to the Wiki and the Zoom meeting.

I was playing around with the Streetcred Swagger API because we needed to find a way to retrieve issued credentials in order to be able to revoke them at a later date (for any user using our service).

If I do a GET /credentials I get all the credentials issued and offered across multiple connections going back several days.

I assume these are stored in the Issuer agent's wallet. But this surprised me as I thought that only the holder stored credentials in their agent wallet.

Am I misunderstanding something here?

Hi. I'm getting a stack overflow error whenever making any Pool calls using the aries framework. What could cause stack overflow errors. For reference, it happens for the aspnetcore sample but not in the edgeconsoleclient app, The Pool call is Pool.OpenPoolLedgerAsync. What am I missing?

Hi all,
I got very interested recently into the self-sovereign identity concept and find it fascinating, so I stumbled upon the Hyperledger Aries project. So if you don’t mind, I have a couple of questions and would be very grateful for some help.
I would like to run my own Aries network so I can play with it and learn, but only managed to find instructions for Hyperledger Indy and I’m not grasping what the exact difference is. I managed to run the VON test network locally and probably could run it on dedicated servers, as a more realistic scenario, but don’t know where to start. Is there any „tutorial“ or manual that could you recommend? I bought a couple of books and „Introduction to Hyperledger Sovereign Identity Blockchain Solutions: Indy, Aries & Ursa“ course on EdX. So far I enjoy the theory, but I would also like to get my hands dirty and play with a live system.
What is the current status of Aries SDK for Java? I’m senior Java developer and naturally feel most comfortable coding in Java, but if you suggest some other language for start, that’s fine too
How would you suggest me to contribute to the community? As I mentioned, I really find the self-sovereign identities fascinating and would like to contribute.

Thanks in advance!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 04 Jun 2020 18:28:04 GMT):<br/>
Hi.  Have you looked at the second edX course?  That is the one for devs to run things: https://www.edx.org/course/becoming-a-hyperledger-aries-developer

Java process has been slow - some, but not enough interest.  ACA-Py (Python), aries-framework-dotnet and aries-framework-go are the most mature ones right now. 

Once you have a better idea of what project you would like to build with, we can help with some early tasks to get started.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 04 Jun 2020 18:28:28 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Thu, 04 Jun 2020 23:10:30 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I’m unsure where exactly to post this question

The VC standard specifies an issuance date on each credential. 
When building a presentation, is there anyway to include that date (which is *not* a credential value) as part of the proof?

The workaround seems to be issuance_date to be duplicated as a credential value and then non standardized in it’s presentation (unix timestamp, month/date field/etc as up to the issuer) which would cause problems.
</p>
<p><strong>jakubkoci</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:43:10 GMT):<br/>
Hi. Is there any protocol spec how end-user app can get and show logo/avatar of the connection? Maybe something like `logoUrl` in connection invitation or `logo` link to attachement of connection invitation?
</p>
<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 10:46:03 GMT):<br/>
When I try to issue a credential to myself, the aca-py agents gets somehow stuck. I get the `credential_received` message in `handle_issue_credential`, but after that no `ack` is sent back. All future calls to the agents (for example calling `/credentials` to get all stored credentials) don't return anymore and the requests run into timeouts. When I issue the same credential to another agent, all works flawless (so the credential itself should be fine I guess). Is there anything I need to do/extend in the demo-implementations of the acapy-agent so that self-issued credentials can be accepted?
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 13:01:57 GMT):<br/>
Happy Friday everyone. I have been hacking on a project recently to integrate aries capabilities into the OM (https://openmined.org/) stack. This is off the back of a paper we recently got accepted for publication - https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02456. If anyone is interested in learning more or contributing just give us a shout!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 14:34:29 GMT):<br/>
Best to ask on the #aries-cloudagent-python channel.  Did you use the /store_credential endpoint?  I'm thinking it might be that.  Depends also on start up parameters used.

<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 15:39:09 GMT):<br/>
The Verifiable Presentation contains an array of included VCs, so each VC would already include its issuanceDate.
Are you asking specifically how this would work for a ZKP presentation?
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 16:02:26 GMT):<br/>
when doing a normal (non ZKP) presentation, the only information that shows up about VCs are:

schema_id, cred_def_id, rev_reg_id, and timestamp 

It would make sense for timestamp to show up as the issuance date, but it only shows up as null so i'm unsure what timestamp refers to in the encoded VC in the presentation

<p><strong>ntonani</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 17:02:27 GMT):<br/>
As Aries is a toolkit for developing cred solutions, I'm wondering how many people are using only some tools rather than diving into the ecosystem head first. I would like to us it as a pluggable digital wallet, with potential for expanding to other uses, namely vc. l Would love to hear if others have done this.
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 17:03:17 GMT):<br/>
aries framework go implements only Aries and not the indy stack (yet)
</p>
<p><strong>ntonani</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 17:04:40 GMT):<br/>
sorry could you expand. do you mean it does not take a dependency on Indy (it is pluggable), or that the wallet isn't yet stripped? also thanks for quick response.
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 17:05:32 GMT):<br/>
it does not have a dependency on indy. it just manages connections and interchanges DIDCOM messages as far as i know
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ntonani</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 17:15:35 GMT):<br/>
right, i have glanced at this. some unknowns for me. 1) unclear if storage also includes credential storage (I.e. json-ld payload) storage or just kms. I see json-ld vc support but nothing around storage 2) unclear viability of go sdk on mobile platform. I see a js sdk but seems to be an Indy wrapper atm.
</p>
<p><strong>spacemandev</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 17:33:33 GMT):<br/>
Looking into it it seems like the timestamp field has to do with time of non revocation, so it still doesn't solve the problem of giving us issuance date from the VC
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 18:54:03 GMT):<br/>
correct - aries-framework-go does not have dependencies on indy. This framework is capable of managing DIDComm messages and has support libraries for features needed by agents/wallets such as Verifiable Credentials, JSON-LD signatures, DIDs, DID Resolution, KMS, Basic storage, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 18:55:14 GMT):<br/>
The Go framework currently has three methods of usage: as Go packages to be built into a Go application; as a daemon controlled by a REST API; as a WASM controlled by a JavaScript API.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 18:55:49 GMT):<br/>
Note: the WASM is runnable in browsers.
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 19:27:36 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, I'm not understanding. Are you talking about using indy-style credentials in a W3C verifiable presentation?

i was hoping that indy-style credentials matched up with the W3C spec, but it seems that is not the case
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 20:21:35 GMT):<br/>
they don't yet. Work is proceeding that direction, much of which is documented in the Indy HIPEs and Aries RFCs about Rich Schemas.

<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Sun, 07 Jun 2020 06:00:36 GMT):<br/>
I understand that revocation notifications are not yet implemented in Aries. Is this correct? If so are there plans to implement this in the near future? Thanks.

I understand that revocation notifications are not yet implemented in Aries. By revocation notification I mean holders being notified that a credential was revoked. Is this correct? If so are there plans to implement this in the near future? Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 07 Jun 2020 14:21:19 GMT):<br/>
This has been discussed in the context of issuing a credential - e.g. adding a flag/note to the Offer and/or Issue messages to inform the holder that the issue was triggered by a revocation.  But that's not done yet.  

There is a proposed RFC 0183 Revocation Notification that you should look at, as it likely does what you want.  I suggest checking that, evolving it and then promoting it's use in the community.  With revocation support new in the community, we just haven't gotten there yet. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0183-revocation-notification

Hi, I am learning about Aries, in the guide it says that Aries is using the Ursa project for Crypto Library, I was looking for a project that uses Ursa and did not find, is there an Aries project that uses Ursa?  Or Ursa not mature enough to use?
</p>
<p><strong>MikeRichardson</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 05:30:20 GMT):<br/>
Thank you stephen. I would be happy to get involved in implementing this in conjunciton with others if there is sufficient interest. In the meantime, I suppose the issuer could just send a message to the holder notifiying them of revocation of credentials.

Wondering if anyone here knows the cross-over between W3C CCG and Aries community? I'd love to know more about the Universal Wallet spec through the lens of Aries - https://transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/. Does Aries not already provide "A portable, extensible, JSON-LD wallet supporting digital currencies and credentials."?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:28:21 GMT):<br/>
Haven't seen that spec, I'll have to go over it. I think the Go framework has a wallet/KMS for JSON-LD credentials, not aware of anybody focusing on currencies
</p>
<p><strong>ntonani</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:30:37 GMT):<br/>
Ya I suspected that was the difference. Doesn't seem outside Aries scope though.
</p>
<p><strong>ntonani</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:32:31 GMT):<br/>
Curious if there are technical limitations within Aries that'd force transmute to have written a wallet implementation themselves. Perhaps just lack of coordination.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:37:09 GMT):<br/>
There hasn't been as much focus on JSON-LD credentials yet, that's still building. Most implementers have been using Indy credentials which are not currently compatible
</p>
<p><strong>ntonani</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:45:32 GMT):<br/>
Right. I've seen JSON-LD activity in Go repo recently but could have been a timing thing. Easier said than done to extend an existing solution.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:51:38 GMT):<br/>
The Go framework doesn't depend on Indy, it only uses signed JSON-LD credentials
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 17:00:00 GMT):<br/>
We're also actively working on supporting JSON-LD credentials in ACA-py and aries-vcr (the credential registry), especially with BBS+ signatures, and looking for good ways to store and index them

Hi all - what is the status of the Postgres storage plugin with regards to the various language-specific wrappers? I'm specifically trying to get the dotnet library (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet) to use anything other than the default local disk storage.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Wed, 10 Jun 2020 15:10:48 GMT):<br/>
@andrew_delta you don't need wrappers for postgres storage plugin. Postgres wallet plugin exposes API which is consumed only internally by IndySDK. You have to compile the rust code into library, load up that postgresql binary in your code and when creating/opening wallet, you need to express that you want to use postgresql storage instead. You would express that information in these parameters:
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/src/api/wallet.rs#L226
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/src/api/wallet.rs#L229
Example of these parameters for postgres wallet is here (NodeJS wrapper for LibVCX, under the hood these parameters are passed to create/open wallet IndySDK APIs)
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/vcx/wrappers/node/demo/faber.js#L48

There are some conflicts between acapy master and the toolbox, as some work is needed to align with a recent refactor. That should be done in the next week. If you are in a hurry, there is a specific commit that the toolbox works currently with.

@ntonani @victor.martinez @andrew.whitehead Tomorrow on Morning Aries Call we would have Orie to talk about this initiative so feel free to join our discussion and bring some questions.

I am currently implementing https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0212-pickup in Aries  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/pull/1926 and was hoping I could get some back story on the use case for the Message Query and Message List Response.

As I look it these are protocol level messages and wouldn't ever have a "user interface" in place to select individual or multiple, message ids. Once the status request is made and the batch satisfied my thought was that would be the end of the interaction, the edge never really have "insight" into it messages waiting at the agent.

Can I limit use time of credential verfication? I want a credential only can be used 1 times  without reveal unique information?
</p>
<p><strong>m00sey</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 03:51:00 GMT):<br/>
@phuctu1901 are you referring to something like the prescription model 

`For example, in some prescription drug monitoring programs, usage monitoring is a requirement. Enforcement entities need to be able to confirm that individuals are not cheating the system to get multiple prescriptions for controlled substances. This statutory or regulatory need to correlate usage overrides individual privacy concerns.`

The one-time-use situation also occurs in an election, although you might allow multiple votes from the same identifier and only accept the latest one. E-currency transactions are another example. In both cases you generally need to coordinate with a central source like a blockchain/ledger, or the credential issuer

I am trying with https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc and the DJango Demo application https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/tree/master/demo.  I am able to run it till the Presentation verification at vc-authn-oidc side. At the DJango application playing the role of RP, it is getting redirected to OIDC_RP_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE_REDIRECT_URI. In the mobile I get the notification that Proof is verified successfully, also in the  vc-authn-oidc, I see no errors. Problems seems to at be DJango app side only. Any one faced similar issue ? Looking at the code of oidc-rp python package, it seems it is looking for bearer token. Any pointers what might be going wrong here ?

I would like to have a go at firing up Faber and Alice using the Sovrin Staging Net; I have registered a payment address, set up DIDs and wallets etc using indy-cli but I can't find any documentation on using the network.

Hello everyone, short question regarding DIDComm.

Regarding an exchange request, the RFC says "The Request message is encoded according to the standards of the Encryption Envelope, using the recipientKeys present in the invitation"
(https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0023-did-exchange#request-transmission)
However, looking up the code in the indy aries .net framework, only creating and processing of exchange responses involve packing and unpacking.
(https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/master/src/Hyperledger.Aries/Features/DidExchange/DefaultConnectionService.cs#L181)

I am a bit confused here. Should one always expect requests to be encrypted?
</p>
<p><strong>Philser 1</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 14:11:19 GMT):<br/>
Especially in the case of implicit invitations
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 15:26:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes -- all messages except the Out of Band (RFC 434) invitation message are encrypted.  That message is not because there is not been a key exchange.  A response to an implicit invitation (an unsolicited message sent based on a public DID) is encrypted using the information associated with the DID.

Hi guys, I have a big issue! Let me explain. 
I have two agents (Issuer, Holder). I created a credential scheme that contained some data, and I defined it so that my agent could receive and make proposals for credentials, so far so good. I decided to do a issuer credential offer test for the holder, using a json data different from the credential definition structure. And as incredible as it seems this one made an offer! I believe that it is not validating if the attribute data contains in the definition of the credential, I can access both the holder and the issuer the generated credential with a definition that does not match the data, the only thing I realized is that it cannot be issued / generated .
I think this is a very important point of discussion
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 20:15:11 GMT):<br/>
You're right, it's a bug. I'll get on it tomorrow.
</p>
<p><strong>Lucasemori</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 20:17:49 GMT):<br/>
Great, thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 20:18:36 GMT):<br/>
Correction: it returns, but on the issuer side I get a stack trace that ends in
```
aries_cloudagent.issuer.base.IssuerError: Provided credential values are missing a value for the schema attribute 'score'
```
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 20:19:47 GMT):<br/>
with the credential exchange record in state "request_received". So it creates a hopeless offer, sends it to the holder, who makes a hopeless request.

It should validate before making the offer.
</p>

However, if requests based on implicit invitations are to be encrypted with the key in the DID document, in which case is there ever going to be a request for which there has not been a key exchange and thus the request message is unencrypted?
</p>
<p><strong>gpaliwal</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 08:36:56 GMT):<br/>
no worries, do we have any similar sample/reference implementation for the RP using reactjs or angular instead of DJango ?

Hi all, I want to know are there any API for Aries to define schemas / credentials, create connection e.t.c. If not, any possibility that we can write APIs for that?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:28:10 GMT):<br/>
There are none in Aries.  That said, the Aries frameworks that support Indy expose methods/APIs for those purposes -- ACA-Py and aries-framework-dotnet.
</p>
<p><strong>x0axz</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:29:01 GMT):<br/>
you mean ACA-Py and aries-framework-dotnet work like APIs?
</p>
<p><strong>x0axz</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:31:49 GMT):<br/>
I mean, if i want to write api in any language, and by accessing a specific route, one can define schema/credential or can get a url to connect with agent. any possibility?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:24:53 GMT):<br/>
ACA-Py yes. It exposes an HTTP interface and fires HTTP events to the controller (business logic).  aries-framework-dotnet is a library embedded in an application.
</p>
<p><strong>RinkalBhojani</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:30:34 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:28:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes they can.

</p>
<p><strong>esune</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 16:45:54 GMT):<br/>
We do not have a React or Angular implementation, but we have a VueJS implementation so it may help as it is still a browser-initiated authentication flow.

A sample configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/esune/essential-services-delivery/blob/master/openshift/templates/issuer-web/config/esr1/dev/config.json#L9-L21).

The code used by the service is the `issuer-web` component in https://github.com/bcgov/issuer-kit
</p>
<p><strong>esune</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 16:50:14 GMT):<br/>
Please be aware that there is additional configuration that needs to be set in `vc-authn-oidc` for the browser flow to work (e.g.: redirect URIs must be configured). Some of the changes in the latest code were implemented to ensure the proper headers were being applied to responses.

For a reference of what needs to be set you can search the [IdentityServer4 docs](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Hi, when i was trying to use the tag features from the wallet records i got a problem. If i create a record with only one tag i can query it using that same tag with the wallet search. However, if i create a record with, for example, 4 tags and query it using only one of these tags, the wallet search isn't able to find the record. Is that normal or am i doing something wrong? If i create a record with 2 tags and use those 2 tags to search it is able to find the record as well.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 19:39:10 GMT):<br/>
Uggh...sorry about that.  We need to remove/fix the tag feature.  What you saw is unfortunately the way it works.  There are indeed two tags per claim.  One is to be able to see the claim at all (name) and the other is to be able to search the value (value).  The tag feature removes both, but then you can't see the claim at all when using WQL.  Our use case is that we never have to search for it, and hoped the tag feature would reduce storage, but not being able to see the claim at all is too restrictive.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 19:39:53 GMT):<br/>
I'll put in an issue to get that cleaned up.  What was your use case?  Is it worth trying to keep the name and remove the value to save space?
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 19:45:23 GMT):<br/>
My use case is when creating a record for the revocation registry. I want to be able to query by three distinct ways: revocation registry ID or credential definition ID or state of the revocation registry.
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 19:45:51 GMT):<br/>
I didn't felt this need in any other records.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 19:52:11 GMT):<br/>
Ah -- I'm probably talking about a different tagging feature.  The one I mean is one that allows you to tune what tags are auto-created.  I think you are trying to just add extra tags to a credential.  I'm not sure about that.  Sorry for the confusion.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 21:15:47 GMT):<br/>
I guess i found the problem. I was using one of the tags with a boolean type. From the tests i did, i guess all tags must be strings. Even if i don't use the boolean tag in the search, the fact that i added her when creating the record makes the search not find the record.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 21:24:44 GMT):<br/>
That's odd, maybe it's silently failing and not adding any tags

In the "Preparing to Issue a Credential" section of the Aries Open API Demo, there is a comment about another tutorial being needed to walk through the steps using the Swagger Interface to create a DID etc.  Did this ever get done as I seem to keep getting a 403 response whenever trying to use the ledger related endpoints with a localhost VON network, even just trying to get an existing DID is returning 403.  It feels like I am missing something obvious but can't put my finger on it.  Here is my aca-py startup command : 

PORTS="8000:8000 8001:8001" ./scripts/run_docker start --inbound-transport http 0.0.0.0 8000 \
--outbound-transport http \
--admin 0.0.0.0 8001 \
--admin-insecure-mode \
--log-level 'debug' \
--endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
--genesis-url http://192.168.65.3:9000/genesis \
--seed SecretKey00000000000000000000000
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 22:23:47 GMT):<br/>
I think it needs an indy wallet configured, `--wallet-type indy`
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 22:31:43 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Andrew,  I looked at the Faber code but couldn't click to what I wasn't doing that it was.
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 22:33:54 GMT):<br/>
At the very least that is now letting me get the taa so that was at least my initial issue
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 01:55:38 GMT):<br/>
Another crazy question,  am I correct in assuming that ACA-py has no way of updating a DID through the Admin interface ?  I can create a DID with register-nym but there is no ability to specify an endpoint in that interface and no other ledger api that can update it as far as I can see ?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 02:08:29 GMT):<br/>
That's probably true, at the moment it expects you to pass in the endpoint for the public DID when it starts up, and it publishes that one if it has changed. It should probably store the endpoint as metadata on the DID record
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 02:10:56 GMT):<br/>
I noticed it will happily update the existing public DID endpoint if it has changed, on startup.  So it has the capability.  I wonder though if a more generic solution would be to allow the metadata on the /ledger/register-nym and an update method as well since it has a get method for /ledger/did-endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 02:11:42 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for clarifying
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 02:12:00 GMT):<br/>
Would be good to add some functionality for that 
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 02:19:44 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>gpaliwal</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 13:16:41 GMT):<br/>
I think, I figured out what the problem is. I have setup the DJango project on the ubuntu machine and accessing the app using the machine IP. In the later stage of the overall flow when the URL http://XXXX//oidc/auth/cb/?code=YYYY tried to redirect it to the redirect URL, it is not able to setup the response headers. At this stage I don't see any errors in the DJango logs or in the vc-oidc logs.
</p>
<p><strong>gpaliwal</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 13:17:44 GMT):<br/>
I did one minor change in this setup, using the ngrok to access this application, and then everything works fine, I can see response headers are getting populated correctly
</p>
<p><strong>gpaliwal</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 13:18:26 GMT):<br/>
does it have any thing to do with django-oidc-rp configurations
</p>
<p><strong>gpaliwal</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 13:19:14 GMT):<br/>
I have ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"] in the DJnago settings
</p>
<p><strong>esune</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 16:13:51 GMT):<br/>
It's honestly hard to say without having the same setup to look at. It is likely some endpoint naming mismatch when using the machine IP address rather than the pre-defined docker networking and the service ports exposed on localhost by docker-compose

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:18:51 GMT):<br/>
There is no reason not to set the cred def id per attribute or predicate: the holder has the credentials with which to create proof, so there is no use in being coy.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:20:07 GMT):<br/>
If the cred def id is not set, it means to propose a self-attested attribute
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:20:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:20:27 GMT):<br/>
I agree. However, not including the cred_def_id will imply to the verifier that it is a self-attested attribute. I think there could be a more clear way of specifying this, but it's at least concise

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:21:34 GMT):<br/>
Au contraire, it is less concise: it has extraneous info that is not the cred def id and implies self-assertion, hence with no need of schema id, issuer id, et al surely?

I'm confused - are you critiquing the spec or my implementation of it?

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:28:35 GMT):<br/>
As far as predicate referents go, there is no indy-sdk equivalent to the functionality in predicate referent specifications within proof-requests: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/python/indy/anoncreds.py#L1151 contrast https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/f5aca7b5699a7366b74cefa23bc4ab4d6b29dcdc/wrappers/python/indy/anoncreds.py#L1164 i.e., "names"

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:31:11 GMT):<br/>
Two distinct items:
* what good does specifying schema-id, issuer-id, or any other restriction content on a self-attested attribute?
* the (optional) referent for a preview attribute ties back to indy-sdk functionality that is not present in predicate logic - so it can only present a distinction without a differenct

I wasn't following the discussion when this proposal was created, so I'm wondering. Why not just allow the proposer to use the same proof request object, while the other party just fills in the nonce and verifies if they're ok with it? The proposal message would then use standard attachment decorator to remove the indy-isms from the spec.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 20:08:34 GMT):<br/>
Holder - prepares proof request per indy structure allowing to propose any combination of restrictions or non-revocations
- sends that as attachment with mime type over Aries
Verifier - unpacks, fills in challenge, sends back message.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 21:54:35 GMT):<br/>
If you look at the PR for the v2.0 format, that's the approach taken. At least the use of the attachment.  I'm not solid on the exact format of an Indy Proof request, so not certain of what is in that.  Either way, great if you can review the PR:

Suppose the election requires information on the identity card: address, year of birth. The information is not unique so it is not known exactly who is voting, which protects the privacy of voters. I do not want voters to give information on ID numbers (A unique information) Because of that, I can not know that this person has conducted the election yet? I'm not sure I can do that :(

How can we build peer to peer live chat messaging using hyperledger aries?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 22 Jun 2020 12:13:35 GMT):<br/>
At the moment there is only the basic message protocol (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0095-basic-message), which is a very simple protocol allowing two agents to exchange messages. You could build a simple chat application using this protocol. Because this protocol is so simple, it is implemented in almost all aries frameworks. However if you want to build a robust chat application you would probably be better of creating a new protocol which explicitly adds support for things such as read receipts, emoji-responses group messages, and other things as listed in the out of scope section of the basic message protocol (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0095-basic-message#out-of-scope)

hi @swcurran  @tomislav, here are few questions:
1) Where does private and public key stores? in wallet? not on ledger?
2) What exactly stores in Wallets?
3) @swcurran, You once said "No data is sent to the Blockchain. Ever. It is only used for DIDs, schema/credential metadata and revocation information." What do u mean by metadata?
4) Can you please explain the credential verification flow, issuer-verifer-holder?
4a) Without having information about credentials (it isn't stored on ledger, only store in holder wallet), how will verifer confirms (verify) that these credentials are same as they were issued by issuer? I mean what if holder received credentials, changes later, how will verifer/issuer know that?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 00:23:27 GMT):<br/>
1. All that you create or receive go in your wallet.  Public DIDs that you create also go in the ledger.  DIDs you receive from others may be on a ledger or not.  DIDs from VC issuers will be on a ledger (public) and your agent may or may not store them.
2. Indy wallets store: DIDs, the private keys associated with DIDs you create, other ledger transactions that you create (schema, credential definitions, revocation registries, revocation entries).
3. The "metadata" are the objects needed to prove and verify claims from credentials. That means in Indy -- schema, credentials definitions, RevRegs and RevEntries).
4. 
- Issuer creates DID, schema (or reuses an existing one), Credential Definition (public keys per claim, pointer to Issuers DID, pointer to Schema)
- Issuer optionally creates a Revocation Registries (if creds will be revocable) which has a pointer to the CredDef.
- Issuer offers a credential to the Holder; Holder requests the credential, providing a blinded link secret; Issuer issues credential to the Holder.
   - the credential references the CredDef (points to schema and Issuer DID), is signed by the Issuer DID private key, each claim is signed using the keys in the - CredDef, the Holder gets a credential ID (for revocation)
- Verifier sends a proof request to the Holder with the list of claims they want proven. Claims have restrictions about the credentials they can come from (e.g. what schema, what Cred Def, what issuers, etc.)
- Prover finds credentials that meet the criteria in the cred def and constructs a proof.
    - They prove they have the link secret that proves the credentials were issued to them.
    - The DID and signature on each claims prove they were issued by the issuer
    - The signing of each claim using the CredDef keys prove they were not tampered with.
    - If revocable, the Prover creates a "Proof of non-revocation" to show the claims are from credentials that are not revoked.
- Verifier gets the Cred Def from the ledger, the schema from the ledger, the Issuer DID from the ledger and uses those to verify the proofs from the Prover.

Revocation is a little more complicated and there is detail available here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation

Hope that helps.

HI all, I was wondering whether in Aries there is any specification on how an application's frontend (e.g. web or mobile) should interact with agents. I have seen the `Out-of-band` rfc for establishing the connection between the user's agent and the "enterprise" cloud agent. But how would the frontend be updated on changes in the relationship of the two agents for example after a presentation was sent and acknowledged or a verifiable credential has been received?

For an Agent with a UI, the same piece of software usually speaks 'agent' from one end and 'UI' from the other. It's the same piece of software, and not usually another module or app.
</p>
<p><strong>jangerritharms</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:21:47 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam Thanks for responding. Probably I had a wrong model in mind. I thought a web app would talk directly to a user's agent (similar to how a dApp communicates with MetaMask) where as the intended architecture is probably that a web app talks to an app's backend that integrates with that app's cloud agent. And that cloud agent communicates with a user's cloud/edge agent. So how the app's frontend communicates with the app's backend is outside the scope of Aries specifications. Does that sound right?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:32:30 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  We (BC Gov) have a couple of apps that do that sort of interaction. Any agent has a controller component that is the business logic.  In what we have done so far, that's been embedded in an API service that also talks to a frontend webapp and the controller interacts between the two -- and handles any backend persistence. 

So basically, you have an extended web service, a web frontend.  The web service is also the controller part of the agent, that is talking to an agent framework.

BC Gov's issuer kit and the email verification service are examples of that --

hello @swcurran, can you please clear my thought on that; I (the verifier) wants to verify the credentials of holder, which was issued by Issuer. But I don't want to view/receive any credential from holder, but still be able to verify it that these credentials were issued by Issuer and the holder didn't change any credential.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:53:48 GMT):<br/>
it is, at least so far. The split between agent and UI is more common in the enterprise agent space, less common on the end-user (often mobile app) space.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 28 Jun 2020 16:51:51 GMT):<br/>
Depends what you are searching for on the ledger. "NYM" is the same as DID, so if you are looking for a DID, use that.  If you are doing something like finding all the Schema created by a particular DID -- find the DID, copy the text of the DID, filter on Schema, paste the DID into the search and you find the schema created by the DID.

The filtering by object type focuses on those, adding a search term looks at all the data attributes associated with a transaction.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 28 Jun 2020 23:17:10 GMT):<br/>
The issuer has to offer the functionality, and the wallet you are using has to support it.  I'm not sure where the entire flow is documented, but it uses the `~service` decorator that is documented in aries-rfcs.  The Trinisic Issuer and Wallet support the functionality.  I think that ACA-Py supports issuing, but does not have any deployments that I'm aware of that uses the functionality.  To confirm support, please ask on the ACA-Py channel if you are interested.

The new Out of Band RFC makes both using connection-less messages easier, and allows connections to be reused, which is a significant shortcoming in the currently used RFCs.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 02:42:37 GMT):<br/>
I would guess not, but am not certain.  The encoding by the issuer must be known by the verifier for predicates to work, and I believe (others can check me) all the encodings must be integers.  That means that the claim must be encoded as an integer. Further, that means that any non-integer must be encoded into an order integer matching the source. This means, for example, that dates can't be strings but instead have to be encoded as integers using something like Unix epoch.  Strings are usually encoded by issuers as a hash of the string.  For float to work, it would have to be converted to an integer in the same way by both the issuer and the verifier.

hello, i hope you are doing welll, i have a question about the proof exchange process. When we send a proof request we have requested attributes and requested predicates to fill. If I fill both of those i can send a proof  request and my holder can send a proof presentation even if in the proof presentation the requested predicate = {} otherwise if i only fill requested attributes and leave requested predicates = {} when sending the proof request from the verifier, the holder when he tries to share his proof presentation result in a predicate error.

Hey folks, FYI that BC Gov maintains Docker images for VON-Network (indy-node) and Aries Cloud Agent (with the latest Indy SDK).  These are maintained, updated with each release and are used as the basis for our deployments.  Both have been updated recently for the latest Indy Node release (1.15) and ACA-Py (0.5.2).  You can look at the tags to see the latest and the history of the images.

If you want to use them, check out:

Hi all,
We want to develop a mobile application to manage the user wallet and store its credentials and we are trying to do in ReactNative. We know there is a really mature .NET framework, but as we want to go ReactNative, it would be a problem to integrate it. We have also seen a javascript framework but it does not seem production ready, and it has Node dependencies, which is a problem for mobile development. Would it be possible to use vcx (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/vcx) to manage the mobile communications with the agencies Aries Cloud Agents (mobile -> vcx > Internet -> Organizations Aries Cloud Agent) or vcx does not support yet ACA-py? It is a recommended approach?

Is there a way of changing the node names in the von Network i.e. instead of Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4 can I give different names. If so how can I do it. Thank you in advance.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 18:16:18 GMT):<br/>
I know that Indicio.tech has some early work going on in ReactNative. It's worth coordinating with @kenebert to avoid duplication of that effort.

thank you for creating those edx courses- you guys are doing great work. I went through both courses. I still haven't figured following. I believe these are documented somewhere but I am having trouble finding right document to refer - kindly advise when you have moment. 
1. How are Aries Agent's private keys generated and managed?
2. Is there way to secure ACA-Py APIs?Currently it seems APIs can be accessed by anyone who knows the URLs
3. State (i.e. Framework is Production Ready or under development etc.) of various Aries Frameworks (SDKs, APIs, Python, Javascripts, Go etc.). All the labs use ACA-Py APIs. Is state of all these frameworks summerized somewhere?
4. Indy Ledger - based on the use case, is it advisable to Setup Private Ledger?If yes, where can I find documentation to setup Production private ledger?

<p><strong>jshim10</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 12:58:42 GMT):<br/>
Hello guys, I have a question. Is there a standalone Aries mobile agent without cloud agent?
</p>
<p><strong>jshim10</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 12:59:22 GMT):<br/>
Or can you have a mobile agent storing credentials and keys?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 13:54:18 GMT):<br/>
@jshim10 -- A mobile app (any mobile app) cannot receive messages from others.  Mobile apps can only request data.  As such, a "no cloud agent wallet" is not really practical except under extremely limited circumstances.  Any agent with which the mobile app communicated would have to queue up any messages for wallet, and wait until the wallet asked for the messages using HTTP and the "Transport Return Route" protocol --- getting the messages in the response to an HTTP request. And no wallet could message other wallets. This is not scalable.  It might work for an enclosed ecosystems --- all wallets message only messaging with known server-based agents.
</p>
<p><strong>jshim10</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 14:43:47 GMT):<br/>
Then can (mobile) wallets share a cloud agent? When I try to implement, I found out that I would need to create a process (or docker) for a user. For ten thousand users, ten thousand cloud agents seems not scalable to me.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 17:59:19 GMT):<br/>
The definition of a 'cloud agent' in this case is a little fuzzy. The technical requirement is that you use a mediator (that can be shared among many mobile agents) that will receive messages and queue them for later pickup by a mobile device.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 17:59:28 GMT):<br/>
We call that a Mediator.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:00:20 GMT):<br/>
Cloud Agent typically refers to a cloud agent that is unique to the user. That mode does have some advantages to it, but it is not the only way.
</p>
<p><strong>jshim10</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:02:54 GMT):<br/>
oh, so the mediator can work as a message queue right? while mobile agents have all the dkms
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:03:30 GMT):<br/>
they can. That is not a required feature of mediators, but a really useful one for the situation you describe.
</p>
<p><strong>jshim10</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:03:56 GMT):<br/>
Is the mediator implementation also available in JS?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:04:58 GMT):<br/>
I don't now which features the JS code supports.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:06:02 GMT):<br/>
I think a mediator for a set of mobile agents must queue messages.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:07:22 GMT):<br/>
There are several wallet (mobile agent) mediators - some open and some not.  @ianco was asking the other day about what ones there are.  They can be in any language -- independent of the mobile agent. But they do have to work together.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:07:29 GMT):<br/>
Wallet and mediator.
</p>
<p><strong>jshim10</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:08:26 GMT):<br/>
Can you explain why we need cloud agents instead of just having mobile agents and mediators? It's hard for me to understand the necessity of cloud agents
</p>

An enterprise agent is a cloud agent - one that issues and verifies credentials.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:10:00 GMT):<br/>
cloud agents allow you to mask certain details of your internal message routing if you desire. They can also play a role in data sync between mulitple agents in use by a user.

mobile agents can verify, as well as enterprise agents.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:15:36 GMT):<br/>
mediators can also be used for enterprise agents behind firewalls or with intermittent connectivity.
</p>
<p><strong>jshim10</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:17:46 GMT):<br/>
okay. So it is possible to have only mediators as relays on the server side (no cloud agents) and bunch of mobile (or edge) agents to issue/verify
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:30:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes -- but there are muddy terms there as defined by the community.  My suggestion:

- don't use the term "cloud agent" -- it's confusing.
- wallets -- mobile agents
- mediators -- persistent presence for wallets.  One mediator for many wallets. Primary purpose is just to queue and pass on messages.
- relays -- an actual formal term in Aries that is a variation on a mediator, so shouldn't be used in reference to mediators.
- Enterprise Agents - edge agents (wallets) that run on servers for an enterprise.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:30:55 GMT):<br/>
On cloud agent -- use it to mean "any agent that runs on a server for whatever purpose - mediator, relay or enterprise agent"
</p>
<p><strong>jshim10</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:32:52 GMT):<br/>
okay, gotcha
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:37:29 GMT):<br/>
A final caveat. There can be variations on all of those --- e.g. a mediator can do more for it's wallet clients.  It's just software and pliable. But to get basic understanding -- stick with the common uses.
</p>
<p><strong>pablo-arribas-unicc</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 10:41:14 GMT):<br/>
as for the mediators, what open source implementations are there available?
</p>
<p><strong>pablo-arribas-unicc</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 10:42:14 GMT):<br/>
I believe aries-framework-dotnet has that part implemented under routing. Am I correct? Any option in python?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 12:24:50 GMT):<br/>
ACA-py has some built in support in python.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 12:25:13 GMT):<br/>
Go also has mediator support, but they don't support the connections protocol.

Hello @swcurran @tomislav,
I want to verify a proof response, and the proof request wasn't created by me.

@danielhardman  - reading RFC-0051: Decentralized Key Management. It states that master key is not cryptographically protected.  Can we not use user's password (i.e. Alice's or Faber's password) to encrypt master key?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Sun, 05 Jul 2020 15:15:03 GMT):<br/>
Sure, we could. But that just makes the password the master key that unlocks everything else. And once again, the password itself is not encrypted (cryptographically protected). We could also write down the password on a piece of paper and put it in a vault. That would shift the root of trust so it's physically protected, making the password an indirection before cryptographic trust begins. Or we could unlock the password that guards the master key with a biometric, making the biometric the root of trust. Or we could come up with a fancy scheme that uses something you have, something you are, and something you know. But no matter what we do, the inescapable truth is that cryptographic trust is based on managing secrets, and unlocking a cryptographic trove of secrets has to be based on something that's not cryptographic, because if you base crypographic trust on cryptography, you are not increasing the security of the trove.

Hi @swcurran  & team, I got a query on Hyperledger Indy and Aries. I have worked with Indy for about 6 months. My question is that, every holder/user on the network is assigned a service endpoint which the user gets connected to. The service endpoint is a different port number for each user on the network. So would this architecture be scalable n future? We might be needing to assign identity to thousands, millions or billions of users at some later point of time. How Sovrin would be handling the IP address ranges to be assigned to the users/holders in future?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 05 Jul 2020 17:36:40 GMT):<br/>
Not every user gets a dedicated host and IP. Most (non-issuers) and mobile users will share a common endpoint, generally managed by their mediator agent. Issuers, too, can share a same host/IP, although most issuers today are configured to have dedicated service, but this is definitely not a requirement. As Aries/Indy DID's are anchored to a blockchain, as opposed to web, the approach can scale, independent of any IP address range limitations.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 05 Jul 2020 18:09:33 GMT):<br/>
Could you provide a little more detail of what you want to do? There is a plan to have pre-defined proof requests that can be referenced (like schema) vs. created and sent each time.  In that scenario, you still need to provide a nonce to ensure the freshness of the proof and to prevent replay of a proof.  But I'm not sure what you mean by a "third party verifier".
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 05 Jul 2020 18:16:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm wondering if you are talking about the IPs of the nodes of an Indy network - the validator nodes operated by, for example, Sovrin Stewards. If that is the case, there is a pretty low limit on the number of Stewards on an Indy network - currently 25, balancing about robustness/redundancy (supporting up to 8 simultaneous failures) and transaction processing speed.

So either way you were asking, there are built in approaches to scale the system sufficiently.
</p>
<p><strong>x0axz</strong> (Sun, 05 Jul 2020 20:15:21 GMT):<br/>
Here is our system design:
We have multiple Issuers and every Issuer has their own user base (Holders). We want to function as Verifier, to verify the Proof Request on behalf of Issuers.

Issuer wants to verify a holder, the issuer will first sent a proof request to Verifier (us) (we won't store/hold it). We will then forward this request to holder, they in response will sent us the proof (again, we don't want to know anything about it, we want to apply ZKP). We will verify the proof request.

As the Credentials are stored in Holder Wallets, when Issuer sent us request to verify the credentials of Holder, we (verifier) don't want to store/hold/log the credentials in any way.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 13:45:16 GMT):<br/>
The process makes sense.  This is a missing component of TLS, that this verification is one sided, so a proof both ways makes sense. 

This raises lots of interesting questions:

How often are you doing that?  Is it just after establishing the initial connection, or more often?  Also, what is a lot of time?  How much human interaction is part of that?  What is being proven?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 17:27:46 GMT):<br/>
What happens with the ack logic on a repeat verification? The holder (agent) in the record already has an ack by this point, does it care if it gets verified again? What happens in the perverse case when it doesn't verify a second time (could happen with, for example, revocation publication bad luck)?

This seems to open up a can of worms - might it be better to duplicate the record on demand somehow into a new pres ex record in some kind of new state and verify from there? _(Implicitly I would think this would not entail an ack on completion)._
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 17:30:41 GMT):<br/>
I think the use case is two agents communicating and each is doing a proof request/verification.  It's not a single agent verifying twice.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 17:36:15 GMT):<br/>
In that case the record won't be in the verified state on agent B

I'd need to see the work flow. If verifier agent A is a proxy then I don't see how agent B even got the pres ex record in the first place - the endpoints on this protocol are holder and verifier, not verifier and verifier.

If it's slow at the moment, that might be  because it's running the connection protocol twice and then a proof exchange each way, depending how the demo is set up. Perhaps present-proof could be extended to support a challenge sent to the verifier but that's not a feature at the moment. A new protocol could also be created to support this

Our recent discussions about ‘enhancing’ the Connections/DID Exchange protocols with ‘profile’ information has brought up an issue I’ve been struggling with for a bit now. (thread)
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 23:24:43 GMT):<br/>
As a community, we have placed a huge significance on the act of a user ‘accepting’ an invitation to connect. Our emphasis on placing the user in control of this interaction is good. I believe that our timing of this user action has some negative side effects.

It is desirable for a user to have good, quality information available to allow them to make an informed decision. This becomes difficult when evaluating an Invitation to connect, because a secure connection has not yet been established. We therefore aspire to include more information in an invitation to allow the user to make a decision. I believe that keeping the security aspects of the protocol and the information aspects of the protocol separate is worth it in the long run.

An analogy might be made here to visiting a website in the browser: TLS is leveraged to transfer information from a web server to a browser when a user first visits a website. After viewing the page, the user then chooses whether they will further engage, or discard the relationship (TLS connection work).

I believe we should consider the exchange of DIDs to be similar: useful to establish a secure communication channel. If we move the user’s decision point on whether to ‘accept’ the connection further down the timeline, we have the ability to exchange credentials and pass other information along in a secure manner.

In a practical sense, this means we label newly formed connections as ‘pending’ or ‘resolving’ or something similar. These connections might even be hidden from the user. When enough information is received over the connection, the user is then prompted to ‘accept’ the connection, alongside verified, rich information. Should the user decline, the relationship may be discarded.

Perhaps the greatest benefit of this mental model switch is that we can align the moment of ‘connection’ and ‘trust’ in the user experience. A user is presented with enough information to make a quality decision, and perhaps also assign some level or type of trust to the relationship.

As the error we’ve made is a mental model (which I’ve likely contributed substantially to), no protocol changes are necessary for this improvement in user experience. We must change how our apps work, and how they present choices to their owners.

We should also engage in discussing what information is sufficient, as a baseline, for agents to require before involving the user. As this aspect of the process is likely to improve over time, we may safely choose an imperfect but expedient answer to this question. We will improve over time, and it is far less critical that we have only 'one' way to accomplish this.

.indy_client will be somewhere in that path, most likely at the root
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 13:04:07 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 13:05:14 GMT):<br/>
indy-sdk itself uses $HOME/Documents/.indy_client as the indy home path (on iOS - again, it knows it's iOS as opposed to MacOS) and it doesn't seem to care what the app is
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 13:05:58 GMT):<br/>
(I paraphrase: $HOME defaults to /home/indy and it comes from a dirs::home_dir())

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 13:06:27 GMT):<br/>
There's a reason for using Documents, and it has to syncing and backup.

I could keep the directory outside indy-client home, but tails files _are_ indy-specific and I'd prefer to avoid clutter. It looks like there is no way to know whether python is operating on iOS specifically - which seems preposterous from a 2020 point of view

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 13:17:30 GMT):<br/>

I agree with all of the theory you articulate here, Sam. However, in discussing with our product management folks, I am running into friction. Because other products show the logo and name of the inviter, our product management people are unwilling to give up the UX. I told them they could have the same UX but do it a different way, and they pushed back. Part of the pushback is just "it will take longer," but a more interesting pushback is that there are currently no issuers of company logos and company names. Thus, if we replaced the simplistic and insecure approach with a secure one and decoupled the UX from the steps of a single protocol, we would have no basis for phishing-resistant logos. They'd lose the feature in practice, if not in theory.

This makes me wonder if we ought to allow logo+name as they're requesting, but require that it be digitally signed. That would NOT guarantee that it is true, but it would commit the sender of the message to a non-repudiable assertion that could later be validated. Until we have issuers of org creds that attest to logos and company names, that may be the best we can do. I don't love it, though...

I think we may have a 3rd door / bootstrapping solution in the form of the Well Known DID Configuration.
https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/
This is a narrow solution for companies with domains only, but does carry some amount of trust.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 15:22:35 GMT):<br/>
I had forgotten about that. This is a hopeful idea. I'll go socialize it with our product folks and see what they think.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 15:23:44 GMT):<br/>
ideal: we pass a message after 'connection' established, before UX asking user to accept. mess contains link to well known DID, domain, and image. domain can be verified. Image won't, but that's far better than nothing.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 15:24:41 GMT):<br/>
If we could get the logo from the favicon of the same website that holds the .wellknown stuff, we have something a bit better...

As I was reading this thread form the top-down, I thought about the well known DID config, until Sam mentioned it. It's a great way to add some validity about the source of the invitation. It also looks good on the UI and adds element of trust:
```
Faber wants to connect with you.
[Faber Logo]
Verified domain: faber.com
```
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:30:03 GMT):<br/>
Issuers can then publish a DID that they would use for invitations that would be verifiable. This would add one or two extra fields to the invitation payload, but nothing too complicated for implementors to adopt it.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:30:42 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav thoughts on pushing the 'accept' forward, till after the exchange is complete?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:31:47 GMT):<br/>
I'm okay with it. At present, I prefer a little better UX over slightly less phishing security.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:32:23 GMT):<br/>
Can you draw that out a little? I'm not sure I fully understand.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:32:42 GMT):<br/>
Sam, I don't know what you mean by pushing the 'accept' forward.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:33:22 GMT):<br/>
I mean, complete the full did exchange protocol, then exchange protocol messages to 'prove stuff', then ask the user if they accept.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:33:55 GMT):<br/>
so, push user accept of new connection till after exchange etc. has been complete.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:35:11 GMT):<br/>
(my use of forward may be in error. push backward?)
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:35:30 GMT):<br/>
Oh, I misunderstood that. Sounds like a good deal of message exchange before something can be considered valid. I'd rather just keep the invitation data as is, allow for name/profile, but not worry about phishing, and then add the public DID config, which can carry a signature as well.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:36:42 GMT):<br/>
I worry that the need to put a little more in the invitation will never end.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:37:03 GMT):<br/>
I am *deeply* worried about phishing. I feel like allowing anybody to claim whatever name and logo they like, at the beginning of a relationship, dramatically subverts the entire ecosystem we're trying to create.

Using .well-known gives us substantially better security with approximately the same UX, and not a lot of increased effort.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:37:33 GMT):<br/>
We talked previously about adding sigs to the invitation, now the DID configuation spec makes it a little more convenient to do that and add domain anchoring.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:37:35 GMT):<br/>
by changing the point of user 'accept' till later, we can engage rich (and gradually improving) protocols instead of creeping stuff into the invitation.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:38:17 GMT):<br/>
to be clear. use of .well-known and moving the point of UX are orthogonal.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:38:19 GMT):<br/>
Like I said, Sam: the theory is right. But until we have issuers of instutional name+logo, it doesn't help us.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:39:14 GMT):<br/>
the well known did config can be use either as an addition to the invitation, or in a protocol message after dids are exchanged to the same effect on phishing.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:40:05 GMT):<br/>
Hmm. I hadn't considered doing it later. It's true that it has the same effect on phishing. It doesn't have the same effort, though.

it also restricts the entire exchange protocol to require a connection. If well know DID is a decorator, we can attach it to any message, connectionless presentations would be a lot more trusted as well.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:45:09 GMT):<br/>
my head has both didcomm v1 and v2 in mind. if things go as I expect, the ridged concept of a 'connection' will be far less a problem.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:47:45 GMT):<br/>
Note: in my letter above, I'm suggesting two fields. Neither is "name" or "icon." One is "domain" and would use the .well-known mechanism. The other is "avatar", which inherently implies self-assertion and lower trust.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:48:55 GMT):<br/>
I don't think I'm in favor of fighting the battle right now to decouple the UX from the protocol. It's too many moving parts too coordinate. Let's fight that after DIDComm v2 is out.

(While I agree that 'the ridged concept of a connection will be far less of a problem' with DIDComm v2, I also believe we need the concept of a relationship (!= connection). The move away from connections is only half of the puzzle; until we have something to represent the *real* thing we're after, removing the pseudo-thing will continue to generate friction. So I want to fight the UX decoupling as part of a more mature mental shift.
</p>

I like the idea of the .well-known configuration and linked domain, but I'm not sure what the benefit of using a VC would be there over a simple signature using the did doc's identity keys
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:59:33 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead : the signature over DID doc keys tells you that the sender is willing to risk the reputation of that DID on the assertion that they are described by a name and logo. That is not the same as saying they're willing to risk the reputation of a public website.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 18:00:28 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam : re. ordering, if you put the .wellknown stuff after a connection is complete, you have a problem, because you can't use it with a private DID. If you keep the .wellknown stuff in step 1, you can still switch to a private DID later.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 18:04:01 GMT):<br/>
you can remember which public did was used initially, and/or prove ownership of the public did.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 17:45:36 GMT):<br/>
I don't believe we need this. If we want to elevate trust based on VCs, we should just use the Present Proof protocol. If we want to elevant trust based on email verification, we should write an Email Verification protocol. We don't need a protocol to select protocols -- or if we do, it should be a generic "pick among these alternative protocols" protocol, not an "Elevate Trust" protocol.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 18:09:03 GMT):<br/>
I share Daniel's opinion. I'm concerned we're creating highly opinionated protocol with purpose to improve trust, and that in itself might be a dangerous promise. I'm also slightly worried about the implementation complexity of this protocol.

Hello everyone, I have read the documentation for the agent authorization policy from aries-rfc (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/ea388dbf4d04dd1ae28ca387c5c8369d812e5f6f/concepts/0051-dkms/pdf/Agent%20Authorization%20Policy.pdf). Is there an implementation for this protocol completed or in development phase? Is there an any alternative implementation or more recent discussion on it?
</p>

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 02:30:43 GMT):<br/>
There is an implementation in a branch of Indy. I don't remember the branch's name. It was written by Lovesh Harchandani, IIRC.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 02:31:44 GMT):<br/>
I could be wrong about the author. It might have been Mike Lodder as well.

Seeking for High Level Component Diagram Indy & Aries together - which shows how all components in Indy & Aries i.e. Ledger, Indy-sdk, libindy, Storage / Wallet, Aries, Agent, Controller etc. fits together? if this doesn't exist, I can try creating one & send over to this group for review...

Realization: elevating trust shouldn't focus on protocols, but on governance frameworks.

Here is more info. Code that implements this is in the following three repos (each in a separate authz branch): https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/authz-rc, https://github.com/lovesh/indy-node/tree/authz, https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/indy-crypto/tree/authz

I think the indy-crypto code was written by Mike Lodder, not Lovesh.

Thank you again. By the way, there is a related branch in indy-plenum also, but I realized that it is just used for testing purposes. I wanted to mention for the future readers.

Please note that these diagrams are not gospel. In particular, since these diagrams were created, some frameworks have evolved a different perspective on how plugins ought to work (plugins specific to one framework, rather than plugins that can be used by multiple frameworks).

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 22:05:24 GMT):<br/>
I think I disagree with @danielhardman / @tomislav on the need for this - but we need more discussion about it.

On the one hand we agree we have no trust established when we establish a didcomm connection -- it's a higher level concern. Yes, we could just give guidance "Hey - don't trust the other side -- verify them" -- that what we say today.  Responsibility is on both sides to figure out how to get that. I think we need a higher level abstraction that provides ways to do that. Sure, a proof is going to be a good way to do that (although there may be others), but a short form way to say what proofs might be acceptable would help. For example, we really want a way for a user get information about a service.  We don't want the user to have to construct a proof on the fly to do that. Perhaps a similar set of standard proofs are needed when connecting with a person.

I think this is something we should be exploring.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 22:10:31 GMT):<br/>
I see two situations:

1. Alice invites Bob to connect because Alice has an intent that is obvious from the goal of her OOB invitation. Ex: goal = Issue Credential 1.0. In this case, the goal in OOB feels adequate to me.

2. Alice invites Bob to connect but her intent is not obvious. Ex: Bob is a consultant. Alice wants to connect; does she want to hire Bob, or network with him, or demand payment for his unpaid bill? In this case, asking how we elevate trust is the wrong question, because the trust we need is dependent on the context that exists only in Alice's brain. For either Alice or Bob to say, immediately after connecting, "Hey, here are 3 ways to build trust with me" makes no sense. What they should be saying is, "I propose to use this new channel to negotiation a contract with you as a contractor. GIVEN THAT CONTEXT, here's a trust framework we can use (which implies things about reasonable issuers and credentials, and maybe about protocols) -- and here are 2 or 3 protocols we could use to build trust up to "Level C" in the governance framework, which is the one the recommend for people signing contracts.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 22:12:46 GMT):<br/>
This second scenario DOES feel very protocol-worthy to me -- but I think it would be an "establish context" protocol, not an "elevate trust" protocol.

Re @swcurran ` For example, we really want a way for a user get information about a service.` - I agree and this is one reason I advocate for adopting the DID Configuration to give "some" level of authenticity that will only make it easier for the party to make a decision on a trust level.

Re @swcurran ` For example, we really want a way for a user get information about a service.` - I agree and this is one reason I advocate for adopting the DID Configuration well known spec; to give "some" level of authenticity that will only make it easier for the party to make a decision on a trust level.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 22:20:40 GMT):<br/>
That's where I think Sam's suggestion is spot on. Alice wants to issue a credential to Bob, but with just OOB+DID Exchange complete, Alice does not know if she is connected to Bob or someone else that responded to the invitation (as we have said many times).  I think what Sam is suggesting (and I'm agreeing with) is that the OOB intent happen AFTER a basis of trust is established - something beyond DID Exchange.  And since some sort of basis of trust is needed with every connection, we want to make it easy/fast so that we can get on with the business at hand.

In other words - DID Exchange is generally insufficient for having a meaningful exchange -- e.g. to carry out the intent.  Just like you should not do anything with a website until you verify the TLS connection.  With DIDComm this is further complicated because we want confirmation on both sides.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 22:21:53 GMT):<br/>
Yes - agree that well-known is a good method and example. Can we do more or are we just repeating TLS?

well-known works well for connecting to a business or a company (with a domain, obviously) and is a good starting place.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 22:23:51 GMT):<br/>
I think we should focus on some verifiable piece easy for individuals. Since we have an email verification service, let's start with that one. VC of email ownership.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 22:24:17 GMT):<br/>
I see the well-known as a stepping stone, not the ultimate solution. I like the practicality and immediacy it offers.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 22:24:29 GMT):<br/>
on both sides we'll need improvement. If we carefully allow for movement forward, then we can get started now and learn a bit.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 22:27:19 GMT):<br/>
for businesses I'd like a gov. framework around business identity. Issuers that can verify logos names, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 22:27:41 GMT):<br/>
But that'll take a while to establish. well-known we can use now, and covers the common case well.

Hi team, just getting started with this. DO we have something like the end-to-end examples Hyperledger Fabric has to help us get started?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 13 Jul 2020 13:40:07 GMT):<br/>
There are quite a few examples depending on what you are trying to do and depend on the background you have on what Aries does and is used for.  If you need background, this edX course is available: https://www.edx.org/course/becoming-a-hyperledger-aries-developer . Many of the examples use https://github.com/bcgov/von-network, which will give you a running network in about a minute, and there are a series of demos here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/demo.

The revocation registry is a complex identifier that you need to find earlier in the flow.  It's definitely not "1".  Look in the events (webhooks) data, or earlier in the console messages for it.

No: this is the revocation registry id. The credential revocation identifier (cred-rev-id) is something like "1": it's a monotonically increasing "1"-based stringified integer.

*Agent*: We call something an agent if its major built artifact is an installable package that provides an agent-like thing with usable features out of the box.

*Framework*: We call it a framework if it is language-specific infrastructure for building multiple agents or agent-like things, with its own way(s) to give features to them. 

*SDK*: We don’t use the term “SDK” because it implies a huge amount of docs, developer tools, sample code, and so forth that help someone building from scratch. We’re not focused on helping people build from scratch, and we’re not mature enough for SDKs.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 14:13:37 GMT):<br/>
Have you go through the demos?  Aries ToolBox is I think any example of what you are trying to do.  In a nutshell:

1. Deploy an instance of ACA-Py with command line parms.  That gives you an API for your controller. 

2. Create a web app that talks to the controller - receives HTTP events, gets HTTP events.

I don't know what you know, so not sure how to help beyond that.

Would like to know your journey into this so we could improve the docs for new folks.

Hi all, there is one question which I would like to hear more comments, is about the verifiable credentials, as my understanding, to verify a credential, we need to know the issuer's service endpoint to verify this credential was issued from the issuer, so what would be the advantage that each issuer has one exposed rest api to provide a result about whether the specified credential is issued from them? They may have their own database as a check basis, and if this passed in credential is valid in their database, then it will return true, otherwise will return false. So what are the advantages for verifiable credential approach, comparing with this tradition approach. Thanks.

Note about Aries WG call: We need a way for alice to ask "New DID, who dis?"
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 15 Jul 2020 20:56:27 GMT):<br/>
Your first sentence is not correct.  When you verify a credential, you receive a DID that must be public (on a ledger) so you can access the associated public key to verify the credential.  You do not have to contact the Issuer to verify the credential.  For example, you may have a pre-defined list of DIDs that you know and trust, and you just make sure that the issuer is on the list.

If you don't know the DID of the issuer, you will want to find out who the are.  One way to do that would be to connect with the issuer and ask who they are (e.g. request a credential that shows they have authority to issue the credential you are verifying). There are other ways to do that as well. 

You don't need to contact the issuer to verify the credential. You may need to in deciding if you trust what the issuer has said in the credential.

@TelegramSam , @swcurran , and others who talked about the gov framework negotiation protocol on today's Aries WG B call: I have created a doc that explores some scenarios. What I hope you will conclude if you review it is that we need to contextualize the governance framework idea more fully. I've given some examples of how I think that might be doable.

Hey everyone, I am new to Aries. I work for the IOTA Foundation, where we are implementing DID, VC and associated standards in Rust and would like to be compatible with Aries if possible. We are currently in the scoping phase and I was trying to find a particular component. I was wondering if there was a similar standard to DIDComm for the Verifiable Credentials/Presentations. Is their a proposed standard for the exchange of Verifiable Credentials / Presentations?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 08:57:13 GMT):<br/>
Hi Jelle, Have your already looked at the Aries RFCs? There are the issue credential (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md) and present proof (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0037-present-proof/README.md) DIDComm protocols which define the required steps for issuing credentials and presenting proof.
</p>
<p><strong>JelleFm</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 08:58:45 GMT):<br/>
Ah, those were the names I was looking for. Once you know the chosen naming, it becomes a lot easier to find the right RFCs. Thanks you! :)
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 09:03:36 GMT):<br/>
as you're not coming from an indy background it may be good to also take a look at v2 of the protocols, which removed some indy-specific things I think. Issue credential v2 just got propsed: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0453-issue-credential-v2/README.md . Present proof v2 proposal is still on the way.
</p>
<p><strong>JelleFm</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 09:06:42 GMT):<br/>
Thank you! Is DID Auth also merged with DID Comm within Aries?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 09:21:49 GMT):<br/>
I'm not really familiar with DID Auth, so can't help you with that. sorry.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 14:00:26 GMT):<br/>
DID Authentication is built into DIDComm as every message other than (sometimes) the very first is peer-to-peer using DIDs for end-to-end encryption.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 14:01:52 GMT):<br/>
If you are getting started with Aries RFCs, the easiest way to find the relevant ones in use right now is the Aries Interop Profile - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 14:02:42 GMT):<br/>
It in turn points to all in use RFCs for connecting through credential exchange.

Hi All, I am learning about webhook and how should I use it with Aries framework, here I have one question about this, hope can have your comments. Thanks.

I think the webhook is one "push" model about information exchange between two systems/applications, we can call it trigger application and action application, and normally this could be one backend interaction. Image application A is the trigger app, and application B is the action app. When application A has one special event happened, then it will invoke application B's webhook. So here I would like to have your thoughts that, whether application B can use web socket to let user know that there is a new event/data received, and user can take related action accordingly? In other words, whether the webhook always work with web socket to let user know about the received event/data? Kindly advise. Thanks a lot.

thanks @andrew.whitehead  for your reply. So seems websocket is one different approach compare with webhook.

Hi, I am new to Aries, is there a place to get started with some tutorials. I don't have the infrastructure to run a hyperledger, so I believe I would need a public hyperledger. I want to create a end to end demo flow, where I can have a digital wallet, which has the identity, and I believe Aries can then distribute the identity in a hyperledger. And how does hyperledger indy fit in this scenario. Any end-to-end demo flow for getting started?

Hi, what do you guys think is the best way for an holder's agent to check if one of holder's credentials is revoked?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 13:38:54 GMT):<br/>
I suspect that there might be an easier way if you are writing code within the indy-sdk (e.g. at the Rust level), but for now, I think the easiest way is to write a proof request and call the indy-sdk function to create a proof.
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 14:26:36 GMT):<br/>
I thought of attaching a field to a credential (in wallet anoncreds) indicating if it was revoked but i think that's not possible (correct me if i'm wrong). In case this is not possible, what is the best way to save a simple array in the wallet non secrets? Both this options would rely on issuer's agent communicating to the holder's agent that a given credential was revoked.

Wrong approach - it makes a non-cryptographically-verifiable data source the authority on credential acceptability, and assumes a pliant holder.

The best way to put an array into a non-secrets record is to json-encode it into a string and set it as the (necessarily, string) value. Alternatively, the array is really a dict, you can use tag:value for each entry. But note that using tags for everything slows down performance.

Adding a field to a credential for revocation status is also a non-starter because changing its value wrecks any digital signature over it.

The way to prove non-revoked status is to verify a proof on the credential.

Note that the holder may delete the credential if he notices it's become garbage.

The way to prove non-revoked status is to verify a proof on the credential.

Note that the holder may delete the credential if he notices it's become garbage, but even a revoked credential can still be useful (e.g., proof request with non-revocation interval ending before credential revocation, for posterior proof).

<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 20:32:29 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for the response @sklump 

Should the holder's agent always verify if a proof is valid before send it to a verifier and notify the holder in case it isn't?

About the last point, I was waiting for the credential deletion api to become available in the nodejs wrapper. As of now i think it wasn't added yet.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 21:44:50 GMT):<br/>
Oh! nodejs. Sorry.

The W3C model doesn't call for the holder to act as a verifier, so at present I don't think anyone would expect the prover to verify before sending.

Following aries capabilities on credentials, is it possible for an issuer to create a credential with expiration date?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Fri, 24 Jul 2020 07:25:35 GMT):<br/>
OSMA is a holder and does not have verification capabilities. It can however send the credentials to a verifier as proof for it to verify the credentials
</p>
<p><strong>AnneliPedersen</strong> (Fri, 24 Jul 2020 07:26:51 GMT):<br/>
How do you send credentials with OSMA?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Fri, 24 Jul 2020 07:27:45 GMT):<br/>
A verifier needs to send proof request to it. When the proof request comes you can then select each proof equest a credential. And then you can send the proof to the verifier

Just a heads up: Aca-py expects agents to have a name. so options.AgentName has to be assigned, which it is not in the github project.

You can set an attribute for it, but aries neither reserves any attribute names nor assigns any special semantics to any attribute. 

So you can set `validFrom`/`validTo` fields or equivalent in a schema (hence its cred defs), but relying parties could choose to ignore them: they would be attributes like any other.

Hey all, I want to know if a Mobile agent can issue a self credential or not? If yes then please guide me to process to follow and if No then why? Thanks in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 27 Jul 2020 14:58:27 GMT):<br/>
There is no technical reason why it can't be done, but I don't think anyone has done it.  For Indy, the agent would have to have a DID, schema and Cred Def on the ledger, which is not a feature of any mobile agents AFAIK.

In Indy, a prover can include self-attested attributes in a proof.  Would that work for your use case?  Not sure of how well that is supported in mobile agents either...

Hi @zickau , Have you seen the indy doc about revocation? I don’t know how it would work in practice, but it states that “Revocation is reversible.” https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/hipe/en/latest/text/0011-cred-revocation/README.html

Hello, we are working on a framework and are testing the didcomms with an aca-py agent. Currently we are getting an error trying to get a connection response from a request we send to the aca-py instance.

```

aca-py responds with this error:
```
{"@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/connections/1.0/problem_report", "@id": "a79abc10-9b42-43ac-a955-2a511f82d547", "explain": "Connection DID does not match DIDDoc id", "problem-code": "ProblemReportReason.REQUEST_NOT_ACCEPTED"}

Which is odd as the DID and DIDDoc id do match.

Does anyone have a possible solution to this?

Just a reminder about the Identity Implementer's WG Call tomorrow morning (Aug 13th @ 9am MT). This is a chance to get updates on the WG calls you may have missed this week.

Our guest presenter will be Sam Smith of ProSapien.  Sam will be presenting an overview of the new KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) methodology.  KERI creates a self-certifying identifier that provides the basis for a universal DID method (DID:uni).

Here are links to the Wiki and the Zoom meeting.

</p>
<p><strong>pleerock</strong> (Tue, 18 Aug 2020 10:24:07 GMT):<br/>
and trying to understand what "recipientKeys" are? From what I understand right now, its a verkey of newly created connection DID ? Am I right?

Hey guys a noob here :) , I have a question regarding demo tutorial in regards to the invitation that faber generates, for some reason I seem to not find it in the faber terminal window. 

I was able to 

- Successfully run the VON-Network
- Was able to Start Faber and Alice Networks

I can see menu for Faber is generated but can not see the invitation key. I am running this demo through  docker locally.

Hello people, someone knows any work on integrating Aries with the OAuth protocol?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 16:59:59 GMT):<br/>
You can look at https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc  -- it implements an OIDC Identity Provider (IdP) that talks JWT Tokens to the Relying Party, and requests a proof from an Aries wallet.  The claims from the returned proof are put into the JWT so that the Relying Party need not change -- just add a config to use the "Verifiable Credential IdP".

Hi all,
I am currently working on a project but I am confused in some concepts. 
First, where is the wallet that stores the credentials saved? Is it saved on a blockchain or just a local database?
Secondly, I still don't get how the verifier entity verifies the correctness  of the presented values? From what I understood, the personal data of the student or the holder of a transcript are not saved on the ledger, so what does the verifier compare against the ledger if the data is not there? 
I would appreciate your help, thank you in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 18:27:55 GMT):<br/>
* the wallet is a local database
* the values are in the presented proof, which proves that the issuer issued the credentials. The issuer's DID is on the (public) ledger.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:38:14 GMT):<br/>
The blockchain is used to verify the cryptography without needing the verifier to contact the issuer.  The proof/verification interchange is done between the prover/verifier.

</p>
<p><strong>MarinaELias</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 20:40:01 GMT):<br/>
In what form are credentials saved in the wallet then? And what else does the wallet save?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 23:25:37 GMT):<br/>
The credentials are stored in the form delivered to the holder. For Indy credentials, they are signed using CL Signatures.  The wallet also stores DIDs (on and off ledger DIDs), ledger objects (for Indy, there are a couple of things beyond DIDs), connections (DID pairs between connected wallets) and protocol state objects.  And anything else the wallet app wants to put in the wallet.
</p>
<p><strong>MarinaELias</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 00:13:17 GMT):<br/>
Okay last question though, what makes the wallet secure? I mean couldn't that wallet it self be stolen or someone, what makes sure who own this wallet?

Hey guys,
I have a few doubts regarding this demo (ACApy Alice Faber Acme Demo): https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-controllers/tree/master/AliceFaberAcmeDemo
I know that the following repo https://github.com/petridishdev/aries-cloudagent-python is used for building the agents but I'm not able to pinpoint where the DID's are being created. Even in the demo, the invitation object for connection doesn't seem to have a DID (According to the structure of the invite a DID should be present in the invite). 
Could someone please help me out with where Indy comes into the picture in this particular demo?

The invitation contains a "peer-did" (or something similar).  It does not go on the ledger at all -- is just given to the other party in the connection.  So it's not a DID, but contains the same data as a minimal DID - an identifier, a public key, an endpoint and for DIDComm support, routing information to get a message to the recipient.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 02:56:01 GMT):<br/>
In Indy, only verifiable credential issuers need to have DIDs and other data on the ledger.  A verifier and holder does not need it.  So in the demo -- only Faber is an issuer and has data on the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 02:56:37 GMT):<br/>

One more thing, revocation registries need a ledger? I see only one revocation type being defined (`IndyRevocation`), when I try to create a revocation registry, I am getting an error as I do not have nor want to have a ledger instance, I am trying to run aries totally decoupled from a ledger
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Fri, 28 Aug 2020 08:52:55 GMT):<br/>
In order to open a wallet you need to provide it with a master key, as far as I know. Now the next question is where that master key is stored and who manages it :D
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Fri, 28 Aug 2020 09:46:16 GMT):<br/>
I guess the same can be said about a verifier. It looks like the only verifier supported by aries is an indy verifier, which also requires a ledger...
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 28 Aug 2020 13:23:31 GMT):<br/>
Hi @berserkr have you seen the indy doc about revocation? https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/concepts/revocation/cred-revocation.md

Most implementations of Aries only work with Indy at the moment. Aries framework Go is the exception here, it does not support Indy based credentials. However from what I know they also don’t support revocation at the moment.

Running Aries completely decoupled from a ledger should be possible if you don’t use public DIDs, and use a credential method that doesn’t require you to store schemas and credential definitions on the ledger. This is not possible with Indy.

However for revocation using a ledger is crucial. Without the revocation status being anchored in a ledger the verifier will need to talk directly to the issuer about revocation status. How else can we know for sure the credential hasn’t been revoked? This introduces some privacy concerns, and also makes the holder dependent on the infrastructure of the issuer. All things we can avoid when using a ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 28 Aug 2020 14:13:10 GMT):<br/>
The owner of the wallet holds it and stores it in a way that they define "safe".  On a mobile app, it uses the OS provided protected storage - e.g. the place that requires biometrics, etc. to access.

Thank you for the clarification, makes sense, This is something I have been wrestling with and making the argument for, which is, the need to run an indy ledger as it will simplify things for us. Rather than trying to re-invent the wheel

<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:57:08 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra One thing that is not clear to me yet is the tails file, how is that managed?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sat, 29 Aug 2020 12:22:03 GMT):<br/>
I'm assuming you've read the document about revocation from my previous message. Some information about the tails file is stored on the ledger (Hash and Uri), but tails files are  otherwise managed separately from the ledger. The "tricky" part is that the tails file should be available to the holder. So the tails file should be hosted on a server somewhere so it can be downloaded by the holder. There is no standard for managing this but BCGov has created a very nice indy-tails-server (https://github.com/bcgov/indy-tails-server) that does exactly this.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sat, 29 Aug 2020 12:22:54 GMT):<br/>
I think they even have a public instance running that is free to use (although I'm not 100% sure of this)
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sat, 29 Aug 2020 12:30:09 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran is it correct there is a public instance of the indy-tails-server?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Sat, 29 Aug 2020 18:24:10 GMT):<br/>
I want to make sure the Aries community is aware of this conversation happening in the W3C, in which it has been proposed to eliminate `serviceEndpoint` from the DID core spec. This would be disruptive to DIDComm. It appears that the proposal has been rejected (DIDComm is safe), but there are still some voices claiming that `serviceEndpoint` is useless nonsense. You might want to read the ticket or weigh in. HEre's a link: https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/382#issuecomment-683325040

Hi everyone, I want to build an anonymous social welfare service with the following steps.
Step 1: They will receive a certificate called "ID card" including code, full name, address and some other information.
Step 2: They access the another system to get benefits. The system will send a request to prove that they have "ID card" and a valid address.
Step 3: The system will send them benefits in some way if the proof is valid.

But I have problems checking the person that has ever been received. While I'm not asking for their ID number. Is there a way to solve it? Thanks very much.

Hello , can anyone please tell me how i can achieve below in Indy     ? is there any concept of generating master secret key in Indy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 1. Issuer will issue a certificate by reflecting the master secret that only the user knows.
2. Proof of ownership through proof of zero knowledge without revealing the master secret when submitting the certificate

Good thing DID Documents have a JSON-LD option so we could have just added a didcomm.org extension context and added them back in. :upside_down:

Hi everyone I am  looking for some information about support of DID resolution process for multiple did methods within agents spaces. Means is there any work already started to provide support for multiple did methods? Anyone build so far an agent which can handle more then one did method? I would really appreciate the input. 
As a test we are planning to add to aries toolbox support for did web to test few interoperable mechanisms and we are wondering if there is already a kind of "spec" or best practices to do so.

Re: Aries Wednesday B Call: This call will happen immediately after two days of the Indy Interopathon. Both Stephen and I will be occupied with that meeting. Is there a volunteer that wants to run the meeting? Without a volunteer, we'll need to cancel this week's meeting.

Any volunteers?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:07:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm not really sure what the question is, but that is how Indy anoncreds work -- it's more of a statement than a question.

The holder gives the issuer a blinded link (master) secret that the issuer embeds in the credential. When proving, the issuer unblinds the blinded link secret without revealing the link secret itself.
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:28:14 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @swcurran , my question was around how the holder will generate that master secret key? what function or API we can use for that?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:01:27 GMT):<br/>
Ah...that I think happens automatically when you create the wallet.  Confirmed by devs.
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:08:37 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran ahh....do you mean i need to confirm with the devs for that? can you please give any devs reference so i can reach out to him?

Excuse me, I have a question about anocreds.
How to make credentials one-time use so that second and later run are detected but do not reveal exactly who I am?
</p>
<p><strong>pixelschnitzel</strong> (Tue, 01 Sep 2020 13:59:31 GMT):<br/>
You could revoke the credential immediately after first usage.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 01 Sep 2020 17:59:25 GMT):<br/>
It's not obvious.  The problem with revoke-after-first-use is that it is not a single transaction, and the verifier has to contact the issuer to request it be revoked.

AFAIK - there is not a good answer to this with VCs.  That is a "double-spend" issue and is probably better handled with more cryptocurrency-like handling.

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 01 Sep 2020 18:23:30 GMT):<br/>
"consumable credentials" would be the term we sometime use to describe these types of credentials. As @swcurran there's currently no implementation that supports this

Hello, I'm interested in volunteering for Hyperledger Indy projects as a developer-beginner. If there are some tasks that don't require extensive coding knowledge or this knowledge might be gained using free available and known resources then I am willing to help. You can contact me using private message. Cheers, Victor.

Thank you @pixelschnitzel, @swcurran  and @tomislav.  Does this mean that I have to reveal a unique piece of information about myself to be able to determine if I have interacted with the verifie?. Also means the unlinkable has been turned-off in this case. What is the best way to deal with this at the moment? Thank you very much. I'm doing final-project and am struggling here.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 02 Sep 2020 19:02:54 GMT):<br/>
Yes, you would have to do that.

There is some work going on in around something called a "domain proof".  In that, a verifier can tell if they have/have not seen a credential before by comparing with proofs seen before. However, while the value repeats for the same verifier, it is different from each verifier so verifiers can't coorelate between them.
</p>
<p><strong>phuctu1901</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 01:15:20 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran  I think a domain proof is very useful. 
I have just tried requesting 5 proof requests from 1 verifer to a user's credential. The five requests were the same, but the results were different. Can you tell me where I am wrong?
I. System:
- Aries CloudAgent Python to use API for verifier.
- Mobile Wallet.
II. Working process:
1. Creating connection between user and agent.
2. Sending proof request. (use / present-proof / send-request)
3. Allowing send proof from mobile wallet.
4. Repeating step 2,3 five times.

These are the proofs I received. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6aqbyv4vu9hyqdl/AACjgFX0DaBqF-Vtk438wQ_la?dl=0

Has anyone tried to rebuild the libindy library for iOS, lately?

I'm trying to rebuild libindy.a (for iOS) using the latest source, the current version of rust, and the latest Xcode 11. However, while it all seems to build okay, it fails on linking -- it's trying to link the mac libs instead of the iOS libs and I'm not sure why.   The relevant error message says, "building for iOS-arm64 but attempting to link with file built for macOS-x86_64"
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 11:37:03 GMT):<br/>
We just had a discussion about this on the aries-framework-javascript call 30 minutes ago. We're also having problems with building libindy for iOS. @karimStekelenburg1 and @ajayjadhav are going to look into it this week I think.
</p>
<p><strong>mccown</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 11:52:07 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra thanks for looking at this.  I think what's happening is a few of the libraries that indy requires (e.g., libsodium, libzmq, & OpenSSL) when installed as documented (brew install libsodium) don't install iOS-compatible libraries.  I just tried to add libsodium to a simple test app in xcode and got a similar message "test.xcodeproj Building for iOS Simulator, but the linked library 'libsodium.a' was built for macOS."

Hey guys just a quick question regarding the APIs in the AliceFaberAcme Demo (ACA-py Controllers Demo: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-controllers/tree/master/AliceFaberAcmeDemo)
It's my understanding that calling the "/issue-credential/send" API should automatically save the issued credential in the Holders wallet, am I mistaken? Because I'm unable to get the credentials from the Holders wallet, it's empty. 
I thought maybe I'd have to call the "/issue-credential/records/{cred_ex_id}/store" API but that gives me an error and I haven't seen that API being used in the Demo either.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 17:05:06 GMT):<br/>
No -- the send is on the Issuers side, and it does automatic stuff for the issuer. No impact on the holder. I believe there is a command line parameter that might auto-handle things on the holder side, but that is not altered by the /send endpoint.
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 04:29:55 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Oh i see, thank you for the info. I'll be looking into how to deal with it on the holders side but I'd greatly appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction. The holder has access to the credential records and the credential exchange ID, so I was hoping there was a way to use this information to save the credential to the holders wallet.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 10:31:46 GMT):<br/>
The demo auto-stores: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/703288de7c5cf48bd6c624905ca0a01d8fc3f010/demo/runners/alice.py#L41
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 10:36:44 GMT):<br/>
If the operator invokes `(1) Issue Credential` on Faber then the issuer sends a credential, which Alice agent stores in its wallet. Use `/credentials` at port 8031 to list Alice's credentials: you may have been using port 8021 which would list the Issuer's credentials (none).
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 10:47:03 GMT):<br/>
@sklump Thank you for pointing that out, I've been using postman to send requests to the Agents. I have used the correct port which is 8031 for Alice. 
So my calls have basically been,
Establish Connection:
1. 8031: /connection/create-invitation
2. 8021: /connection/receive-invitation
Issue Credential (using connection_id from previous request)
3. 8021: /issue-credential/send
Now at this point I can get the records using "/issue-credential/records" but the credential isn't present in the wallet

Could you maybe let me know where I must be going wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 10:58:16 GMT):<br/>
What's in the `/issue-credential/send` body?
One sure way to get the results you want is to run the demo on the command line with `--events` and retain the results for reproduction via Postman.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 11:15:29 GMT):<br/>
On Faber (port 8021), `/issue-credential/send` content:

@sklump I'm able to get all the records from Alice (8031) by using `/issue-credential/records`
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:42:08 GMT):<br/>
How many?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:42:14 GMT):<br/>
(About)
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:42:31 GMT):<br/>
@sklump 
I created 4 so I'm able to view all 4 records
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:42:31 GMT):<br/>
@sklump 
I issued 4 so I'm able to view all 4 records
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:43:10 GMT):<br/>
They're always failing as you describe?
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:44:07 GMT):<br/>
@sklump They don't show up in the wallet, I'm under the impression that if the credential record is available it's been successfully issued, am I wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:44:25 GMT):<br/>
Issue is not the same as acceptance
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:44:44 GMT):<br/>
There is no contradiction between issuer:issued and holder:not-stored
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:45:14 GMT):<br/>
@sklump So holder must accept this credential and save it in the wallet which is not happening in my case?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:46:20 GMT):<br/>
I cannot speculate what is happening on your end without looking at records. I am asking if it always fails.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:47:50 GMT):<br/>
If it always fails then it won't matter which one. If it does then we have to pick between the 4.
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:48:21 GMT):<br/>
@sklump I'm not exactly sure what you mean by always "fails". If you mean if none of the credentials are showing up in the wallet then yeah none of them show up. And as for the credential record, shall I attach a screenshot since it's too large to paste here?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 14:48:46 GMT):<br/>
Pick one of them and post it please

OK, the exchange is holding at `request_sent` from the issuer - can you pick one from the holder side and post that one?

@sklump This was from the holders side (8031)

ah yes, of course - can you find one from the issuer side then?

@sklump
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:06:37 GMT):<br/>
So the issuer got the request but didn't act on it. You didn't see any logs on the Faber console? They might be in red?
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:07:27 GMT):<br/>
:thinking: Give me a couple of minutes to re-check
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:08:49 GMT):<br/>
No problem - there could be a mismatch against the schema attributes too, maybe. There are so many variables.
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:20:58 GMT):<br/>

Faber      | Node is not a validator
Faber      |

```
@sklump Yeah I think this is what's causing all the mess, any idea why this is happening?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:22:12 GMT):<br/>
Well that's unexpected
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:23:04 GMT):<br/>
@sklump Btw, was creating my own schema a bad idea? Is the schema in the demo directly linked to the agents somehow?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:25:27 GMT):<br/>
The agents use the schema & cred def hard-coded for proof presentation, but there is nothing special about the demo agents as such. You should be fine creating your own ledger items.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:25:44 GMT):<br/>
"Node is not a validator" is freaky though and I don't know what it portends.
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:27:04 GMT):<br/>
@sklump Maybe I'll try to set up the agents again and see if that helps, although I've done it a couple of times already. Thanks for all your input so far though, I really appreciate it.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:28:36 GMT):<br/>
Can you run it against a von_network locally? If so, maybe the test or prod indy ledger is in a bad way.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:28:54 GMT):<br/>
"maybe" includes "maybe not" of course
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:29:09 GMT):<br/>
@sklump Alright, I'll give that a go as well :grin:
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:30:29 GMT):<br/>
Finally, if the issuer is getting stuck after the request (or any stage), you can poke the admin API's manual step to proceed from there to try again. In this case, `POST /issue-credential/records/{cred_ex_id}/issue`
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:31:02 GMT):<br/>
@sklump Alright :thumbsup:

You can use the non-secrets api to store any data you wish. Note that it isn't designed for large volumes of data.

I executed this command to start agent `LEDGER_URL=http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo webstart` and then open this swagger interface of alice `http://localhost:8031/api/doc#/action-menu`

@esune I just checked, I'm still getting the same error

<p><strong>esune</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 05:15:03 GMT):<br/>
The ledger seems fine now, not really sure. Make sure all the containers are removed before you try again.
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 05:26:28 GMT):<br/>
@esune I cleared all the containers + images and tried again, I also tried on "https://labs.play-with-docker.com/", not sure what's going wrong, I'll try again though

@amanji  I've been using POSTMAN to create new schemas and issue a credential as well, I'm facing an issue where the holder (Alice) isn't accepting & storing the credential but the credential is available in the records.

<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 06:13:06 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, the context helps. So it seems like the same issue is happening with both the Open API demo and the ACA-py Controllers demo?
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 06:16:59 GMT):<br/>
The error message is showing up specifcally in the agent container console output. From the thread could be related to credentials not being stored in recipient wallets? Were you able to resolve the issue by running the agents manually?

<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 06:19:05 GMT):<br/>
The agents use the openapi demo as a context so I'm guessing the same issue is happening there as well but I haven't checked. Honestly, I don't think there is an issue with the ledger, we set up our own agents and used the same ledger url and it's working :sweat_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 06:20:51 GMT):<br/>
@amanji Previously, all I had to do was clear all the images and containers and run everything, that let me issue the credentials and view the credentials in the wallet so I feel like there was nothing wrong with what I did but can't be certain :sweat_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 06:26:53 GMT):<br/>
I wonder if it's related to agent settings in the demos. I can't really speculate at this point unless I run the agents manually. Just to confirm you tried clearing all containers and images, which resolved the issue previously, but now doesn't.
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 06:27:47 GMT):<br/>
@amanji  Yeah previously it did resolve the issue but that was just once, it never helped after that.
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 06:31:05 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps we can try running the demos using a local instance of the VON Network? However, if the test ledger is fine I doubt a local instance of the ledger will resolve the issue.
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 06:32:30 GMT):<br/>

The non-secrets api is provided by the wallet in code, not via the REST API that ACA-Py provides.

Hello Everyone, I am quite new to Indy and Docker, just started with it. I have a doubt.  Following this tutorial I was able to start faber agent with Revocation Registry https://github.com/iaryama/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/AliceGetsAPhone.md..  I would like to know can we enable the revocation history from the controllers repo code directly by calling any agent rest api to enable it.  For starting both the controllers and agents I am following this tutorial: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-controllers/tree/master/AliceFaberAcmeDemo... But this tutorial doesnt provide any option to enable the revocation registry. How can I provide an option from controllers to enable it? Or should I have to run both the codes separately for agent to communcate with controller? What's the best approach?
</p>
<p><strong>amanji</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 15:41:04 GMT):<br/>
Hey @thearhaam so I ran the demos against a local instance of the VON Network and the error messages aren't showing up in the agent container consoles (the demo seems to run smoothly as well). I haven't confirmed whether the credentials are being stored in holder wallets so might be something you want to confirm. Check out the [instructions](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/blob/master/docs/UsingVONNetwork.md) for setting up and using a local VON Network. When you re-run the demos from the terminal you don't need to pass the `LEDGER_URL`. So simply `./run_demo webstart --logs`.
</p>
<p><strong>esune</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 15:46:42 GMT):<br/>
It must be something related to the ledger state - even if it is up it may be throwing errors for some reason. Could also try using `LEDGER_URL=http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io` if you want to try yet another option
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Fri, 11 Sep 2020 04:27:49 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @amanji & @esune I'll look into it, I appreciate all your help.

Revocation is enabled when you create a new credential definition. A credential definition will back a revocable or non-revocable credential depending on how it is created, it is not possible to switch between the two for an existing credential definition.

Hello @esune , I understand that. What I am asking is to enable revocation I only start the agent containers with this command in the aries-cloudagent-python repo:  AILS_NETWORK=docker_tails-server *LEDGER_URL=http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo faber --revocation --events*...... But when I start the controllers from this repo *https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-controllers*, it automatically starts the agens along with controllers  without revocation. I am asking, using the controllers repo can the agents that are being started have revocation enabled?

Hello everyone,
I wanted to play around with the aries sdk to use another blockchain than indy. I read about the resolver of the verifiable data registry, but I haven't found any specifications of the required endpoint yet. Is there any documentation about the protocol between the agent and the verifiable data registry or do I have to reverse engineer the SDKs?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 13 Sep 2020 19:23:28 GMT):<br/>
At this point, no one has implemented an "aries-vdri" component that enables pluggable interfaces to other ledgers.  The different frameworks support either Indy (aries-cloudagent-python, aries-framework-dotnet) or Hyperledger Fabric (aries-framework-go) and do so without a common interface.   The Indy-based frameworks use the indy-sdk.
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 05:46:06 GMT):<br/>
Aries Framework Go has implemented support for HTTP resolvers that provide the Universal resolver interface. If you start the rest agent (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/packages/69982) you can specify http resolvers with the startup option --http-resolver-url did-method@url

Hello everyone, in the Alice Faber Acme Demo, why is the public did of Alice not being created and registered on the ledger. Only Faber and Acme Dids are being created and registerd on the Ledger. This is the tutorial I followed https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/demo  Please help me understand why the holder DID is not registered on the Ledger, only Issuer and Verifier DID are registered.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 16:52:18 GMT):<br/>
With Indy Verifiable Credentials supporting ZKPs, there is no need for a Holder/Prover (Alice) or Verifier to have a public DID.  For communication purposes (to exchange messages) they have peer DIDs (non-ledger) that they exchange with one another, but for credential exchange, only the Issuer needs to have a DID on a public ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 05:09:27 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @swcurran . So having a public did to the holder is optional and if needed we can have it else not needed. But it is possible ti have public did to holder also right?

Hello Everyone, can anyone confirm in Indy while issuing the credentials, if there is a feature of setting an expiry date sort of thing to the credential issued, like after some 10 years of credential issuance, expire it. I know from the documentation what I understood and was able to implement credential revocation with a seperate api. But I am curious to know while issuing credential only we can set some sort of expiration date to the credentials. I checked the docs couldnt find any. Any help is appreciated, thank you
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 06:05:32 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK, you'd need to do that on the "application level", .i.e you could specify an attribute "expiresAt" which a verifier can ask you to disclose. However, if you care about the anonymous credentials you should make sure that the issuer issues a lot of credentials with the same expiration date otherwise this would become a good correlator.

Hello Everyone, I am trying to understand briefly how User/holder anonymity is maintained at the time of credential verification. I see that holder's wallet data is encrypted by a master key. So, is there any API that allows a user to know his wallet master key? As a response to the proof of request, I see a master_secret value in the API Response sent by the holder, what is it.? In the AliceFaber example, I see that some attribute values are revealed like name, degree at the point of verification. Only the age is kept hidden based on the predicate. So, cant we ensure complete anonymity by even hiding the other fields. Also, from my understanding, all encryption works internally work using URSA, but do we still need to do any extra enablement when running the ALiceFaberDemo for master key or anything? I haven't done anything differently. So, how does user anonymity works in here, and similarly, what is the purpose of the master key used for encrypting the wallet, in brief? Kindly help me understand these points
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 16:45:29 GMT):<br/>

Thank for your support @swcurran . I have just do a temporary method. I edited the source code of ursa to solve the above problem. Instead of generating a random variable r value to calculate a_prime variable value, I use a fixed variable r value for some cases. This approach seems insecure because it depends on the prover side and the verifier cannot know if the a_prime value is computed from a given r value. But I think this is the easiest way for a graduate project. The results are quite feasible.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 Sep 2020 13:00:33 GMT):<br/>

Hi guys! Would it be possible to create a proof in advance (since it's known what the question is) and send this proof to multiple independent agents that all want to know the same? The scenario would be, that a citizen wants to write something into a Fabric Blockchain which consists of a city consortium. The chaincodes however must validate, that the citizen is a registered, let's say taxi driver. So if the Fabric consortium exists of 3 organisations, the taxi driver's agent would need to connect and interact with all of them. It would be sexier, if she could create the proof in advance and just include it in her Fabric transaction so that each organisations chaincode can verify it directly. Is that possible or is there a smarter solution?

Selective disclosure is the property by which you can choose which attributes of a credential you want to include in a proof, and which you want to withhold. If the credential was signed as a whole, then that signature would not be valid when sharing just a subset of fields.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 17 Sep 2020 19:44:16 GMT):<br/>
The other feature the master secret provides is the ability to compose a compound proof with attributes from multiple credentials.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 17 Sep 2020 19:44:42 GMT):<br/>
If the link secret is changed, credentials issued with the new link secret value cannot be correlated with credentials using the old link secret value.

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 17 Sep 2020 19:47:48 GMT):<br/>
To preserve the privacy of the taxi driver, it is considered best practice for the driver to use a different peer DID with each connection. But this means  a different proof would have to be generated to for each verifying party.
</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Thu, 17 Sep 2020 21:09:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks esplinr!
In this case the identity of the driver would need to be public because a token will be accounted to her identity. So each time the taxi driver interacts with Fabric, the same DID needs to be used.

If I understand you correctly: when privacy doesn't need to be preserved (same DID for all "connections") and the same subset of fields has to be proofed, then it is possible to create the proof once and share it with each verifying party? I'm thinking about storing the proof itself in Fabric so that each verifying party can read the proof from the ledger without direct interaction with the taxi driver's agent (would be a bad UX if she needs to approve multiple connections for a single transaction).

<p><strong>phuctu1901</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 01:19:13 GMT):<br/>
No problem. I hope the domain proof feature will be released soon. Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 01:45:41 GMT):<br/>
You can't have the same proof shared publicly because there is a challenge-response pattern in the protocol to prevent replay attacks. So you only generate a proof after you get a proof request from the verifier.
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 01:46:12 GMT):<br/>
You can use something called verification proposals to solve this use case, which is supported in Aries .NET
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 04:50:25 GMT):<br/>
thanks @esplinr for explanation, i understood that point, but also in the alice/faber demo using aca-py agents we saw that verifer used to prepare the proof request first and then holder used to accept that request and present the attributes asked by verifier..
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 04:52:09 GMT):<br/>
i didn't found the process in any demo where holder used to generate the proof request first using selective disclosure..could you please provide some input here?
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 04:52:33 GMT):<br/>
i believe that in demo that process might have skipped.. is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 06:31:55 GMT):<br/>
Good point, thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 09:16:35 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr thanks much for the explanation, so when we say "Selective disclosure is the property by which you can choose which attributes of a credential you want to include in a proof, and which you want to withhold" is that in respect to Holder or verifier? as we know that proof request is getting generated by verifier and Holder has no control to choose those  attributes list...if  i am not wrong..
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 09:17:36 GMT):<br/>
so my question is how and at what point user can control what to share and what not to share with verifier ? could you please provide your inputs here?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 15:39:37 GMT):<br/>
That is really determined by the holder's agent. The holder can choose to reject the proof request, or can respond with a proof that is different from the one requested. Then the verifier has to decide whether or not to accept the supplied proof.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 15:40:31 GMT):<br/>
(See the Verification Proposals RFC for details on that.)

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sun, 20 Sep 2020 19:21:43 GMT):<br/>
Known attributes are those the issuer knows when signing. Hidden are those they agree to be signed but the issuer doesn’t know
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Sun, 20 Sep 2020 19:43:29 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder so you mean to say that considering name, age to be two attributes in a credential then holder might be willing to let his name be known to the issuer but not his age. So the issuer issues a credential with the knowledge of holders name but not knowing what holders age is?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sun, 20 Sep 2020 19:56:53 GMT):<br/>
The issuer has to agree to do that. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sun, 20 Sep 2020 19:57:25 GMT):<br/>
Most issuers wouldn’t do that
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sun, 20 Sep 2020 19:58:35 GMT):<br/>
In indys case they use hidden attributes to hide things like random secrets for linking credentials 
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Mon, 21 Sep 2020 03:07:38 GMT):<br/>
Ok, got it. @MALodder thank you for the explanation.

It would be rather technical discussion about current state and roadmap how to achieve those goals so I would invite everyone who is actively working on any implementation of existing components to join the call and the discussion. After the call materials would be shared here so those would not be able to join still would have a chance to provide feedback and comments. Thanks

Just a reminder about the Identity Implementer's WG Call tomorrow morning (Sep 24th @ 9am MT). This is a chance to get updates on a variety of WG calls that you may have missed this week.

Our guest presenters will be Kevin Griffin and Philip Feairheller from Scoir and they will be giving a presentation of Canis "The Extensible, RESTful Credentialing Hub".

Here are links to the Wiki and the Zoom meeting.

This question would be better to raise in the aries-rfc issues. You'll likely get a more robust discussion there. In any case @swcurran or @andrew.whitehead or @troyronda would be people who could weigh in on it.
</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 07:01:30 GMT):<br/>
He means proof proposals, which are described here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof#propose-presentation
</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 07:04:09 GMT):<br/>
If we use those proposals as part of the Fabric transaction, each endorser will have to connect to the holder and request the proposal. So there might be multiple connection requests and a lot of chatter. Isn't there a more "elegant" solution?
</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 16:59:15 GMT):<br/>
I got a lot of ideas from @rileyphughes (thx!) regarding integration of Indy and Fabric. Even though, I still don't understand it completely.

</p>
<p><strong>ldej</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 12:10:58 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 13:22:12 GMT):<br/>
@avi23 yes you can use Trinsic in production!
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 13:22:56 GMT):<br/>
@avi23 Trinsic is an Aries-level application, which means it's not used for creating the Indy layer. You can use Trinsic to connect to any indy network, including Sovrin, or you can use your own indy network
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 13:36:15 GMT):<br/>
thanks @rileyphughes so what is the recommended way to connect to indy network for any prduction level APP?  is it recommended to use https://sovrin-mainnet-browser.vonx.io/

?
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 13:36:55 GMT):<br/>
or its recommended to create a separate indy network and use thant in production?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 13:49:13 GMT):<br/>
For a production level commercial application you're going to want to look at using the Sovrin ledger networks.  They are secure, full distributed, and fully HA.  Each node on each of the networks is hosted and maintained by a dedicated Steward (a company or organization with formal agreements with the Sovrin Foundation).  A list of Stewards can be found on the [Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/) website.
- For dev environments there is [BuilderNet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_builder_genesis)
- For test/staging environments there is [StagingNet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis)
- For production environments there is [MainNet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_live_genesis)
You can register DIDs on BuilderNet and StagingNet here; https://selfserve.sovrin.org/
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 13:54:04 GMT):<br/>
I agree with @WadeBarnes that for production you'll want to use Sovrin MainNet. The only thing I would mention is that the link that Wade provided above doesn't let you write to MainNet. To do that, you can create a MainNet issuer in Trinsic, which automatically writes your DID for you to MainNet
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 13:54:30 GMT):<br/>
You can also use Trinsic to create issuers on StagingNet/BuilderNet as well
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 14:12:01 GMT):<br/>
thanks @WadeBarnes @rileyphughes so does that sovrin mainnet network provide all the things like node validators, ledger to write etc?
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 14:13:18 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 14:14:19 GMT):<br/>
`does that sovrin mainnet network provide all the things like node validators, ledger to write etc?`
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 14:15:12 GMT):<br/>
The link above for MainNet is a link to the Genesis transaction file needed for agents to connect to the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 14:15:12 GMT):<br/>
The links above contain the link to the Genesis transaction files needed for agents to connect to the given ledgers.

<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 16:18:22 GMT):<br/>
@WadeBarnes don't forget that, to write to Sovrin MainNet, you'll need to either 1. apply for a transaction endorser status with sovrin foundation, go through board approval, sign the legal agreement, etc. or 2. go through a service provider who already has an endorser.
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 16:18:59 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 11:53:56 GMT):<br/>
Hi guys, regarding the example of presenting a proof of age via the drivers licence in a bar: in theory, you have to establish a connection in each bar to the bar's agent first. Then you can start with the Proof Proposal or Proof Request.
In practice, this takes too much time. If you're in a crowded bar the first time, all that should be necessary is the barkeeper scanning a QR code from your phone and getting an instant check- or cross mark. Is that possible today with Aries?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 12:42:47 GMT):<br/>
Hi @haggis you are right that it is not always desired to make a connection before starting a proof exchange. This is already possible and generally called a "connectionless proof". ACA-Py and Aries Framework .NET support it. The current way to do this is using the out-of-band protocol (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0434-outofband/README.md) however current implementations (I think) make use of the `~service` decorator to initiate the present proof protocol without creating a connection first.
</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:24:27 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, @TimoGlastra! I read about that RFC before but didn't know it's already implemented in some frameworks due to its PROPOSED status :thumbsup:
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:41:49 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK the out-of-band protocol method is not implemented yet. The current implementations still use the "old" method using the `~service` decorator.

Hi,guys,I am new to aries,Is there a way to create agents by myself? Am I only able to do this by modifying the alice/faber demo?
</p>
<p><strong>kangme</strong> (Sun, 04 Oct 2020 07:19:27 GMT):<br/>
I find arie's docs need to be gradually improved, and it doesn't seem to be very newbie friendly at the moment.

Hey, I feel you. I have been there :) I have recently worked with a few folks to create a jupyter notebook tutorial series that should hopefully get you the knowledge you are looking for. Assuming you know python etc. https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDentity/tree/master/tutorials/aries-basic-controller
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 09:51:43 GMT):<br/>
It might be a bit rough around the edges so would love some feedback, P.Rs etc. Let me know how you get on
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 13:05:34 GMT):<br/>
I also just pushed this - https://github.com/wip-abramson/aries-acapy-fullstack-starter which uses the tools in that repo to create a full stack aries application
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 15:15:21 GMT):<br/>
The standard way to setup an agent (as much as there are standards) is to use docker/docker-compose and then write a controller app using a language like python or javascript
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 15:15:49 GMT):<br/>
@kangme I believe you already have access to examples of a docker-compose setup
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 15:16:37 GMT):<br/>
There are some other examples here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-controllers

Just a reminder about the Identity Implementer's WG Call tomorrow morning (Oct 8th @ 9am MT).  In this call, we review updates from a variety of industry WGs that you may have missed this week.

For our discussion this week, I am planning to describe some cryptographic primitives and then we can all discuss if / how they might be of use to identity.

Here are links to the Wiki and the Zoom meeting.

<p><strong>Matt-Spence</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 16:42:10 GMT):<br/>
So I'm relatively new to working with Aries protocols, and I'm working on implementing the basic message protocol from RFC 0095. The protocol doesn't call for any states, but I need to add some to my implementation to support things like threading. What do I need to do to ensure this doesn't break interoperability? I apologize if this is too broad a question, let me know if I need to be more specific
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 17:35:47 GMT):<br/>
At lot depends on what you are doing -- e.g. building a framework from scratch, using an existing one, etc.  There are three major frameworks (going on more...) that you can look at to see how things are handled -- python, go and .NET.  Threading and protocol state object handling is largely an internal concern for an Aries agent, but all implementations are likely going to be pretty similar since the state defines the protocol sequence.

It should move to active when a message is received from the other agent

Hi all: Currently I am on a project about SSI using hyperledger Indy platform, my question which is the mobile agent that you used to develop the holder part. My question is precisely what type of mobile agent I can use and which is functional Aries MAX (Aries Mobile Agent Xamarin) - Xamarin / .Net, Aries React-Native Mobile Agent (ARNIMA) - React Native or React Native Indy SDK (rn-indy-sdk) - React Native.
Thanks in advance for your help
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 10:08:40 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Nabil-oussa , Aries Mobile Agent Xamarin is the most complete of all. It uses Aries Framework .NET where most of the current Holder wallets are build on top (Trinsic, Esatus, Lissi, ...). ARNIMA isn't updated for a while and doesn't have a lot of functionality yet. Finally, rn-indy-sdk in itself doesn't provide any Aries functionality -- it's just a wrapper around indy-sdk for Android and iOS exposed to Javascript to be used in react native. You can then use rn-indy-sdk in aries-framework-javascript instead of indy for NodeJS. However aries-framework-javascript is still in development and doesn't provide all of the the basic features yes (connect, issue, verify) so for now using Aries Framework .NET (Xamarin) would probably be the easiest / most ready choice. Does this answer you question?

I answered a similar question a couple days ago: https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries?msg=Ei5QGWyGDGNy3F7yi . aries framework go doesn’t support indy based credentials (yet) and therefore isn’t interoperable with the other implementations. It really depends on your requirements

@anil_helvaci @TimoGlastra Especially for native development, there's one more option - libvcx https://github.com/AbsaOSS/libvcx/
Soon to be moved back under Hyperledger organization
</p>
<p><strong>anil_helvaci</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 12:07:58 GMT):<br/>
I work in a large defense company and we are trying to develop a ssi product. I am also a former native mobile developer. Do you think -libvcx is stable enough to build a product over it ? If not when do you think it will be? @PatrikStas
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 12:19:13 GMT):<br/>
Indeed LibVCX is still somewhat turbulent, we are building app on top of it, but ever since we forked it we did not mind doing breaking changes to clean things up. I would say it can take a few more months till things settle. However the breaking changes we did so far, for someone who is using aries (we deleted most of the legacy code from libvcx) were not that changes. Some data structures changed, but our mobile guys did not have hard times to keep up
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 12:20:45 GMT):<br/>
But for sure it's important to say, officially libvcx is not yet stable. We are bumping minor versions on releases and we do right now we do make some breaking change on almost every release
</p>
<p><strong>anil_helvaci</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 13:27:56 GMT):<br/>
All right @PatrikStas  I will be watching libvcx. Thank you for your answer

@anil_helvaci yes, we are very excited and working on getting the repos transfered over to hyperledger. So, hopefully within the next week or so you will have access to native IOS and Android aries frameworks (swift and kotlin respectively). Of which we are doing some PRs to indy-sdk where we updated the IOS wrapper which hd some issues and will be adding an Android wrapper as well

Hi! I'm working on a sample dotnet-agent, which should be able to publish a credential schema to the builder-net. It already has an issuer-DID and got tokens from https://selfserve.sovrin.org. However, when I call `await _schemaService.CreateSchemaAsync(context, _issuerDID, _schemaName, schemaVersion, schemaAttrNames)` it only throws an exception:
```
Hyperledger.Aries.AriesFrameworkException: Ledger operation rejected
   at Hyperledger.Aries.Ledger.DefaultLedgerService.EnsureSuccessResponse(String res)

   at Hyperledger.Aries.Features.IssueCredential.DefaultSchemaService.CreateSchemaAsync(IAgentContext context, String issuerDid, String name, String version, String[] attributeNames)

Do I need to publish a DIDDoc before, or do I need to become a Trust Anchor somehow?

Ah, the problem may be I haven't accepted the `TxnAuthorAgreement` yet. There's a corresponding `TxnAuthorAcceptanceService`. And I tried to auto-accept the agreement by adding `builder.AcceptTxnAuthorAgreement();` to `Startup.cs`. However, this ends in a weird `System.ArgumentException: 'Cannot marshal: Encountered unmappable character.'`. Any idea how to accomplish this?

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:06:07 GMT):<br/>
There are several open source implementations in the Aries frameworks.  It's a messaging spec that operates at a higher level than a transport running on DIDComm, so it is not just a simple HTTP Request/Response protocol.  It allows for negotiation and different credential types, particularly ZKP.  Several Aries frameworks implement it for Indy ZKPs, but others do not.  V2 of the spec (a later RFC -- 453, I believe) removes the final Indy-isms in the protocol.

any aries framework implementation (the python cloud agent or .Net or whatever), is there code that exists right now that implements say this REST interface (the spec seems to have moved under me in the past few days)? https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-http-api/

<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:27:07 GMT):<br/>
or is this an "exercise for the reader" kind of thing?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:34:59 GMT):<br/>
if it helps, we're engaged in a project where we need to interop with other teams and the W3C standards have been picked as "lowest common denominators" and we're trying to go about planning for how to do that.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:35:10 GMT):<br/>
which is the motivation of the question
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:36:31 GMT):<br/>
Simple answer no.  Any Aries framework implements an interface to allow a controller (business logic) to control an instance of the framework.  Together the instance of the controller and framework are an Agent.  The interface exposed is different per Aries framework -- e.g. .NET is a library embedded in the controller, ACA-Py (Python) and aries-framework-go expose a REST API for the controller to use.   The framework's all send ping the controller when something happens ("Hey, I received a message for this protocol you started") so that the controller can tell the framework how to respond.  As such, as a basis, all of the frameworks expose to the controller an interface to execute the whole protocol, which is more complex than a simple request/response.

That said, some frameworks expose a simplified API endpoint to let the framework handle the whole protocols in some default way.   For example, ACA-Py has a `credential-issue/send` endpoint that says "Send this credential to this connection and let me know when it is done".   That is close to what the simple Issuer HTTP API is that you are talking about.  BTW -- I don't think it is a "W3C Issuer API".  It's talked about in the CCG, but is not a W3C standard.

Finally, because DIDComm is inherently async messaging, a synchronous "request/response" HTTP protocol is not going to work in some (we think a lot) of use cases.  But that's a deeper topic.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:40:18 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran okay, oh wow.  I guess I was way off then in my understanding of various topics but thanks for that that answer.  I think I understand now and thanks for the clarification as to where that lives (the specs and organizations all get kinda confusing for me).  Hmmm.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:41:50 GMT):<br/>
In light of that answer, if you were working on a project where you wanted to use Aries but were required to interop with other teams who might not being using did methods that were based on Indy and DIDComm how would you go about it?  I guess I assumed that "request/response" protocol was the lowest common denominator but maybe I'm wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:42:58 GMT):<br/>
would you build a middleware instead for the workflows you wanted to support or is there some other kind of generalizable protocol one could use to do that?  Or is DIDComm that protocol and I just don't understand it yet?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:52:12 GMT):<br/>
If you want to use Aries, you definitely need to understand the tao of DIDComm.  I'd then look at the interfaces exposed by the frameworks to see what they do out of the box.  Then I'd be looking at what the other teams are doing and hence what flexibility you have. Chances are an API could be built from what the other team is doing to the Aries agent with minimal effort.  It might be done in the framework, or as a controller that "wraps" the framework.

Tough to answer beyond that.  :-)
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:53:35 GMT):<br/>
roger, that's what I figured.  Okay, well I'll dig back in then.  Thanks for your help!

@daidoji We have a separate project that built a service exposing the CCG VC HTTP API using aries-framework-go. See here: https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-service/blob/master/docs/vc-rest/vc_interop_api_impl_status.md .

</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 19 Oct 2020 18:12:06 GMT):<br/>
and I was at the step "The ledger browser should refresh and display the four (4) transactions on the ledger related to this DID:" however, I only found one transaction on the ledger

Hello, a lot of you are probably at IIW but I was wondering if anyone could help with my problem above from yesterday.  Still having trouble with it.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:19:34 GMT):<br/>
@AdrienViolet @c2bo that's right. aries-framework-go (including the mobile binding) discussions take place in #aries-go
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:00:22 GMT):<br/>
Were you running in Docker or browser?
</p>

@ianco
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:08:00 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran in docker.  Whole thing worked perfectly up until the step I got an issue on (then there were issues afterwards)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:08:53 GMT):<br/>
Just ran it in the Browser (Play with Docker) and everything worked to that point -- the 4 transactions and the API call.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:08:59 GMT):<br/>
OK - I'll try on docker
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:12:46 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Thanks, I appreciate it. (also thanks for the course, its really great as a refresher)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:13:06 GMT):<br/>
@daidoji regarding the ledger browser refresh, sometimes there is a delay between when the transactions are written to the ledger and when they are visible in the browser, you can try waiting and refreshing the ledger browser
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:13:28 GMT):<br/>
Tried on Docker (running on Linux) and all worked
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:14:18 GMT):<br/>
You can also try running against a local ledger vs the BCovrin ledger, I don't recall if that's covered in the specific tutorial you're doing
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:15:06 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran hmmm must be user error then.  From that particular error do you know where I probably had the issue?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:15:09 GMT):<br/>
Since Faber creates the schema and credential definition on startup, they *should* be there on the ledger, or else you'll see an error message in the Faber startup screem
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:15:14 GMT):<br/>
@ianco roger, will try that.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:15:26 GMT):<br/>
I didn't see any errors that stood out but I'll try again
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:16:24 GMT):<br/>
the most straightforward way to test it out is to run locally, as described here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/demo#running-in-docker
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:16:40 GMT):<br/>
This just starts Alice and Faber connecting to a local ledger
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:17:08 GMT):<br/>
If this works then there's no reason why it shouldn't work connecting to BCovrin ledger as well
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:17:17 GMT):<br/>
roger, yeah that one worked for me.  I was just following the instructions in the edx course by connecting to the BC ledger.  I'll try with a local ledger though.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:20:32 GMT):<br/>
Are you behind a firewall?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:39:58 GMT):<br/>
ianco, nothing that should be blocking those ports.  Also, what confused me is that I have that one ledger entry http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io/browse/domain?page=1&query=WgWxqztrNooG92RXvxSTWv&txn_type=

but not the other three.  If it were a firewall wouldn't all of them have failed?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:41:56 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:42:11 GMT):<br/>
Remember that Faber generates a new random DID every time you run it
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:42:56 GMT):<br/>
If you look here for example:  http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io/browse/domain?page=3854&query=&txn_type=
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:43:19 GMT):<br/>
... you can see the NYM, schema and cred def created by `U4mivYzDaDbRGvcCVvrtVp`
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:49:20 GMT):<br/>
roger, that def looks like the lab said it would
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:49:48 GMT):<br/>
Probably the test that @swcurran  just ran
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:50:13 GMT):<br/>
@ianco okay, I'll try again.  Likely there was some kind of user error on my part or some fluke I guess.  Thanks for your help.  These labs are incredibly informative and useful other than this small issue.

Hello all! I am having trouble understanding the Action Menu API usage for aries agents. Where might be the best place for me to post my questions?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 18:40:14 GMT):<br/>
how do we find out what did methods the various Aries implementations support?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 18:42:27 GMT):<br/>
did:sov and did:peer, but are there others?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:07:02 GMT):<br/>
aries-framework-go currently supports out-of-the-box: did:peer, did:key and configuring a DID resolver URL (called httpbinding).
you can also inject your own VDR implementation
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/tree/master/pkg/vdr
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:08:00 GMT):<br/>
We've tested the httpbinding against several additional DID methods.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:08:22 GMT):<br/>
e.g., did:sov, did:v1, did:elem, did:web
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:08:25 GMT):<br/>
ahh, what does VDR stand for?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:09:09 GMT):<br/>
We've also tested injecting our own DID method code in our builds (did:trustbloc).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:09:25 GMT):<br/>
VDR = verifiable data registry
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:09:51 GMT):<br/>
ahhh, cool.  Do the other Aries agents have similar features or is that constrained to your agent so far?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:12:32 GMT):<br/>
Many of the aries projects started by building on top of indy libraries...
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:13:13 GMT):<br/>
(so afaik many of the projects are currently for Indy).
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:13:36 GMT):<br/>
ahhh, haha that's what I thought.  The Go agent leads the way then
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:14:30 GMT):<br/>
I'm new, but I've learned enough to ask 1. What does the spec say 2. What does the Aries RFCs say 3. Which RFCs have been implemented in which agents haha
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:17:10 GMT):<br/>

@george.aristy  @sudeshrshetty Thank you, importing the cert in Firefox did the trick!
However, now when I run #2 of the demo (executing receive-invitation at Bob Agent), I get this error as a response:

The focus of the community has been on identity.  There have been lots of discussion about what we need in wallets, and for the early use cases in identity, cryptocurrency capabilities have not been high on the list.  I think there is an expectation that it will eventually come ("this my one wallet"), but that bridging is not seen as a priority.

I see, thanks your explanation, I think DID integration to public blockchain networks (including support for smart contract transactions) is exciting topic, hope this topic will have more priority in the future :)

Hey guys, had a question regarding Trinsic Studio.
I'm guessing that "Organization" is basically an Agent, am I right? Also is there any way to dynamically create organizations by calling an API? or the only way to create an organization is through Trinsic studio?

Question about Sidetree:
Aries aims to be blockchain agnostic. While the Python and .NET implementations of the Aries agent frameworks are dependent on Indy, the Go implementation is using Sidetree.
Which role does Sidetree play in a broader sense? Are the Python and .NET implementations also aiming to use Sidetree in the future, or are they planning to go a different path?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 26 Oct 2020 12:53:51 GMT):<br/>
@etaleo The Go implementation is compatible with multiple DID methods. You can inject a VDR into the framework or use the HTTP binding configuration to connect to a DID resolver service.
</p>
<p><strong>etaleo</strong> (Mon, 26 Oct 2020 13:05:28 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda Oh, that's interesting! Can you guide me to the responding documentation (if it exists) or location at the source code?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 26 Oct 2020 14:04:47 GMT):<br/>
@etaleo When you instantiate the framework, you can use the WithVDR function to inject: https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/pkg/framework/aries#WithVDR
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 26 Oct 2020 14:04:52 GMT):<br/>
The "httpbinding" VDR allows you to use a resolver endpoint: https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/pkg/vdr/httpbinding#New
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 26 Oct 2020 14:06:23 GMT):<br/>
If you are using the docker image, you can pass an environment variable to set the http binding endpoint. e.g., https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/master/test/bdd/fixtures/agent-rest/docker-compose.yml#L22

Hey everyone,
in Kiva’s session at IIW “Verifiable Photo and attachments in Aries” @cam-parra  we had a short discussion about *credential gallery images* that can be displayed in the mobile wallet app.
To be clear, I’m not talking about verifiable (holder-specific) images as credential attribute but credential-specific (usually not holder-specific) images to improve the user experience (e.g. picture of a driver's license.).

The way I found out, the currently available wallet implementations do not support this feature or have/plan to implement a proprietary mechanism for that. In our opinion this is an important feature that should be part of an RFC to promote interoperability. We (Lissi) think the best way to implement this feature is to add an attachment (e.g. credential_image~attach) to the credential offer message.
- should this be an optional part in the RFC 0036 issue-credential?
- Is there already a discussion on this topic somewhere?
- what do you think?

Hi everyone, I'm just starting on SSI and Hyperledger Aries. I've read the docs and followed two online courses on edx, but things are still quite confusing! I'd like to make a POC with a mobile agent, but can't find a good tutorial on how to do it. Is there some "practical" resource on the topic? Also, to develop a mobile agent is it necessary to use the Xamarin framework? I looked up the agent-framework-javascript repository, but it seems to be in a very early stage of development. Can it be used for a POC to demonstrate the basic functionality of a SSI application (connection, request credential and present proof)? Thanks a lot in advance for any reply!
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 17:55:26 GMT):<br/>
It is not necessary to use Xamarin, but that is the only codebase that exists in HL repos at this point. I do know there are multiple parties very close to open sourcing some mobile code.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 17:55:53 GMT):<br/>
Given that, your direction may depend heavily on how patient you can be for those codebases to be released.

You can use a commercially available mobile app (Trinsic, Lissi, Connect.me, etc.) if the proof of concept doesn't need to include the actual development of the mobile app + cloud agent. You can do the "AliceGetsAMobile" demo using any of these, I think. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/AliceGetsAPhone.md Dunno if that's what you're hoping to do, but it definitely covers the basics.

Hi, I am building an identity solution for my school and we want it to be following a common standard that is universally verifiable. I have a few questions, will be great if I can get a response - 1. Does using Indy also mean I am compliant with w3c VC standards? 2. We are planning to go ahead with sov which provides me with a did of type sov, should I be looking at aries implementation? 3. When Indy too has a concept of channels authcrypt and decrypt etc. Is there a reason why I should look at aries? 4. Can I monitor the transactions of did type sov in the Indy scan net?

I'm having trouble wrapping my head around DID resolution:
As far as I understand, agents need some kind of resolver, and resolvers need to know how to resolve various DID methods, as there are a bunch of different ones that should all be interoperable.
Does every resolver know every possible DID method? How is it decided which DID methods are valid/supported? Where and how does resolving happen exactly? (Locally on the client? Remotely on a trusted 3rd party?)
And how, for example, would one add a new DID method (e.g. a new, custom blockchain) to the mix?

I'm thankful for any answers and resources regarding this topic, both from a high level / theoretical view and from a technical view!

>Does every resolver know every possible DID method?
no, I don't think so, however projects like "Universal Resolver" have that goal in mind I think https://dev.uniresolver.io/

>How is it decided which DID methods are valid/supported?
I think this is decided by the implementing team of the client agents and resolving agents.

>Where and how does resolving happen exactly? (Locally on the client? Remotely on a "trusted" 3rd party?)
Depends on the did method I think.

>And how, for example, would one add support for a new DID method (e.g. a new, custom blockchain) to the mix?
Would have to get the method added to the spec (not sure how that process works but I think you just have to submit some forms somewhere.  In your own agent you could just resolve things yourself.

>Would one need to implement custom resolving support for every relevant agent in the wild?
Not sure, maybe people with better knowledge can answer this one.
</p>
<p><strong>etaleo</strong> (Fri, 06 Nov 2020 20:45:36 GMT):<br/>

So, is there something like an "official" / "chosen on" list of "valid"/"accepted" DID methods? (The ones listed here? https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods)

> In your own agent you could just resolve things yourself.
So, then my own agent would be able to resolve the DID.
Isn't it more important that the agent of the opposite party is able to resolve the DID? So - in order to add support for a new DID method, would it need to be somehow integrated into the official Aries github repository? (And every agent implementation therein?)

Which role does the Universal Resolver play exactly?
https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/

Is it planned that this is *the* way to resolve DIDs across various Aries Agents?
(If not, ) how is DID resolution planned to be handled in general, given there are numerous different DID methods?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 17:13:53 GMT):<br/>
The expectation right now is that an agent might have one or several resolvers full implemented locally, including at least one with write capabilities -- e.g. an issuer would have write access to the ledger to which it anchors the verifiable credentials it issues. The local resolvers might be tied to a single ledger (e.g. Ethereum) or a type of ledger (e.g. Indy networks -- work has started on that).

Where a local resolver is not available for a given DID to be resolved, the agent would have options (a) do nothing -- I don't support it and don't trust it, (b) use an instance of an external 3rd party universal resolver and resolve it that way.

</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:02:32 GMT):<br/>
is it just a failsafe check or is this `_cdll()` doing something?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:19:58 GMT):<br/>
It preloads the DLL to check that it is actually found: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/bafa3bbcca2f7ef4cf5ae2aca01b1dbf7286b924/wrappers/python/indy/libindy.py#L131
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:20:49 GMT):<br/>
but is that necessary?  Shouldn't the OS do that when called?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:21:21 GMT):<br/>
It would but then it might blow up later when it's first used
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:21:27 GMT):<br/>
(assuming its installed correctly? and LD_LIBRARY_PATH and whatnot?)
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:21:42 GMT):<br/>
Indy loads it lazily on first use
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:22:24 GMT):<br/>
hmm, so how would it blow up?  If it wasn't installed correctly?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:22:59 GMT):<br/>
Usually because the python wrapper was installed but not the separate DLL
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:23:32 GMT):<br/>
so python3-indy doesn't install the DLL?  Its just a wrapper around that dll?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:24:10 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:25:26 GMT):<br/>
oh okay, so its necessary to install libindy as a separate step to use `python3-indy` and `aries-cloudagent`.  (sorry to repeat the same thing so many times just trying to make sure I get it right)
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:25:48 GMT):<br/>
I guess from that repo I got the idea that I could `pip install aries-cloudagent` and be up and running
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:26:03 GMT):<br/>
but then the docker demo images looked a lot more complicated so I knew I was missing something
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:30:43 GMT):<br/>
It should be possible to do some things without installing Indy, but not use an indy wallet or credentials

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:30:43 GMT):<br/>
It should be possible to do some things without installing Indy, but not use an indy wallet or credentials, which the demos rely on
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:31:30 GMT):<br/>
oh, what could I do without an indy wallet or credentials?  Just make p2p connections with other agents?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:31:59 GMT):<br/>
Yes, pretty much, some other protocols like basic message

</p>

Another question, if I create a local-did with `wallet/did/create` in aca-py and then try to get the endpoint `wallet/get-did-endpoint` why isn't the endpoint set in the response when I set it at wallet provisioning via the `--endpoint` argument?  I seem to be getting `null`
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 21:08:54 GMT):<br/>
There's a repo here with a few sample controllers: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-controllers/tree/master/AliceFaberAcmeDemo

Hello ! I'm looking for a solution to integrate Hyperledger Aries into a Flutter mobile project. I see there's only a Aries Framework - .NET available (for Xamarin). (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries) 
One solution would be to integrate native (swift-IOS, Java-Android) libraries and write mappers to Flutter but I couldn't find any native libraries too. (Native iOS/Android developer would actually have the same question). 
Do you forsee any solution for native apps? Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 12 Nov 2020 14:38:04 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>louisdedecker</strong> (Thu, 12 Nov 2020 15:04:08 GMT):<br/>
cool thanks @TelegramSam . I actually wondered if we couldn't export native ios/android libraries from a Xamarin project in order to leverage the .NET code.

Hi, I am trying to run my own Indy network on a Ubuntu 16.04 ec2 instance using Indy SDK. This has created 4 nodes that runs in a separate VM. I have now created a steward and one trust anchor (Faber college) and I have on-boarded Alice. How do I now use the Aries agent and launch the APIs on top of the Indy structure I have built? I am trying to use ACA-Py. Kindly do help with any documentation? @swcurran - Kindly do assist us here.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 17 Nov 2020 14:44:42 GMT):<br/>
The `demo` folder has lots of information on connecting and using an indy network.  In short -- you need to get the pool genesis file from your Indy network and pass that as an argument to the ACA-Py instance, which will use it to create an internal "indy pool" through which it communicates with the network.

Would anybody like to present any topic during today Morning Aries Call and co-host the call? The plan  for today was to discuss:
-  a bit about proposition for cleaning up a bit Aries RFCs (introduce better structure to the specs - currently from dev point of view it is a mess),
- Update about work done in Aries Toolbox / Acapy in the context of the Digital Immunization Passport project and integration with Data Stores for storing the data.
unfortunately due to illness I am not operative today and won't be able to join. Please let us know if you would like to use that call to pick any of the topic and help lead the call otherwise we would need to cancel today call.

Hello, I can't seem to find a way to initiate a issue-credential operation from the holder. I am using dotnet libary with the xamarin mobile agent. I am using this RFC https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0036-issue-credential as my reference when asking this question. The RFC states that there are two ways for Holder to initiate issue-credential protocol: 
1) Holder sends proposal 
2) Holder sends request
There is no method about propose-credential in the ICredentialService interface of the dotnet library and CreateRequestAysnc method states that the credential has to be in the state "offer" in order to create the credential request. My question is this; How can we initiate a issue-credential process from the holder using dotnet library ?

I haven't been able to attend the Aries WG calls recently, but I have been reviewing the agendas and sometimes the recordings. For the discussion of AIP 2.0, we should focus more on what user scenarios  we want to enable instead of a laundry list of RFCs and features. Why does supporting the suggested RFCs matter to adopting organizations and people?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 18:51:45 GMT):<br/>
This is the same discussion from the session we had on this in Provo, and I'm good with continuing that.  Do you have a proposal?

But regardless of that, RFCs in AIP 1.0 have evolved and have been replaced by other versions (or other RFCs in some case), so even if we keep the same scenarios as were defined in Provo, AIP 2.0 will have have new RFCs and versions.

Hello experts, I have a generic question, I am not sure if this is the right place to ask about it. In Verifiable Credentials, how a VC is correlated with an entity like a user? I read about Blinded Linked Secrets? but I could not find a lot of information about it anywhere? I am really surprised that such proving ownership is not talked about a lot in the documentation s and the W3C standards? Am I missing something? Does Hyperledger Indy have a different method for VC ownership? is there a documentation i am missing that explain those concepts?

Hi.
I was working for a solution, where I need to present proof from xamarin mobile agent to aca-py through out-of-band protocol.
There is already issued credential in my mobile agent issued by aca-py.

Then I provided the requestPresentationMessage and requestedCredential to 'CreatePresentationAsync()' in Dotnet framework. 
Now the issue that I am facing is that, the CreatePresentationAsync is hitting the following error while running.

Hi.
I was working for a solution, where I need to present proof from xamarin mobile agent to aca-py through out-of-band protocol.
There is already issued credential in my mobile agent issued by aca-py.
For presenting proof, I have created out-of-band invitation from aca-py and copied the response from which I derived the requestPresentationMessage.
Then I provided the requestPresentationMessage and requestedCredential to 'CreatePresentationAsync()' in Dotnet framework. 
Now the issue that I am facing is that, the CreatePresentationAsync is hitting the following error while running.
"An unknown crypto format has been used for a DID entity key."

Hi.
I was working for a solution, where I need to present proof from xamarin mobile agent to aca-py through out-of-band protocol.
There is already issued credential in my mobile agent issued by aca-py.
For presenting proof, I have created out-of-band invitation from aca-py and copied the response from which I derived the requestPresentationMessage.
Then I provided the requestPresentationMessage and requestedCredential to 'CreatePresentationAsync()' in Dotnet framework. 
Now the issue that I am facing is that, the CreatePresentationAsync is hitting the following error while running.
"An unknown crypto format has been used for a DID entity key."

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 14:52:58 GMT):<br/>
@ianco - can you give guidance?  We need to get this added to the instructions  -- it's being hit regularly.

@Nabil-oussa -- what instructions are you following to do the installation?
</p>
<p><strong>Nabil-oussa</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 14:56:54 GMT):<br/>
Thank you very much, I follow your recommendation and I was successful this step by using these commands, pip install windows-curses and 
pip install python3_indy
</p>
<p><strong>Nabil-oussa</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:00:16 GMT):<br/>
1. using Python 3.8.6, 2.pip install aries-cloudagent, 3. pip install windows-curses, 4.pip install python3_indy
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:02:13 GMT):<br/>
I was wondering if you were using the instructions here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/DevReadMe.md#locally-installed
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:02:54 GMT):<br/>
Looks like that is where we need to add the guidance about this: `pip install windows-curses` and
`pip install python3_indy`
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:05:01 GMT):<br/>
Or should aca-py be specifying all of it's dependencies more explicitly so they are installed automatically when aca-py is installed?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:06:42 GMT):<br/>
But that might cause issues with other image assembly/build processes.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:07:37 GMT):<br/>
For now we'll add the docs, and later look at the dependencies.
</p>
<p><strong>Nabil-oussa</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:11:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes we need to add this guidance

I propose that we add Layer 2 peer DID support to AIP "next". This would require impls to parse DID docs but not to implement the synchronization protocol that allows peer DIDs to be updated. It is one step more sophisticated that did:key because it allows multiple keys and multiple key types. @telegramsam and @swcurran Are we having a community B call this coming Wed before US Thanksgiving? If yes, let's discuss then.

You can ask this in the #aries-framework-dotnet channel as well, but I don't think the propose credential protocol is supported in the dot net library. 

However I know that the propose presentation protocol has been implemented

Hi Bazalel -- thanks for the note.  The material is about 8 months old at this point, so it's reasonably up to date, but things are definitely changing.  But I think the core of the material is reasonably current with what is happening today -- but things are starting to change!  AIP 2.0 is being talked about, BBS+ Signatures, and evolution of frameworks.

I think Evernym said it'll be fully open sourced in 3 years' time. But it's on the "glide path" towards open source. I think it's still a commercial offering right now. Having said that, I'm also curious about this and would love to hear from someone at Evernym about it.

Verity is a Verification / Issuance platform built on Indy and Aries. The commercial product is a SaaS offering, and the source code is a ull solution, rather than a framework, more like Aries

Hi, I finished the Aries Developer course yesterday and I am just getting started with Aries development. I see that there is no java-sdk right now. Do you know whether there are people interested in having a java sdk?

I was given the assignment at the last Aries WG to generate a PR (or document) to start the discussion about what should be in AIP Next. I've done that initially as a Google Doc and plan on leading a discussion about the document and it's comments at the next US Afternoon Aries WG Call. For those that want to take a look ahead of that to prepare their "discussion points", the link to the document is below.

Please read the initial section of the document so you have a bit of context of what's in the document and what I've already done.

Enjoy!

I have a general question in regards to the state of the development tools and the general purpose of the different frameworks. as fair as I understood the frameworks should (ideally) support all Aries protocols that are defined in Aries Interop Profiles. is this assumption correct or have I missunderstood that?

if I am right -> is this currently the case for one of the existing frameworks? is there any matrix where we can see which frameworks supports which protocols defined in the AIP ?
</p>
<p><strong>marc0olo</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 21:25:17 GMT):<br/>
I am just wondering what aspects should be covered within the framework (key management, storage, didcomm, ...) and which not?

where e.g. do you see all the features and protocols being implemented? in separate, (hopefully) pluggable libraries or within the framework?

I see that e.g. some protocols are implemented in this repository: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx

ok I see the .NET framework supports a lot of features. so I guess it is desired to have that all covered by the framework which leads me back to my first question: is there any compatibility matrix to see what features and protocols are covered by each framework?

Sorry, I don't understud you
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:08:54 GMT):<br/>
just a joke. Why you are looking for alternative?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:08:54 GMT):<br/>
never mind, just a joke. Why you are looking for alternative?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:10:14 GMT):<br/>
and what do you mean by von-network with indy? von-network is indy
</p>
<p><strong>GuilhermeFunchal</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:10:39 GMT):<br/>
Is the von-network not used to develop?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:12:00 GMT):<br/>
the one which you are probably using is meant for  demos and development. Is the easiest way to bootstrap a test net for development afaik
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:12:14 GMT):<br/>
so you are looking for something more production ready, is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>GuilhermeFunchal</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:12:42 GMT):<br/>
Yes, exact
</p>
<p><strong>GuilhermeFunchal</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:13:10 GMT):<br/>
What would be more appropriate?
</p>
<p><strong>GuilhermeFunchal</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:15:01 GMT):<br/>
Do you have any reference for me ?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:16:05 GMT):<br/>
You could easily build production network out of the examples of von. Basically is just matter of bootstrapping nodes and configuration.  If you assume that you would control all nodes then should be relatively simple.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:18:10 GMT):<br/>

This might be slightly out of topic but I am trying to connect the dots as good as good as possible. I know that following initiatives exist which I consider most relevant in the SSI space:
- W3C Credentials Community Group
- Hyperledger Aries
- Dezentralized Identity Foundation
- Trust over IP Foundation

I am currently figuring out how all these initiatives are related. I know that different working groups of the decentralized identity foundation are e.g. working on specifications for different topics and also provide some reference implementations. Can we expect that everything (or most things)  specified in W3C and DIF working groups will eventually be reflected in Aries RFCs and then be included in new Aries Interop Profiles?

Would be happy to get some background about all the initiatives. Maybe there is some diagramm that describes how they are related?

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 16:31:11 GMT):<br/>
@marc0olo that is a good question, and constantly evolving somewhat.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 16:32:21 GMT):<br/>
We lack a good map in the larger community, but I can give you a summary as it relates to Aries.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 16:36:32 GMT):<br/>
Aries work requires advancement in a few areas. That work has generally started within Aries, and has often moved to a different group as interest grows. DIDComm v1 born in Aries has led to the DIDComm WG at the DIF, working on v2. It is the intent of the Aries community to adopt and migrate to v2 as it becomes ready.
Similar is the advancement of governance frameworks. ToIP is now focusing on that, and Aries will lean on any associated work there. W3C has the DID spec (obviously a dependency) and the Secure Data Storage WG, which is Orthogonally related.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 16:44:33 GMT):<br/>
My view -- 

* W3C Core specs for DIDs and Verifiable Credentials. Also does some development of other specs. to be standards.
* DIF -- development of other specs to be standards for Decentralized Identity -- DIDComm, Presentation Exchange, Storage. 
* Trust over IP -- a way to formalize technical and governance stacks for "Trust" related ecosystems -- for example, FinTech, Education Credentials, Gov't ID, etc.  For example, Aries might be a tech stack within ToIP.  Note that the ToIP incubates the stacks, and then an ecosystem would have it's on Foundation/organization to maintain the standards -- templates for building ecosystems.
* Aries -- Open Source implementations that define and use protocols to enable working code.
</p>

did I miss any important initiative/group in my list?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 17:33:55 GMT):<br/>
I probably think that the DIF list should include KERI.  There are more organizations, but in this style, I might be tempted to add MyData.

I'm searching for DID/VC agent implementation not dependent only on Indy ledger. I found two projects currently : 

* Hyperledger Aries Framework Go : https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go 
* Uport DID Agent Framework : https://github.com/uport-project/daf

Verity has plan to support other ledgers(blockchain) next year.

are there any other options? welcome any advice, comment, hint :)
My need is not to be locked in Indy ledger..

The Identity Implementer's WG is meeting tomorrow morning (Dec 3rd @ 9am MT / 4pm UTC).  In this call, we will review updates from several industry WGs, which you may have missed this week.

For our presentation, Nicole Khor (Anonyome Labs; University of Queensland) will present a part of her research, which includes integrating SSI technologies with existing browser-based authentication protocols (e.g., WebAuthn).  She will talk about browser integration, protocol requirements, etc.

Here are links to the Wiki and Zoom meeting:

Hi, can anybody help me debug me run alice-faber demo please? I run into this issue : ```Faber      | aries_cloudagent.ledger.error.LedgerConfigError: Exception opening pool ledger default: Error: Invalid library state
Faber      |   Caused by: Ledger merkle tree is not acceptable for current tree.
```
I understand that this caused by genesis-file mismatch. Now, I am running my indy ledger and von network webserver using von-network docker container on my host machine which gives me 0.0.0.0:9000 for webserver and fetching the genesis file from there, returns me nodes and clients having ip 172.17.0.1 which is standard for docker containers. Now, I want to run the alice faber demo and then find out a way to set GPIO pins on my beagleone black which has a gateway 192.168.6.1 and can be ssh'ed into throgh 192.168.6.2. So, I setup the aca-py installation and run the demo, using GENESIS_FILE=~/local-genesis.txt  LEDGER_URL=http://192.168.6.1:9000 LOG_LEVEL=debug DEFAULT_POSTGRES=true python3 -m runners.faber --port 8020 . Also, I edited the local-genesis.txt to replace 172.17.0.1 with 192.168.6.1. Now, using this setup I get  Caused by: Ledger merkle tree is not acceptable for current tree error and by using GENESIS_URL=http://192.168.6.1:9000/genesis LEDGER_URL=http://192.168.6.1:9000 LOG_LEVEL=debug DEFAULT_POSTGRES=true python3 -m runners.faber --port 8020, I get indy pool timeout error. (this shouldnot work as it will connect with the local docker 172.17.0.1 of beagleone black, not with my host's 172.17.0.1). So, I'm stuck here, not being able to run the demo. Any help will be appreciated.

why would alice be able to post to the faber agent?  I think that's a manual step in the demo.

Hi there, I recently found this chart on compatibility --> https://hackmd.io/t1cotiReTXCnkpDG8k2tVA#LEGEND there the table lists "VC Creds" (LD-Proofs, VC-JWTs, AnonCreds, BBS+) to my understanding after reading the W3C conformance section (https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#conformance) the correct naming should be "proof mechanism".

Hi everyone. I know that Indy wallet is single threaded and has limitations if there is a need to process more VCs at the same time. But has this been solved in Aries? 
</p>
<p><strong>Bezalel</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 02:39:08 GMT):<br/>
I have this question too, as an Aries newcomer. I think Evernym Verity, recently open-sourced (free only for small-size project though), is implemented using Scala Akka framework (distributed actor model) to solve the scalability issue of Aries 'Agents'. In my understanding, scalability issue of Aries Agent should be looked at from two perspectives : 

1) one (enterprise) cloud agent handling large volume of DID/VC processing in parallel 
2) large number of 'mediator/relay' cloud agent per end-user(mobile agent), new OS process per an agent seems not viable for achieving Agent scalability

can existing Aries frameworks address these scalability issues? (especially I'm curious about Aries Go and Rust implementation)
</p>
<p><strong>ultimo2020</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 05:52:53 GMT):<br/>
Hi Bezalel. Great that we are on the same page here. What I am also interested is exactly like you said, is handling large numbers of cloud agent processing. I have seen some queuing addons to evernym to try to solve this, but the question is the same, which and if they can, Aries frameworks can solve those important issues that enable large scale applications to be built?

@Bezalel I have the same question. I'd prefer to develop app in native code instead of coding in xamarin but I am not sure if aries-go is usable for mobile
</p>
<p><strong>marc0olo</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 10:08:25 GMT):<br/>
what I personally would like to see is a compatibility/feature matrix for the different SDKs. it's really hard to figure out which SDK supports which protocols and VDRs

in regards to the mobile agent I discovered in the notes of the recent group meeting call that their is a pending contribution of GlobalID for swift and kotlin frameworks. I already asked about the state of these in the chat
</p>
<p><strong>marc0olo</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 10:36:06 GMT):<br/>
@Bezalel I know the question was about production level deployments (which I don't know) - but if you search a mobile implementation using the go bindings you can take a look at this example: https://github.com/trustbloc/aries-examples

Thanks swcurran. Will check it out. Maybe another topic, is there any other online work to facilitate the security in the Custodian cloud wallets? Fot an example separation of the storage for the private keys, offline mode for signing transactions with private keys and maybe multiple signing?

BTW - reread your message and the DIF group is more on the separation of the agent from the storage, vs. all being housed together.  It might cover offline storage but not certain and I don't think (but might :-) ) cover multi-sig.

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 07 Dec 2020 22:21:25 GMT):<br/>
Only mention I’ve seen of it is an issue in the DIDComm repo, where they mention channel teardown: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging/issues/81. But this was closed without stating the reason, so maybe this is not that helpful 🤷‍♂️ 
</p>
<p><strong>marc0olo</strong> (Tue, 08 Dec 2020 09:16:40 GMT):<br/>
my head is currently struggling to understand how pairwise or n-wise DIDs (peer relationships using did:peer) can be combined with anywise DIDs? the main question I have is how can I present a proof of a VC that is e.g. linked to a public DID method in a peer relationship - if this is possible at all?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 08 Dec 2020 10:24:13 GMT):<br/>
Depends on how subject authentication is achieved
- IndyCreds typically don't use DIDs for subject authentication. You get a proof in a "DIDcomm channel", but subject authentication is done via a link secret
- I guess (not sure) in LD VCs as used in Aries Go you transport a whole VP in the DIDcomm channel. The DIDcomm channel could be associated to another DID than the VP (@troyronda ?)
</p>
<p><strong>marc0olo</strong> (Tue, 08 Dec 2020 11:37:41 GMT):<br/>
thanks @domwoe, I just found this publication which describes that scenario also quite well: https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/How-DIDs-Keys-Credentials-and-Agents-Work-Together-in-Sovrin-131118.pdf

it would be interesting to know how this is achieved for LD signature based VCs or if it is currently possible to achieve the same behavior using those
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 08 Dec 2020 15:38:44 GMT):<br/>
It would be possible to present a credential issued to one DID over a pairwise channel using another DID, along side proof of DID ownership for the subject DID.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 08 Dec 2020 15:38:52 GMT):<br/>
That's never been designed, but is possible.

hi ， regarding Aries RFC 0075: Payment Decorators, I tried to write a process using it. I don’t know if this understanding is correct.
1. In merchant website, user confirms a VC order and selects preferred payment method.
2. Merchant website display a QR code with credential-offer message(with payment decorators--~payment_request). 
3. User uses mobile wallet to scan The QR code.
4.  mobile wallet creates  connection with merchant, and then, mobile wallet deals with credential-offer message which has  payment_request included. Mobile wallet call the corresponding payment application for payment.
5. The payment application prompts user to authenticate,   complete payment process, and sends the payment result back to the user’s mobile wallet.
6. Mobile wallet generates the credential request message with ~payment_receipt included. 
7. The merchant confirms the payment result from ~payment_receipt and creates credential.
8. The user’s mobile wallet receives the credential ,verifies and stores the credential.

Hi guys, a very amateur question here. If I would like to use the ACA-PY framework (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python) to build an agent controller, where should I write the code for the controller? I saw the demo directory containing some files such as Alice.py which is basically the controller code, but if I want to build my own controller and set up my own agent, how should I get started?

It should be possible to use it as cloud wallet agent eventually. Yesterday I connected to the Sovrin StagingNet with this framework from React Native app. The same functinality should be available also on the backend side with Node.js.

My expectation is that Aries Credential Exchange V2 protocols (RFC 0453/0454) will enable using appropriate credential/presentation types. DIF PE looks very promising for the "Present Proof".   I've not really looked that much at CHAPI, but I think it is more a transport layer below DIDComm.  For OIDC so far, we've only used it via a VC IdP that talks OIDC flow between the PR and the IdP, and the IdP uses Aries protocols to talk to the Wallet.

Looking at that spec again, I find it strange that the constraints are in the form of a JSON path (with options for different formats) and not written as RDF relationships to the credential or the subject

hi there! I'm doing the LS173x course and trying to run this demo: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/demo#run-the-alice-and-faber-controllersagents -- I skipped the step of running the VON network (actually because I wasn't able to run it successfully, and gave up the struggle of installing the python dependencies -- now it complains about plenum)... I tried to run the docker image of the von-webserver too, but I was getting init errors on docker logs... anyway, since its optional I just skipped... but it seems that the command `python3 -m runners.faber --port 8020` actually relies on port 9000 throwing the error: `aiohttp.client_exceptions.ClientConnectorError: Cannot connect to host localhost:9000 ssl:None [Connect call failed ('127.0.0.1', 9000)]`

That is a dependency on von-network. In addition to running a 4 node Indy network, von-network runs a Network Browser web server for that Indy network that is exposed on port 9000 of your docket host. When the Alice Faber demo starts up, it uses the web server to get to the genesis file for the Indy Network.

von-network and all of these are designed to run using Docker. They can all work outside docker, but you have to reconfigure them and run into many challenges that are not helpful to the goals of getting going with Aries.  Using docker, it usually takes about 2 minutes to be running an Indy network, with most of that time spent downloading artifacts from the Internet.

Hi all, I've been reading the LFS172x course contents about Agents and the cloud agent model using ACA-Py. In addition, I've tested the demos available on the official repository and I understand how it works for the simple architecture presented of three agents (Alice, Faber and Acme), running the agent and the controller in different ports. But, what about if we create an application that provides a service and we have 1000 users, so there will be 1000 agents. Each user will need to launch their agent or the application may have an agent instance on a port on which each user can connect and perform different agent tasks or some different mechanism? The question arises because the user application (controller) is separated from the agent instance in the demo, and I would like to see how a real application could be implemented without making the user launch the agent instance. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>newdev42</strong> (Mon, 28 Dec 2020 14:42:36 GMT):<br/>
hi Alberto, I believe each user will have their own agent in their mobile wallets, or cloud agent etc.
</p>

(I might be wrong since I'm studying as well)
</p>
<p><strong>newdev42</strong> (Mon, 28 Dec 2020 14:43:02 GMT):<br/>
you as a web service, will have only one agent, eg. Faber Agent
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 28 Dec 2020 16:15:06 GMT):<br/>
If now have 1000 (or a billion) Alice agents that are mobile agents, you don't have a problem -- each is on their own device.  You would need a mediator to serve those, but a single mediator can serve many mobile agents.

If you do want to have 1000 Faber (or Alice) agents running in the cloud, the concept of a multi-tenant wallet was just implemented in ACA-Py. With that, you have one scalable instance of ACA-Py and as many wallets, one per agent in a single data store.

Thank you @newdev42 and @swcurran. What I can understand from your comments and from what I read in the course it's the following, you can use Go and .NET frameworks to have the agent in the mobile device (as you both say), but it's not the case, so I'm focusing in the Cloud Agent Model (HTTP API using ACA-Py). If we extend the AliceFaberAcme demo to have 1000 Alices and I develop the application (controller in IP:port) for 1000 Alices, does the following make sense?

- Faber: 1 agent / 1 controller (as in the demo)
- 1000 Alices: How many ACA-Py instances? (agents) / 1 controller (I'm not sure)?
- Acme: 1 agent / 1 controller (as in the demo)

As @swcurran comments in the second paragraph, and probably is what I'm looking for, I guess the multi-tenant wallet needs Alice's signature and mine, right? Could be the best solution to my approximation?

Thank you very much and sorry if I'm asking naive questions.

I think that depends on how you measure it.  ETH and BTC are probably more likely to be along in the long run because of their multi-purpose uses but those of us here think that identity centric ledgers and private ledgers have enough going for them that they'll be an option too.

Something will eventually gain hegemony I bet (a la TLS and oauth2 federations being largely implemented in the same stacks) but the whole point of Aries and even Hyperledger Indy is allow those that need to run their own public/private chain to be able to do so.

Hello, I'm working on Credential Revocation. Everything is working fine, am able to Revoke the Credentials and the status changed to '4'.
I have two questions.

1) On Issuer side, the Credential Status is 4 (Revoked), but on Holder/Prover side, it's still 3 (Issued). Why?
2) When Verifier Creates a Proof Request, I also added the `Nonrevoked` Time Interval. Like normally, Prover sends a Presentation Proof response, and the credentials verified normally. Why?

```
NonRevoked = new RevocationInterval
{
	From = 0,
	To = now
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 14:58:42 GMT):<br/>
Revocation is a unilateral act by the issuer, and there is no notification to the holder -- that would have to be a separate step, and there is talk of an Aries protocol to do that.
</p>
<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 14:59:52 GMT):<br/>
But if I want to update the Holder, that his/her credentials are revoked, then how will I achieve this?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:01:54 GMT):<br/>
Not sure about the example you are trying and what went wrong.  One thing you should do is change the interval to `from=now()` and `to=now()`,  The semantics of interval is very tricky to understand.
</p>
<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:03:45 GMT):<br/>
`var now = (uint)DateTimeOffset.Now.ToUnixTimeSeconds();`

<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:05:18 GMT):<br/>
which Protocol is used to update the Holder Credential State?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:05:49 GMT):<br/>
Re: intervals -- see this: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation#proof-of-non-revocation-intervals
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:08:36 GMT):<br/>
Currently, there is no protocol to update the Holder Credential State (AFAIK).  This protocol has been proposed - -https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0183-revocation-notification, but is not implemented.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:09:31 GMT):<br/>
One of the wallets (estatus, I believe) is checking the ledger to see if a credential has been revoked and flagging it.  It is their own implementation, and AFAIK, no other agent is doing that yet.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:15:28 GMT):<br/>
Yes --multi-tenant wallets are what you want.  That feature has recently (this month) been added to ACA-Py -- without a lot of docs.  The Alice-Faber demo does support the multi-tenant option, so you can look at that code to see examples.  More docs to come...
</p>
<p><strong>RazaDen</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:17:31 GMT):<br/>
Hello everyone! Is it possible to use Aries SDKs to do credential issuance and revocation without going through the ledger? I believe this relates to the whole correlatable vs uncorrelatable credentials discussion. If we look at simple use cases, such as the password-less login on a web site, I believe this makes sense. In this case, the "web site" owner gives you a credential for logging in to her web portal after you perform some kind of registration step etc. Hopefully my description makes sense. Can we do this with Aries SDKs or we need to develop it on our own?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:20:02 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand what you mean.  If the website is the issuer and the verifier, you can just use DIDComm without verifiable credentials if you don't need to know anything about the user and just need to verify it's the same person each time.
</p>
<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:20:06 GMT):<br/>
thanks for helping. I'm looking into aries .net framework to see if they added anything to update the holder about revocation, but seems like nothing is done yet. any idea of how I can achieve it (with already available protocols?)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:22:49 GMT):<br/>
You can add a function in the framework to have the holder check the ledger to see if the credential is revoked.  We've added that in ACA-Py. But it would basically be a polling solution, or a check-before-using -- not ideal.  Basically, you have to call the indy-sdk function to get the revocation state for the cred-def on the ledger and check if the credential you have has been revoked from that data.
</p>
<p><strong>RazaDen</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:23:57 GMT):<br/>
Well, now that you put it that way it makes a lot of sense Stephen. Which DIDComm protocol could we use for that? I guess for the "registration step" we scan a QR code with a connection invitation to connect to the website's ACA-Py agent. Then, when a registered user wants to login, I guess the website displays a QR code with an OOB and checks whether it has a connection with the user's agent or not? If yes, the user can login? Am I on the right track?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:32:35 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  Using OOB, the user's agent would respond with the "reuse" message.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:36:11 GMT):<br/>
Another idea I've had for this is that the site could issue the user a credential from the site (so you would need credential handling and ledger) and put a unique id in a cookie to the browser associated with the account. On return to the page, the service would see the cookie, find the account and send a proof request to the user for the login.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:36:40 GMT):<br/>
In theory, this could be done without a VC, but there has to be something that the user sees and responds to on their phone/agent.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:37:08 GMT):<br/>
Off-hand, I don't know a non-VC way to trigger that.
</p>
<p><strong>RazaDen</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 16:04:51 GMT):<br/>
This is an interesting thought exercise. Maybe it would be better to come up with a protocol, based on top of standard Aries messaging, to implement this use case. I think that via simple signatures and typical challenge-response we can make this work pretty well. Like, when the user registers on the website, the user gets back some kind of digitally signed token of some form that can be used as a type of "login credential" (not in the VC sense). Then, when a registered user wants to login, the website and the user (via their agents) do a challenge-response flow where the user has to prove that he was "issued" a token by the website. The website checks its database to see that the "login credential" of the user has not been revoked (for w/e reason) and acts accordingly. Seems like that would work :slight_smile:

basically I cannot find the method in libindy to create a credential-proposal in the same way I found the create credential-offer for example

</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 11:18:03 GMT):<br/>
The proposal is an optional part of Aries RFC 36, which came about after libindy, to accommodate the possibility of the (prospective) holder initiating the interaction as some systems might do. Indy does not use a proposal; the issuer always initiates. Since there is nothing cryptographic in the proposal, there is no need to visit libindy nor its libursa cryptographic library; e.g., https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/2bcb075dc7f2d27a91234df5a15acc191eb971d9/aries_cloudagent/protocols/issue_credential/v1_0/messages/credential_proposal.py#L23

Hi @all. I'm new here and to Aries. I'm following this https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/AriesOpenAPIDemo.md. I'm trying to establish a connection between `Faber` and `Alice`. I've executed `/out-of-band/create-invitation` from Faber successfully. Also executed `​/out-of-band​/receive-invitation` from Alice successfully. But I'm now stuck here. I've tried executing `/connections/{conn_id}/accept-invitation`  from Alice with conn_id from previous step unsuccessfully. It seems I'm missing something. And from the look of it, it seems the documentation is out of date. Any idea how I can proceed from here? Thank you in advance. FYI: I'm running everything in docker in my local machine.

To sum up, I don't understand where to include the examples provided in the RFC since in the OpenAPI I don't see anything related to sending data. Can someone guide me on where to find a complete example or how and where to include the examples of the RFC? Thank you very much!

where it gets dumped on key `request_presentations~attach` because https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/04613473a993518aea9d8e024d7318e0583d92c7/aries_cloudagent/protocols/present_proof/v1_0/messages/presentation_request.py#L65

Thank you @sklump. From what I can see in the code (probably I wouldn't be capable of integrating it in an application because I don't understand really well the code and I don't know if I need to import this code in my agent or something similar (sorry because I'm learning how Aries work in many aspects...)) and in the examples. The attachment is included in the presentation, so it's supposed to be small data like images or some kb of information, no? What about transferring more than 100mb of data, it is possible using Aries? It is better to consider alternative methods? From what I've read in the RFC doc I think so, because there are several privacy and security considerations, and probably the protocol is not prepared for such quantity of information. Thank you very much!

Hey @albertobr, this repo contains an example of a basic attachment protocol that can be used to send images. https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDentity. See libs/attachment-protocol for the code and tutorials/attachment for a notebook demo using it to send  an image (or any file) between two agents. Not tested file sizes though

Hey, I have been going over some literature on attribute based credentials which I consider aries/indy/ursa to be an instantiation of. It seems to me there is a clear divergence in the way pseudonyms are handled. Specifically the literature discusses being able to generate pseudonyms from the link secret and supports optional scope-binding (one pseudonym per a given domain) and key-binding (proving that the credential(s) you present have the same secret as the one used to generate the pseudonym you are known by) (See https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01470502/document section 3). Whereas aries uses peer DID's based on a public/private key pair. Have there been any discussions around this, I couldn't see any rfcs covering it. I am especially interested in how scope-binding can be achieved. Thanks

A few questions regarding https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core
- What is the controller property in the verification method and why does it need to be there? (Why is the top level controller property not "sufficient"?)
- How exactly is the controller property in the top level did document used? Can they change the whole DID document of the subject? (Only when they provide an authentication (?) verification relationship?)

Hi, I'm trying to modify the AcmeDemoWorkshop from: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/demo/AcmeDemoWorkshop.md, specifically the line: `"requested_attributes": { f"0_{req_attr['name']}_uuid": req_attr for req_attr in req_attrs }` (which I don't understand quite well), but I want to use the forms proposed here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/175. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but when I do the following change in where I only want to verify the name in the proof as a requested attribute (same thing as the OP in the issue):
`"requested_attributes": { f"0_{req_attr['name']}_uuid": req_attr for req_attr in req_attrs }`
into:
`"requested_attributes": [ { "name": "name", "value": "Alice Jones" } ],`

It sounds like you don't have a good handle on how Indy works.  You might want to take a look at how Indy works -- what goes on the ledger and what goes to the credential holder and verifier.

Perhaps check out this course -- chapter 1:

Hey! I am new to all the SSI components using blockchain. I have taken up the course "Introduction to Hyperledger Sovereign Identity Blockchain Solutions: Indy, Aries & Ursa" on edx and now I am more interested in working on an actual project, i am possibly thinking to develop the transcript verification system shown in the demo. But i am little confused about how should i proceed. Do i need to know about how to build a blockchain like bitcoin/ethereum or any decentralised app or i can start with indy and aries right from the beginning? Also can someone guide me on how. do I actually start coding the software on my own? What resources can i refer and what programming knowledge would i require?

Have people read this - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9031545? Seems to me there are some misunderstandings/misrepresentations of the crypto. Especially around commitments to link secrets being decryptable at some point in the future. That said the proxy forwarding of proofs seems feasible under the current stack. Without linkage between a pseudonym and a presentation through the same secret what assurances does the Verifier have that the ZKP proof was generated by me and not my friend?

No -- definitely not.  Start at the top of the stack -- building applications for digital identity/trust over IP.  Understand why the ledger is there, and how to use it -- but no need to know how it works, unless (a) you really, really want to, or (b) you want to contribute to building the ledger.

<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 16:28:13 GMT):<br/>
Interesting, you understand correctly I think. So in the current implementation the keys used in did exchange are created from the link secret. And do all presentations of credentials also prove that the link secret within the credential is the same as the one used to create the key for the did? It is not clear to me that this happens, but would be great if it does

</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 16:33:51 GMT):<br/>
Right, from what I understand F(link secret) -> key pair.

the key pair is associated with a did.

Presentations are signed with that key pair.  If someone compromises the key pair they could compromise that particular conversation, but if your friend holds the link secret they should be able to generate more key pairs that you can use to make sure they hold the link secret.

Although I am still interested in the question: Does the hyperledger stack prove binding  between DIDs used for DIDComm and credential presentations?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 17:42:06 GMT):<br/>
@wip-abramson One challenge with answering your final question is that there are many Hyperledger stacks, and they use different credential technologies and DID methods.

I will speak to Hyperledger Indy, which is the Hyperledger Indy stack I know best. But my answer won't be accurate for Hyperledger stacks that use Ethereum and public DIDs for VCs, for example.

What is embedded in a Hyperledger Indy ZKP-oriented credential, at issuance time, is a Pedersen Commitment (you can study these on Wikipedia) to a link secret. This is NOT an encryption of the link secret. Nor is it a key derived from the link secret. The commitment is represented by the formula g^x*h^r in a modular field, where g and h are generators, x is the link secret, and r is a randomly chosen blinding factor.

When a credential is used later, part of the proof is to show that the holder of the credential knows the link secret. This is done by generating a new numeric expression that derived from the same link secret as the commitment in the issued credential. The original commitment is not simply revealed; rather, a mathematical relationship between the unrevealed commitment in the issued cred and the new expression chosen by the holder is proved.

This binds the holder to the credential on the basis that the holder knows a secret that only the holder of the credential is supposed to know. This is quite similar to binding the holder to a DID in the credential (a technique that ZKP-oriented credentials support but that is rarely used because it adds no extra value). The similarity is that binding to DIDs is also based on knowledge of a secret -- the private key of the DID controller.

In addition to the crypto of the actual proving, in Hyperledger Indy (all vendor stacks I know of) and most of the other Hyperledger stacks, the whole proving conversation takes place over DIDComm. This means that the prover has ALSO used authenticated encryption to prove that they are the owner of a DID. The net effect is that the prover is simultaneously bound to the credential(s) by link secrets, and to the relationship with the verifier by DIDs.

HTH
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 18:14:57 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman oh thanks, that's a very helpful explanation.  (even though I wasn't the original queryer)
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 19:47:15 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Daniel, this is great and your rebuttal of the paper I linked is very thorough. Much appreciated.

I actually know the cryptography behind privacy ABC's relatively well and am very much an advocate/admirer of what has been achieved in Indy over the years.

I am just a bit confused about how DIDs in DIDComm diverge from pseudonyms in the literature. Pseudonyms are generated from the link secret as a commitment, they can be provable bound to a credential. I.e this nym you know me by was created from the same link secret as the secrets in the credentials I used to create the proof I am presenting. They also include mechanisms that ensure a link secret can only produce a single pseudonym per defined domain.

DIDs in DIDComm are (I think) created from a key pair. Is this associated to the link secret as @daidoji mentions. I didn't think they were. These give you authenticated encryption but it is not entirely clear to me how they achieve credential or domain binding features.

So in theory I could establish a connection using DIDComm using secrets in my wallet, but forward proof requests to a friend and respond using a proof they generated for me.

I recognize this is hard and you discuss it in detail along with mitigations in your write up.

I am more interested in the decision to move away from pseudonyms, because both credential binding and domain binding as described seem like useful features that are not obviously possible today.  Or maybe I am still missing something.

Thanks

I got everything working and my aries cloud agent deployed on my beaglebone and communicating with the host machine cloud agent and sending it sensor values. Now, I want to test the performance metrics of Aries Communication Protocol and Hyperledger Aries vs current communication protocols(MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, Matrix etc.) and blockchains (Public & Private). Can anybody help me with existing research in benchmarking Aries using Caliper or provide links that may help me. Any existing connector to Caliper?

Hi, it is probably a simple question but I cannot find a clear explaination on it. That is, in VC context, what is the different between a schema and a credential definition? Do we need both to create a credential?
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Fri, 15 Jan 2021 09:49:13 GMT):<br/>
A schema defines the structure of the credential, it's attributes & name. Wheras a credential definition is a public key enabling a specific entity to sign credentials based on the schema. One schema can have many cred_defs. I.e. many different entities can issue the same schema using their own unique issuance key.
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Fri, 15 Jan 2021 09:49:32 GMT):<br/>
I also always find this useful to actually see what these things look like on the ledger - https://indyscan.io/txs/SOVRIN_MAINNET/domain
</p>
<p><strong>George_Sujarae</strong> (Fri, 15 Jan 2021 13:05:50 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the explaination...and is it also possible for a credential definition to contain many schemas too?
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Fri, 15 Jan 2021 13:26:38 GMT):<br/>
No. A credential def is a public key for a single schema. It is possible for presentations to contain attributes from multiple credential schema. To verify public keys (cred defs) for each schema would be required.

Hi, can someone help me understand the need for mediators? What are the advantages of using a mediator over a relay (besides herd hosting)?

For mobile wallet apps, mediators are needed as an endpoint for the mobile app, as you can't have a public endpoint on a mobile device. The mediator is also used to queue the messages for a mobile wallet when the wallet is offline.

A few questions regarding https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core (again, with an additional question)
- What is the controller property in the verification method and why does it need to be there? (Why is the top level controller property not "sufficient"?)
- How exactly is the controller property in the top level did document used? Can they change the whole DID document of the subject? (Only when they provide an authentication (?) verification relationship?)
- How would you realize a scenario in which multiple controllers may only act *together*? (As far as I understand, every controller listed in the controller property may act on its own)

Hi Team, I have one question would like to have your suggestion, if I want to build one multi-tenancy agent which can create one wallet for one entity(Company/Individual/Thing), whether ACA-Py is one option I can choose? As I know ACA-Py is proper for an enterprise agent which only service for one entity. So any idea? Thanks in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 14:56:54 GMT):<br/>
@lijiachuan I think multi-tenancy is being worked on in acapy and already exists in real world deployments.  #aries-cloudagent-python can give you more details I'm sure.

Hi all, @swcurran,  we are working on Credential Level feature. For which we want to add an attribute in Schema. We have some concerns:
1) Is adding more and more attributes in schema a good idea? Talking in sense of Scalability.
2) Of course, the levels will be updated with time-to-time, is doing transactions (adding, updating) makes a load on ledger?
3) And or these things stores directly on ledger? or just in wallet?
Thanks

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 22:51:44 GMT):<br/>
Using that as a prerequisite to being issued a credential is two transactions, which I think is OK.

<p><strong>mailgourav</strong> (Wed, 20 Jan 2021 09:38:29 GMT):<br/>
All, trying to do some performance testing credentials issuance with revocation registry size as 50K, It is taking approx 3 mins just to create the Credentials Definition and then 5 mins just to issue a single credential. So it is too slow. But with no revocation registry credential issuance is almost immediate. I am using  aries-cloudagent:py36-1.14-1_0.5.1 and using 4 node Indy VON Network from https://github.com/bcgov/von-network. Wallet database being used here is SQLLite only. The CPU and memory utilization are all with in the limit, don't think it has any thing to do with infra. Any pointers on how to optimize this ?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 20 Jan 2021 15:31:25 GMT):<br/>
Schema are written once per version to the ledger, so the size and number of versions is not really a concern (assuming the number of versions is relatively small in production -- e.g. changing over months or years).

The actual issuing of credentials has very little load on the ledger -- reads to get the materials by the parties that haven't cached them, but nothing goes on the ledger as you issue.  They are only stored in the wallet.

Revocations do go on the ledger, but they can be done in bulk, so in many use cases, there is one per day (for example) vs. continuous.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 20 Jan 2021 16:36:40 GMT):<br/>
@wip-abramson : You are correct that current practice is to derive the DID value from a keypair, and to derive the keypair entirely from entropy in a SRNG. So today, it would be uncommon to have a mathematically provable relationship between a DID value and a link secret.

However, deriving the keys of a DID from the link secret has *also* been explored (in conversations in Hyperledger Ursa). The conclusion of those conversations was that this binding could be done with only minor changes to the ecosystem. The DID controller/holder would have to modify how they create DID values, and anybody who wanted to know that the DID controller they're interacting with also knows a particular link secret would have to ask for proof of that fact -- but the basic protocols and data structures would remain the same.

Because this was the conclusion of the exploration, we chose to make the stronger binding a roadmap feature rather than build it right away; we think we can introduce it later without a lot of pain.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 14:48:40 GMT):<br/>
It shouldn't be: use `max_cred_num` in `POST /revocation/create-registry` request body. 1000 is the default. Note that tails file creation is expensive and increases with the rev reg size. You may be able to find a larger size you can live with.

We think 10 to 20k is about the max you want to do.  Note that when you run out, ACA-Py automagically rolls over to a new registry and creates a new one, so there is no delay in issuing.

@george.aristy : This is a question about the conversation you and @TelegramSam and I have been having re. did:key, extensions to did:peer, and the key-wrapping mechanism that you proposed in your recent PR. After our conversation this last Wednesday, I feel that some of the concerns you are raising need to be discussed with the authors of the did:key method, because they appear to invalidate some of what that method purports to solve. So either they should be alerted and need to address the concerns in some way, or there are aspects of did:key behavior that you and I may not be understanding fully. I think I could get the attention of Dave Longley (who I believe is the main inventor of did:key) and/or Manu Sporny (the method's more visible public proponent) to schedule such a meeting. Do you feel it would be helpful? Also, I believe you were going to write up a summary of your concerns? Have you done that? It might help frame such a discussion in an efficient way...
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 20:47:58 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I haven't put my concerns in a GitHub issue yet. I will try to do so over the weekend.

Do I feel it would be helpful? I don't know - I'm skeptical. I really think the problem is self-evident. But I'm willing to have a quick call about it.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 20:49:44 GMT):<br/>
I did contact Manu and the team at Digital Bazaar, but really didn't get far.  There was a bit of back and forth and then the chain stopped.  We didn't get to it being an issue or not, or whether there was an approach or not.

expected to be the new NIST-approved draft... but perhaps I'm missing
something?

>I'm skeptical. I really think the problem is self-evident.

 I understand the way that the mathematical transformation in the Edwards curve has allowed a short-cut in our thinking, where a single key can express all the state needed for every possible verification method in a DID doc. What I don't understand is why Sam's PR doesn't solve the problem. It should be possible to declare a secp256k1 did:key, expand the DID doc per its spec, and produce something that doesn't make sense for encryption, only for signing -- but then override the nonsensical encryption key by adding an additional key value that's an encryption key of a different type.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 22:49:27 GMT):<br/>
Try it with P-256.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 22:50:56 GMT):<br/>
I also dispute this:

> expand the DID doc per its spec

The `did:key` method is under-specified.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 22:51:54 GMT):<br/>
Forget about all tribal knowledge you may have acquired while talking with folks. Just take the text in the spec and try to apply it to P-256, or even secp256k1.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 22:55:41 GMT):<br/>
Can anyone point to normative text in `did:key` that explains in detail the rules of expanding an identifier into a document?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 22:56:00 GMT):<br/>
There isn't any. This is all there is: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/#create

</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 22:56:59 GMT):<br/>
We have an example showing an Ed25519 key inflated into a did document with its corresponding X25519 key. There is no requirement that the X5519 key needs to be included there.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 23:05:36 GMT):<br/>
did:key may not have enough in the spec, but it has lots of recognition and agreement in many places that it's a Good Thing.   We know it's incomplete, but use that good will to make it better.

Hi All, currently the credential schema is only defined for its claim name, but for each claim's value, I am not sure whether there is a way to define some rules like the value only can be a date type value, number or string. Whether all of this validation needs to be handled from application level.

And in real work, if one authority created a new credential schema, how others would know there is a new schema which they can use to create new credential definition, is there any recommendation?

Thanks.

The credential exchange record gets removed unless `preserve-exchange-records` config setting says otherwise. The credential exchange record tracks the progress of the issue-credential protocol.

The credential belongs at the holder, not the issuer: this is the crux of self-sovereign identity. In case of regime change and revanchism, for example, the issuer must not have cryptographically provable evidence of credential issue.

<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Mon, 25 Jan 2021 14:42:36 GMT):<br/>
thanks @sklump , but the credential is also one asset related to the issuer, right? So how issuer should track their issued credentials, and how they revoke it if they didn't have a record in issuer's system, is that one record out of the wallet?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 25 Jan 2021 14:57:26 GMT):<br/>
The issuer is expected to keep a record of the issuance in their system of record -- e.g. the controller.  The wallet is not the best place for that.  

As well, it's not the credential that gets deleted from the issuer, but rather then credential exchange record -- the protocol state object that tracks the sending of the messages in the issue credential protocol.

And...using start up parameters, the issuer can choose to delete the record after successfully issuing, keep the entire record of the issuing, or keep a minimal amount of data about the issuance.  The latter is a good choice when revocation is being used, and the issuer can reference the credential exchange record when revoking a credential.
</p>

Current practices about data types are enumerated here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0036-issue-credential#encoding-claims-for-indy-based-verifiable-credentials

There was some work done in a couple of other places to improve this ("Rich Schema" and "Overlays"), but I think the future direction is much more likely to be towards JSON-LD and layered on that (perhaps Overlays -- not sure).

The Indy approach is that the schema are on the ledger, visible to all and best practices would be to look first at existing schema before publishing a new one.  Going the direction of JSON-LD in the future, the model is the same, although the lack of publishing on the ledger makes that more challenging. Things like "schema.org" become a possible home for schema.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 25 Jan 2021 22:48:32 GMT):<br/>
What is the controller property in the verification method and why does it need to be there?

It allows for explicit stating that a key is associated with a separate controller. This allows for greater fine grained authorization systems which become of greater value in ocap models.

I believe this is only used in certain methods as a way for the VDR to check whether a particular proof submitted to the VDR to update the DID Document is authorized to perform the update. The only method I've seen relying on this property has been veres one and I think Orie may have dabbled with it in element.

> How would you realize a scenario in which multiple controllers may only act together (e.g. by 66% majority rule)?

> What is the controller property in the verification method and why does it need to be there?

It allows for explicit stating that a key is associated with a separate controller. This allows for greater fine grained authorization systems which become of greater value in ocap models.

> How exactly is the controller property in the top level did document used? 
I believe this is only used in certain methods as a way for the VDR to check whether a particular proof submitted to the VDR to update the DID Document is authorized to perform the update. The only method I've seen relying on this property has been veres one and I think Orie may have dabbled with it in element.

>Can they change the whole DID document of the subject?

yes

> How would you realize a scenario in which multiple controllers may only act together (e.g. by 66% majority rule)?

It looks like you manually changed the second issuer DID based on how similar in entropy it is to the first one. If this is the case then the keys won't match and signatures will be invalid hence the ledger operation error. If you actually did generate this you might want to look at your source of entropy when generating keys because getting that much entropy matching is highly suspicious.

This is my favorite one: http://toc.cryptobook.us/

It covers the basics of everything you'd expect in a graduate level crypto course and does a good job of expanding on the basics to apply to modern day crypto. Here's an associated course to go with the book as well: https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/courses/OnlineCrypto/

@george.aristy I agree that did:key lacks in its description, but it goes a long way in keeping consistency without the requirement of defining a new identifier which is what appears to be proposed. In general I've had the greatest success getting Manu, Dave's, and Dmitry Z's attention by opening a PR and then emailing them about it to get a review. I'd suspect if you wrote up a PR that would likely move the ball forward more. At least then you don't have to define your own bespoke format that would only be supported by the Aries community and would introduce a point of contention in the future.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 11:32:49 GMT):<br/>
The goals of the AFGO project w.r.t. crypto and AIP 2.0 are:

* allow use of NIST curves and algorithms, beyond Ed25519/X25519
* separate authentication keys from key agreement keys

We'd also like AIP 2.0 to be agreed upon within a month or two.

I suspect lobbying for some changes to `did:key` will syphon significant time and energy that will delay those goals.

I submitted a very simple proposal that fixed the issues and that requires minor tweaks to existing implementations.

I've another question for you, as u've worked on OSMA. 

Do u have any idea how to connect the mobile app (aries .net xamarin app) with multiple issuers on different servers? I mean mobile has to accept credentials from issuers running on different servers (different IPs).

I have a running server with a mediator and issuer, both running on different port and mobile can accept credentials from that.

Now, I add another issuer on different server (different IP), mobile can establish a connection with this new issuer server, but can't accept credentials as it returns `An unmapped error with the code '307' was returned by the SDK.`.
</p>
<p><strong>paul.bastian</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 17:57:09 GMT):<br/>
Whats the requirement/motivation for new curves? Aren't the 25519 curves cryptographically way stronger and more trustworthy than the NIST curves?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 18:07:09 GMT):<br/>
@paul.bastian, many government actors (especially the US gov't) have contractual requirements to only use NIST curves.  There have been no public attacks against say p256 or the other NIST approved elliptic curves but the internet community trusts the 25519 curve because of potential NSA shenanigans in the creation of the NIST approved curves https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519#History
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 18:07:35 GMT):<br/>
Although 25519 is a NIST approved draft (and should be fully certified any day now as far as I'm aware)
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 18:12:53 GMT):<br/>
and its probably a good instinct to be able to switch stuff in and out in case some breakthrough happens the community wasn't prepared for

<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 18:32:37 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog @TelegramSam @swcurran how did you guys envision this would work in V2?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 18:32:52 GMT):<br/>
A proposal or an idea must have been drawn up somewhere.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 19:36:44 GMT):<br/>
I'm also a bit confused here - are folks really pining for `did:key` specifically, or just generally DIDs to encode the keys?
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 19:36:54 GMT):<br/>
I assume it's the latter but would rather ask to be sure.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 19:37:06 GMT):<br/>
So for instance would a `did:peer` DID work?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 20:45:41 GMT):<br/>
`did:peer` serves a different purpose.  With `did:key`, you provide a public key (and maybe two if needed) and you do string manipulation to do a transformation to a DIDDoc.  With `did:peer` you define a DID identifier and a complete DIDDoc containing whatever you want -- but most importantly including a DIDComm service endpoint.  You can't just swap one for the other.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:37:20 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran you didn't include that thesis in your comments to @TelegramSam 's PR to extend `did:peer` here: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/peer-did-method-spec/pull/26
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:37:52 GMT):<br/>
Still - `did:peer` are not required to have service endpoints.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:38:20 GMT):<br/>
No but they can.  `did:key` cannot.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:38:25 GMT):<br/>
Method0 of `did:peer` is deliberately just like `did:key`
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:38:46 GMT):<br/>
Right, but useless for DIDComm.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:38:51 GMT):<br/>
Nope.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:38:58 GMT):<br/>
OOB messages have a serviceEndpoint.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:39:10 GMT):<br/>
We can encode that information in the DID itself.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:39:18 GMT):<br/>
We shouldn't go half-way here.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:39:26 GMT):<br/>
DIDs all the way!
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:39:32 GMT):<br/>
Isn't that what folks want? :)
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:40:07 GMT):<br/>
It's actually how DIDComm v2 works from what I saw.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:40:16 GMT):<br/>
The only thing left outside the DID are the routing keys.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:42:13 GMT):<br/>
The troubling thing about `did:peer` is that work on `initial-state` has stalled: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/peer-did-method-spec/issues/24#issuecomment-760476523
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 23:05:38 GMT):<br/>
definitely just generally DIDs to encode the keys. Not did:key only.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 23:12:49 GMT):<br/>

Hey, is the eventual goal to break down indy-sdk and move components of it under aries? Will anything stay under indy-sdk? Seems to me the architecture discussed here is misleading by not mentioning libindy which actually is the glue that binds everything together. https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/05/14/announcing-hyperledger-aries-infrastructure-supporting-interoperable-identity-solutions

1 is more or less right, but it's a block diagram.  I did a presentation at an Aries meeting in November using this slide deck that shows one path from that to now -- 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wn53YCFWxUrWPX3wQOxHRGqyCs3xjfl_rlluQbDmAfo/edit?usp=sharing

On 2, there are several storage approaches being used.  "Legacy" is the indy-wallet component of the indy-sdk. A newer version of that is aries-askar, referenced and linked in the presentation above.  The Aries Framework Go team has used the storage solutions from the CCG -- at least the Encrypted Vault structure.

Hi everyone! I was exploring the multitenancy feature within ACA-py for a project I'm working on, but it seems it doesn't recognize any of --multitenant and --multitenant-admin options... I've tried switching between main and multitenancy branches, but nothing seems to work. The only references I found were in the demo code. Is this feature still in the works or am I missing something? Thanks a lot!
</p>
<p><strong>maddocche</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 15:57:07 GMT):<br/>
Hi ascatox, I've also been looking into that for quite some time. From what I found the only option right now is to use Xamarin (.NET hybrid mobile framework). Take a look here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 16:05:34 GMT):<br/>
There are a couple of other options to build on.  

@Alexi and @ajayjadhav might be able to point you at some other places to start.

Aries MAX (the Xamarin one mentioned above) is another option.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 16:27:57 GMT):<br/>
Hi @maddocche, it should be usable if you're working from the main branch in ACA-Py. Did you check out the documentation regarding multi-tenancy? See https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/Multitenancy.md
</p>
<p><strong>maddocche</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 16:34:05 GMT):<br/>
Hi @TimoGlastra, thanks for the answer. I did, but neither "provision --help" nor "start --help" list any multitenancy option, and if I try to use them anyway it says that they are not recognized.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 16:35:04 GMT):<br/>
How are you running acapy? using the `./scripts/run_docker` command?
</p>
<p><strong>maddocche</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 16:36:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I tried that way, then by manual building the docker image and then getting aca-py from PyPi through pip, but nothing worked...
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 16:38:44 GMT):<br/>
The version released on PyPi doesn't contain the multitenancy features yet
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 16:38:59 GMT):<br/>
However the run_docker script should work
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 16:39:20 GMT):<br/>
I just ran 
```
PORTS="20000:20000 20001:20001 20002:20002" ./scripts/run_docker start --endpoint http://192.168.65.3:20000 --inbound-transport http 0.0.0.0 20000 --admin 0.0.0.0 20001 --admin-insecure-mode --outbound-transport http --no-ledger --multitenant --multitenant-admin --jwt-secret test
``` in main and it works fine
</p>
<p><strong>maddocche</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 16:46:18 GMT):<br/>
With the same command I get this: "aca-py start: error: unrecognized arguments: --multitenant --multitenant-admin --jwt-secret test"...

Hi @swcurran you mentioned in the Aca-Py call that you are planning to change the status of Aries from incubation to active. I am planning on formally and strongly supporting Aries as the technology stack for SSI in PL in 2-3 weeks max. Just wondering if you believe it's possible to change the status in that time, or maybe I should wait, because you know business people like "active" more than incubating :)

Hey! we worked on a framework that is native on android we are still working on open sourcing it under hyperledger. Here is an example apk you can download (you will have to spin up a mediator as it asks for this when you start it up, I recommend using the dotnet framework mediator). 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Miv_c5Jy8G-bybwjDks731BathIhska_/view?usp=sharing

Hey Folks - as discussioned at the Aries WG Call today, I've put together a draft document to propose that Aries exit "Incubation" status ASAP.  I'd appreciate additions, changes, suggestions and for those agreeing to the idea to add their name to the document:  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=41591994

I've taken the TSC criteria document, added some context about Aries and then added point-by-point responses to the criteria.  I would encourage maintainers and contributors from other Frameworks and Aries repos to add comments about their code base -- many of the responses in the document reference ACA-Py specifically.  There is also a section about real world use cases and would appreciate if folks could add their use cases to that.  Perhaps Kiva, Trinsic, SecureKey, ABSA, esatus, IDUnion/LISSI, Indicio, IDRamp, CPQD, SICPA, Anonyme, AyanWorks and so on.

Hey Folks - as discussed on the Aries WG Call today, I've put together a draft document to propose that Aries exit "Incubation" status ASAP.  I'd appreciate additions, changes, suggestions and for those agreeing to the idea to add their name to the document:  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=41591994

I've taken the TSC criteria document, added some context about Aries and then added point-by-point responses to the criteria.  I would encourage maintainers and contributors from other Frameworks and Aries repos to add comments about their code base -- many of the responses in the document reference ACA-Py specifically.  There is also a section about real world use cases and would appreciate if folks could add their use cases to that.  Perhaps Kiva, Trinsic, SecureKey, ABSA, esatus, IDUnion/LISSI, Indicio, IDRamp, CPQD, SICPA, Anonyme, AyanWorks and so on.

It means the project has an "active" status, which indicates the maturity of the project.  It is useful for newcomers arriving at the project to understand it is ready and in use for production applications.

@andrew.whitehead @swcurran Does ACA-py support connections between agents if one agent has no endpoint URI and no mediator? I have an out-of-band invitation, but can't figure out how to accept it and establish a connection using an agent that doesn't have its own endpoint.

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:09:51 GMT):<br/>
The agent without an endpoint may be able to use https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0092-transport-return-route  and/or a websocket connection

Hey Folks -- added the Hyperledger TSC Quarterly Report for Aries.  Since the last one was submitted just a few weeks ago, this one has not changed much. Please review and update if there are any errors or ommissions.

<p><strong>peacekeeper</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 08:19:00 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, that makes sense. One more question if you don't mind, is it possible to do this via tha ACA-py REST API / admin interface? To accept a connection invitation using return route and websocket?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 19:34:53 GMT):<br/>
@george.aristy -- a quick question for you.  If `did:key`  was changed to be able to have an optional two keys (verification and agreement), would that be sufficient for you?  E.g. `did:key:<multibase verkey>[:<multibase key agreement key>]?  The latter is optional and if absent either there would be no key agreement in the DIDDoc, or if possible, the key agreement key would be derived from the verkey.

Or is there more to it then just the two keys issue?

Apologies for jumping in, but I had a similar discussion about this today. The problem traces back to this discussion about Ed25519 being used for digital signatures *AND* encryption (the latter is not correct). Formally, such keys should only be used for EdDSA, i.e., dig. sigs. Now, in ECC, we need a key with which we can do encryption/decryption, since this is done via ECDH (which formally speaking is a key agreement). That said, if the multibase encoding (for both keys) in your message @swcurran has a "nested" multicodec which conveys information about the exact curve, then the only thing that is not *explicitly* specified is that "verkey" is EdDSA or even ECDSA and that, correspondingly, key aggr. is ECDH. Maybe that latter part being non-explicit is ok.

Generally for encryption, there are other parameters that need to be conveyed as well. Key Agreement (ECDH in this case) is the first one. The other ones include: the key derivation function (KDF), MAC algorithm, and the symmetric encryption algorithm (ENC). 
I have no recollection if in practice all these information are conveyed in the encoding of the key (multibase + multicodec). I believe @george.aristy was referring to the inability of `did:key` conveying all this info.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 06 Feb 2021 17:58:10 GMT):<br/>
To clarify, even if `did:key` was changed to allow the conveyance of two keys (encoded using multibase+multicodec), that would not be sufficient?  

Does that mean there is no point in multicodec, as I would guess that would mean it is insufficient at supplying the needed information.

Apologizes that I'm not well-versed in this -- I'm just trying to understand the information needed, not why it is needed.

Hi,
I am using ACA-PY version 5.6 for credential issuances along with controller which is written in Spring boot. I am trying to issue ~250000 credentials 
with only one credential definition. The time taken to issue ~100000 credentials is 26 hours. I need to optimizing this time further. Any suggestions in this regard will be really helpful.
Thanks and regards

hi everyone,
as the SSI ecosystem grows, we feel there is a growing need for a standardized wallet security ecosystem and therefore a working group called "Wallet Security" is to be launched under DIF umbrella.
In particular we think that:
- we should get a common understanding, terminology about wallet security in the community
- talk about wallet security architectures to analyze similarities
- create a specification and interface to communicate about wallet capabilities, security, regulation-conformance and other points of interoperability
- define mechanism to enable wallet security assertions, certification and ways to prove them
- define specifications about wallet user authentication, ways how to ensure them and how to communicate them to issuers/verifiers

If you are interested about this topic and like to comment, participate, criticize:
- please review the Wallet Security WG Charter: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18H2hVjHZEBjbnzod8tLogJIEzySdecbk9d-QBJaqHP0/edit
- subscribe to the mailing list: https://lists.identity.foundation/g/wallet-security

After gathering initial feedback, we will have an open discussion meeting soon.

I hope this is in the best interests of the community and will get the necessary feedback to make an impact.
Best regards,
Paul Bastian

It's not common for an ACA-Py agent to be running without an endpoint, that's much more likely for a mobile agent.

Hi there, thanks a lot for developing Aries and the support that you give here!
I am currently taking the edX course \href{https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS173x+1T2020/course/}{Becoming a Hyperledger Aries Developer}
and I am in Chapter 4 doing the _Lab: Using ACA-Py’s OpenAPI/Swagger Interface_.
I started up Alice and Bob with
`LEDGER_URL=http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo alice --events --no-auto --bg`
`LEDGER_URL=http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo faber--events --no-auto --bg`, respectively
and can reach the Swagger-UI of both Agents. I succesfully created on Faber's side a connection invitation by executing `POST` `/connections/create-invitation` , copied the "invitation" object from the response body into the `POST` `/connections/receive-invitation` request body which also succesfully gets executed. Now using the `connection_id` from the response as parameter in the `POST` `/connections/{id}/accept-invitation` is successfully executed with a 200 respnse, however, the terminal logs for the Alice agent show the folliwing error:
```sh
2021-02-08 23:48:00,493 aries_cloudagent.transport.outbound.manager ERROR >>> Error when posting to: http://192.168.56.102:8020; Error: (<class 'aiohttp.client_exceptions.ClientConnectorError'>, ClientConnectorError(ConnectionKey(host='192.168.56.102', port=8020, is_ssl=False, ssl=None, proxy=None, proxy_auth=None, proxy_headers_hash=None), ConnectionRefusedError(111, "Connect call failed ('192.168.56.102', 8020)"))
```
Also Faber can then not accept the connection request. Any idea and help would be much appreciated.

`LEDGER_URL=http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo alice --events --no-auto --bg`
`LEDGER_URL=http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo faber--events --no-auto --bg`, respectively
and can reach the Swagger-UI of both Agents. I succesfully created on Faber's side a connection invitation by executing `POST` `/connections/create-invitation` , copied the "invitation" object from the response body into the `POST` `/connections/receive-invitation` request body which also succesfully gets executed. Now using the `connection_id` from the response as parameter in the `POST` `/connections/{id}/accept-invitation` is successfully executed with a 200 respnse, however, the terminal logs for the Alice agent show the folliwing error:
```sh
2021-02-08 23:48:00,493 aries_cloudagent.transport.outbound.manager ERROR >>> Error when posting to: http://192.168.56.102:8020; Error: (<class 'aiohttp.client_exceptions.ClientConnectorError'>, ClientConnectorError(ConnectionKey(host='192.168.56.102', port=8020, is_ssl=False, ssl=None, proxy=None, proxy_auth=None, proxy_headers_hash=None), ConnectionRefusedError(111, "Connect call failed ('192.168.56.102', 8020)"))
```
Also Faber can then not accept the connection request. Any idea and help would be much appreciated.

@ianco -- any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 03:48:58 GMT):<br/>
When you create the initial invitation, make sure you delete the "sample" json body of the invitation request, I suspect this is where the host IP is coming from (it's just a sample and doesn't reflect your actual IP)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 03:49:30 GMT):<br/>
I just tested the connection between these agents on my local (using the same startup parameters) and everything worked

Hey there. In the example schema here, the list under "@context" is huge, but only "schema", "rdf" and "rdfs" are used. Why are there so many in the list when only 3 of them are used in the actual schema?

</p>
<p><strong>karlo0</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 13:53:35 GMT):<br/>
Many thanks, this solved the problem
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 13:55:22 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran `did:key` does not constrain a key's usage to a particular purpose when a key is suitable for several.

(plus the issues that @RazaDen mentioned)
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 13:56:39 GMT):<br/>
For example, a P-256 key can be used for both key agreement and signatures. The `did:key` method as is currently written does not allow one to specify whether the sender would like to use it for one or the other. The spec is extremely ambiguous, but is commonly interpreted as "use the key for all technically possible purposes"
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 13:57:41 GMT):<br/>
So back to your proposal... you can see how multicodec/multiformat alone doesn't make much sense for separating keys for their usage.
</p>
<p><strong>george.aristy</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 14:02:08 GMT):<br/>
You can start to see why I took the approach I did with this proposal: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/577

I'm just basically reusing standardized JOSE identifiers to specify the algorithm parameters, in addition to separating the signing keys from the key agreement keys in DIDComm invitations.

The beauty of it is really in the reuse of the JOSE identifiers. Seemed like a much easier route at the time.

Hi everyone, I have a question about the present proof protocol as implemented in ACA-Py. I have a zero-knowledge proof request that's not satisfied by any credential (but I assume this is true even for other types of proof requests), so when I call "/present-proof/records/{pres_ex_id}/credentials" it returns an empty array. How can I reject the presentation from the prover side? To my understanding the right way to do it would be sending back a problem report message, but I can't find any suitable endpoint; there is only the issue credential problem report endpoint, and sending back an empty presentation return an error. Thanks a lot!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 20:23:30 GMT):<br/>
Could you add that as an issue?  It sounds like something that needs to be there.  

Note that it might be, but if not, we can get it on the list to add.

having the additional short form identifiers in there don't have any effect. As to why they're included I can't say, but they'd be fine to remove without issue.

Hi, I am curious about how to use Aries with Ethereum. I know it is possible to use Sovrin for this, but prefer open source solutions.  How can I connect Aries with Ethereum using only open source tools?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 16 Feb 2021 19:08:05 GMT):<br/>
hey Chris, I'm not sure if that's possible at the moment.  I haven't heard of anyone doing that.  

However, I know that aries-go uses DIF's Sidetree protocol so it should be possible.  Maybe you could ask them.

Hello, I'm trying to run the aries demo locally (Alice and Faber) but I'm getting an error when I try to run Faber: "Error: invalid library state caused by: Ledger merkle tree is not acceptable for current tree". Does anyone have gone through this one? I'm a bit confused what I did wrong, does anyone knows what this error means? Thanks in advance :D
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:22:42 GMT):<br/>
It means your alice/faber agents are trying to connect to the ledger using the wrong IP.  Likely you're running von network (?) which by default uses the docker IP.  If you're running alice/faber locally they're trying to connect using the local IP.  Try starting von network as follows:
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:22:57 GMT):<br/>
`./manage start <your local ip> --logs`
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:23:14 GMT):<br/>
... and then start the alice and faber agents
</p>
<p><strong>Nizu</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 14:01:33 GMT):<br/>
ok thank you, i will try
</p>
<p><strong>paul.bastian</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 14:21:42 GMT):<br/>

I had to go to the von ledger and get the genesis file to update the local-genesis file in the demo folder, forgot about that. Now it gets to a point where it starts to listen and then it immediately shutsdown saying "timed out waiting for agent process to start. Admin URL:..."
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 16:40:56 GMT):<br/>
try setting local environment variable `GENESIS_URL=http://localhost:9000/genesis` and then running alice/faber (sorry forgot this step)

Interesting ...  I've never seen that error before
</p>
<p><strong>Nizu</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:20:27 GMT):<br/>
which one? the red or the white?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:20:45 GMT):<br/>
Have you managed to successfully run the demo in docker?  (i.e. using the `./run_demo faber` command?)
</p>
<p><strong>Nizu</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:23:27 GMT):<br/>
I haven't tried it yet, I have been using this command: GENESIS_FILE=/path/to/local-genesis.txt DEFAULT_POSTGRES=true python3 -m runners.faber --port 8020
</p>
<p><strong>Nizu</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:23:36 GMT):<br/>
from the Aries readme
</p>
<p><strong>Nizu</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:23:48 GMT):<br/>
I-m going to try it now
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:24:07 GMT):<br/>
Yes it's easier to use the `run_demo` command, which runs everything in Docker
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:24:37 GMT):<br/>
Getting it running locally is a bit more challenging and not really supported (due to all the potential issues with differences between local environments)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:24:57 GMT):<br/>
... but if you can get it running in docker then you should be able to get it running locally too ...
</p>
<p><strong>Nizu</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:26:52 GMT):<br/>
looks like it is working
</p>
<p><strong>Nizu</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:27:00 GMT):<br/>
it-s waiting for a connection
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:34:00 GMT):<br/>
You manually copy the invitation from faber to alice and then the connection is auto-detected
</p>
<p><strong>Nizu</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:36:08 GMT):<br/>
yes, but i can only do that when alice is running correct? I get this now, when I try to run Alice
</p>

are you running faber using `./run_demo faber`?  you cal run alice using `./run_demo alice`
</p>
<p><strong>Nizu</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 20:12:56 GMT):<br/>
I'm running faber using `./run_demo faber` and it is waiting for a connection. I tried to run Alice using `./run_demo alice` and I got that error

Hi guys! I know that an edge agent communicates with other agents via a mediator by packing the DIDComm messages into a DIDComm message of type `forward`. Fine. Can someone explain how an agent - also configured to use a mediator - with no internet access except to its mediator would communicate with the ledger nodes to write e.g. a schema definition? Is this communication also routed through the mediator? Automatically? Or would aca-py need special configuration for this?
</p>

Hi everyone! Just a quick question, does ACA-Py support CORS for request to the admin endpoint? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>RazaDen</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 12:04:32 GMT):<br/>
Agents that are strictly acting as mediators (and nothing more than that) do not facilitate this kind of functionality. In the scenario you are describing, this can be achieved by having the "edge agent/application w/e" act as a *controller* of a cloud agent. For instance, you can use the Admin API of ACA-Py to do ledger stuff and ACA-Py will do everything for you (the edge controller). From a conceptual point of view, these two cases are different. However, from a practical standpoint, ACA-Py is very powerful and can act both as a mediator *and* as a means for you to do ledger stuff in the limited connectivity setting you are describing.
</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 12:40:02 GMT):<br/>
Thank you, @RazaDen . I'm going to discuss this with my colleagues. Spontaneously I would say this isn't possible because this would require having the private keys outside of the secured network. Maybe some kind of proxying mechanism might be helpful here
</p>
<p><strong>RazaDen</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 12:41:18 GMT):<br/>
Yeah it's very sloppy as it mixes two paradigms into one. Also, if you want to scale up to multiple mobile agents, it's going to get even messier. Glad to be of help!

Another question: Is it somehow possible to get a published DID into a mobile agent? Or to publish a DID created on such a mobile device? Currently it seems like mobile agents (tested Trinsic and Lissi) are created a keypair under the hood and then creating pairwise DIDs from that keypair. And they're missing to provide something like a seed import. However, if I want to bind a mobile agent to a real world identity, I also like to publish a DIDDocument containing my public key - in order to be able to create verifiable digital signatures via direct messaging (not to confuse with verifiable credentials).
So my question is currently just: How to get a published DID into my mobile agent?

I think proxying would work fine.  The isolated agent would sign the transaction and then hand it to the controller to interact with the ledger.  The ledger doesn't care (AFAIK) who gives it the transaction, as long as it has the right signatures for the action to be taken.

The team at Danube Tech has done some work with a DIDComm connection to a Universal Resolver instance that would handle this type of activity.
</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:43:22 GMT):<br/>
We had a look at Universal Resolver as well. However, it currently "only" does DIDDoc lookup (and later registration) - no node communication, doesn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:44:49 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure.  I was pointing to the example more for the pattern than if it will do exactly what you want.

In the DID method specification the DID scheme is defined as `sovrin-did = "did:sov:" idstring *(":" subnamespace)`
Hence a valid DID is `did:sov:2wJPyULfLLnYTEFyzByfUR`, with `2wJPyULfLLnYTEFyzByfUR` being the idstring.
Another one would be `did:sov:2wJPyULfLLnYTEFyzByfUR:mynetwork` with `2wJPyULfLLnYTEFyzByfUR` being the idstring again and `mynetwork` being the (optional!) subnamespace.

Two questions from this:
1) If the subnamespace is optional, is there any way to distinguish to which network a given DID belongs to (e.g. is it from Sovrin or is it from local von-network)
2) The `did-sov` driver for the `universal-resolver` has a regex in it's code to parse the segments of a DID. This is ```
```

Hello folks,
on March 1st, 6pm CET we will have an open call to kickoff the upcoming Wallet Security WG at DIF.
I will present motivation, goals and a first roadmap.
Very short summary:
 - standardized wallet security is necessary for sensitive credentials like id-cards, payment credentials or more
 - create a specification and interface to communicate about wallet capabilities, security, regulation-conformance and other points of security-relevant interoperability
 - define mechanism to enable wallet security assertions, certification and ways to prove them
 - define specifications about wallet user authentication, ways how to ensure them and how to communicate them to issuers/verifiers


WG Charter:https://docs.google.com/document/d/18H2hVjHZEBjbnzod8tLogJIEzySdecbk9d-QBJaqHP0/edit
Mailing list: https://lists.identity.foundation/g/wallet-security

Topic: Wallet Security WG Kickoff
Time: Mar 1, 2021 06:00 PM Amsterdam, Berlin, Rome, Stockholm, Vienna

To add another potential data point, we've seen a use case utilize the Indy-VDR proxy server to provide a mobile agent with the capability of reading schemas/cred defs, etc, and posting requests via the RESTful API proxy server.

</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Sun, 21 Feb 2021 22:24:39 GMT):<br/>
ie something like
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Sun, 21 Feb 2021 22:24:52 GMT):<br/>
```"business_name_referrent": {
            "names": ["business_name","employee_name"],
            "restrictions": [{
              "schema_id": "CHANGE:2:Some Schema:0.0.0"
             }],
            "revealed": true
          },```
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Sun, 21 Feb 2021 22:25:13 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 14:00:21 GMT):<br/>
Hi guys! I've got a security question:
Is there a standardized way how mobile agents show the name of a verifier? Let's imagine next to a door is a printed static QR code. If you scan it, your mobile agent connects to the doors agent (Notice: the doors agent decides about its connection label presented to the user! In this case: "VIP Palace Inc."). Then the doors agent sends a presentation request which the user agrees to. If everything is ok, the door opens. Fine.
Now imagine someone malicious prints a QR code and sticks it over the original one. When the user scans this malicious code, the mobile agent connects to the attackers agent. This time, the attackers agent also uses the label "VIP Palace Inc." and requests the same credential while the user has no idea who he is communicating to.
If I don't miss anything, this is a way for phishing information presented via credentials, isn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 14:04:28 GMT):<br/>
Seems like it.  This is kinda why public DIDs on the ledger exist.  Eventually, the users (or program agents acting on their behalf) will have to make sure the well reputed VIP Palace Inc. is the DID listed in the QRCode and not the nefarious VIP Palace.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 14:06:11 GMT):<br/>
MiTM attacks are hard to defeat though imo.  Hopefully "web of trust" type ideas will help mitigate this threat insomuch as possible.  That being said, the old style trust based systems on the Internet suffer the same issues so I think SSI projects like Aries are a step in the right direction.
</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 14:12:32 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thank you.
I think the public DID doesn't help much in case the non-technician John Doe would need to compare the DIDs. Maybe something like the OrgBook would help, by first providing an government issued VC to proof the identity of "VIP Palace Inc" and only after that allowing presentation requests from that DID.
This, however, would require a lot of customization as no generic wallet supports such a workflow.

Thanks for clarification, @daidoji !
</p>

yeah you got it, that's the gist of the ideas as I understand them.

Hi! I don't know if here is the right place, but I have some doubts regarding a user case I have.
The user case will involve DID and credentials, which I've seen it could be solved in different ways. But the problem I'm facing now, to decide what I will use to design my architecture, is to solve how I could send messages from an agent (let's say a raspberry pi or a sensor sending data) to a mobil agent via bluetooth (without mediators or relays).
</p>
<p><strong>deas</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:07:20 GMT):<br/>
Unless I'm missing something, that sounds doable. What are your doubts?
</p>
<p><strong>jabuaasnez</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:17:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi! thaks for answering! 
What kind of agent would be a device sending data to a mobile agent? Would it be possible to authenticate communication, that is, the mobile agent being able to confirm that the data is comming from a, e,g,. an IoT device, and send data (from the IoT device) as message; all via bluetooth?
</p>
<p><strong>b1conrad</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 17:50:22 GMT):<br/>
we naturally use HTTP as a transport mechanism, but other transport mechanisms such as BLE are totally workable as well
</p>
<p><strong>jabuaasnez</strong> (Sun, 28 Feb 2021 21:51:02 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, it is also stated in the _Aries RFC 0004: Agents_, that Bluetooth can be use as communication transport. But I became confused when reading that the communicaton between mobile agents has to happen via mediators involving the use of internet.  
I need edge agents (let's get back to teh sensor example), which won't rely on internet (more that maybe during a ID registration process), able to send their data to mobile agents via bluetooth.  Would this be possible? Which repo or example should I be looking at? 
Apologies if this is a basic question/problem but I'm completely new with hyperldger.

According to https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/0.6.0/Mediation.md outbound messages (see last action in the diagram) are sent directly from Alice (using the mediator) to Bob. Is it somehow possible to configure acy-py to use the mediator also for those outbound messages? Use case: Agent is located in a very restricted network and has no internet access. Only mediator has internet access.

Regarding https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-recovery:
How is the recovery meant to be explicitly specified as such in the DID document?
As far as I understand, there is no explicit "recovery" verification relationship, and it seems you cannot specify something like a "recovery use case" for the capabilityInvocation/-Delegation relationship property

>How is the recovery key meant to be explicitly specified as such in the DID document?
I think that's open to interpretation within the spec.  I'm not actually sure I've even seen a did doc with a recovery use case specified myself to be honest.

I'm not sure about your second comment though, what did you mean?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:26:30 GMT):<br/>
Yes -- at least that is intended functionality. Not done yet, I suspect. The mediator would be a relay for the outbound messages.  The sending agent would prepare the message for the recipient based on the recipient's needs (what's in their DIDDoc), and then wrap that in a "forward" message and send the forward to the "outbound relay" to process.

Not sure you build that into the mediator or create another aca-py instance that is the relay. Logically, they are separate components -- an inbound mediator and an outbound relay.

Hi Experts ..

We have our own centralised identity platform and we have a vision to make our platform interoperable with the outside world by using DIDs standard, our system saving Identities and Claims in RDMS .

*Our expectation after developing this vision are:*

Be able to create new DIDs and save it in our DB.
Be able to resolve our DIDs by fetching the data from our APIs which are connected to our DB.
Be able to resolve SD Request and preparing the SD Response from our APIs.

*So my questions are:*
Can Arise framework help us in achieving our goal?
If yes , 
    - then what is the steps we should take 
    - what kind of plugins we need to use or modify or will we have to build new Plugin to achieve the expectations mentioned above?

If we are going to create new DID in our system, then should we have new method eg. did:xxx? or should we use already existing Method Specification?

Ah, alright, thank you.

The thought process for the second comment was as follows: If there is a recovery key for a DID, it should be specified somewhere in the DID document, but I didn't find a proper place for that (neither as a verification relationship as its own, nor by marking a specific CapabilityInvocation VR as 'this shall be used for recovery')
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 14:31:49 GMT):<br/>
yeah I'm not sure.  Seems like a question other people with more familiarity with the specs should be able to answer.  That diddoc WG might be a good place to start.  I've seen a lot of talk about recovery mechanisms but few implementations in the wild myself.

That's interesting, using self-sovereign identity technology in a centralized platform. Since anyone can use public code to create DIDs, so can you. Since you are going to store them (and their docs) on your DB, then yes, you would want a new method. Because that's what a method is for, to be a way to resolve a DID into its document. My two ¢

A question regarding key rotation as described in https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#verification-method-rotation

One quote in 9.7: "Proofs or signatures that rely on verification methods that are not present in the latest version of a DID Document are not impacted by rotation, and might require additional information to mitigate compromise. "
=> So, VCs issued with old keys (before the rotation) are still valid, no problem

Then, another quote in 9.7: "Frequent rotation of a verification method might be frustrating for parties that are forced to continuously renew or refresh associated credentials. "
=> So, VCs issued with old keys are frustrating, as they aren't valid anymore and the affected VCs have to be renewed/refreshed

These two interpretations seem to contradict each other, so which one is true?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 15:40:35 GMT):<br/>
That's a better question asked of the W3C VC Maintenance Working Group.  Basically, if the verifier can get the value of the signing key at the time of issueance, all is well. But that ability might be dependent on how that key is published -- e.g. if you using a DID, whether or not the DID Method supports getting earlier version of the DIDDoc.  

I think the latter is saying, it might be frustrating for the verifiers if they have to try multiple keys to see if any of them work on a given presentation.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 06:57:32 GMT):<br/>
normatively, neither. Since that's a portion of the security considerations section, the purpose is not to state how something must be done, but to rather say here's some things you should consider while designing. Ultimately this is not a decision that should be made at this layer, but what you do at this layer will affect the layers which depend on this decision.

For example, vc-js takes a document loader in and in that document loader you define a strategy for how you plan to resolve a DID. So if your VC proof contains did:example:123?version=4 and the resolver that's used in that document loader returns a valid JSON-LD document with a ldp key (the JSON object like Ed25519VerificationKey2018) and it's in the appropriate verification method it will validate for you.

However, if you built a document loader that doesn't resolve did:example:123?version=4 (say because example did method doesn't support resolving old versions) then it won't validate because no did document is able to be resolved and therefore no public key can be found to validate the VC.

In other words, this is up to the VC validation logic you choose until a protocol spec is written on how the VC MUST be processed in which case some did methods may not be able to comply with the that spec because they will have made design choices at the DID layer which impact that processing logic.

I think that you would need to set up a mediator agent that was A) within BLE range of the sensor and B) connected to the Internet so that it could relay messages over HTTP to Aries cloud agents, etc.

In our lab, we use a Raspberry Pi to receive messages from our sensors and from there into the Internet. We don't use BLE yet, but there's probably a hat for that. We run a pico-engine on the Pi and Pico Agents would run nicely therein. https://github.com/Picolab/G2S and includes code for mediating (called "router")

Off the top of my head:  The idea is that on the ledger you have a registry on which you can have an identifier for each device you have.  At any time, you can activate a new device and revoke an existing device.  With each proof, you send a ZKP that proves that (a) the device sending the proof is in the registry and (b) has not been revoked.  It operates much like the AnonCreds revocation registry.  I don't know exactly how it would work and how your device would be anonymous, but I'm sure it was thought out.

The tricky part of it is getting other components (verifiers) to understand the proof that would be included.  There is no other discussion AFAIK in any other VC community about this concept, and the concept is not included in the VC data model

Hi,all. I have a question about cross-domain-messaging. Both Alice and Bob's cloud agent belong to the same Agency. When Alice needs to send a message to Bob's cloud agent, which way is correct? 1. Alice constructs an encrypted envelope with Bob's cloud agent, and sends it directly to Bob's cloud agent through Alice's cloud agent. 2. In addition to constructing an encrypted envelope with Bob's cloud agent, Alice also needs to construct an encrypted envelope with Agency, and the message is forwarded through Agency。
</p>
<p><strong>ye_zi</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 03:44:24 GMT):<br/>
Both Alice and Bob's cloud agents belong to the same Agency. The cross-domain message here refers to the message between the Alice domain, the Agency domain and the Bob domain, or the message between the Alice and Bob domains? Whether agency encryption is required depends on whether Bob or Alice need to route through the agency in the did doc provided to the other party, right?

In DIDComm, the relative location of Alice and Bob don't enter into the picture.  Bob constructs in the DID he gives Alice the "encryption route"  (e.g. a series of keys that Alice uses to wrap the message) and an endpoint to which to send the message.  Alice, just does whatever Bob says to do.

Bob could get fancy and detect somehow that Alice was in the in the same Agency as he was in adjust the encryption route and endpoint accordingly (e.g. skip having the message go to the external Agency endpoint).  However, from Alice's perspective, there the process is the same --- encrypt per the encryption route and send to the endpoint.

Hey everyone, I was wondering what the standard behaviour of the Aries Cloudagent with respect to the pool config is. Will queries be sent to two random but fixed nodes and compared (at least I thought this is the default config for the indy-sdk)? Will the respective nodes be chosen randomly or does the agent prefer specific nodes (for example, one that runs with the same DID as the agent because they use the same seed)?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:34:35 GMT):<br/>
I'm not a cryptographer.... :-)

My understanding is that using BBS+ the set of keys to be used for signing the claims of the credential can be derived programmaticlly from the issuer key such that there is no need for the CredDef object on the ledger.  Basically, each participant gets the issuer public key and from that derives the keys of the CredDef, which allows creating the credential, the presentation and verifying both.

Note that the schema is not needed because of the use of JSON-LD for the VC. This does not get to full semantic understanding of the schema, but it is sufficient to remove the need for the schema on the ledger.

Note that one might want a schema (and some argue, a cred_def) on the ledger but those are different topics. Indy AnonCreds chose to have all the objects on the ledger, and with BBS+, you don't have to use them.

thanks @swcurran , can you explain the policy address attribute in anoncreds. It is mentioned in anoncreds 2.0 paper that agents should specify authorization to use a credential by including a policy address in the credentials. How does this work?, how can an attribute specify agent authorization, and how could we add a new agent to authorize that credential

JSON-LD can give you more information about the claims in the credential than just a name for the claim as is in the AnonCreds `schema` object.  However, I've been admonished in the past by those deep into the semantics that it might not give you all the machine readable details -- is it PII data?  What label should be used for the data?  What transalations for the label should be used?  What is the precise format of the data?   And so on.

AFAIK -- JSON-LD goes a long way on those things, but I don't have a lot of experience in applying JSON-LD.

I'm not the right person to answer that.  @brentzundel may have an answer.

Agent authorization would use the same proof mechanisms as a revocation registry. The policy address attribute described in anoncreds 2.0 would point to the user's authorization policy on a verifiable data registry. Changes to the authorization policy would be included in a common agent authorization accumulator.
It has never been implemented and it is not clear now if it will ever be.

Hello,
I'm working on the IDunion project, which is an Indy/Aries based SSI-Network, being built in Germany and there is a scalability question that occured to me, which I think is very important for the technology being ready for daily usage:
Has the Stack been tested for:
1) One cloud agent processing 10 presentations per second? or 20, or 100? What would be the limit there?
2) Same for mass revocations
3) To a certain degree same question above for issuing credentials
I would like to know whether anyone tested this before or if it even makes sense to take a look at it. I am a research assistant and it would be a very interesting research question for me. 
Thank you

Do we receive any webhook for "connection-less proof request" after  verification   ?
I am using version 0.6.0 of acapy-agent. I do receive web-hook for proof req with connection creation.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 04:46:21 GMT):<br/>
That will depend on what the requirements are. You'll need to consider the credential size, the bandwidth of transmission, and internet availability on verification for your use case.
</p>
<p><strong>JSedlmeir</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 08:37:04 GMT):<br/>
You mean after the proof was sent back to the agent? According to my experience with 0.6.0 (and also 0.5.6), there should be two webhooks; one when the proof arrives at the agent, and one after it has been verified. The webhook endpoint for that you mean is topic/present_proof, right?
</p>
<p><strong>sumit9935</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 09:50:35 GMT):<br/>
yes end point is 
topic/present_proof

when I create a proof , I do get a webhook, but when its verified its not sending any webhook.

@kdenhartog Thanks for letting us know what to consider. 
If there is no restriction (size of the credential or bandwidth etc...), is it possible to issue VC embed an image data as a claim in Json-LD format?
It was possible to put an image inside a HTML in the following format. So, I would like to know if this is possible with json-ld as well.
```
<img src="data:image/jpg;base64,{{base64-data-string here}}" />
```
In schema.org, suitable type seems to be ImageObject. I would like to know if this is possible with it as well.

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 16:04:23 GMT):<br/>
Sadly no, that's not possible at the moment. We depend on libraries that don't support WASM, and thus can't run in the browser. However the Aries Framework Go project has WASM bindings so it an be used in a browser environment

Hi
I am trying to understand the general flow of hyperledger indentity apps. I am currently working with this tutorial *https://kctheservant.medium.com/demonstration-of-hyperledger-aries-cloud-agent-6e476a5426b0*

1. I create a connection invitation using *POST /connections/create-invitation* on Node 1.
2. I receive connection invitation at Node 2, using *POST /connections/receive-invitation* by passing invitation object in payload.
According to tutorial, at this point an active connection should be established between Node 1 and Node 2, as shown by *state: activr*, in the data. But when i query connection using the connection id on Node 1, i get *state: response*, and when i try to query on Node 2, i get 404.
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 11:43:58 GMT):<br/>
That is a pretty old tutorial :) You need to send  trust ping I believe to move the state to active now.
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 11:45:54 GMT):<br/>
Also if you want some newer tutorials I think we have developed some nice ones in this repo - https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDentity. Basically use jupyter notebooks to write business logic that interacts with the agents swagger-api. Let me know if you have any questions
</p>
<p><strong>JSedlmeir</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 20:47:13 GMT):<br/>
I wonder how the wallet can handle this; it does not seem like a proper connectionless proof request to me. Maybe try the following form (and encode it to base64 as you did for your json):

`{
  "@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/present-proof/1.0/request-presentation",
  "@id": "THE PRESENTATION_EXCHANGE_ID THAT YOU GOT AS RESPONSE WHEN CALLING /present-proof/create-request WITH YOUR BODY",
  "request_presentations~attach": [
    {
      "@id": "libindy-request-presentation-0",
      "mime-type": "application/json",
      "data": {
        "base64": "THE BASE64 ENCODING OF THE PROOF REQUEST, I.E., WHAT YOU SENT ABOVE"
      }
    }
  ],
  "~service": {
    "recipientKeys": [
      "A VERKEY OF THE RECEIVING AGENT"
    ],
    "routingKeys": [],
    "serviceEndpoint": "http://TARGET_AGENT_IP:11000"
  },
  "~thread": {
    "thid": "THE PRESENTATION_EXCHANGE_ID THAT YOU GOT AS RESPONSE WHEN CALLING /present-proof/create-request WITH YOUR BODY",
    "sender_order": 0,
    "received_orders": {}
  }
}`

Hi everyone, according to your experiences or available related works (that I might be missing)... which type of agent will be the most suitable for an IoT device holding a credential (used for the device's authentication)? The device has to be able to prove its credentials and communicate (send data) without using Internet.... which git repo should I focus on for this?

Hey @da3v21, I am also very much interested in this. But you are correct, currently, this is not supported. This was a helpful answer I got about this previously https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries?msg=cCwPQoJkjhnkaxedQ

I do think ursa has the cryptographic primitives available so it could be implemented, just hasn't bubbled up the stack yet.

@esune knows that library pretty well and should help. I haven't looked at that in a while, but it sounds like you haven't loaded the presentation request into the service.  Take a look at the summary here, and notably the "updatePresentation" script that loads the presentation request:

what @swcurran pointed out is what I would have suggested as well: you need to have a record stored in `vc-authn` using its API that describes what will be requested in the proof request. The value of `pres_req_conf_id` in the OIDC authentication request needs to match one of the configuration ids stored in `vc-authn`, otherwise the controller will not know what to request for the proof.

<p><strong>esune</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 18:16:05 GMT):<br/>
The main readme in the repository has an example showing what the configuration payload looks like, you will obviously need to adapt it to your needs. The keycloak configuration guide shows how to setup `vc-authn` ad IdP: please note that you need to set the `forwarded parameter` to include `pres_req_conf_id` or the request will fail (no proof-request configuration is provided and processable if the parameter is missing).

Hello Everyone,
I am trying to understand why we need a private connectionID as well as private DID for a single private connection. I also want to know when are the private DIDs created in create-invitation process. I am familiar with why we need a pair-wise private connection, but I want to know more technically. Can I get some sequence diagram kind of thing to know the exact flow of connections between two agents?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:42:39 GMT):<br/>
Best/easiest thing to do is to walk through the first part of the ACA-Py API demo to go through it yourself.

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/demo/AriesOpenAPIDemo.md

You have a DID per connection to prevent correlation across channels.  You don't want a single identifier for yourself that share with everyone in the world.

You will need to provision a sub-wallet by using the `multitenancy` API in the ACA-Py admin interface. Provisioning a sub-wallet should respond with the token to be used in the header to have reuests routed to the right wallet.

Hi everyone. I hope someone can help me on some doubts: with my team we have developed agents to manage our own did method, whose did documents are stored on a Ledger. 

At a certain point we wondered how to achieve interoperability with other agents: for example, how to communicate with an agent that handles sov methods. In this regard, could someone indicate me a source of information about this? 
Another thing we have asked ourselves is if we could use aries go framework https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go to realize our own agent that treats our method, in order to inherit all the structure and the functionalities already realized, endpoints included.  Again if someone could give me some information that would be great.

Thanks for any help.

Hi all, 
I'm trying to develop an agent for my own DID method, using https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go. 
However, I couldn't find detail examples about how to use the aries-framework-go.
I have studies the OpenAPI demo of ACA-Py. So, I understood how DIDcomm and VerifiableCredential/Presentation work.
But, I would like to implement the same flow using aries-framework-go.
Could someone provide some examples or articles with me?
Thank you!

The instances of Tails Server hosted by BCGov are in the process of moving to a new domain. This will be for the most part transparent, however if you have been using the `dev` or `test` instances of the server you will need to update the URLs as follows:
DEV: `https://tails-dev.vonx.io`
TEST: `https://tails-test.vonx.io`
PROD: `https://tails.vonx.io` (same as before)
The old instances will be available until Friday April 16th at roughly 9am PDT - after this time they will be switched off. The new instances re already available, so we encourage you to switch over to using them as soon as possible.

Hi, I've been reading about the proof verification process and I've done some code and scripts to test the python runners. But I want to understand something, what's the mechanism that prevents an attacker to present a false proof, saying for example he has an age over 18 years old. What mechanism prevents an attacker to generate its own presentation JSON file. Is the presentation derived from the credential stored on a wallet signed by the Issuer? I've read the 0037 RFC from Aries, but it is not specified what I want to know. In the OpenAPI demo I don't see any value in the presentation related to a public key from the Issuer or similar, just the schema IDs and Cred_def_id. Thank you very much!
</p>
<p><strong>AkankshaM</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 14:38:20 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @swcurran. I have checked out this demo. You are right, we need pair wise DID for avoiding correlation of data/identity. What I don't understand is the "connection_id". It is obvious that an agent need to send invitation to other agents for establishing connection, alone public DID cannot suffice the connection right now (I didn't find any demo about establishing connection purely with Public DID).
connection_id is pair-wise unique as well just like pair-wise DIDs. Is it that connection_id is used only by controllers and private DIDs is used only by agents?
If not, why do we have connection_id if we have pair-wise DID? And, we require connection_id while issuing credentials, presenting proofs and messaging. What I have noticed is that private DIDs are not used in this OpenAPIDemo after establishing connection. Is it that agents communicate behind the scenes with pair-wise DID?
Please correct me if I am wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>AkankshaM</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 14:46:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi, 
The proof includes attributes signed by the private key of the issuer. So, in order to verify the proof, public/ver key of the issuer is used.
May be this is the piece you are missing. Please correct me if this is wrong.

A connection object is represents the relationship between (usually/always for now) a pair of agents. The connection includes the DIDs being used by the two parties, and other information -- for example the labels used by the controller for the two agents.  There is also an extension mechanism so that extra protocol specific data can be stored with the connection.

The connection id is known to the controller and the controller uses it to say -- "hey, I want to start a protocol with this connection".  The controller often links the connection with the entity in the domain-specific database.  For example, a user in their system has a connection id for agent-y things.

Also, I am curious to know if multiple private DIDs can be created with same connectionID?
Or, if multiple private DIDs can be linked to same connectionID?
The later seems impossible for out-of-band connection because for every invite, there is a new connection ID , and hence a new pair of DID.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 15:51:17 GMT):<br/>
I'm sure it would be possible, but don't know of a use case.  It would mean changes to the API for the controller to tell the framework which DID to use for messaging.

There would have to be a really compelling reason to add that complexity.

<p><strong>esune</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:19:11 GMT):<br/>
That would probably be best defined by your business processes and governance, technically you could do either way, however it would likely defeat the purpose of having a multi-tenant agency in the first place if you only use one agent

A third Curr[ae]n in this space? Wow!

Rich Schema evolution has largely stopped.  In stead, the community is moving towards the use of BBS+ Signatures which provide W3C Standard VC format, ZKP (no inherent unique identifier for the holder) and selective disclosure, and JSON-LD format credentials.

BBS+ is still being rolled out, and the feature set is not as complete as the Indy AnonCreds (no predicates, and no ZKP-Revocation -- although coming...), but it moves the Indy/Aries community closer to the other VC communities that are more focused on JSON-LD -- without losing ZKP and selective disclosure.

Hi guys,
I'm trying to use the aries framework go mobile binds to establish connection between two agents but when I accept the invitation I get this error "id exchange client - accept exchange invitation: failed to execute state action 'requested': outboundDispatcher.Send: no transport found for serviceEndpoint: didcomm: transport / queue] "   does anyone have any idea what it could be?

I have got a question, about vc-authn-oidc, so after the email cred is verified, it redirects/shows us what is inside Authorize.cshtml, is there any way where I can change the redirection to any other page. This is really important for my projects, any sort of help will be appreciated.
</p>
<p><strong>spilling</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 18:20:52 GMT):<br/>
I am pretty sure that project uses the aries-framework-dotnet project. If so, it uses the mediator included in that project.
In that case, the wallet for the mediator holds the connections with the wallet in the mobile application. When the mobile agent requests its messages from the mediator, that request happens via a connection stored in the mediator wallet. 
The EdgeXX wallets are used only as at rest storage for messages bound for the wallet in the mobile agent.
</p>
<p><strong>spilling</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 18:27:10 GMT):<br/>
I have not read through the code for the Aries framework go, but my guess would be that there is no route defined in the connection offer where the second mobile agent should send its reply. In an edge/ mobile use case, this would typically include use of a mediator.

I'm getting this error when trying to issue a credential: "Issuer has no operable cred def for proposal spec {'cred_def_id': ...." I'm trying to understand just how Aries works. My model may be incorrect, but I believe that there are types of credentials that are defined on the blockchain, like "driver's licence" then an instance of Aries will be told which of the credentials it is able to issue. If I'm wrong I'm not sure what to read to understand this more concretely.
</p>
<p><strong>daniel-s 1</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 22:32:38 GMT):<br/>
Anyway, when trying to issue a credential the field cred_def_id is sent in the payload from the controller to Aries. Aries will use that DID to filter through credentials it can issue and if it is not available in the list of credentials that this instance of Aries can issue, it returns the above error.
</p>
<p><strong>daniel-s 1</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 22:33:25 GMT):<br/>
Is my understanding correct? Any suggestions on what to read to better/perfectly understand this process?
</p>
<p><strong>daniel-s 1</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 22:33:45 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible to query an instance of Aries to get the DIDs of all the types of credentials that the instance issues?
</p>
<p><strong>spilling</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:49:52 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the name for a type of credential is a "Schema". These define the attributes which the credential will contain. In the driver's license example, the Schema says "all credentials created based on this schema will have first name, last name, driver's license number, ..." and so on. These can be used by anyone. 

A verifiable credential contains data for one instance. Using the driver's license as an example, this would contain the user's actual first name, last name driver's number. 

Between the credential and the Schema lives another layer. This is the credential definition. The simplest explanation is that this is a set of signing keys created by a specific issuer related to a specific schema. This can only be used by the issuer which created the credential definition. 

What this error appears to be indicating (I assume it is from ACA.py, which I have not used much) is that you have not used the issuer to create a credential definition.
</p>
<p><strong>daniel-s 1</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:52:44 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your reply. I was partially confused about the difference between schema and credential definition, which you helped clarify.
</p>
<p><strong>daniel-s 1</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:55:07 GMT):<br/>
So, just to repeat what you said. A scheme defines the template for the credential and the credential definition is almost analogous to someone posting onto the public ledger, "I'm the DMV in XYZ jurisdiction", publishing their public key, and saying that you're going to issue this credential.
</p>
<p><strong>daniel-s 1</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:55:39 GMT):<br/>
*schema
</p>
<p><strong>spilling</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:56:16 GMT):<br/>
That sounds correct.
</p>
<p><strong>daniel-s 1</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:58:29 GMT):<br/>
I guess it then makes sense why I would be getting this message from an issuer that wants to issue a credential but has not previously created the credential definition with this agent. I believe in this case that the issuer had previously created the definition, but the agent application was reinitialised and the state (wallet) was lost.
</p>
<p><strong>spilling</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:58:51 GMT):<br/>
That would do it. :)

Does proof also really reveal the attributes to the proof requestor or just "yes/no" answer of the proof?
In the play with docker OpenAPI demo, the http response of proof just shows status as "verified". No attributes of schema are visible in the response.

Yes.  There is no dependency on Indy in DIDComm -- it can be used in many scenarios, even just secure messaging.

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 11:00:42 GMT):<br/>
I think with naked key is meant the raw public key string. Previously keys were always ed25519 keys so a naked key was sufficient because you knew that it would be a base58 encoded ed25519 public key (aka verkey). Now did keys are used because they allow you to detect which key type and encoding you're dealing with

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 29 Apr 2021 15:39:43 GMT):<br/>
Easiest is probably by looking at (or even using) the implementations that exist in the various Frameworks -- Python, C#/.NET, Go, Rust and JavaScript.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 29 Apr 2021 15:41:22 GMT):<br/>
If you look at the set of RFCs in AIP 1.0 (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile#aries-interop-profile-version-10) and ignore the ones about Credential Exchange, you are left with the ones about DIDComm and protocols.

I do have an acapy related question:Is there a reason why the order of claim fields in credential definitions (Name, Last_Name, DoB etc.) are not coming in the same order they are put in for credential definition? I end up having a random order for the claim fields. So to recap:
If I put the following claim fields in the schema definition:
1. Name
2. Last Name
3. DoB
I end up getting it in a random order in indy i.E:
1. Last Name
2. DoB
3. Name
This is particularly problematic, when you are creating a diploma for example which also includes school grades. In that case the overview is non-existent...
A colleague of mine is a developer for a solution, which is using Acapy. His remarks were that The JavaScript JSON Arrays are actually specified as ordered lists. If that's the case, is this somehow not implemented in Anoncreds / Indy?
Thanks in advance for any remarks

HI. For Issue Credential Protocol 2.0:
In Hyperledger Indy, where the `request-credential` message can **only** be sent in response to an `offer-credential` message, the `propose-credential` message is the only way for a potential Holder to initiate the workflow.
Is this meaning that (?):
1. the holder send to issuer `propose-credential` message to start the workflow
2. the issuer send to holder `offer-credential` message'
3. the holder send to issuer `request-credential` message'

This means that if your process requires the *holder* to initiate, then their only starting point is `propose-credential`. 
It is possible to start the process from the *issuer* with the `offer-credential` message.

I believe the doc was trying to say, because of how Indy works, it is not possible for the *holder* to initiate this process using any other message.

Hi, I have a couple of questions for the Out-Of-Band protocol.   Thanks in advance.
1) When the receiver of an OOB message which contains an "requests~attach" field as defined at https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0434-outofband#messages, the OOB message receiver begins the protocol by sending the attached message with a "@id" field which it (the receiver) generates dynamically on-the-fly.  Is this correct?  In other words, it seems to me that the message in the OOB attachment should not have an "@id" field and that we require the sender to generate their own, since they are starting the protocol.
2) Towards the end of the same section (athttps://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0434-outofband#messages), the RFC references a `please-play-the-role` message, but I don't see this message defined in any RFC and the link just goes back to the top of the OOB RFC.   Is this message defined somewhere?  If yes, where?

Hello, I hope i find you well.

</p>
<p><strong>spilling</strong> (Tue, 04 May 2021 17:08:42 GMT):<br/>
Yes, setting the seed will keep the DID consistent. Seeds are 32 characters. I am not certain of the restrictions, but commonly alpha numeric (0-9a-z).

I don't think please-play-the-role is a real RFC, but it's odd that it links to the same page.
For the response to the OOB message, I think it uses the attachment's ID as the thread ID to help the initiator coordinate?
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Tue, 04 May 2021 17:28:20 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Andrew.  So what wasn't clear to me is if the receiver (a) is receiving the attachment message or (b) supposed to send the attachment message back to the sender (i.e. the creator of the OOB invitation).
From what you said, it appears to be "a" rather than "b".  In that case, the "@id" field in the attachment MUST indeed be unique for each receiver of the OOB invitation, which means if I want to generate a QRCode which can be scanned by multiple receivers, then the generation of the "@id" in the attachment MUST be delayed until the short-url-resolution time.  Am I understanding this correctly?

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 04 May 2021 17:59:40 GMT):<br/>
The wording seems a little unclear in the RFC about responding to requests~attach messages, possibly because an earlier version was a bit more flexible there. In the current version I believe the requests are always treated as messages from the initiator to the responder, and the responder must assemble the next message in the relevant protocol

@swcurran This explanation is confusing with peer DID.

Hello all,
I am trying to set up aries without docker container.
I can start von-ledger on docker.
For the below command, (including --wallet-type indy), it throws the error that wallet not found. 
$ aca-py start -it http '0.0.0.0' 10000 -ot http  --admin '0.0.0.0' 5000 -e http://localhost:8080 --genesis-url http://0.0.0.0:9000/genesis --label 'My agent' --admin-insecure-mode --log-level info --wallet-type indy --seed 00000000000000000000000000faber1 --wallet-name "My Wallet" --wallet-key "somekey" 
How do I set up that?

I checked https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/150

$ aca-py start -it http '0.0.0.0' 10000 -ot http  --admin '0.0.0.0' 5000 -e http://localhost:8080 --genesis-url http://0.0.0.0:9000/genesis --label 'My agent' --admin-insecure-mode --log-level info --wallet-type indy --seed 00000000000000000000000000faber1 --wallet-name "My Wallet" --wallet-key "somekey"

How do I set up that?

I checked https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/150. I am getting almost same error, but the solution is confusing me. How do I register DID without starting aca-py.

Without --wallet-type parameter, I am able to start agents. But, while accept-request API call, agent to agent communication is not happening. In the terminal, it throws this error:
'''
raise client_error(req.connection_key, exc) from exc
aiohttp.client_exceptions.ClientConnectorError: Cannot connect to host localhost:8081 ssl:default [Connect call failed ('127.0.0.1', 8081)]
'''
I tried to on ngrok port on 8080 and 8081 as well, but it did not make any difference.
PS: ngrok ports on 10000 and 10001 are up.

What am I missing?
Also, can anyone tell if I am doing it correctly?

Thank you in advance

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 11 May 2021 18:57:52 GMT):<br/>
We don't have any examples of that. Generally we have the web service behind the web app talking to both the browser (one channel) and on a separate (DIDComm) channel, talking to an Aries Agent.  We've never had an agent in a browser talking to a mobile agent.
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 12 May 2021 05:44:48 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran so you mean there is no way to establish a secure msging with mobile app and cloud agent? i heard that we need to use a mediator in between for that and there currently some work going on aries framework - javascript to support the official mediator stuff

I want to make the Xamarin Edge Agent an **Issuer** so that it can create Schema and Issue Credentials. Can anyone guide me on the process, please?

If I try to create a Schema using the below code, I get the error **Ledger operation rejected**
```
string schemaId = await SchemaService.CreateSchemaAsync(AgentContext, provisioningRecord.IssuerDid, "Template Name", "1.0", new[] { "Full Name", "Address"});
```
<br><br>

A few points worth noting
- Once the Edge Agent wallet is created, I'm able to get the IssuerDid and IssuerVerKey from the `ProvisioningService`
```
await provisioningService.GetProvisioningAsync(agentContext.Wallet)
```
- The `IssuerDid` of the Edge Agent is assigned the role of an `Endorser` on the Ledger. There is an entry for that on the Ledger.


*I have not got any relevant response on the `aries-framework-dotnet` channel*
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 May 2021 14:00:30 GMT):<br/>
There is between a mobile agent and cloud agent -- that is done all the time.  I interpreted your question as being between a browser and a mobile agent.

Hello Everyone! we are developing Aries + Xamarin based mobile application, where we want to store user credentials, and public & private key associated with DID. i explored over the google but didn't found any way to retrieve private key for user wallet. It would be really helpful, if you can suggest how to retrieve private key and store that in wallet? Any help would be really appreciated, Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>spilling</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 16:50:33 GMT):<br/>
If you are using the [indy-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/) it is not possible to retrieve the private key from the wallet. I believe it was a conscious security decision.

There are projects made recently to break out some of the features in the indy-sdk. For example, there is a project for wallet storage named [aries-askar](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-askar). However, I have not had a chance to determine if this uses the same wallet format as the libindy.
</p>
<p><strong>spilling</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 16:55:13 GMT):<br/>
Since the did is already an endorser, you may be missing the Transaction Author Agreement (TAA) which may be required depending on the ledger in use.

Adding the TAA is not a feature built into the aries-framework-dotnet project. It is recommended to add it by creating a custom ILedgerSigningService, and use the `IndyLedger.AppendTxnAuthorAgreementAcceptanceToRequestAsync(...)` method to append the TAA.

Hello Everyone! We are developing an Aries + Indy web application for identity management in a factory. We have followed the "Become an Aries Developer" MOOC and we now try to create a new schema using the Ariestool Box. Once we have selected the "Create" button after adding the variable for the new schema, it doesn't appear in the list of available schemes. Does anyone cope with the same issue ?

Due to conflict on my side and lack of presenters, I am canceling today's Aries Morning call. We'll pick up the baton again in two weeks time, Jun 2nd. 

If you have any specific topics which you would love to hear or would like to present, please reach to me and we would organize a slot. If nothing new would come, topic for next call would be centralized registry with decentralized control - the way how to go VC registry and goes beyond that - with some examples and demos.

Hey there :wave:
I'm not quite sure how to phrase the question, but: What is the "equivalent/alternative" to root certificate authorities in the SSI world?
For example: In theory, anyone could issue a university degree credential and sign it. How does a verifier determine who is a authorized/trusted university and thus whether to accept the credential or not?
How is the chain of trust going to be determined and how will it look like?
</p>
<p><strong>spilling</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 14:04:16 GMT):<br/>
With Aries/Indy when proofing you could limit by Issuer DID. So limited to only supported Aries/Indy RFCs, it would be up to the verifier to maintain a list of trusted issuers. 

I know that there are groups working on this question. One that comes to mind is [Trust over IP (ToIP)](https://trustoverip.org)

The agent generally establishes a 'peer' DID when creating a connection, ie. a new DID that is only used for that purpose

Hi All, hope you're all doing well.
I've been thinking about a solution to a problem and couldn't find an RFC for this. Perhaps someone here has an additional opinion:

Problem: As a Verifier, I want to know what the public DID(s) of "Firm X" is (are).
Solution: We may know the WWW-URL of Firm X. We could standardize an endpoint, e.g. firmx.com/dids which will return the DIDs in a certain format.
The reply should also contain a checksum of something, which the Verifier enters together with the URL to avoid misspelling problems etc.
In this way we would leverage existing DNS in order to obtain DNS.
Does something like that exist already?

Thanks in advance

FYI - Arnaud (Chair of the Hyperledger TSC) requested a "top story" about each Hyperledger project.  I've sent this in for Aries:

```
The top story in Hyperledger Aries has been the success of the now year old Aries Interop Profile 1.0 in creating an ecosystem of at least 8 open and closed source Aries implementations and countless interoperable deployments of Aries Agents exchanging verifiable credentials, including those for "proof of vaccination" use cases. The next chapter of the Aries Interop story started on May 26, 2021 with formal acceptance by the community of Aries Interop Profile 2.0, which expands that interoperability across more DID methods and verifiable credential formats.
```

Feel free to provide feedback -- we can adjust as needed before the Hyperledger Global Forum.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 02:46:17 GMT):<br/>
A thing to try would be to use a basic message, but the an attachment decorator.  That in theory should get the attachment sent.  Of course the controller has to know what to do with it.

A protocol specific for attachment sending might be useful though.  It would probably be just like basic message, but with goal codes instead of the plain text message.
</p>

Alright folks, With AIP 2.0 Ratified (last week), we finally have agenda time for other topics relevant to the Aries community. What would you like to discuss?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 23:48:09 GMT):<br/>
Without hijacking the topics, there are a few Indy/Aries topics that would be nice to discuss.  

* The handling of resolving identifiers across multiple Indy networks by checking them all to see where the identifier is -- and to how to handle collisions.  Wallet experience, verifier handling, etc.
* The did:sov "universal resolver" does not currently return a DIDComm service block for an ATTRIB endpoint.  Ideas on how to address that?  Where could/should a change go to enable that in AIP 2.0?

I don't have presentations on those, but could start a conversation.

You missed a good discussion -- lots of interesting things.  Universal Wallet, what to do about RFCs that use attachments when we go to DIDComm v2, some Indy DID resolution issues (handling the "endpoint" ATTRIB in the DIDComm world, checking multiple ledgers for an object), and a great question about how a holder should handle a presentation request they don't want to answer (at least not as asked).

when we revoke and reissue new credential. is it possible to trace back and forth between those credentials?
e.g. Let's say we have a holder H, we issue c0 for H. Later on, we revoke c0, and issue c1 to H. Then revoke c1, and issue c2 and so on, until we revoke c2 and issue c4 for H.
Is it possible if we start from c4, and trace back the history of the credentials that we have issued and revoked for H. (start from c4 trace back to c3 -> c2 -> c1 -> c0)?
Similarly, if we start from credential c2, can we trace forward to find the current valid (non-revoked) credential c4?

I guess, the data modelling of my question is that if we treat credential like a doubly linkedlist, which we can traverse back and forth of the ledger?
e.g. i0 <-> i1 <-> i2 <-> i3 <-> i4?

If "we" in this case is the issuer, then you could keep a history.  If "we" is the holder, you can likewise can keep the history. No one else in the ecosystem knows anything about the history.  A verifier that verifies every one of the credentials and notes the differences in the data presented might be able to tell that the credentials are different if (a) they know the prover is the same entity and (b) the data (claims) they request be proven included the differences that triggered the revocation events.

From the sounds of your last paragraph, it seems you might think the credentials are put on a ledger.  To be clear -- with Indy/Aries and VCs in general -- no data/VC goes on the ledger.

Hi all, I have some doubts. Unless Aries RFC 0231: Biometric Service Provider is implemented in an Agent, a person can illegaly "lend" his wallet to a friend, in order to attest, for example that he has the green vaccine passport. His friend only needs to know the wallet password, pin or passphrase, that is because the authentication method is something he knows instead of something he is (e.g. with biometrics), thank you.

Hi everyone, I was wondering if you believe that (A) each holder will end up with one wallet for all of his credentials or (B) each holder will have multiple wallet apps that are optimised for certain use cases?

<p><strong>PaulWen</strong> (Wed, 09 Jun 2021 15:56:22 GMT):<br/>
I currently see arguments for both models but am wondering in particular how credentials from different wallets could be combined to answer one proof request?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 09 Jun 2021 16:03:12 GMT):<br/>
That seems to be a big open question.  It seems like logistically one wallet to hold most of the credentials is the only way to manage and transmit those credentials.  Multi-wallet scenarios (and onerous transfers of credentials between wallets for the users) seem like they're less than ideal.

<p><strong>dmendivil</strong> (Wed, 09 Jun 2021 18:58:11 GMT):<br/>

that's true, but that'll be way more hassle imo.  Seems like the market has to eventually coalesce around a  set of wallets that provide a range of security features.  Kinda like browsers.

Hi @karli0!

We have developed a few concepts here where we're using X.509 both to make the onboarding of new users --towards issuing base identity VCs, and to eventually signing documents and even the content of VCs. (when it's needed by the law).

Hi everyone. Is it possible to manage "data DIDs" in aca-py/indy? This means that the DID controller and subject are different, and the DID controller is an existing did that represents a person.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 13:04:02 GMT):<br/>

```
class SignatureOptionsSchema(Schema):
    """Schema for LD signature options."""

    type = fields.Str(required=False)
    verificationMethod = fields.Str(required=True)
    proofPurpose = fields.Str(required=True)
    challenge = fields.Str(required=False)
    domain = fields.Str(required=False)
```

These values are passed mostly verbatim to the `proof` section of the resulting signed document. The biggest exception is the `verificationMethod` which is obviously used to perform verification on verify. So yes, the possible values are largely dictated by the "Linked Data Proofs" spec you linked to and what you fill into these values and whether it's valid is left to the caller since these endpoints are currently very loosely coupled with ACA-Py.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 14:29:17 GMT):<br/>
I wouldn't say such concepts are used in ACA-Py.  ACA-Py generally only has DIDs on a ledger for the issuer, and for the purpose of issuing, with the only data in the DIDDoc being the public key for the DID and an endpoint.

So please excuse this question if it's a "noob" question... We are building an api on top of aca-py to facilitate our use cases... 

This question is in the context of ACA-Py...

I am just keen to know why there is a concept of "wallet endpoint" and what it is used for? It does not appear to be the same as the more general endpoints for communicating between agents. I'd assume it has something to do with giving external parties the ability to interact directly with wallet? Not entirely sure what external party that would be... When you create a wallet you can set the endpoint, this can also be read and updated.

Hi everyone, in the "present-proof" protocol, is it possible for a verifier to share the proof presentation submitted by the holder with a third-party so that the third-party can also verify the proof? This might be required in cases when there is some legal conflict between a holder and a verifier.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 20 Jun 2021 14:15:33 GMT):<br/>
There is not a technical barrier to that.  There might be a legal one, and a question of consent. It's roughly equivalent to a bartender taking a picture of your ID at a pub and keeping it "just in case".  Definitely a murky legal area -- especially if PII is involved.
</p>
<p><strong>lwyatt</strong> (Sun, 20 Jun 2021 14:23:59 GMT):<br/>
So in the bartender scenario, is it possible for the bartender to prove to a third-party that the picture in discussion is actually binded to some Verifiable Credential?
1. I'm not sure how the third-party will verify (cryptographically) that the picture is binded to some credential. 
2. Is the same also possible even the CL-Signatures based credentials?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 20 Jun 2021 15:10:36 GMT):<br/>
The third party could verify the same cryptography as the verifier  -- who the issuer was, that the claims had not been tampered with/forged, and the proof of non-revocation, if provided.  Using CL Signatures, they could also that the proof was created by the holder -- e.g. the same party to whom the credential was issued.

To get deeper into the specifics of the cryptography, you'll have need a cryptographer to explain beyond that.
</p>
<p><strong>lwyatt</strong> (Sun, 20 Jun 2021 19:17:47 GMT):<br/>
I see. Thanks for your response @swcurran. 

After checking out a few details, I could gather the following:
Verifier creates a nonce (which binds the proof presentation by a holder to the given verifier). If the verifier shares this nonce with the third-party, along with the proof presentation data, the third-party should be able to verify this proof.

Hi everyone, I wanted to know if "auto-ping" and "auto-verify-presentation" tags work with agent version 0.6.0 and Edge agent ?
( I tried creating connection and tried to establish an active connection between Edge agent and acapy (0.6.0) , but the state on the acapy was on "response" . Ideally it should be active if these tags are given to acapy.

<p><strong>akakream</strong> (Mon, 21 Jun 2021 12:41:36 GMT):<br/>
I was also wondering this. When I send the presentation to a third party agent, it cant re-verify the presentation, (I get an error stating that the presentation exchange is not in state "presentation_received".) Is there any workaround to this using the agent API?
</p>
<p><strong>esune</strong> (Mon, 21 Jun 2021 15:38:18 GMT):<br/>
I believe whether the connection is set to `active` or not is a result of `aca-py receiving a ping back from the other agent. Especially when sending a connection invitation, the inviting agent is unaware of the connection being established until it receives something (a ping or any other type of message) from the invited agent.

The other agent in this case is an .net Edge Agent.

And the same scenario used to work with Acapy agent 0.5.6 and .net edge agent

@akakream I don't think it would work like that. You ideally need to create a separate proof request for each presentation that you expect from a holder. 
I don't think we can forward proof presentations for verification by a third-party with the current set of APIs.

Hello everyone, I have a problem, I send a proof of request to my Lissi Wallet and if I have only one predicate or attribute request, the presentation afterwards can be verified in my Verifier agent, but if I request two or more predicates/attributes, the verified status always ends up as false. A colleague of mine found out that it works, if you use an old version of Lissi(0.12), do you have any insights to this problem?

Hi, I am trying to implement a quick PoC of the section C of the W3C standard (https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#subject-holder-relationships) which implies for a Holder to store a Verifiable Credential whose subject is not him, but the SDK raises an error when I try to do that (storing a different-subject credential). Is there any way to implement this with the current version of the SDK? is it in the roadmap to add support for this? T

What are you using -- ACA-Py?  If so, suggest that you open an issue with a detail of what you think is needed.  I'm not sure what is supported.  Quite frankly, I don't understand how the W3C Spec. actually supports Subject is not Holder -- how can that be cryptographically verified?

I think that "subject is not holder" is not a VC issue, but a schema/semantics/VC ecosystem issue.  The only thing about the holder that can be crytpographically tied is that the holder was issued the credential by the issuer.  I don't think anything can be cryptographically proven about a subject that is not the holder.

Also interested in your use case.

Yes, I posted it here but it might be in another channel, maybe in aca-py... C6 effectively describes a situation where the holder has no know relationship with the subject. Also, the W3C proposes in C5, which requires that the holder stores two Verifiable Credentials (the original and the other one) and generates a Verifiable Presentation based on these two Verifiable Credentials. This also adds extra complexity to the verifier, who would need to take this into account for verifying the VP. The example provided is a patient who is too ill to get a prescription and sends a friend on his behalf.

Hi guys, 
I'm trying to create a file and write in the file the time that it takes for Faber.py to initialize and make connections but I can't seem to find that file, no error is given...
I checked the directory that the code is being run and it says it is being run in the folder home/indy/... I dont have that directory and when i try to change it to a directory that actually exists on my computer it says it doesn't (it gives me the errno 2 file or directory doesnt exist..

does anyone have any idea about what is going on?
Thanks in advance

<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 29 Jun 2021 16:52:10 GMT):<br/>
Faber is dunning in a docker container so that is where the file is getting created

There is not an Aries standard for how it's done within codebases. The most advanced implementation that I know of is in ACAPy. That code will reveal their choices, and questions can be asked in #aries-cloudagent-python for more detail.

Hi everyone, on last Aries A call we talked a bit about ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) and today we would see how it works in action. 
HCF are happy to present the work which was done over past year in collaboration with multiple communities presenting the vision of authentic data flows within Dynamic Data Economy. We would show how OCA helps to harmonize the data and link different ontology (data model), then through ACDC it is digest into the system and how components like Data Sharing Engine can make use of that in discoverability mechanism for criteria search. All that with consent driven flow and privacy preserve mechanism. See you on the call!

As I see, there are 3 main ways to encode a VC (which is what we try):
1) JSON + JWT
2) JSON-LD + JWT
3) JSON-LD + LD-Proof

In 3), you provide the signature/proof via the proof attribute.
Then, within 2), you can either a) provide the proof/signature as a ordinary JWT signature as part of the JWT – or, you can/should also add an additional proof property (e.g. for more sophisticated signature algorithms or proofPurpose), as described in https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#jwt-encoding

How does the proof attribute of the JWT has to look like, and how (if at all) does it differ from a JSON-LD Proof?.

aca-py itself does not support handling the SSL certificates for HTTPs. What we usually do is put it behind a reverse proxy that handles SSL and terminates the HTTPs conenction so that external traffic is under HTTPS while internal (between reverse proxy and aca-py) is HTTP

This allows us to scale and balance the number of aca-py instances serving the requests without having to deal with the TLS settings on each aca-py instance.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 05 Jul 2021 15:53:35 GMT):<br/>
We (the team from the BC Government) run our applications on OpenShift, which does a nice job of handling all the TLS termination, routing, load balancing and scaling for all our aca-py insatnce.

Hello newbie to Indy/Aries

 If I'm using a default wallet with sqlite in a Web Agent, its possible to attach to an Indy-cli this wallet if I have (acces to) the files and their key?
 
 ```
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 57344 Jul  6 08:52 sqlite.db
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 32768 Jul  6 08:52 sqlite.db-shm
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 90672 Jul  6 08:52 sqlite.db-wal
 ```

 If storage is Postgresql I think is posibble to do an export/import but if the storage is sqlite I don't know.
 
 I haven't Indy-sdk in the Web Agent.
 
 Reviewing the https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/docs/design/001-cli#wallet-attach documentation there is a file `storage_config` but I havent found documentation about the content of it.
 
 https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/cli/src/commands/wallet.rs
 
 "storage_config", "The list of key:value pairs defined by storage type."
 
 The purpose is to do a backup of the wallet.
 
 Thanks in advanced.

Yes you can use the indy cli to import/export a sqlite wallet (in fact you can export from sqlite and import to postgres or the other way around)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 07 Jul 2021 14:12:00 GMT):<br/>
Postgres has a bunch of extra parameters in the storage config and credentials (there is an example ehre: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/experimental/plugins/postgres_storage/cli_ps_test.txt)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 07 Jul 2021 14:12:40 GMT):<br/>
For sqlite I don't think you need to provide any extra config or credentials
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 07 Jul 2021 14:12:47 GMT):<br/>
(just off the top of my head)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 07 Jul 2021 14:13:41 GMT):<br/>
The only issue may be where the indy-cli looks for the sqlite database.  Try creating a new wallet using indy-cli and then see where it creates the wallet.db file ...

<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 09 Jul 2021 13:34:39 GMT):<br/>
We use postgres for wallet storage when we horizontally scale aries.  (Note this is for aca-py or any indy-based aries agent, other agents may use a different backend database)

Hi. I'm very new to Aries and Indy. I'm trying to run Alice demo for Faber --revocation but I keep getting "trying to detect ngrok service endpoint & jq not found" . 

I have project directory setup as alice >demo> indy-tails-server>docker. i have jq-osx-amd64 file placed at both >demo and > docker yet still failed. Did i miss anything out?  and sorry if I bring this up at the wrong channel. 

thank you.

Thank you for the response  @ianco , I know that I can use Indy-cli to import/export. But my question is if I can import having only the wallet files, no exported wallet with indy-cli. The wallet is not storaged in postgres but in sqlite.

Hi @ianco

  Finally I have found that having access to sqlite files (sqlite.db) and wallet key (WALLET_KEY) you can import into Indy-cli.
  
  I'm using Indy-cli from Von-Network in container mode. And two terminal (T_INDY_CLI, T_INDY_CLI_CONTAINER)
  
  
  Steps:
  
  1. From T_INDY_CLI_CONTAINER copy sqlit.db in a directory (f.e Imported_Wallet)
  2. From T_INDY_CLI start Indy-cli. From vont-network directory (`./manage indy-cli`) and wait until you have indy promt (indy>).
  2. From T_INDY_CLI_CONTAINER copy the directory inside Indy-cli container wallet home directory (`docker cp Imported_Wallet/ INDY_CLI_CONTAINER_NAME:/home/indy/.indy_client/wallet/`).
  2. From T_INDY_CLI_CONTAINER Enter into the indy_cli container (`docker exec -ti INDY_CLI_CONTAINER_NAME /bin/bash`)
  3. From T_INDY_CLI_CONTAINER in /home/indy/.indy_client/wallets/ create a file with name "Imported_Wallet.json" (same name as the directory where the wallet is) and content {"id":"Imported_Wallet","storage_config":null,"storage_type":null}
  4. From T_INDY_CLI list all wallets typing `wallet list`.
  5. From T_INDY_CLI open the wallet `wallet open Inported_wallet key=WALLET_KEY`
  
  If we have the wallet in postgresql we have an example on how to backup the wallet (export/import) at
  https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/blob/master/docs/Writing%20Transactions%20to%20a%20Ledger%20for%20an%20Un-privileged%20Author.md#backing-up-indy-agent-storage

No idea where to ask this so I will put it here: With the introduction of BBS+ Signatures and present-proof-v2, is there a standardized way for self-attested attributes (e.g. I prove some attributes from my digital ID card and add my telephone number as a self-attested attribute - this was doable in the indy/CL + present-proof-v1 world)? From my current understanding, this is part of the proof Attachment Format (e.g. via subject_is_issuer in DIF presentation exchange and a of 'self-issued credential/proof')? Are there any examples how this would look like with the DIF presentation-exchange format and bbs+ based proofs (especially the response to such a request)?

Good question.  I think that the DIF working group might be the best place to ask, but perhaps @shaanjot.gill or @TimoGlastra might not since they have the most experience with PE.  

My guess is that is not supported, but not certain.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 13 Jul 2021 12:46:10 GMT):<br/>
I'll post in the DIF working group channel.

Posted the question and received this back from one of the spec authors:

we talked about this and thought that you could do this by requesting a schema URI of a Self Attested type
But to simply state the Holder must be self attesting, there's the subject_is_issuer flag

If you set that, it will tell the Holder they need to be the source

<p><strong>c2bo</strong> (Tue, 13 Jul 2021 14:02:14 GMT):<br/>
Okay than that part about subject_is_issuer works the way I thought, so basically in a presentation_submission/verifiableCredential array I would have another field for some form of vc where e.g. my own did:peer is the issuer (which then would need to match with the did:peer I exchanged) ?

I basically have a VerifiableProof part that looks like this:

```
{
   "invitation":{
      "did":"did:sov:WSJLpW7o4AgdNWfTwmGbwV",
      "imageUrl":null,
      "label":"ITSI Agent",
      "recipientKeys":null,
      "routingKeys":null,
      "serviceEndpoint":null,
      "@id":"53733975-ad8b-4bd4-8ba8-2e65b909a0a4",

   },
   "connection_id":null,
   "invitation_url":"?c_i=eyJAdHlwZSI6ICJkaWQ6c292OkJ6Q2JzTlloTXJqSGlxWkRUVUFTSGc7c3BlYy9jb25uZWN0aW9ucy8xLjAvaW52aXRhdGlvbiIsICJAaWQiOiAiNTM3MzM5NzUtYWQ4Yi00YmQ0LThiYTgtMmU2NWI5MDlhMGE0IiwgImxhYmVsIjogIklUU0kgQWdlbnQiLCAiZGlkIjogImRpZDpzb3Y6V1NKTHBXN280QWdkTldmVHdtR2J3ViJ9"
}
```
Once the other agent uses this invitation to establish a connection, my controller webhook receives an event, i.e:
```
{
   "accept":"auto",
   "state":"request",
   "rfc23_state":"request-sent",
   "invitation_key":"H3Y63bBHsyeopWcTEZkABsYQxcWJoXXCBJuBcjaQHfcr",
   "their_label":"Verein Agent",
   "their_role":"inviter",
   "invitation_mode":"once",
   "connection_id":"b18c361f-41a0-4bb9-848e-78a4096368af",
   "my_did":"LBdzjqt9BHgs6ar3XbfhVo",
   "updated_at":"2021-07-13 14:16:44.580315Z",
   "routing_state":"none",
   "their_did":"4GR7fysWXmWmpbmSBKGX5g",
   "created_at":"2021-07-13 14:16:44.580315Z"
}
```
My problem is, that there seems to be no relation between the invitation and the resulting connection event. Any idea how my controller could link those together?
</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 12:27:09 GMT):<br/>
Basically, I'm sending an invitation to a specific user. When he or she uses this invitation I need to link the "SSI connection" to that specific user.

The ACA-Py team is happy to announce that Release 0.7.0 became official today. This is a huge upgrade with a significant list of big, new capabilities:

* Support for W3C Standard Verifiable Credentials based on JSON-LD using LD-Signatures and BBS+ Signatures, contributed by Animo Solutions - #1061
* Present Proof V2 including support for DIF Presentation Exchange - #1125
* Pluggable DID Resolver (with a did:web resolver) with fallback to an external DID universal resolver, contributed by Indicio - #1070
* Alpha support for the Indy/Aries Shared Components (indy-vdr, indy-credx and aries-askar), which enable running ACA-Py without using Indy-SDK, while still supporting the use of Indy as a ledger, and Indy AnonCreds verifiable credentials #1267
* Updates and extensions to ledger transaction endorsement via the Sign Attachment Protocol, contributed by AyanWorks - #1134, #1200
* Upgrades to Demos to add support for Credential Exchange 2.0 and W3C Verifiable Credentials #1235

Thanks to all the maintainers and contributors -- there was a lot of community participation in this one!

Has anyone here begun the effort of incorporating the Author/Endorser workflow into the Aries Toolbox?  I have some engineers who are just about ready to begin some coding to do just that, but thought I would check to see if anyone else has either started that work, or would like to collaborate or contribute to the design or coding efforts.

We have incorporated endorsing into this project: https://github.com/bcgov/aries-vcr-issuer-agency: there is an agency and endorser controller driving both agents.

You will need to look in both services for the `aries-agent` class and the `webhooks` class, which will contain the endorsement stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>esune</strong> (Thu, 15 Jul 2021 20:14:04 GMT):<br/>
[This](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/demo/features/0586-sign-transaction.feature) BDD test has all the steps required to endorse transactions, including scenarios supporting revocation.
</p>
<p><strong>esune</strong> (Thu, 15 Jul 2021 20:14:48 GMT):<br/>
One thing to be aware of is, though, that some of the endorsement functionality is subject to change to some extent as we will be rewriting it to be more efficient/user friendly (scope is not yet 100% defined though)

Thanks @esune! I appreciate you sharing the link to what you have done. Are you willing to show us  a quick demo of what you have?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 15 Jul 2021 20:54:58 GMT):<br/>
We have our own non-gui implementation (linked below), so we are familiar with most of the steps, but it would be great to see it in action in a "more GUI" implementation. https://github.com/Indicio-tech/author-endorser-wizards

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 16 Jul 2021 06:35:47 GMT):<br/>
Regards the update that Emiliano mentions. What we want is for it all to be handled within ACA-Py -- the ACA-Py instance is configured to be an author with an endorser, or an endorser, and all the ledger writes are handled accordingly.  The only need to contact the Controller is for the endorser to decide if it will endorser a given request.

We'd love some help on that.  We can help with the definition -- we have that pretty well ready.  Just need to get it done.

@lynn.bendixsen I could guide you through the code - mostly. We have implemented the protocol on both ends, however for our use case we are making it transparent to the users (it is handled automatically by the agents/controllers)

@esune Thanks for the information!  Sounds like you have a "hands-free" approach implemented where an Endorser representative does not actually look at any of the transactions and "approve" them.  Is that true?
While this will not work for our production workflow, a quick intro to how your code is setup would be awesome!
</p>
<p><strong>esune</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 16:14:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes, at least for now that is the approach we have taken - in our use case the "approval" process is when onboarding a new author to the platform and connecting it to the endorser (basically just shifting the agreement so we can automate everything)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 16:16:30 GMT):<br/>
FYI -- there will have to be UI for the endorser in a production workflow to enable decisions to be made  -- endorse or not.  The plan is for the UI to be able to apply rules for automation of future requests from the author -- endorser always, never endorse, endorse for x days, endorse for x transactions, manual approval always, etc.

It's my pleasure to announce that Absa donated React Native Indy SDK wrapper to Hyperledger. The code has been transferred from https://github.com/AbsaOSS/rn-indy-sdk to https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk-react-native preserving all contributions. Although it’s just a wrapper, if you combine it with Aries Framework JavaScript you’ll get the power to build an Aries agent mobile app. If you were a contributor to the rn-indy-sdk, please create a new fork from the new repository to continue the development. Thanks for understanding, and looking forward to collaboration with all of you.

Hey guys, is there a way to transfer a file from the docker container where the agents are being run and the host? it is giving me permission denied when I try to use Docker CP even if i use sudo...

Also, I wanted to be able to run the demo between all agents automatically, but programming is not my strong suit, any ideas on how I can automate initializing the agents and exchanging invites and going through the demo many times? I'm stuck on trying to figure out how I can automate the exchanging invites part...

any kind of help is appreciated! thanks in advance!

Sounds like it might be a networking issue.  The pool times out if it cannot connect to one of the IP addresses of one of the nodes in the pool (or the genesis file) within a certain amount of time.

the genesis url: http://192.168.1.110/genesis
</p>
<p><strong>mateussousa</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:03:17 GMT):<br/>
Even with ngrok
</p>
<p><strong>mateussousa</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:03:26 GMT):<br/>
i got the same timeout
</p>
<p><strong>mateussousa</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:03:31 GMT):<br/>
http://74f52d3bdf8e.ngrok.io/genesis
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:04:48 GMT):<br/>
When you open the ledger browser does the Status section look something like this:
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:04:49 GMT):<br/>

<br/><a href="./assets/gsMbK9ucaGEZBZmrG-Clipboard - July 21, 2021 7:04 AM">Clipboard - July 21, 2021 7:04 AM</a>
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:07:13 GMT):<br/>
The url would be `http://192.168.1.110:9000/genesis` for the genesis file by default, unless you started `von-network` with the IP address of your machine.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:07:13 GMT):<br/>

Sometimes you have to do the following in order for a docker container to see services exposed by the host;

Hi,
I am glad to be a part of this community of Aries Developers.
We are building a product where our usecase is to issue credentials against a skill. Think about HackerRank is issuing certificate to someone for Python and same candidate is getting Python verification for HackerEarth. 

Can we have some pre-build agent to explore for this usecase?
Issuer can be multiple and it will be a M x N relationship between issuer and holder.

Any help or reference will be much appreciated.

Hi,

I'm exploring the VC AuthN Demo (https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/tree/master/demo).

Below is the workflow of the demo

- The Angular demo website (https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/tree/master/demo/oidc-angular) redirects to Keycloak
- The user clicks on "Verified Credential Access"
- Keycloak redirects to the Auth Controller (https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/tree/master/oidc-controller)
- The Auth Controller generates and presents a Proof Request QR code
- The user scans the Proof Request QR code and submits the Proof Presentation
- The Auth Controller generates a token and redirects to the demon website (Angular)

*I'm not sure what exactly happens in the last step. I believe the Auth Controller generates a token and redirects back to the demo web with the token. However, I don't know how the token, (if any) is being generated!*

Can anyone guide me with it, please?
</p>

I'm exploring the VC AuthN Demo (https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/tree/master/demo).

Below is the workflow of the demo

- The Angular demo website (https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/tree/master/demo/oidc-angular) redirects to Keycloak
- The user clicks on "Verified Credential Access"
- Keycloak redirects to the Auth Controller (https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/tree/master/oidc-controller)
- The Auth Controller generates and presents a Proof Request QR code
- The user scans the Proof Request QR code and submits the Proof Presentation
- The Auth Controller generates a token and redirects to the demo website (Angular) ***

*I'm not sure what exactly happens in the last step. I believe the Auth Controller generates a token and redirects back to the demo web with the token. However, I don't know how the token, (if any) is being generated!*

Can anyone guide me with it, please?
</p>

Hello everyone,
I am new to aries/indy development and want to assess which aries framework to use. I plan to build an ios mobile agent that talks to a cloud mediator agent. I am intersted in the usecases around issuing, holding and presenting credentials. I feel overwhelmed by the amount of aries frameworks and I don't understand the advantages and disadvantages.
Here are the frameworks that I consider:
- ACA-Py (Production ready, supports mediator agents)
- Aries-Framework-Go (can it be used as a mediator agent on Indy? If so how?)
- Aries-Framework-Javascript (Is this only for react-native mobile apps or also for nodejs servers?)
- Aries-VCX for ios + Aries VCX to be used inside python or node server for mediation, e.g. NodeVCX Agency (what's the difference to the other frameworks?)

How do I decide where to get started?

You are only looking for a mediator agent, right?  Assuming so:

- the only functionality issue is whether the AIP 2.0 Mediation RFCs are supported.  You will want to use RFCs 0211 and 0212, so if the framework is not using those, it's probably not a good choice. So a quick summary of the information available on each mediator is needed to understand that.

- I would then likely order them into which one I would want to use, all things being equal. 

- Then I'd go through them in that order looking at how to deploy them and try out. It should be pretty easy to spin up a mediator and if you hit friction (lack of docs, not easy to run, etc.), I would move on. 

For such a constrained use case (mediation), it should be pretty easy to get started, so if it is not, look at the next.

`vc-authn-oidc` is built on top of IdentityServer4. When Keycloak request authentication, `vc-authn` generates a jwt that is sent back to Keycloak which in turn generates a new jwt and redirects to the client (the Angular app).

Hey everyone, I was wondering if anyone has any good technical HOW-TO's or tutorials out there for BBS+ signatures / JSON LD credential implementation? Trying to get people up to speed to be able to implement via articles, and github repos is not the easiest.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 26 Jul 2021 17:56:11 GMT):<br/>
What layer of the stack are you talking about?  Adding support for BBS+ to an Aries Framework, or using BBS+ credentials after they have been added?
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Mon, 26 Jul 2021 17:59:51 GMT):<br/>
Primarily on the framework layer but both would be great. We are working on adding BBS+ support to our frameworks. But tutorials for using BBS+ after they have been added as well would be very useful for spreading general understanding.

ACA-Py has an implementation in it, but not a too much documentation on how it was done. Here is the PR if that helps - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1061 and @TimoGlastra has a HackMD document that was used to guide the implementation -- https://hackmd.io/AtgNvApsQ1OAlhnn3Xfetw

As far as using the functionality, ACA-Py has a demo implementation that does VC exchange with BBS+ credentials. From a controller perspective, once ACA-Py has the functionality, there is not much difference between issuing Indy and BBS+ credentials from a coding perspective. Data formats change, but not too much in the coding.  Demo guide: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/demo/AliceWantsAJsonCredential.md

Remember for the implementation, you also have to do DIF Presentation Exchange. Here is the ACA-Py PR for that: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1125

Thanks so much for the detailed getting started guide :slight_smile: 

Besides ease of setup and documentation, do you see any other tradeoffs that I have to consider? Eventually this should become mediator agent that is depoyed to production and has good scaling.

Also I don't understand the difference between the frameworks that are based on libindy vs. libvcx. Should I care?
</p>

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:54:00 GMT):<br/>
libindy in the lower level Indy library for connecting to Indy ledger, using AnonCreds (Indy verifiable credentials) and an implementation of storage.

Not sure if you meant libvcx, but if so, that would be a higher level Aries library for running DIDComm and Aries protocols. I've not heard of it.

If you mean indy-vdr, that is a replacement for the Indy SDK for connecting to the Indy Ledger. There are two other libraries related to it -- indy-shared-rs (AnonCreds) and aries-askar (storage and key management). Together, the three are replacements for the libindy (Indy -SDK).

They are newer, and we think they will scale better than the indy-sdk, but they have not had nearly as much use -- they are new.
</p>
<p><strong>aspannag</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:09:09 GMT):<br/>
I actually meant libvcx and aries-vcx the higher level aries library. I don't understand the tradeoffs of why I should use it over a standard and proven aries framework.

I also read about the efforts of replacing libindy with other libraries to improve scaling. Do you have resources to read up here?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:12:44 GMT):<br/>
OK -- "VCX" means Verifiable Credential eXchange, so it is a library built on top of the Indy SDK to do Aries things -- protocols. It was initially within the Indy-SDK, and has recently been extracted. It is a Rust library and all the goodness that entails -- allowing it to be wrapped in other languages and used both server side and mobile.  Evernym did a lot of the original development of it, and a team from ABSA (and others) are carrying it forward.

Ok. That clears things up, thank you.

Maybe I am overthinking this and I should rather get started and eventually I will see the advantages and disadvantages quickly.

We need something to transform an ios app into a wallet that can manage credentials. And we need a mediator agent that talks to the ios app. I guess for ios we would use vcx (because it's c-callable) and for the mediator agent we can use anything that respects the protocolls. Is that about right?

Yup.  BTW -- for getting started, you could probably even use the Indicio public mediator - https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/ - as you work on the iOS wallet.
</p>
<p><strong>aspannag</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 15:50:14 GMT):<br/>
Yes. That's a great option, too.

Alright. Thank you very much. I got a lot out of your explanations.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:31:05 GMT):<br/>
There is a DID Resolver that makes it straight forward to read DIDs off other ledgers and that's been done.  Writing to another ledger is doable, but has not yet been done.

What ledger are you interested in using?

</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 29 Jul 2021 12:54:21 GMT):<br/>
I think it depends on what Aries implementation you're using so it would be specific to that install.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 29 Jul 2021 12:55:07 GMT):<br/>
Aries is a set of specifications and protocols, things like Aries Cloudagent Python (acapy) or Aries-go-client are implementations of those specifications and protocols
</p>
<p><strong>Nizu</strong> (Thu, 29 Jul 2021 12:59:42 GMT):<br/>
im using Aries Cloudagent Python, so if it is a set of specifications, im assuming that those and their version are specified on the requeriments.txt

If you're looking for version information that helps you understand what protocols the agent supports, how it behaves, etc, then you should look at https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md#aries-interop-profile-version-10
ACA-Py supports aries interop profile 1.0, and is moving towards supporting AIP 2.0 as well.

ACA-Py does not currently have any built in push notification functionality coupled with mediation. This would have to be implemented as a plugin or feature of your controller by processing webhooks/events for the forward message sent event

Hello everyone, welcome after holidays! Due to some other commitment I won't be able to lead tomorrow Aries morning call and wonder if anyone would like to help to kick out the calls after summer break? Or if we should have 2 weeks more to relax? Let me know if anyone would be interested to co-chair those calls as my schedule getting really tied and would appreciate help on that.

I could attend the Wed call that is US morning. I have some concepts related to DIDComm that I would love to discuss. But I don't know if that's the right meeting to bring them up.

Would today's call be well attended -- or do you think people are still in summer vacation mode?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 09:12:13 GMT):<br/>
in EU a lot of people are still in vacation mode so hard to say, But if we properly facilitate the call I think we can couple couple of people.

    ```Created new profile

I have a question concering the intersection of verifiable credentials and DIDs. Suppose I employ a pairwise unique DiD for communication with another entity. Now, does the VC that I want to present need to be issued to the keypair associated with the pairwise unique DID? Or is it only the link/master secret that is required to prove that I am in posession of a credential, which can then solely be proven through the public key of the issuer? Thank you very much in advance :)
</p>
<p><strong>deas</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 17:03:08 GMT):<br/>
I think it's the latter, not the former. (Public DID, not pairwise unique DID.) But I also think that there might be work out there in trying to prove that the VC was truly issued to the entity presenting proof based on it. Is that what you're getting at?

The pair-wise DIDs for Comms in Aries should be unrelated to the DID of the issuer of a VC.  Further, in Indy AnonCreds, the holder is bound to the VC by the link secret, not the pairwise DID.

So, it's the latter of your options.

In AnonCreds:

- The Holder gives the Issuer a "Blinded link Secret"
- The Issuer inserts that into and their own DID in the the VC
- They sign the VC and the claims in the VC using the private keys in the CredDefinition (on the Indy ledger).
- The Holder proves (in zero knowledge) they have the link secret (without revealing it) in providing the presentation.
- The verifier can verify the Issuer's DID and signature on the claims using the objects on the ledger, and that the correct link secret was proven using the blinded link secret.

Hope that helps!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 23:25:35 GMT):<br/>
Note that the model changes with the W3C Standard VCs. At this point, the Holder must have an identifier in the VC from the issuer, and must prove to the verifier they control the private key related to that identifier.  There is no ZKP/link secret capability.

<p><strong>seriousm 3</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 08:46:15 GMT):<br/>
@deas Yes, that is what I am getting at!
@swcurran Thank you for the short deep dive! I understand how it works in Anoncreds using CL signatures and that the issuer basically signs a commitment to the link secret as the first message of the message block which also contains the holders attributes. I guess when you are referring to the current W3C VC standard and proving that you are in control of a private key, you are referring to the utilization of BBS+ signatures rather than CL signatures, as they do not demand for a link secret anymore, but rather allow for one keypair per credential? 
Could you provide some resources on the mechanism where the Holder must have an "identifier in the VC from the issuer"? I don't understand this part yet :)
</p>
<p><strong>seriousm 3</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 08:47:08 GMT):<br/>
And I also can't seem to find that in the VC specification, maybe i just overlooked something...

You have it.  I agree on the lack of coverage of that in the VC spec, and I've raised an issue #789 and a PR #795 about binding a VC to it's Holder.

You can read about my view on that in the issue and PR, and the response from others.

Hi! I am Meng Kang, a Master’s student in Electrical Engineering supervised by Dr.Victria Lemieux. We are looking for people with a background in blockchain, cryptography, or software engineering to volunteer for an anonymous survey. You will first watch a presentation video of our software design research project ‘A Decentralized Identity-Based Blockchain Solution for Privacy-Preserving Licensing of Individual-Owned Data to Prevent Unauthorized Secondary Data Usage’, and then provide your feedback by filling out an online questionnaire. 

Here is the link for the presentation video:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X7epdOwUB0SvDOlKrDeGU8l8eKwWSiLd/view?usp=sharing
Here is the link to the survey: https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3C4Yp2FPiHufmM6
Here is the PDF version of the video: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pbjmTVxWe6HQ4Jge-qR0-xS3nn2rIRAW/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105944806570308548495&rtpof=true&sd=true

The video will take you 20 minutes to watch, and the survey will take you another 20 minutes to complete.

Thank you for your time and feedback on our research.
Please contact me via meng.kang@ubc.ca if you have further interest in this study.

hello everyone, i'm new to hyperledger and i'm trying to use aries-mobile-agent-react-native but i couldn't seem to understand to how to work with the mediator thing or where i should set it up!!
any articles you provide could be super helpful
</p>
<p><strong>mateussousa</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:53:51 GMT):<br/>
I do not recommend to use the suggested mediator. It seems to be very unstable.

Also, the #aries-bifold channel is specific to to Aries Mobile Agent React Native, so is a good place to collaborate.

Hi Everyone today on Aries A WG we would like to discuss the topics related with DIDComm, we would start with high level introduction for those who are not familiar with it and then dive into the far future how this could be shaped into something which we could call "fat protocols" and applicationless ecosystem. 
Details of the meeting as always on the wiki page: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=56723948
We starting at 4pm CET - in about 2h. 
See you there!

when will the "Hyperledger Aries Developer" course start on edx, what changes can we expect from the last course, is there any other source where i can follow or get material
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 29 Aug 2021 19:35:12 GMT):<br/>
I believe the course will launch on Sept. 1, 2021 — this Tuesday. The course follows the same flow as the last version, but is updated with all that has happened in the last year and half.  Everything in it is based on Open Source code, and all the labs point to open source.

I've updated the Hyperledger Calendar to combine the A and B calls. If you are a regular on the A call, the time and link are the same, but now the call happens weekly. If you are a regular on the B call, the time is the same as the A call, now 60 minutes, and weekly. Robert and I will share meeting hosting.

Hi @Anasalamin, sorry for the delayed response, but we've recently updated the Bifold app to allow it to use ACA-Py as a mediator, which should help with your concerns of stability for mediation. You are also welcome to use Indicio's Public Mediator for testing if you find that helpful: https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/

I'm running into some unexpected and inconsistent issues with the Aries test harness (AATH). 
I'm testing using several mobile wallets on iOS (Lissi among others), but I keep having problems accepting the connection request from Faber when executing @T001.5-RFC0037. I have no problem with T001-RFC0160, so I'm not sure what is different about this connection request (I can also execute @T003-RFC0036 without a problem).
The mobile agent gets the connection request, but it's unable to accept it. 

FYI, here's the command I use (this is using ACA-Py 0.7.1RC0):
`LEDGER_URL_CONFIG=http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io TAILS_SERVER_URL_CONFIG=https://tails.vonx.io ./manage run -d acapy-main -b mobile -n -r allure -t @T001.5-RFC0037`

I'd welcome any suggestions to troubleshoot this further!

```

i have tweaked everything i can trying to get it to work but i couldn't.
can the maintainers take this under consideration?

We'll need a lot more detail. We have automated tests that ensure basics like issuing are working, so we'll need details on your setup.  Have you submitted an issue related to this?

Hi all! Our development team at OP Lab has been working with a Hyperledger Aries compatible agency, and we have published the source codes during this summer. The agency has a microservice architecture implemented with GoLang and it includes a WebAuthn enabled web wallet. Communication internally and between agent and client follows gRPC protocol. You can find more information about the project from our announcement post: https://findy-network.github.io/blog/2021/08/11/announcing-findy-agency/ Also documentation and getting started instructions can be found from the project site: https://findy-network.github.io/ Take a peek if you are interested and feedback is of course welcome!

```const credentialRecord = await agent.credentials.offerCredential(connectionId, {
      preview: credentialPreview,
      credentialDefinitionId: credDefId,
      comment,
    });
    console.log(credentialRecord.state);
// OUTPUT: offer-sent```

When propose from the other agent, I receive a message. What am I doing wrong?

Main reason is that we've had more interest from Europe and no one coming from APAC/NZ/Aus, so we felt the earlier time was better.

I made an app agent using React Native. Is an mediator essential to receive inbound messages?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sun, 19 Sep 2021 11:21:32 GMT):<br/>
Generally yes. It is possible to receive messages without a mediator, but you will only be able to receive messages as a response to messages you send to other agents. The other agent should then also support return routing, so it can respond with a message. So I’d advise you to definitely use a mediator

Can I use this?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sun, 19 Sep 2021 11:24:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes, if you’re using the latest version of AFJ from NPM you can use it
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sun, 19 Sep 2021 11:25:34 GMT):<br/>
I do want to note that I wouldn’t call the mediator production ready yet, as it queues messages in memory 
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Sun, 19 Sep 2021 11:25:51 GMT):<br/>
If the agent shuts down all mediated messages are lost
</p>
<p><strong>MiryangJung</strong> (Sun, 19 Sep 2021 11:26:50 GMT):<br/>
Oh, it's a very important fact. I'll keep that in mind.

Responding to messages works based on events. You can listen to specific events (such as the `BasicMessageReceived` event). See the example below:

```
    agent.events.on<BasicMessageReceivedEvent>(BasicMessageEventTypes.BasicMessageReceived, (event) => {
      // event.payload.message contains received message
      console.log(event.payload.message)

      // event.payload.basicMessageRecord contains the record for the stored message
      console.log(event.payload.basicMessageRecord)
    })
```

Hello

  We are trying to work with revocable credentials. Our environmet is:
  
    - VON-NETWORK
    - Indy-tails-server
    - ASP CORE
        Issuer Web Agent
    - Android
        Holder Agent
     
  When the issuer is registering the schema, credential definition and revocation registry definition in the ledger, we see that at REVOC_REG_DEF on "Tails file location" the URL is done using Issuer Web Agent URL + RevocationRegistryUriPath (/tails) + hash f.e
  
  `Tails file location: http://localhost:5010/tails/93kMFCLjSxor5R1V2sAT4vSNfApwsuE9U1FfPLwLrF6s`
  
  When we run Indy tails server tests (./manage test) the "Tails file location" in REVOC_REG_DEF records at ledger are, RevocationRegistryUriPath /tails + hash f.e
  
  `Tails file location:: tails/G92Lei9p8EiBinjdDguigQDLP4PHGVjz6KqHfJPDTZL7`

  Whe have two doubts
  
  1. What is the correct URL of "Tails file location"?
  2. We see hash files created at Issuer agent filesystem but NOT on the STORAGE-PATH of the Tails Server. We are suppossing that the tails files need to uploaded to Tails Server.
  
Thanks in advanced.

The PC(node.js, express.js) agent creates an invitation with http '/invite' and app(RN) agent make connection by open url .
The app agent is using an mediator. How can I connect between app agents?

When creating a creddef that supports revocation, the issuer agent will also create a revocation registry file and an entry to be published on the ledger. You are correct saying that the revocation registry should be uploaded to the tails server: this process should be automatic in aca-py if you have set the `--tails-server-base-url` argument to the base url for the tails server.

It sounds like you might be using the .net Aries agent and I am not sure on whether this is handled automatically though.

Finally we were able to upload the file to the Tails Server but we still don't know the purpose of the "Tails file location" URL in the ledger, i.e., does the prover agent use the URL for revocation worflow, f.e. for "proof of non-revocation"? or is that URL used by someone?

hey there,
i'm trying to establish a connection between the mobile agent and  ACA-Py using Aries-toolbox.
i'm not able to get the credentials notification that were issued from the toolbox.
inside the connection object and exactly in "raw_repr" i keep seeing the "state" as "response"
do you have any idea what does that mean or how to solve it?
``` json
"raw_repr":
{
"their_did": "PqTuCzVXbA9Sp1ajvguybL",

Hi all,How are you? I trust all is well. Our goal is to replace the signature type in aries-cloudagent-python, i.e. replace CL with BBS+ Signature.
After several research, we have seen that there are code implementations of the BBS+ Signature in "aries-cloudagent-python".
Could you tell me more? Is there a way to do this subtitution ? If yes, how ?
Thank you very much in advance !

The would mean that it's correctly sending the connection response to the mobile agent, however if the mobile agent doesn't receive it and reply with a trust ping or other message then the connection will remain inactive from the Aries Toolbox POV.
The issue I've ran into here the most is not receiving the message appropriately from the mediator. If your mobile agent is Bifold I'd be happy to help offer additional guidance :)

It's there and supported.  Today, there are no wallets that support it, but you can do it ACA-Py to ACA-Py and ACA-Py to AF-Go.  Work is beginning on support for BBS+ in Aries Framework JavaScript, and from there into wallets.

To try it out in ACA-Py, take a look at the demo using this guidance:

Verifier agents need access to the tails file in order to check the revocation state of the credential. The URL on the ledger tells verifiers where to go get the tails file for that revocation registry: the URL on the ledger should match the URL you would use to download the tails file from the tails server (or other hosting mechanism of choice).

 {
    "credential_definition_id": "4kfmXB6jB2jB5Knt7uskb6:3:CL:8326:Vacc 1"
}
The question how we can configure the wallet’s ACA-Py to support the BBS+ signature.  Thanks!

You can read how ACA-Py supports JSON-LD VCs in general and BBS+ support in this document:

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/JsonLdCredentials.md

With BBS+ VCs, there is no Credential Definition object per se as it is dynamically generated as needed.

Hi everyone,

I’m trying to implement the following use case:

A prover generates a QR code from any verifiable credential to present a proof to others.
Verifiers scans the QR code and verify the validity of the verifiable credential.

This use case is useful for places that have doors with QR scanner implemented (train, airports) and it would make it easier for people with physical contact to show proof (e.g. entry of a club for age or vaccination verification).

For usability, it should be possible for users to present proof either over a connection for case like authentication on web services but also a connectionless one for physical interaction with other where verifiers only need to scan the QR code of the prover.

I thought to use the Out Of Band protocol with an attached Propose-Presentation message but I am not sure if that is possible. Or could it be envisioned to only send a Presentation message?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 13:33:33 GMT):<br/>
I agree with you on the Proposal -- I think that is the way to go.  It does mean that there are 3 messages flowing, but I think it is the "right" way to do that use case.  Very interested in how it goes.
</p>
<p><strong>adn-misa</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:12:36 GMT):<br/>
I will see how it goes but i think there should also be a possibility for a prover to present their proofs while being offline (no internet connection, etc.).

There is also the concern of speed of verification which needs to be acceptable but i will see it during my tests.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:24:05 GMT):<br/>
Yup...same thoughts. We've not tried just sending presentation without a request, but something to be considered.  Not sure how the nonce would be handled.

Hi everyone, please i need you help. I'm using the demos (alice, faber) with docker and i was trying to do a get (using requests in python) to a server using rest services (localhost:3000) in the alice agent code. I get a ConnectionError exception (Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused',)). I think the problem is that i'm trying to use requests inside the docker container, what should i modify to solve this error?
</p>
<p><strong>Junior22</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 17:36:51 GMT):<br/>
Probably docker doesn't let me connect to localhost:3000, because if i run a simple python program or i use curl it works perfectly

We've helped with some work for offline verification--the biggest challenge is with the transport from my POV, with Bluetooth being likely a good mechanism here. So this ideally would allow you to still exchange multiple messages, which would allow you to use the presentation protocols as we traditionally do.

Hi, I have some interrogations regarding the visibility of the fields in the different exchanged objetcs. Indeed, i have a scenario where i send a proof request with "{{VERIFIER_HOST_URL}}/present-proof/send-request", then I check the proof requests of the verifier with "{{VERIFIER_HOST_URL}}/present-proof/records". As the proof request was not yet "accepted" I would expect the "requested_attributes" not to be visible but it turns out that they are visible. Is it a normal behaviour?

Hi all - I'm just wondering if an agent needs a connection to the ledger as an author. When trying to create a schema with the Author agent, I get an error message that "No ledger available". I expected the author would work with --no-ledger

The Identity Implementer's WG for today (Oct 7th) has been cancelled. Enjoy IIW next week and I look forward to seeing you in our next meeting on Oct 21st!

<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 17:08:22 GMT):<br/>
You need a ledger to create a schema (or credential definition or revocation registry).  Even once the data is written to the ledger, if you want to issue or verify credentials you need a ledger connection to read the appropriate information from the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 17:09:23 GMT):<br/>
An `author` role (vs `endorser`) just means the agent can't write to the ledger, unless they get the transaction endorsed by an endorser
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 17:10:07 GMT):<br/>
PS this all relates to Indy credentials.  If you are using json-ld then you don't need a ledger
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 17:29:28 GMT):<br/>
Further -- the common model is that the author create the transaction, send it for endorsement, get it back signed and then execute the transaction.  That way, the author knows when the transaction is written to the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 17:32:43 GMT):<br/>
(Although there is the option for the author to ask the endorser to write the ledger transaction)

On today's AFJ Weekly call there was a discussion about the need for "a mediator for AFJ" for deploying an AFJ-based wallet.  I've talked to a few people about this and I think the requirement is that we create a new repo "aries-mediator-service" that would work kind of like VON Network -- e.g. it is basically a configurable dockerfile with a mediator configuration for a released version of framework, some "manage" scripts to make it easy to build and deploy, especially for development/testing and (going further than VON Network) scripts/guidance for deploying in production.

What shouldn't matter to those deploying the mediator is what Aries Framework is built upon.  That is an internal detail that should be based on the technical goals of creating this new repo, notably (in order of importance):

- Scalable and performant for large use cases -- ideally supporting millions of wallets.
- Easy to implement
- Capable of supporting additional services that might be added to mediators -- e.g. backup storage for example.

Based on the discussions I've had over the last little while, I think (but am open to discussion) ACA-Py is likely the most ready to start with, based on these assumptions.

- Long term, the performance is likely to be as good as any other.
- ACA-Py is the most complete today -- e.g. the least amount to be needed (e.g. ability to run in k8s for scalability, scalable persistence support, etc.)
- As long as the API to the mediator remains consistent, internal changes can be made to swap in a better solution (e.g. a mediator specific code base)
- It would take just a couple of days to have this repo created and available for use with documentation for anyone to deploy and use.

Please reply to this with your thoughts on this.  Is there a better solution?  Are the assumptions above wrong?  Are there more requirements?  Is there a good reason to have a per framework mediator solution?

Thanks

My expectation was that the author could outsource all communication to the ledger to the "endorser". If I understand correctly, this is not the model, however, the author currently always needs a connection to the ledger. 
What exactly does it have to do with the flag "Create Transaction For Endorser's signature" when creating the schema?
And POST /transactions/create-request "Endorser will write the transaction after endorsing it" ?
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries?msg=Ho94J46Ah22aLTeZh) Right - why does the author need to Ledger in this flow?

Hi everyone ! I'm testing Alice/Faber's demo with docker and I try to running the following request: 
/request-presentation-2.0/{pres_ex_id}/send-presentation
But it return this reponse : 404: pres_ex_v20 record not found: XXX WalletItemNotFound.
I take the pres_ex_id from the Faber's request /send-request and it doesn't work.
Thanks !

Thanks for picking up that topic! Andrews summary is very helpful. The missing mobile notification (Firebase / APNs) feature was the main reason that prevented us from using ACAPy as a medation agent and so we are going with AF for .net.
Because AF for .net does not make use of Askar yet (afaik) we are bound to the experimental postgres feature in Indy. 
There are 4 strategies that we tested:
DatabasePerWallet (load scaling is good but postgres initial db size is 8 MB. Not reliable for multi-million edge wallets)
MultiWalletSingleTable (bad load scaling with increasing connections),
MultiWalletSingleTableSharedPool (bad load sclaing with increasing connections),
MultiWalletMultiTable (not implemented)

We are currently evaluating our own implementation of "MultiWalletMultiTable" that keeps all tables in the same DB but puts the edge wallet name as suffix. If that works good, we will prepare a PR for that.

Thoughts and feedback very welcome.

I'm still new and trying to figure things out. What is the best way to include aca-py inside Docker? adding 'aries-cloudagent' inside requirements.txt or using docker image from https://github.com/bcgov/aries-cloudagent-container? sorry if my question doesn't make sense but my understanding that this is the "clone" of original framework which will be pulled from docker hub while the former is pulled from pip :/

We've started a project that has several parallels to a dedicated mediator service. As this has been a topic of discussion across various Aries calls recently, we wanted to share some of our work for the sake of comparison at least. We find the simplicity and flexibility to specialize an agent like this proxy mediator service to be quite compelling.

Aries Mobile Summit

Calling all Aries Mobile Agent developers!

We have a growing number of issues related specifically to Mobile Agents.

Topics include:

* RFC 496 - Transition to OOB and DID Exchange
* HTTP Mobile exemptions
* UX of Invitations
* SVG Cred Display
* Consequences of Machine Readable Governance on UX
* Embedding Agents into existing Mobile Apps
* Exposing errors / details to users & power users (404 and 503 like errors)
* Unsupported DID Method
* Revocation implications for Mobile
* Mobile Verifiers
* How are we really going to do deep-links?
* Secure Element usage
* Device Recovery (Backup/Restore/Sync/Rotation to new keys)

We want to organize our efforts around these topics.

The first meeting on this topic will be Wed, Oct 27th during the regular Aries WG call at 7am Pacific. During this first meeting, we will discuss:

- Ideal meeting times and format
- Priority of related topics
- Outlining steps to resolve highest priority issues

We'll decide there how best to accomplish the work of addressing these issues.

If you develop mobile apps, please arrange for a member of your team to attend. While recordings will be available, we need your input on these topics.

Thanks!

Hi, I am trying to make an open source Authentication System which will be used as an authentication tool for a crypto-currency based private project.
I am confused whether I should be using the Kadena chain (as it supports more transactions) or should I be using Aries or Indy?
As the summary of explanation says that Aries is a tool, could it be used with Kadena as a blockchain?

So this is not based on ACA-Py or any other Framework?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 21 Oct 2021 16:53:06 GMT):<br/>
Is it worth the distraction of spending time on something that we can provide with less effort?   I really think we need to focus on AFJ AIP functionality and not spend cycles on something we can have with little effort.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 21 Oct 2021 16:54:04 GMT):<br/>
That said, I've not read the proposal (I'm on vacation :-). ) and if this will be less effort than an Aries Framework, I'm not against it.

It really depends on what you want to do.  If you are just resolving (reading) DIDs off the ledger, that should be either trivial using a universal resolver, or easy by adding code in to resolve such DIDs.  Writing is likely a little harder as you have to add functionality into writing. Once you have that, you the other protocols should work.  You would not be able to use AnonCreds, but the support for W3C JSON-LD credentials in some libraries (ACA-Py and AF-Go) should be straight forward.

So not available today, but doable.

Hi everyone. I've just started learning about SSI and Hyperledger project. I wanted to take you suggestions about the right framework to choose, for having two mobile agents, Kotlin and UI Kit, a mediator and an enterprise agent. I've read a lot, and still I'm finding it hard to decide. Maybe someone could help or suggest me to some good reference about the pros and cons. Thank you!

Hi everyone, I am new to Hyperledger Aries and Indy . I was exploring Hyperledger aries for DI and from performance perspective . I am facing some issues in perfomance.
Like with auto issue and auto accept enabled, one request takes almost 6 seconds to complete.

With lot of parallel requests (Let's say 1000) triggered at same time, agent is taking more than 10 mins to process these 1000 transactions.

How can I get better performance and what are current bottlenecks in aries framework?

I think that would depend mostly upon which implementation you were using.  Are you using acapy?

If you are using ACA-Py, you can scale up the number of ACA-Py instances on a platform like Kubernetes.  While there should not be limitations to the parallelism that is possible -- credential generation and the necessary cryptographic operations consume processing power.

@daidoji  @swcurran  Thanks for replying. Yes I am using ACA-py, forgot to mention. 
I scaled aries agents instances to 8 and distributed load using load balancer.

CPU% used in each is less than 50%, but even after scaling to 8 instances (of aries issuer agent), performance is only 2x.

I am not able to identify what is causing bottleneck here.
I tried multiple aries holder instances also (But these were on same machine).

Sovrin Transaction Endorser. Hi we are a swiss based non profit organization, that has been working with aca-py for the last year. We are looking for an organization that can endorse our DID and credential definitions. For aca-py we see that there is a new endorser protocol, which we would be happy to use with any endorser that offers this functionality. Does anybody now of someone who is working on providing endorsing functionality or even better has implemented it already? (We are obviously able to provide legal proof of our organization)
</p>
<p><strong>Ferdinand.wittmann</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 10:08:16 GMT):<br/>

Hmm....we got a lot faster than that on a Kubernetes (OpenShift) environment we had -- around 2000 issuances per minute.

It would be great if you could create a repo with the configuration and so others could try it, and tweak it.  It would also be good to run it with tracing on.

Hi guys!
I want to try the ACAPY demo, but building the VON network (./manage build) already fails with the following error:

Retrying (Retry(total=0, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7fb50cdfdbe0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution',)': /simple/pyyaml/
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pyyaml~=5.1.1 (from -r server/requirements.txt (line 1)) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for pyyaml~=5.1.1 (from -r server/requirements.txt (line 1))

Could you please help how to resolve this issue?

Looks like you were having a connection issue.  I just rebuild `von-network` without any problems.

Hi, i am trying to create invitation json similar to Faber like follows on my custom agent `{"@type": "https://didcomm.org/connections/1.0/invitation", "@id": "cfdd5215-9ca0-4d10-be3d-66af2f07d0d2", "recipientKeys": ["3xRJ3XiDDLVDes24Sk43kgr3k8xv2pY6nVhCVLLs7wV8"], "label": "faber.agent", "serviceEndpoint": "http://192.168.0.14:8020"}` i went through Faber parameters but it doesn't seemed to have used any. Any guidancce is pretty much appreciated.

That's a decentralized question -- different groups have different priorities.  That said, I think the question is great and one that we will work on.  I have write the first cut of the Aries report to the Hyperledger TSC and will try to cover that. 

A quick cut will be:

- AIP 2.0 completion, particularly on the Wallet side (server side is much further ahead)
- A strong focus on an Aries Mobile Wallet UX -- including collaboration on open source wallets that can be used to produce mobile apps suitable for publication in app stores. A (somewhat arbitrary) goal is to have about 90% of the code in producing a wallet be shared and open source.
- Building out implementations of machine readable governance frameworks that can be easily integrated into mobile wallets.
- Continuing to reduce the effort of  deploying issuers and verifiers.

@swcurran Does Aries support non-repudiable proofs as of now? How can a Verifier prove to a third-party (let's say some legal body) that a Holder (say Alice) actually presented proofs to the Verifier? Also, is there a recommended way using which a verifier can prove to the third-party that the Holder indeed was Alice?

Good questions.  The proofs in Aries are just picked up from credential formats, so it is not so much as Aries as the supported credential formats.  That means Indy AnonCreds (CL Signatures) and the two W3C JSON-LD formats/signatures -- LD Signatures and BBS+ Signatures.  AFAIK (but I'm not expert), I don't think the proofs are non-repudiable.  But I recommend that you look at those signatures schemes to be sure.

For the verifier to prove the Holder is Alice, they must collect enough information to know that. For example, in many business context "knowing Alice is Alice" is based on a gov't ID, and so enabling Alice to have that in a trusted way is needed.  For example, in BC, to get such a digital ID, you have to do an online live session or record a video that is both reviewed by a human and checked against the ID database held by the province -- basically a Level 3 Assurance process. Once you have that, the process is to have the holder prove that credential to the verifier.  Of course it doesn't have to be gov't ID -- it's really up to the verifier to decide what they think is sufficient to know Alice the Holder really is Alice.  The verifier needs to know what the Issuer did to verify Alice before they issued a credential.  The governance framework as the basis for issuing a credential is really important.

HI all, 

I’ve recently been working with Hyperledger Aries (versions 0.6.0 & 0.7.1) & have generally found it to be a really amazing framework.

However I notice there seems to be some inconsistencies resulting in errors when executing some of the API calls for the Acapy agents. 

For instance I was able to successfully run a full sequence of schema/credential definition, credential request/issuance & credential verification on a new instance with my Issuer, holder & verifier nodes. 

However, when attempting to run the same sequence again for a brand new set of credentials I get the following error t the send presentation API call:

`Error when constructing revocation state: Error: Invalid structure. Caused by: UrsaCryptoError: Invalid len of bytes representation for PoingG2. CommonInvalidStructure.`


The API Request was constructed using the following details:

Type: `POST`
Endpoint: `http://{{Verifier_IP}}:{{AcaPy_Port}}/present-proof/send-request`
Body: `{
  "comment": "string",
  "connection_id": "{{Verifier_Holder_Conn}}",
  "proof_request": {
    "name": "Proof request",
    "non_revoked": {
      "to": 1636122004
    },
    "nonce": "1234567890",
    "requested_attributes": {
      "additionalProp1": {
        "name": "companyname"
      }
    },
    "requested_predicates": {
      "additionalProp2": {
        "name": "grade",
        "p_type": ">=",
        "p_value": 10,
        "restrictions": [
          {}
        ]
      }
    },
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "trace": false
}`

Could you kindly advise on why this could be happening especially given that the same request has been successful on previous occasions.

Thanks

P.S. I am running this on the sovrin dev network without a Postgres database

Hmm...is the `restrictions[]` array needed on the requested attributes?  I'm not up on the Indy AnonCreds proof request format, but it doesn't look quite right.
@ianco -- any other ideas on that error messa?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 09 Nov 2021 01:43:39 GMT):<br/>
I think the predicate has to have *some* restriction on it.  An unrestricted (revealed) attribute is self-attested, but I don't think there's a corresponding rule for a predicate to not have restrictions

One of the greatest strengths of Aries is the large amount of organizations implementing solutions - and the promise of interoperability between them. But that argument would be much stronger if we'd be able to quantify it. Does anyone know if there's a list or a trustworthy count of companies or products?

I've tried setting both the attribute and predicate to have values for restrictions as specified in the repository (open_api & proof_request.py) as well as swagger ui. Unfortunately after iterating over a variety of combinations I ultimately still had no luck. Could there be something else i'm missing?

Here's a sample of what my restrictions object looks like:

Hi all,

I would like to understand why we include a timestamp in the requested predicates object when sending presentation, given that we would have checked the non-revoked status already if requested in  proof request?

```

        "additionalProp1": {
            "cred_id": "{{Referent}}",
            "revealed": true

    },

        "additionalProp2": {
            "cred_id": "{{Referent}}",
            "timestamp": 1636649578
            }
        },

I don't think it is needed.  Here is an example from the ACA-Py demo of a fully formed (and working!!) Proof Request with a predicate.  There is no timestamp there.

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/demo/AriesOpenAPIDemo.md#faber-sends-a-proof-request

A proof request that asks for a "proof of non-revocation" if the proof request can be satisfied by a revocable credential asks for timestamps, but the name of the field is "non_revoked".

I'm not sure where "Timestamp" is from in your example.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 13 Nov 2021 00:30:05 GMT):<br/>
Ah...wait -- you are showing something from the Presentation -- not from the presentation request.  I'm not sure about that.

That would be in Indy and it's handling.

Hi all,
I am studying Decentralized Identity, and I am trying to put one example running. I have tried to put frameworks like Microsoft Ion running, so that I could set up one small example. I know that Hyperledger Aries allow to store verifiable credentials (I am assuming that it is the same as DIDs), but I can't find one example where I could setup an environment to see DIDs working. Does anyone can provide me some guidance on this?
</p>
<p><strong>arner</strong> (Mon, 15 Nov 2021 09:37:03 GMT):<br/>
DIDs and Verifiable Credentials (VC) are not the same. The VC is the document that contains the claims that can be stored in the user's wallet. The wallet can generate a proof based on the attributes in its VCs. The verifier can then verify these proofs using the public key of the issuers of the credentials. The DID is a way for all the parties to retrieve some public information like public keys of verifiers. The communication between the parties is underpinned by a protocol called DIDComm, which uses DIDs for security and routing. If you have a technical background and are serious about learning, I recommend the following courses: https://www.edx.org/course/identity-in-hyperledger-aries-indy-and-ursa and the second one also includes examples https://www.edx.org/course/becoming-a-hyperledger-aries-developer.

I'm trying to work out a solution to use an Aries (edge) agent a little bit differently then for normal SSI. I'd like to have the ability for the user to sign some text in a way that's non-repudiable and can be verified by others (so not just the counterpart in a DIDComm connection). Obvious problem here is that the user has no persistent public key like an issuer has in a static DID document. So I have a feeling I'm stretching it too far. Or is there a clever other solution that would accomplish this?

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:53:40 GMT):<br/>
Could you go into a bit more depth into why you want to do this and for what use case? That would make it easier to see the possiblities
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:54:44 GMT):<br/>
If you're using JSON-LD credentials what you could do is using the same `did:key` for the `issuer` and `credentialSubject.id`. Basically you're making a claim about yourself in this case
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:55:02 GMT):<br/>
That you could prove to others (`did:key:xxx` said `x` about `did:key:xxx`)
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:55:48 GMT):<br/>
You can either issue it to yourself and use it for proving using presentation exchange
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:56:21 GMT):<br/>
Or you could use the jsonld endpoints to create the VC and share it how you would like
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:57:20 GMT):<br/>
This however doesn't take into account any privacy considerations, but as you want the statement to be non-repudiable and linked to a specific DID maybe that's not needed for this use case

The cloud agent of a company wants the user (using an edge agent) to sign a simple agreement. If they end up in court, they want to be able to prove that that particular person (or a person representing a particular company) agreed to the terms.

There's also a second use case I'm thinking of, where there is proof that someone in possession of a VC that says they work for a certain company agreed to certain terms - and that proof can immediately be verified by three others and then discarded (more specifically; getting multiple peers to endorse a transaction with a verifiable presentation in a Hyperledger Fabric network - without needing 3 connections and 3 approvals and with explicit consent about the content of the transaction. And without changing the fundamentals of Aries...).
</p>
<p><strong>arner</strong> (Mon, 15 Nov 2021 15:53:29 GMT):<br/>
So if I issue a credential to myself, it would use the link secret to help me prove (in 1:1 presentations) that it was me who made that statement in a non-correlatable way, right? But for non-repudiation, you're saying I should include the peer did in the credential? So that the counterparty can say: I had this connection with this person, and previously they identified to me with a proof, and now they confirmed their agreement with my terms.

In my second use case, this would be bad for privacy because this user is now correlatable by the others. In the first, it might be good enough.

VCs and signatures signed by DIDs don't have any legal effects by themselves. It is also true for the static DID of an issuer. You'll need a legal document that guarantees that the static DID belongs to the issuer. And you can also prepare a legal document that guarantees that a key belongs to a user of the company. Then the user could sign documents with the key or could issue VCs to the company.

An iOS agent has added to the indy-sample-agents repo: https://github.com/conanoc/indy-sample-agents
This is just a prototype of a mobile agent for iOS. Take a look around if you are looking for a reference implementation written in Swift.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 20:28:30 GMT):<br/>
Best is to ask on the #indy  or #indy-sdk  channel. Not sure who can help.  The other approach that we've had to fall back on a few times is to go through the Indy tests cases and code.  :-(

*Topic - Wallet backups and portability*

Hi everyone, I was wondering about various possibilities in which a Holder might want to transfer/migrate credentials from one wallet to the other. I'm stuck with what all is possible for the following scenario in the current Aries ecosystem -

Scenario: A Holder owns two wallets - wallet-A (4 credentials) and wallet-B (3 credentials). The Holder now wants to add (or merge) the credentials from wallet-B to wallet-A. In my current understanding of one of the Aries framework (Dotnet to be precise), on doing so, all the credentials of wallet-A would now be overwritten with credentials of wallet-B. So, basically wallet-A would now become almost identical to wallet-B. 

Is there a way in the Aries ecosystem using which the Holder can get all the 7 credentials in one wallet (A, B or a new C)?

For Indy AnonCreds, I don't think that would work -- at least today.  Indy AnonCreds uses a "link secret" for Holder Bind that is generated per wallet. Thus, each wallet instance would have it's own link secret for the set of credentials held. It might be possible for a wallet to track a link secret per credential, which would enable the use case you are thinking about.

I'm not certain of the proof generation process to be certain -- e.g. if a proof is sourced from multiple credentials, do they have to have the same link secret?  That would have to be understood.

I believe that all credentials presented in the same proof have to come from the same wallet (i.e. same link secret)

@swcurran Is it possible to somehow have the same "link secret" for two wallets (in a case where both the wallets are owned by the same holder)? 
I am talking about the case where a Holder can somehow seed the link secret. I do understand that it might not be recommended but is that still possible?
</p>
<p><strong>lwyatt</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 05:32:13 GMT):<br/>
@ianco If we are somehow able to manage the same link secret in two wallets (assuming the link secret generation wouldn't be random and would be controlled by the holder), can we present credentials in the same proof from different wallets?

I think the link secret is created within Indy SDK so we don't have any control over what is created.  However I suppose you could create a wallet, export it, and import it into another wallet/database, and then you would have 2 wallets with the same link secret
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 15:52:22 GMT):<br/>
I don't know what would happen if you did this (copied credentials from one wallet to the other (if there was any way to do that), and then tried to present the credentials together on one proof), either it would work or it wouldn't :-P
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 18:28:45 GMT):<br/>
What he said ^^^ :-).  I suspect that would work.

Hi all,
I was wondering how a proof for a VC is derived when not all of the credentials attributes are presented to a verifier.
So, e.g. I have a credential with my postal adress (street, house number, postal code, city, country) but I only need to disclose the city and country.
I was not able to find any particular method in the W3C VC spec... 
Does anyone have some pointers or know this off-hand?
I appreciate any hints :)

The W3C VC spec doesn't address this issue.  If they did it would be in the VP section.  Rather it is left to signature scheme -- BBS+ (sort of) supports it, and CL-Signatures (although not in W3C VC format).

Basic technique is to canonicalize the data into an array of messages, one message per item that can be selectively disclosed, and then sign each item.

When presenting, present only the items to be disclosed. The signature on each can be checked.

You'd have to go further into the signature schemes to get into the details of the canonicalization, signing and verification.

Some implementations of Aries support W3C credentials including BBS+ and most support CL-Signatures (aka Indy AnonCreds).  Support for AnonCreds is much richer and easier to implements -- the ecosystem around it is much more mature.  JSON-LD makes using BBS+ a lot more complicated, and a bunch of the CL-Signature features are missing.

How this is being achieved ? Sorry I am not able to find the instructions on this specific question in the docs. Please help me
</p>

Hi @Prasad8 2 , there's a channel for [aries-cloudagent-python](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-cloudagent-python) in which this question would be better suited. On your question: There's a flag `--enable-undelivered-queue` that might help, but I'm not into the details of how exactly this works.

@ianco, within the Indy SDK we have access to the anoncreds.prover_create_master_secret() call--which I believe _might_ give us a mechanism for generating the link secret. I _think_ we've been using the behavior that if no argument is provided then the secret is auto generated by Indy. 
Am I thinking along the right lines, or am I missing something?

The secret is auto-generated using an ursa library, there's no ability to pass in a parameter to generate the secret (the parameter is for the `id` of the master secret record in the wallet)

Hello everyone!
Sorry for bothering you.
Have the following issue:
When calling the AnonCreds.VerifierVerifyProofAsync to check if a presentation that was provided with a revoked credential is valid, it always returns "True". 
I use the following proof request:
```
   "name":"Test Verification",
   "version":"1.0",
   "nonce":"483754409945318649274168",
   "requested_attributes":{
      "test-verification":{
         "names":[
            "FirstName"
         ]
      }
   },
   "requested_predicates":{
      
   },
   "non_revoked":{
      "from":0,
      "to":1637675098
   }
}
```
I also check if the credential was revoked at the holder side, by calling the IsRevokedAsync method from the .Net Aries library, and, on this side, it sees the credential as revoked.
Also opened a github issue https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/issues/206.
Does anybody have any idea? Would appreciate any suggestion. 
Thank you!

Guys, one blind question. Does agent support more than one controller (I mean, *before/without Multi-Tenant feature*)? I believe, the answer is "No" If it supports, is it possible to configure more controller's urls in WEBHOOK_URL variable? I can't think about any scenario where agent should support multiple controllers in non-multi-tenant scenario. Please throw some light on this.

Hi, I have two questions. I have been experimenting with the aca-py Faber Demo. I already have a seed and registered the DID at BCOVRIN test network.  I would like to pass the seed from the command prompt.  But I could not find any way to pass a seed into the Faber agent. Can someone let me know what would be the approach to handle this scenario? Second question, how to make the wallet persistent so that it does not create a wallet every time the agent is run? Thank you very much.

1. passing a seed to faber isn't currently supported.  However it would be straightforward to add a new parameter to pass in this information.  The parameters are defined here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/demo/runners/agent_container.py#L988
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 15:18:58 GMT):<br/>
2. by default the agent uses a sqlite (file-based) database for the wallet.  This database is located inside the docker container and will be removed when the container shuts down.  However you can run the agent using postgres for the back-end database, in which case the wallet will persist in the database when the agent shuts down.  There are some instructions for running with postgres here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/main/demo#run-a-local-postgres-instance
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 15:21:08 GMT):<br/>
You can use more than one controller with a single agent, but IMHO that's an anti-pattern (although some people have been looking at this approach for certain use cases).  I think you can specify multiple webhook url's using the `--webhook_url` parameter.

On the first question. The idea of passing a seed has been proposed before and rejected because of the security risk. We think it is a very bad idea to pass what amounts to a private key across a REST interface.

Hi all. 
I recently got the demo working using Von-Network. Pretty cool. 
I am wondering what it would take (if it would be possible) to swap out von-network for an etherium node. I have local ethereum dev (ganache-cli) set up, I am wondering how easy would it be to start using that. Could someone point to docs / guide on that?

Hi all. 
I recently got the demo working using Von-Network. Pretty cool. 
I am wondering what it would take (if it would be possible) to swap out von-network for an etherium. I understand that Aries is meant to work with Indy, are other ledgers supported? I keep reading different posts and keep getting different answers. Many mentioned that it is not possible, while others say that it is under development to add different ledger support to aries.
</p>
<p><strong>SargisDudaklyan</strong> (Sun, 05 Dec 2021 04:14:39 GMT):<br/>
i found an answer https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/issues/132 that it is impossible to do. Is this still true?
</p>
<p><strong>SargisDudaklyan</strong> (Sun, 05 Dec 2021 04:16:22 GMT):<br/>
it would be nice if we could pass in etherium address to "ledger-url" when starting up Aries ACA-PY agent.
</p>
<p><strong>SargisDudaklyan</strong> (Sun, 05 Dec 2021 04:16:22 GMT):<br/>
I am using ACA-PY agent. I thought it would be nice to include etherium address in the genesis file.. not sure if that is possible
</p>
<p><strong>SargisDudaklyan</strong> (Sun, 05 Dec 2021 04:36:25 GMT):<br/>
What I am doing right now is writing a schema to the ledger, writing credential definition, issuing VCs, and then verifying it. 
I assume it wouldn't be trivial to just swap out von-network for ethereum and see it work.

Hi All, Can someone pls help me to understand this. How in agent-agent communication the mediator components keeps track of mobile devices ? What is the driving factor and the attribute that the issuer or mediator component understands that a particular device is registered to send and receive message ? What happens if the mobile wallet holder, reinstalls the Indy wallet app in new device and restores from backup ? How the mediator component keeps track of the devices ?

Hi all, I'm debugging an incompatibility between two agents I'm trying to connect.  IBM Verify Credentials and AF .NET.  It seems to be an issue where the format of the forward message from the invitee isn't correct OR the inviter agent isn't handling the format correctly.  So I guess I'm asking if there is any way through the Aries Test Harness to look at message flows through the various agents and see what is being processed.  Or if examples are available anywhere.  In my specific case, what is a https://didcomm.org/routing/1.0/forward message supposed to look like?  Any pointers would be appreciated!
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:19:27 GMT):<br/>
There's nothing in AATH itself - the messages are secure and private between agents (peer-to-peer) so you will need to debug on each of the agents to see what is going on

@ianco sure, that is what I'm doing.  But my problem is I don't know what it is supposed to look like.  I was hoping that if both agents were run by AATH then AATH could retrieve logs from each agent after a test run to show the results.  But maybe I'm misunderstanding how AATH works.  I'll try to look more into it this week

The log files for the agents are captured to the `.logs` directory (I think)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 14:26:47 GMT):<br/>
AATH runs the agents as docker images, so doesn't have any visibility into the internals of what each agent is doing (including message formats)

- how can I create a proof  of a a credential (let's say a RSA signature for the sake of simplicity) ?
- and how can the receiver or the verifier of the credential verify the signature? 
Any hint is very welcome, thank you in advance

There are other working groups for specific implementation framework (such as ACA-Py and AFJ), but the main Aries working group is probably the right place to start.
I believe there's a call planned for Wednesday next week, but I believe this will be the last meeting of what started as the "Aries mobile summit". @TelegramSam could you confirm?

Hi all. In the demo, there is an example with age verification.
I am thinking of a solution that could work for moving age.

Assume that you are 20 and you got were issued VC. Tomorrow you turned 21 and you would like to use your VCs to prove to a bartender that youre over 21. What is the best way to accomplish this without reissueing new VCs?

Your approach sounds good to me. It will definitely work.

With AnonCreds, predicates only work with integers. As such, a Unix epoch (timestamp) can be used, but has the downside of being pretty ugly to display to the user.  A clever solution that is used in the community is to have the DoB as an integer such as 20011013 (for 2001.10.13) and provide the argument for the predicate in the same way.  Works well for dates, not so well for date time.  This is part of Aries RFC 441 -- https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0441-present-proof-best-practices#dates-and-predicates
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 15:36:38 GMT):<br/>
We're also working on a separate way to enable proper display of data encoded in different ways, and if that approach proves viable, the Unix epoch approach might become more viable.  We'll be talking about that at some of the upcoming Aries WG Calls if you are interesting.

Hello, I see that very old indy-sdk (1.11.1) (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/requirements.indy.txt) being used in even latest version of ACA-Py. If am I referring to right place, any specific reason to use older version of indy-sdk? Aprreciate your inputs. Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 14 Dec 2021 05:16:03 GMT):<br/>
That’s a minimum version (for the python wrapper). We might want to increase that though

Hey guys, Im quite new to this. I have been trying to create a new schema on  http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io/ however, I get an AriesFrameworkException: Ledger operation rejected exception. I assume this is because my agent doesnt have the assigned role of an Endorser on the network? My question is how does one assign that role to an agent if that is the problem I am having?
</p>
<p><strong>kalyankonda</strong> (Tue, 14 Dec 2021 07:15:12 GMT):<br/>
Got confused...Is that python version or indy-sdk version? How do I know that which indy-sdk version is being used in latest aca-py version?

I believe it's picking up the latest, with the minimum set to 1.11.1, but we'll confirm. Certainly should be the latest.

Call to Participate - DIDComm User Group

Now that the DIDComm v2 spec is nearing completion, and there are robust libraries in multiple programming languages, we are starting a user group to share learnings as we put DIDComm into production. We will organize community resources, produce a handbook, foster application-level protocol creation, maintain the didcomm.org website and repo, and recommend best practices. We invite anyone who's interested to register in the user group's email list or discord channel:


Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/F4Qw7h6Sr9
Mailing list: https://lists.identity.foundation/g/didcomm-usergroup

The first regular meeting will be held in January (10-14), with meeting selection to happen prior on the above communication methods.

Although this UG is sponsored by DIF, this is not an IP-protected context. We won't be developing specs or working on standards. Thus, you don't have to be a member of any particular org to join, and there are no legal terms to review or paperwork to sign.

Please join us!

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 22 Dec 2021 19:13:46 GMT):<br/>
BC Gov has posted a funded "Code With Us" Challenge for individuals/teams interested in updating Hyperledger Indy to support the new `did:indy` DID Method, specified [here](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/). The opportunity and response guidelines are [posted here](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace/opportunities/code-with-us/e3dd1605-cc1d-4c30-a9ee-245940bccd0d). The total funding for the challenge is $70,000CDN and is divided into 4 phases. The first 3 phases require the use of Python working on the [Indy Node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node) and [Indy Plenum](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum) repos, while the 4th phase requires Rust development in the [Indy VDR](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr) repo. Those responding may choose to apply for only the Python work, only the Rust work or both.

Questions can be asked here or on the website hosting the opportunity.

Applications for the challenge will be accepted up to January 10, 2022. and the work is expected to begin shortly after that date, with completion expected by March 31, 2022.

I was trying to upload my app to Google Play Store, but they weren't allowing me to publish it.

```
Your app currently targets API level 29 and must target at least API level 30 to ensure it is built on the latest APIs optimized for security and performance. Change your app's target API level to at least 30. 
```

**Changes in Manifest File**

I then removed these permissions from Manifest File.

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

**GetExternalFilesDirs()**

And also used to `GetExternalFilesDirs()` to create folder, as per [android documentation][1]

**Starting in Android 11, apps cannot create their own app-specific directory on external storage. To access the directory that the system provides for your app, call `getExternalFilesDirs()`.**

So, I changed in code:

`Path.Combine(FileSystem.CacheDirectory, config.Value);` **to** `Path.Combine(Android.App.Application.Context.GetExternalFilesDir(FileSystem.CacheDirectory).AbsolutePath, config.Value);`

**Run time Permissions to Read & Write**

When I removed Read & Write Permissions from Manifest file, I couldn't create folder, I enabled the run time permissions, without adding Read & Write permissions in manifest file, now I'm able to create folder.

```
await CrossPermissions.Current.CheckPermissionStatusAsync(Permission.Camera);
await CrossPermissions.Current.CheckPermissionStatusAsync(Permission.Storage);
```

**Changes in MainActivity.cs**

I also used `GetExternalFilesDir` in `MainActivity.cs`.

```
var host = App.BuildHost(typeof(PlatformModule).Assembly)
.UseContentRoot(Android.App.Application.Context.GetExternalFilesDir(System.Environment.GetFolderPath(
System.Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal)).AbsolutePath).Build();  // Android requires that we set content root.
```

And according to this [comment][2]:

```
var version = CrossDeviceInfo.Current.Version;

if (int.Parse(version) >= 11)
{
	Android.Systems.Os.Setenv("EXTERNAL_STORAGE", GetExternalFilesDir(null).AbsolutePath, true);
}
```

**Action Required: Your app is not compliant with Google Play Policies**

After all these changes, I'm unable to publish app on Play store. Received an email:

**Issue: Need to use Media Store API or No Access to Files**

*You have requested access to All Files Access permission but it appears that your app's core feature requires access to only Media Files or does not need access to any Files. In case your app needs access to Media Files, with the MediaStore API, apps can contribute and access media that's available on an external storage volume without the need for the access all files permission.*

*Please update your app so that the feature uses Media Store APIs and remove All Files Access (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) permission.*

You could use `GetFilesDir` which locates the android internal storage path instead of `GetExternalFilesDir`. And then the storage permissions will not be needed.

There isn't any function available in C#: `Android.App.Application.Context.GetFilesDir();`.

Instead these are available:

```
Android.App.Application.Context.GetDir();
Android.App.Application.Context.GetExternalFilesDir();
Android.App.Application.Context.GetExternalFilesDirs();
```

Hello All,
</p>
<p><strong>kalyankonda</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 11:30:34 GMT):<br/>
I understand that Aries is supporting string/text data type alone currently. Any idea on supporting complex data types (such as documents, images etc.) along with other common data types ( such as date, bool, decimal numbers etc.). Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 12:09:59 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's what I was using earlier.. same issue.. please have a look on this GitHub Issue: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-xamarin/issues/53

Hey all, I am trying to figure out the differences between Indy and Aries and the correlation they have. Can anyone explain that to me?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 22:18:11 GMT):<br/>
The short version:
Aries was (originally) built on Indy and incorporates several layers of abstraction that hide many of the technical complexities of Indy and allow a developer to concentrate on developing the business logic for their application.
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 22:23:07 GMT):<br/>
Is Aries still built on indy?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 23:07:07 GMT):<br/>
It still uses Indy, but there are separate shared RUST libraries being developed to overcome some scaling limitations of the indy-sdk.  The one of which is https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-askar that Aries can now optionally use.

<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 08:55:35 GMT):<br/>
Sorry. I'm confused that I may need permission to use external storage, but I don't need permission to use external storage just for app-specific dirs.

So, you can use external storage without permission. The problem seems to be this:
`GetExternalFilesDir(FileSystem.CacheDirectory)`
</p>
<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 08:57:02 GMT):<br/>
`GetExternalFilesDir` takes `type` as a parameter, but you used the wrong one.
</p>
<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 09:03:42 GMT):<br/>
Cache dir should be `FileSystem.CacheDirectory` as before, and the content root should be `System.Environment.GetFolderPath(System.Environment.SpecialFolder. ApplicationData)` instead of `Android.App.Application.Context.GetExternalFilesDir(System.Environment.GetFolderPath(
System.Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal)).AbsolutePath`

These are some of the folders I'm accessing in the app. Should I use this `System.Environment.GetFolderPath(System.Environment.SpecialFolder. ApplicationData)` for all of them?

`Android.App.Application.Context.GetExternalFilesDir(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData)).AbsolutePath`

`Android.App.Application.Context.GetExternalFilesDir(FileSystem.CacheDirectory).AbsolutePath`

`Android.App.Application.Context.GetExternalFilesDir(FileSystem.AppDataDirectory).AbsolutePath`

Indy AnonCreds supports strings and integers. All strings are hashed into an integer, and it is the integer that is actually signed - as defined here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0036-issue-credential#encoding-claims-for-indy-based-verifiable-credentials

As such, it is possible (and has been done) to encode different data types into strings -- e.g. base64 images to text. To do that, both the issuer and the verifier (at least) and usually the holder have to agree about the format of the strings -- how to decode them.

We are currently looking at the possibility of using Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) as a way for the issuer to express what they are issuing. We're primarily looking at OCA for localization (multi-language support of labels on data), but data formats would also be supported.

Generically, Aries protocols support multiple DID Methods (including Indy DIDs/ledgers, but also did:key, did:orb, etc.) and verifiable credential formats (including AnonCreds which is in the Indy SDK and W3C VCs). Different Aries deployments support a range of DID Methods and VC formats -- most support Indy DIDs and AnonCreds, some support other DID Methods and W3C VCs and some support both.

I cannot imagine any of the two lines above could throw IOException. Can you show the details of the IOException?

Beside that, why do you use cache dir for the genesis file?

I see. It could be treated as a cache file, but it could also be treated as an application resource and you could use `System.Environment.GetFolderPath(System.Environment.SpecialFolder. ApplicationData)` if `FileSystem.CacheDirectory` has some issues.

Hi, we've been trying to implement https on our mediator/issuer/verifier/mobile agent. We also enabled [UseMessageTypesHttps](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/e06398d3c2c16d43d0ca0e64ce3d5180d7904f15/src/Hyperledger.Aries/Configuration/AgentOptions.cs#L178) in agent configuration. Our agents are deployed on AWS EC2 servers with SSL enabled.

Is there anything else we have to change in the code? or in the configuration? any resources on that?

how can I retrieve the private/public key of a DIDconnection using 'myDID' ? I need the keys for signing a Presentation
thanks for supporting
</p>
<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 11:47:25 GMT):<br/>
I used `System.Environment.GetFolderPath(System.Environment.SpecialFolder. ApplicationData)`.

and removed the `android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"` in Manifest file. 

Same Pool error.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 12:35:48 GMT):<br/>
Are you asking about `https` in the message type names or network communication? To my understanding, switching the UseMessageTypesHttps will enable it for the type names.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 12:38:05 GMT):<br/>
As far as using it for network communication, that's dependent on your agent and server communication. Most commonly this is done by intercepting traffic using a proxy (like nginx or envoy), terminate TLS and route it to your agent.
As far as TLS setups, this is dependent on your cloud/dns provider.
</p>
<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:07:36 GMT):<br/>
For both. If I switch to `UseMessageTypesHttps`, do I have to make changes in the Controllers (Connections, Credentials, Proof)?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:09:07 GMT):<br/>
Based on the comment on that property, I would say no.
```
/// Gets or sets the value for UseMessageTypesHttps.
/// Only affects messages created by the default services,
/// if you create additional messages you have to set the useMessageTypesHttps via ctor too
```
</p>

Inconsistent behavior when issuing multiple credentials in sequential. Some of the issuances are failing with error "400 Revocation registry metadata not found".
Agent version: 0.7.2
Wallet-type: askar
Agent API invoking from Controller: /issue-credential/records/{credential_exchange_id}/issue

Note that issue is not consistent and happening only when we use wallet type as askar (when we tested with indy as wallet type then no errors). Let’s say when we issue 10 credentials, sometimes all 10 are getting succeeded and sometimes few requests are failing with above error. The error rate is proportional when we go for bulk runs. Recently, we have upgraded agent to 0.7.2 version and wanted to understand if we are missing anything.

Below are the command line parameters (values are masked for security reasons).

[ "/bin/bash", "-c", " aca-py start -it http 0.0.0.0 10000 -ot http --admin 0.0.0.0 5000 -e http://abcagent:10000 --wallet-type askar --auto-provision --log-level debug --seed <some 32 chars> --genesis-url http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/genesis --label 'Example label' --admin-insecure-mode --auto-respond-messages --wallet-storage-type postgres_storage --wallet-storage-config '{"url":"abcpostgresserver:5432","wallet_scheme":"DatabasePerWallet"}' --wallet-storage-creds '{"account":"abcuser","password":"abcpassword","admin_account":"abcuser","admin_password":"abcpassword"}' --wallet-name wallet-askar --wallet-key dicept_key --tails-server-base-url http://abctailserver:6543" ]

I tried it myself and I could reproduce the same io error.
But, the error did not occur when I added `Android.Systems.Os.Setenv("EXTERNAL_STORAGE", GetExternalFilesDir(null).AbsolutePath, true);`

CacheDirectory was not a problem.
I suspect the version checking using the `CrossDeviceInfo` is the culprit. And you don't have to check the version. That env variable is preferred for any version of android.

I set the `EXTERNAL_STORAGE` in `MainActivity.cs` to:
`Android.Systems.Os.Setenv("EXTERNAL_STORAGE", System.Environment.GetFolderPath(System.Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData), true);`

and removed the `requestLegacyExternalStorage` from `AndroidMainfest.xml` file.

Now, on Android 9, 10, 11, the Wallet & Pool is being created.  No `indy_client` folder in external storage anymore.  And Credential Issuance, Revocation and Verification is working perfectly fine.

But still can't upload on `Play Store`, same issue.

I analyzed the `.apk` using `Analyze APK` feature in Android Studio, and in that, `AndroidMainfest.xml` has `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, while in my project's `AndroidMainfest.xml` file there isn't any `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions.

Though, I ask for `CrossPermissions.Current.CheckPermissionStatusAsync(Permission.Storage)` on run time, but when I removed it and Analyzed the APK, still it includes `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions in Manfiest file.

yes. I removed it from `AssemblyInfo.cs` too.. Same Issue.. Maybe they can be merged from the dependent library. Is there any way to check if the library used have those permissions in their Manifest file.
</p>
<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 08:03:10 GMT):<br/>
I don't think the libraries can affect the manifest file. How about try a clean build and make sure that it's a release build.

<p><strong>zossimov</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 11:21:36 GMT):<br/>
I looked into it and found this article *[How Libraries can silently add permissions to your Android App][https://medium.com/glucosio-project/how-libraries-can-silently-add-permissions-to-your-android-app-620911d7de6c]* and the *[Fix][https://github.com/Glucosio/glucosio-android/commit/2f48b314b82a252df2ca20cd2811c464e965887b]*. **It Worked**.
 
But I'm using camera, and I was storing these pictures in the `Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData)`. Which requires `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions.

So, I replace the path with `FileSystem.CacheDirectory` and it worked (Intenral Storage doesn't requires Read and Write Permissions in Manifest file).

There is a new repo called "aries-mediator-service" that is to be used as a mediator. It is a pre-configured version of ACA-Py. It should be useful for both developers wanting to spin up their own, or as the basis for a production mediator.

When a presentation is received from a verifier, is there a way to keep that presentation "open" so the verifier can always have access to that presentation?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:42:42 GMT):<br/>
I assume you mean "received by a verifier".  

From a general a general Aries coding perspective, the verifier can keep the presentation and recheck it if they want.

From a specific implementation -- it would depend on what the the framework you are using has implemented.  I think in any framework, the controller could save the presentation.  Some frameworks may hang on to the presentation in secure storage, and so in theory you could re-process it - others may not.

In either case, you would need a way to invoke the "verify presentation" on the saved data. I suspect that few frameworks include a way to do that directly -- it would have to be added.  In ACA-Py, that could be done via a Plugin, or if it really makes sense, could be added to the core.

Is there a good use case for using this as a general feature?
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:45:05 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, that's what I mean. I feel like this would be a good use case for companies to be able to display user profiles on their application without the need for a separate database.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:46:25 GMT):<br/>
This is an example of an aca-py plug-in that can "re-verify" a received proof:  https://github.com/AnonSolutions/aca-py-audit-plugin
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:46:49 GMT):<br/>
The verifier is responsible for saving the proof and proof request though
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:46:59 GMT):<br/>
My thought was that you could use a secure connection and an ID to a presented credential to be able to access that credential again without having to request it again.
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:47:58 GMT):<br/>
That would work, but is there a possibility to implement a feature that allows you to use the ID of the presented credential to access it from the users wallet?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:50:31 GMT):<br/>
Our policy has been to not save protocol objects in the wallet (aka secure storage) after use as (in our opinion) is the responsibility of the business logic -- the controller.  That keeps the secure storage smaller (things are deleted), only necessary items are kept in the wallet long term (e.g. private keys, connection records, etc.).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:51:26 GMT):<br/>
Not required, but that works well in our environment where Agents are provided as a service to business apps.  Agents are then holding less PII -- only transient holding.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:52:01 GMT):<br/>
Of course...then the controllers are holding more PII -- which is what you are proposing to avoid.
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:54:59 GMT):<br/>
Exactly. If an agent of a company was to keep the info of agents, it would, in a way, ruin the no central storage idea that seems to be promoted by SSI. So I was wondering what the best way to do that is.
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:55:47 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking that you could use something like a connection ID to have access to certain aspects of a verified credential to be able to display on an application
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:59:33 GMT):<br/>
What we have used in the "issue credential" model is to allow three options for the protocol state object -- keep in full (lots of data, all the back and forth messages), keep minimal (minimal info kept about issuance) and delete.

The same could be done for presentations. Keeping the entire state is a lot, but keep just the minimal might be useful.

it's a reasonable option. 

If this is using ACA-Py, could you capture some of this and put it in an issue for discussion?  Perhaps a discussion on the ACA-Py User Group meeting would be a good idea. Those with high volume experience could weigh in.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 23:00:39 GMT):<br/>
If you need it Real Soon Now, you could do a plugin, get some discussion going and community agreement, and then do a PR.

Thank you. I will see if I can put this in as an issue. Also, when is the next ACA-Py User Group meeting?

<p><strong>shanest</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 07:21:41 GMT):<br/>
this maybe a silly question but how do I pass arguments using ACAPY_INBOUND_TRANSPORT= inside docker compose, it requires 3 arguments. e.g http 0.0.0.0 8080 I tried to wrap it with ""  but doesn't seemed to work as well
</p>
<p><strong>shanest</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 07:23:32 GMT):<br/>
I have been using command: http 0.0.0.0 3000 for now and thinking to tidy up the whole thing

Hi @shanest , I don't know the answer offhand, but the underlying library being used is https://pypi.org/project/ConfigArgParse/, so that documentation may help
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 14:21:41 GMT):<br/>
The inbound transport is a complicated parameter, because it has multiple values and there can be multiple inbound transports
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 14:22:02 GMT):<br/>
You can also specify it in a yaml config file, there i an example here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/demo/local-indy-args.yaml#L17

(this might also give some hints as to what the env var syntax may be, for example try `"[http, 0.0.0.0, 8030]"`)

Hey folks! We are running a Hyperledger Aries workshop today, and will be directing deeper questions to this channel to help folks gain some familiarity with Aries community channels. Several of us working with the workshop will be monitoring to help folks with questions. The workshop starts in 15min, and will last 4 hours.

Thanks!

@richzhao Did you find a resolution to this issue?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:51:24 GMT):<br/>
Most NPM module install issues are due to conflict with other modules. For once, the provided instructions of clearing `node_modules/electron` is the most likely solution.

I'm working through these steps (I realize they're #indy material), but want to keep it in #aries per the workshop guidelines. https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/cli/README.md#binaries Any better / more recent instructions I should try?

Because of the large number of attendee's today we chose to have everyone use linux for the "hands-on" portions. There are instructions available for Mac, but we will not be supporting those during the workshop (happy to help after the training). This site has some MAC install instructions for indy-cli https://docs.google.com/document/d/18-8MiRRuxVHn-FFWyd8LHukPNl_WNzo-tJtXK9bmZfY

We'll do our best to work with you to solve problems with the prerequisites. We had hoped that most of these issues would have been found and addressed during our office hours earlier this week where one-on-one help was available. If you get stuck, you may find it useful to just follow along with the presentation and pursue the hands-on portion via the recording after you are able to solve the issues you encounter.

Call to Participate - DIDComm User Group

Now that the DIDComm v2 spec is nearing completion, and there are robust libraries in multiple programming languages, we are starting a user group to share learnings as we put DIDComm into production. We will organize community resources, produce a handbook, foster application-level protocol creation, maintain the didcomm.org website and repo, and recommend best practices. We invite anyone who's interested to register in the user group's email list or discord channel:

Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/F4Qw7h6Sr9
Mailing list: https://lists.identity.foundation/g/didcomm-usergroup

The first regular meeting will be held in January, with meeting selection to happen prior. Please fill out our survey: http://whenisgood.net/d8dkhgi

Although this UG is sponsored by DIF, this is not an IP-protected context. We won't be developing specs or working on standards. Thus, you don't have to be a member of any particular org to join, and there are no legal terms to review or paperwork to sign.

Please join us!

IOT represents a spectrum of capabilities - at the capable end of the spectrum devices can use DIDComm directly. At the lower end, they are often better reporting to a more capable device that bridges to DIDComm protocols.

Are DID's assigned to each agent? or actor ?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 17:42:23 GMT):<br/>
Each Agent can have one or more DIDs.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 17:43:07 GMT):<br/>
Issuers and Verifiers typically have one published DID, and most Aries agents switch to Peer DIDs for communication with other agents.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 17:48:37 GMT):<br/>
DIDComm Protocols can be created by anybody without any required permission.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 17:49:12 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>aymanejabrane</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 17:50:12 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for the explanation. If I share my Peer DID, would it be possible for it to be spoofed by a bad actor ?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 17:51:04 GMT):<br/>
no - the peer DID is bound to the private key used to create it. Without that private key, a bad actor is unable to use your peer DID.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:06:36 GMT):<br/>
Yes - a mediator can serve many edge agents.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:07:20 GMT):<br/>
The mediator itself is untrusted - it doesn't have the keys to decrypt the message being sent to the edge agent.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:08:22 GMT):<br/>
Indy is just the ledger portion of the architecture. Aries agents talk with each other to exchange Indy based credentials.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:08:53 GMT):<br/>
Indy itself contains no support for parties to talk directly to each other, only register public keys, schemas, and other credential related information on the ledger.

looks like we used node 16 when we were doing our testing: `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -`
</p>
<p><strong>frostyfrog</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:31:22 GMT):<br/>
So, one of the things we are using is a proxy on the web to route traffic. I don't know if it will help, but if you restart the container and re-add the agents to the toolbox (you will need to delete the old connections), that may fix your issue.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:32:28 GMT):<br/>
The agent keeps track of which DID is used with which connection.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:33:03 GMT):<br/>
Generating uinque DIDs is done automatically for each new connection - it isn't something you have to manage yourself.
</p>
<p><strong>frostyfrog</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:33:59 GMT):<br/>
Sam, isn't the DID based off of the encryption keys, or did I misunderstand during the recent Indy Node meeting?
</p>
<p><strong>burdettadam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:36:23 GMT):<br/>
I am not sure I understand your question. Are you asking about the crypto or managing Identity vs did comm connections with 'dids'?
</p>
<p><strong>frostyfrog</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:37:22 GMT):<br/>
I believe what's being asked is, "How do you guarantee that a newly created DID is unique?"
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:37:34 GMT):<br/>
DIDs are based and bound to keys. New keys are created for each connection.
</p>
<p><strong>aymanejabrane</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:37:57 GMT):<br/>
Hey Burd, it is to guarantee the uniqueness of DID
</p>
<p><strong>aymanejabrane</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:44:45 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for troubling you @TelegramSam . 
So there are 2 types of DIDs. 
1. DID for agents which is static
2. Peer DID which is generated for each connection and thats what is presented in the Indyscan. 

Please correct my understanding if I got it wrong..

yes. you can learn more here. https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#introduction
</p>
<p><strong>frostyfrog</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:52:24 GMT):<br/>
In order to connect to another agent, you need to connect to them with a DID. In demos, we automatically create an invitation which, in turn, creates a new DID. An agent can create as many DIDs as they want to. For credentials, an agent can create a DID which is not used for a connection, but the basics are the same. There aren't really 2 types of DIDs. A DID represents a cryptographic key and that key can be used for a variety of things. From agent-agent communication to signing and verifying credentials.

</p>
<p><strong>devisions</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:37:33 GMT):<br/>
I would like Bob to automatically approve the presentation requests sent from Alice, same as Daniel showed before.

The two agents are successfully connected ("Connections" section in both Toolbox are fine, "Messages" are also), no error in the terminal (where the toolbox and the services were started),
but in Bob's toolbox's "Presentations" section, the presentations requested from Alice are listed with a `state: request_received` and that's it (a looping icon keeps rotating on both).
Should I do something to troubleshoot this?

How does the revocation registry work? Does it delete the record (attribute) off the ledger or is it not finalized until a certain point in time?

</p>
<p><strong>frostyfrog</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:49:37 GMT):<br/>
As far as I know, things aren't deleted off of the ledger. Revocation happens at the credential level. When a credential is revoked, it is added to the revocation registry where it is then compared against when credentials are being verified (as far as I know)
</p>
<p><strong>frostyfrog</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:51:43 GMT):<br/>
Are all attributes and predicates correctly spelled? The last time I tested (months ago), if an attribute does not match up, or if your predicates do not pass validation, then the proving agent will not respond automatically.
</p>
<p><strong>burdettadam</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:54:37 GMT):<br/>
aca-py has configuration that allows automating did_comm interactions. I am not sure of the issue here though. I will ask around about the looping icon.

<p><strong>devisions</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:59:35 GMT):<br/>
The problem was that Bob does not "hold" some of the attributes that were included in the presentation requests.

Bob has only "name", which he got as part of a received credential from Alice.

Now, the 3rd presentation request included only the "name" attribute, and now this got automatically approved and it's all good on both sides, as illustrated in the last screenshot.

Hello, I have been trying to send a credential with an attachment for a while, but to no avail. 
My setup is the following: I have two ACAPy instances running in parallel and I am able to create a connection and send credentials normally. However, whenever I try to send a credential with a base64 encoded attachment in the field`offers~attach` with one agent, the credential and its attributes are received by the other agent, but the attachment is nowhere to be found. I am currently checking in the docker logs, the response body and the `issue-credential-2.0/records/` endpoint. 
Does anybody know what I am doing wrong? How can I get the attachments to the other side?
</p>

Hello. I'm looking into use ACA-Py to send/receive verifiable credentials between mobile agents, possibly using multi-tenancy and in a serverless environment (e.g., AWS Lambda). The ACA-Py cloud agent would only act as a message mediator between the sender and receiver, and would not be responsible for issuing or verifying credentials. While I have tried to get up to speed on the ACA-Py project, I am new so I apologize for any ignorance in my questions.

From my understanding, the ACA-Py cloud agent does not have persistent wallet storage, only in-memory. If I wanted to implement a persistent storage backend for the cloud agent, what all would require implementation? I see there is an [abstract BaseStorage class](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/aries_cloudagent/storage/base.py). Beyond implementing a concrete persistent storage class, what else would need to be "swapped out" or "injected" to use this new storage backend?

My assumption here is that, because the cloud agent would be in a serverless environment, a persistent storage backend is required to persist the peer DIDs that are established to allow for communication between the sender and receiver mobile agents. In this case, I believe the sender and receiver would act as the controller, where the messages that they send between each other would ultimately stem from a user interacting with the mobile agent.

The multi-tenancy would be used so that there would only need to be a single "instance" (i.e., Lambda function endpoint) that could manage the communication between different sender-receiver pairs.

Thank you in advance!

ACA-Py definitely has persistent storage -- not very useful without :-).  It can be setup to use SQLite or Postgres, depending on your needs.

On the serverless front, I'm not aware of anyone that has implemented that.  Interested in how that progresses.

Finally -- ACA-Py currently has in-memory queues for inbound and outbound messages. There is a WIP PR on adding persistent queues via reddis or kafka (or add your own) that  you might be interested in.

<p><strong>dantetti</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 14:14:30 GMT):<br/>
Hey, I am wondering for what reason a wallet can have non-public DIDs?
</p>
<p><strong>kalyankonda</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 14:29:42 GMT):<br/>
As per the design (and more importantly for security reasons), Pairwise/Private DIDs are stored in individual agent's wallet. All public DIDs get stored on Ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>kalyankonda</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 14:35:52 GMT):<br/>
Aegnt exposes its APIs on thier admin port (as an example: 8031 in case of Alice agent in faber-alice-demo example) and you can call those APIs from your UI.
</p>
<p><strong>kalyankonda</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 14:36:45 GMT):<br/>
You can refer this link for OpenAPI/Swagger specifications: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/main/open-api
</p>
<p><strong>dantetti</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:44:00 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I mean I don't see use cases for non-public DIDs in wallet
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:50:40 GMT):<br/>
It depends what you are thinking of as "wallet".  If you mean the mobile app and that non-Public DIDs would be surfaced in the UI, then no -- not needed.

However, if you just mean storage, and that the Aries Agent will use the non-Public DIDs under the covers for managing connections and providing a secure communication channel with DIDComm, they are needed. Fundamental to the use of DIDComm and enabling the higher level Aries Protocols
</p>
<p><strong>dantetti</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:54:52 GMT):<br/>
so you mean in the storage case it can be used for peer-to-peer communication?

<p><strong>dantetti</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:54:52 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rtatton</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 20:06:20 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense. Actually, in the case of a serverless function, it's okay that the queues are not persistent as this can be external to the cloud agent's functionality. 

However, because state is not guaranteed to be persisted across function invocations, the wallet would need a storage implementation that is external to the agent. For example, if using AWS Lambda, the wallet could be persisted using S3, DynamoDB, or one of their SQL databases. Perhaps this could be as simple as saving the SQLite or Postgres DB file to S3 such that it's loaded upon function invocation and just before finishing the invocation.

Yes. It is used to encrypt peer-to-peer message. (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/nodejs/src/gettingStarted.js#L177)

It is also used in creating credential request, though I'm not sure what's its internal usage.(https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/nodejs/src/gettingStarted.js#L195)

Here is another question. If I create a DID in wallet (storage), make it public and push to the ledger.  After that If restart my server it'll not run because: "New seed provided which doesn't match the registered public did". How can I get around in this situation? Don't ask why I'm doing this I am just trying to understand how it works)) @swcurran
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 26 Jan 2022 22:01:53 GMT):<br/>
It depends on how you are creating the DID in the ledger.  Your wallet and the ledger have to be in sync (same DID, verkey, private key), so if you destroy your wallet between reboots, you have to make sure you can reproduce the same DID.  You do that by using the same seed.  It sounds like when you are starting, you are using a random seed and so it is different any time.

If you do want to be able to continue running after reboots, you should be making sure you are persisting your secure storage (wallet) across reboots.

Note that while you can recreate an identical DID by using a seed, you cannot do that with a Claim Def, so if you delete your storage and recreate it, any Claim Def you create will NOT match the Claim Def on the ledger.

<p><strong>dantetti</strong> (Wed, 26 Jan 2022 23:27:44 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for the reply! 
First, I am registering a DID on the ledger (manualy) and starting acypy by providing the seed of the DID in command line. 
After I am creating new DID with the help of /wallet/did/create (I am not passing any seed here, I guess acapy uses some random seed) and storing it on the ledger with /ledger/register-nym. 
Then I am making created DID public (in acapy only one DID can be public) with /wallet/did/public and rebooting my acapy without destroying the wallet. Here obviously I get the error "seed doesn't match the registered public"  because I am providing a seed of the old DID. 
So, how can I start my acapy with new public DID in this case? How keep DIDs of the ledger and wallet  in sync in general. Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 01:09:35 GMT):<br/>
I'm not 100% on the start up params, but I believe if you use the `--seed` parameter, along with the Public DID parameter, the ACA-Py instance should:

- create the wallet if needed
- create the DID in the wallet if needed
- create the DID on the ledger if needed.

If those things are already done -- things just proceed.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 01:10:32 GMT):<br/>
The "provision" vs. "start" mode might impact the wallet creation, but the latter two should happen regardless.
</p>
<p><strong>dantetti</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 01:15:01 GMT):<br/>
So, if I create new DID, push it to the ledger and make it public I have to start acapy with that DID (because I don't know the seed when I create it with /wallet/did/create)

Re. the call to participate in a new DIDComm Users Group that I posted last week:
We had a nice set of respondents to this survey. Unfortunately, the general consensus was that it is impossible to get us together! Almost every proposed timeslot had at least ¾ of the respondents saying they couldn’t come. We are busy!
I’m going to try again, but with the following changes:
* I’ve extended the calendar time until Feb 11, in case the early parts of a month are better for us than the end parts.
* I’ve decided to look for 30 minute slots instead of 60. I think this might be better – the commitment to attend is less heavy, and perhaps calendars will be a little more flexible. I believe we can still get a lot done in 30 minutes, if we’re well organized.
So, can we try again?

Just a question: is credential presentation susceptible to replay attack? For example, if the verifier has malicious intent, can it publish publicly a credential presentation it receives, such that it is still verifiable who the holder and issuer of the credential is?

A verifier could publish the data -- they have that.  Such abuse is a legal vs. technical issue.  So if the plaintext data identifies the Holder, that is possible. That is why  the data minimization is so important -- providing as little data as possible through selective disclosure and predicates.

A replay is not possible -- that would be detected. Each presentation request has a nonce that makes it unique. So a malicious verifier receiving a presentation request from another verifier could not replay a presentation they received.

If the malicious verifier published a presentation, the issuer would be known from the identifiers in the presentation.  The holder would not be known by the identifiers in the presentation, unless (as stated above), the data presented had PII.

This error (`AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'services'`) could be an issue with the format of the invitation you are trying to accept
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 19:44:11 GMT):<br/>
On the mediator side it looks like the webhook endpoint is missing, you're getting a `404`:  `Error when posting to: http://localhost:3008/webhooks/topic/connections/`
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:02:41 GMT):<br/>
Alright, so I've tried a few different alterations to the script and none of them are working. But, when I replaced the local mediator connection url in the multitenant script with a development indicia-tech mediator url, I only get the `AttributeError` error.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:08:10 GMT):<br/>
Can you describe your setup?  I.e. are you running locally, using docker, etc .. ?
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:12:10 GMT):<br/>
I am running locally. I have the aca-py cli installed and that is what I am using to run the scripts. For the ledger, I am connecting to the sovrin buildernet.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:12:51 GMT):<br/>
Can you share your aca-py startup commands?

<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:15:20 GMT):<br/>
First I run the mediator agent. I copy the invitation URL it gives me. Then I paste that url into the --mediator-invitation argument and run the multitenant agent
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:16:12 GMT):<br/>
And then you create a tenant wallet (aka sub-wallet) in the multitenant instance?
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:17:17 GMT):<br/>
yeah. Then I try to connect to it and use the wallet through the api endpoints, but it every time I try to run something, an error returns saying I need a mediator.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:17:51 GMT):<br/>
Ah ok, I'm not sure the tenant wallet automatically connects to the mediator
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:18:20 GMT):<br/>
I.e. I don't know if the `--mediator-invite` param gets picked up for a new tenant instance
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:18:56 GMT):<br/>
Try explicitly connecting your tenant to the mediator after you create it
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:19:31 GMT):<br/>
That's what I thought at first, but here https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/Multitenancy.md#mediation it says that you can do just that, which is what I have been trying to do, but I'm about to just go ahead and connect a sub-wallet to a mediator manually.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:20:35 GMT):<br/>
Yah it looks like the docs say "it should work"
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:20:53 GMT):<br/>
If it works when you connect the tenant manually I suggest to log an issue
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:21:11 GMT):<br/>
... then someone will take a look at the aca-py functionality
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:21:37 GMT):<br/>
Alright. I will go ahead and make sure that works first

Sorry for slow response, this message got a bit lost in all of the previous replys.  The instructions you are viewing are for adding a Node to an existing network. The Steward DID must be added to the ledger by an existing Trustee. The Steward DID is not added to the ledger during the init_indy_node command.
Trustee's can be added to an existing ledgerr at any time and are not at all related to addins or removing Nodes or Stewards.   Trustees, (the role) are network administrators, not node operators.
If you are trying to start a new network,  (and only if it's the initial time you are  starting it with the genesis nodes) then the specific instruction you are referring to is something you can skip since the initial Trustees and Stewards are in the genesis files and will not need added to the brand new network separately.

I have logged an issue in the aries-cloudagent-python repository about the /accept-request issue I was getting. If this is an actual issue and not just my error, could it be possible that this issue could have resulted in the multitenant agent's mediator not connecting on startup?

Hi, I would like to transform the Faber/Alice/Acme use-case within the ACA-py framework into a web-based use-case. I would like to know what would be the best approach for doing this. If someone knows of any pointer regarding this, I would be grateful if you could share those pointers. Thanks in advance.

In this object when creating an invitation, what is the service endpoint for and what should it be? Like, does it need to be the agent endpoint or the webhook?
```
{
  "my_label": "Bob",
  "recipient_keys": [
    "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
  ],
  "routing_keys": [
    "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
  ],
  "service_endpoint": "http://host.docker.internal:8022"
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>skittlez1522</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 19:08:47 GMT):<br/>
Also, is the recipient key the key of the recipient wallet and if so, how do you get that key?

It is the agent endpoint and it must be accessible to whomever the invitation is going to.  It is the physical address (including the protocol) to which the entity receiving the invitation will send the follow up message (whatever that might be). It may be direct to the agent creating the invite, or may be to a mediator that has been setup to handle receiving and forwarding the message so that it gets to the inviting agent.

It is never the webhook address, and might be the agent endpoint if that is exposed publicly.

FYI the endpoint in your above example is for an internal docker network, so you will only be able to connect with other agents on the same docker network (on your local host).  If you want to connect with agents running elsewhere, you need to setup public endpoints.  There is an example here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/demo/AliceGetsAPhone.md

Hello, I am trying to connect a mobile android agent without inbound with a mediator using aries-framework-go. Since the documentation from here (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/DIDComm+MediatorRouter) is already 2 years old I was wondering how the flow needs to be adapted when using DIDComm V2. Do I still need to perform a DIDExchange between the Router and the Mobile Agent? Or how else will they connect? Is there a pre-built mediator that uses DIDComm v2 and is compatible with aries-framework-go? Thank you in advance for the help!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 18:22:17 GMT):<br/>
The Aries community is still using DIDComm v1.0, as v2.0 is still under development in DIF.  You are probably better to ask the question in that context -- e.g. in the DIF Slack channel.

@TelegramSam -- anything to add to this?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 19:53:11 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK Aries Framework Go already supports DIDComm v2 (at least an initial version) and supports multiple protocols using DIDComm v2. I'm not sure however what their exact progress is and whether mediation using DIDComm v2 is already supported

Hi @The_Science, Even I am stuck with the same futex facility error. I tried re-installing the same node and npm versions but still facing same.
Any suggestions on how it could be resolved would be much appreciated.

Hi Devg, my issue was the wrong version of node.  I guess the question is,  do you have multiple versions of node installed and is it possible the incorrect version is being used with the script?

Hello, We are planning to migrate from Aries agent 1.0 APIs to 2.0 APIs in our controller. Before we proceed for impact analysis and analysis of required changes, I would like to check with forum here if somebody is already done this analysis and migrated to 2.0 APIs. If there is guide/material on this exists already. Any references/pointers will save our time.
</p>
<p><strong>devg</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 13:46:38 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I tried with version 16 individually as well but no luck. Not sure what might be the issue. If I may ask, what is the specific version that you have used for node and npm?
</p>
<p><strong>The_Science</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 14:04:03 GMT):<br/>
Hope this helps:

$ npm version
{
  npm: '8.1.2',
  node: '16.13.2',
  v8: '9.4.146.24-node.14',
  uv: '1.42.0',
  zlib: '1.2.11',
  brotli: '1.0.9',
  ares: '1.18.1',
  modules: '93',
  nghttp2: '1.45.1',
  napi: '8',
  llhttp: '6.0.4',
  openssl: '1.1.1l+quic',
  cldr: '39.0',
  icu: '69.1',
  tz: '2021a',
  unicode: '13.0',
  ngtcp2: '0.1.0-DEV',

Hi @lynn.bendixsen , I am trying it on linux based ubuntu 18.04. It does not have the GUI capability.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 19:43:00 GMT):<br/>
The script that you are running when you see the error requires a GUI.  Try installing the "desktop" version of 18.04, or just  add all of the GUI items required. I was going to provide a link, but there are many options available if you google search for "https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=installing+a+GUI+on+ubuntu+server+18.04&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8"

Hello @heysatya, This appears to obe a similar issue that  devg had, which is that you might have tried to run in an environment without GUI capabilities.  If you have installed a server without a GUI (minimal, etc.) then please try again with a "desktop" version of Ubuntu 18.04.

To provide more context: we are planning to migrate from 5.6 version agent to 7.3 (which I belive it latest stable one). We have migrated agent to 7.3 without any issues/changes from our controller. We are using 1.0 APIs in our controller. Now, we are planning to migrate to 2.0 APIs. We are planning to migrate our an agent (and controller to 2.0 APIs) which acts as both Issuer and Verifer. Currenly, we are using Trinsic as Holder wallet.

I think this link has the call information you are wanting.  There is a hyperledger calendar  also, that is likely the best way to get a copy of the meeting on your calendar:  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings 
Tuesday, February 15 is the next Aries Workgroup meeting.

Hi here. Is this channel moved on to discord like other hyperledger projects? The reason for asking this is that the rest of the channels such as aries-go are not in discord.
</p>
<p><strong>devg</strong> (Fri, 11 Feb 2022 04:36:18 GMT):<br/>
That's great. Thanks for sharing the info @lynn.bendixsen . Looking forward to contributing to Aries.
