{"msg":"Hey various Aries members,\n\nAt IIW I noticed that there was quite a bit of interest in discussing how a DIDComm protocol might work. I've been discussing this work in many places to help evangelize and find early consensus on what we would like to see in a common messaging protocol that's based on DID work that has been baking in various communities. Given that this work would likely need to cross cutting through (hopefully) the entire DID space, I wanted to reach out to various people in many different orgs to get discussion going on this subject.\n\nMy hope is that we can start with a call to discuss things and move forward in an agile way as needed. Right now I'm looking to find a good time for this call and have setup a scheduler here: \n\nhttp://whenisgood.net/DIDComms/\n\nIf you would like to join the calls please provide times that would work best for you weekly. \n\nAlso, if you aren't able to make the calls, but would like to follow the discussion will be taking notes in a google doc here.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1k5USBTdQP9RbcImbnC61cjyxRI3FtbTq8IRHlK-_7cw/edit#\n\nThanks!\nKyle Den Hartog","username":"kdenhartog","ts":"2019-05-15T22:14:06.377Z"}
{"msg":"@TelegramSam and @kdenhartog et al: I have raised several PRs against the aries-rfc repo. One (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/7) adds a brief section describing the use of github issues. I don't think it's controversial, given our discussion earlier this afternoon--but we would have to get someone with greater privileges to turn on Github Issues for that repo before we merge it (@rjones?). Others move a few very core concepts in the Aries RFC space. Given our discussion about process (which has now been formalized in the merged PR from Sam), can another maintainer quickly merge these today?","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-05-15T22:24:55.677Z"}

{"msg":"Thanks.\n\nMy head's more or less in the same place. Moving status from Proposed to Accepted and from Accepted to Adopted have a substantially higher bar than just updating some verbiage. Those are community decisions.\n\nAs a frequent author of stuff like this, I'm really glad to have a chance to update a doc with only a light interaction. However, even the authors of specs shouldn't just update them in significant ways willy nilly. I suggest we adopt a convention that a PR should be named according to its effect. I named mine \"Propose RFC\" when I was requesting the PROPOSED status, and \"Accept RFC\" when I was requesting the ACCEPTED status. For PRs that don't include substantive changes, I suggest we name them \"tweak <something>\" so a maintainer knows they're just typo fixes or clarifications. For PRs that do make substantive updates without requesting a status change, I suggest we name them \"update <something>\".

Instead of generating from the initial public key, it would use a sha256 hash of the initial version of the DID Doc, which means the initial DID Doc could have any number of keys, and that it wouldn't be vital to rotate the one and only initial key value immediately after being used to generate the DID.\n\n2.

{"msg":"I don't know if I'm the first person to use the phrase \"message family\", but I was one of the first. And I wish I'd never used it. Its relationship to the true, crisp concept of \"protocol\" is muddy. We have to version a protocol, and we have to route based on a protocol. The messages involved in creating connections, and the messages involved in synchronizing changes to DID Docs, are both part of a logical grouping of messages about connections, but they have to be versioned in different units. We could say there's a general \"message family\" about connections, but there are most certainly two distinct protocols there. I've never liked the idea that \"message family\" included sequence rules, roles, and state machines; that always felt like a \"protocol\" construct to me.\n\nSam (and I think Stephen to a lesser extent) have been the main proponents of promoting the term \"message family\", and I went along because I was a lone voice in the wilderness. But if there are others now showing up saying that \"protocol\" is the term that really resonates, I think we should listen to them and de-emphasize the term \"message family\" as a fuzzy term with little practical impact that could be applied to any type of grouping.","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-05-24T14:23:05.723Z"}
{"msg":"I'd like to rename the term as well; \"wire\" doesn't really apply well to messages at rest on disk, or to messages transmitted wirelessly. But I have a different preference from \"message encryption\". Let me explain.\n\nI think the other \"layer\" or \"level\" of messaging (the one where agents or applications deal in plaintext JSON structures) is also misnamed as the \"application level\". We struggled with this term quite a bit, wanting to call it \"agent level\" at one point, but never really loving anything we came up with.\n\nThere is a metaphor that I think gives us both terms very nicely. It's the metaphor of envelopes and the content inside them. So I'd suggest that we use the terms \"message\" and \"envelope\", and talk about putting a message inside an envelope. This is exactly the visual I used in diagrams in the mediators and relays HIPE, and I think it was very clear. This also has a nice secondary consequence, which is that Tobias's idea of plaintext-but-signed messages as an alternate wire format just becomes a second type of envelope. (And that's the reason I don't want to refer to this layer as \"encrypted\", BTW, even though I think encrypted envelopes will be far and away the most common envelope style.)","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-05-24T14:32:20.496Z"}

One topic I haven't heard discussed much though is how to rapidly (and maybe even just temporarily)  suspend activity as a backstop to limit time critical damage that could be caused by a breach. Sort of like a 'panic button' that would pause wallet activity if something hinkey were detected. The thinking may be that once a breach occurs, it is too late to do anything anyhow and maybe the focus should be on creating a trail. Thoughts? IMHO if we accept that breaches will occur and can limit the extent of damage as a native feature (pluggable) rather than push mop up activity to a higher layer there is greater likelihood of getting it right.","username":"SteveMagennis","ts":"2019-05-31T14:09:35.362Z"}

The URI format is associated with a predefined schema (I suggest \"ssi://\") that would be serviced by whichever rich agent is the \"master\" app for managing someone's identity on a mobile device.\n4. The URI format can also be associated with one or more \"thin agent\" schemas (e.g., \"fitbitssi://\") on the same device. By having this predefined schema plus one or more thin agent schemas, messages can be sent to the rich agent, and responses can flow back to each thin agent that wants to communicate this way.\n5. It is possible to discover whether a rich agent has registered as the handler of \"ssi://\" messages.\n6. A message family has been defined that can be used to query the rich agent to find out its name and characteristics, and to register thin agents to cooperate with it.\n7. A simple security model has been specified, clarifying what trust should be imputed to apps communicating in this way, under which circumstances.\n8. It is possible to envision a way to use this mechanism so a thin app could query the ssi wallet on a mobile device for the 1 relationship it is interested in, to share credentials, and so forth.","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-06-05T21:33:19.843Z"}

Here's why.\n","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-06-07T19:20:28.394Z"}
{"msg":"In English, we have the phenomenon of count nouns and non-count nouns. A count noun is something that you count with integers: cars, shoes, phones, etc. We say, \"I own 3 cars.\" A non-count noun is something that you quantify as a collective or mass: \"My car is emitting *a lot* of smoke.\" \"I bought *3 bushels* of wheat.\"\n\nCount nouns carry plural markers in English: I own 3 car*s*.\n\nNon-count nouns do NOT carry plural markers in English. We would not say, \"I saw 3 smoke*s* coming out of my tailpipe when I started the car.\"\n\nIt is possible for a noun to be both a count noun and a non-count noun. \"Water\" is a great example. Normally, water is a non-count noun--we measure it in real units, as a collective. However, when a waiter takes our order at a restaurant, he may say, \"Okay, so that's 3 waters, right?\" When this happens, we're implying that we've packaged the non-count, collective noun in a discrete form.\n\nWhen you turn nouns into adjectives, usually the non-count, non-plural version is more common. We talk about \"water-borne illnesses\" and \"watercraft\", not \"waters-born illnesses\" and \"waterscraft\".\n\nSo what about the word \"communication\"?\n\nWell, \"communication\" is normally a non-count noun. We say things like \"There's a lot of communication happening\" (non-count collective) or \"The internet backbone carries 3.9 terabytes of communication per second in the transatlantic cable\" (units +real quantifying a collective but not discrete items).\n\nWe *also* use communication as a count noun, in the same way that my water example does. If each discrete communication event is counted, then we can say things like, \"27 communications arrived on this radio channel in the past hour.\"\n\nSo, what would \"didcomm\" imply, and what would \"didcomms\" imply?\n\n\"Didcomm\" means communication in bulk, uncounted. It is also the appropriate ajective form. \"Didcomms\" means individual, countable didcomm events.\n\nAlmost always, we want the non-plural, non-count sense.\n\nAs I said before, I really don't care how we talk informally--but in formal written artifacts, I suggest that we follow best practice grammar and use the form without the 's'.","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-06-07T19:35:41.654Z"}

{"msg":"Hi everyone, thanks for reaching out to me @kdenhartog and @MikeRichardson, very excited about Aries! I don't think I'll have much capacity to contribute to protocol design, but rather I see myself more on the implementation side of things for now.

{"msg":"Hey. Just found out this project. Nice idea!\nI've looked through the RFCs and noticed the one related to protocols. I was working on this topic for a while and now I have a nice implementation of a tool that is able to describe protocols in a declarative way. There are many similarities between your RFC and my implementation such as request-response/notify logic and an ability to nest one protocol inside the other. As a bonus my implementation is based on no-ARQ reliable udp.\nCheck it out: https://github.com/seniorjoinu/prodigy  \n\nYes, it's not finished (I have some issues with concurrency and I'd like to implement some congestion control, security and nat traversal techniques),  but the field of improvements and fixes is clearly defined, and the concept is proved to be working.","username":"AlexanderVtyurin","ts":"2019-06-10T10:28:18.142Z"}

I'm glad you found us!\n\nHaving a declarative language for protocols is something I'm quite interested in. However, it would have to be something we could use in languages other than Kotlin before we could adopt it, because we are language-agnostic.\n\nHow do you propose to deal with protocols that are not composed purely of peers (that is, there are different roles with different rules about how they interact)?","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-06-10T17:40:29.493Z"}

This gives much better outcomes than calling the code block straight JSON and having ugly red marks all over it when github beautifies it.\n\nI will probably still use the embedded image approach sometimes when I need to highlight a subset of a JSON block (e.g., the way I used it in the attachments RFC here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0017-attachments/README.md#inlining).

Connections give you an audit trail; they are what you would look up to say, \"What does <entity X> know about me? What consent have I given them? What credentials have they seen? And what do I know about them, too?\" Connections are also a point of policy enforcement; they are where you can say, \"Don't ever tell Bank X anything else about me\". If everything you do is ephemeral, it is true that you are a ghost on the digital landscape, but so is everybody else. Usually, you want more record-keeping and control than that.\n\nAs far as the UX implications, think of connections like cookies. How much time do most users spend inspecting a list of their cookies? And how much of a UX burden do you consider them?","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-07-17T21:57:45.143Z"}
{"msg":"well,\nfor the first bit, I would say I don't think it's all or nothing -- i think there's specific cases where connectionless shines. \nas for the second, i don't know if cookies is the appropriate term because there is more user involvement with \"connectioning\". i know that it's been discussed about setting up rules for agents to be able to automate stuff like this, but i think in practice setting rules for each type of usecase increases set up time for users who likely won't engage in that and leave it to defaults\n\ni think of it more like adding email addresses/phone numbers to your address book. for example, if I wanted to start a secure did message chat with someone i'm connectioned with, it'd be clunky to go to my connections list and see every service i've ever interacted with as a connection.\n\nfurthermore, like emails and and phone numbers, you could still maintain logs of proof requests fulfilled for audit purposes without needing to tie those to connections -- and linking them automatically if a connection with an entity was created after the fact (texting a number, then adding that number to your contact list later is an example i think of)","username":"spacemandev","ts":"2019-07-17T22:05:43.661Z"}

{"msg":"@AmanAgrawal - the OrgBook use case is special in two ways.  First, the credentials in it are all public, *not* private information - basically, the pieces of paper that a business puts on their wall for clients to see that they are permitted/qualified to do the work they do.  Second, the mechanism is largely to bootstrap the Verifiable Credentials model in a jurisdiction - to get all the gov't (and others) to issue Verifiable Credentials even though no business have their own wallets (to create a supply), so that when organizations get their wallets, they can get verifiable credentials (the demand).  There are longer term uses of OrgBook that go beyond bootstrapping, but that was the initial reason for building it.\n\nWe would definitely not recommend putting 14M citizens private information into an OrgBook-like repository.  That would be private information would just be a honeypot for attacks.  We would never use that approach for citizen data.\n\nOn your last question. Once an organization has their own wallet, they will connect to the various services that issued credentials about them to OrgBook to be issued a verifiable credential directly to them.  The OrgBook could facilitate the connections, but would not \"transfer\" the credential they have to the organization.  That is technically not feasible, nor is it desirable. The business would just collect the verifiable credentials from the enabled services that provided those same credentials to OrgBook.\n\nHope that helps.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2019-07-18T18:17:05.474Z"}

We have a pilot production service planned for a significant professional accreditation organization within our province coming up in the fall. This pilot has a requirement for mobile agents to be able to hold and offer verifiable credentials issued and verified by services operating instances of aries-cloudagent-python. Details are in this Open Collaboration MOU: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GPZ4p4zM36AN3DcHJ13s_IisSrT4F3S0 \n\nMore details around the use case and how we intend to work with the community are in the document.\n\nOur offer is to work closely, in the open, with groups that we believe are close to having a releasable mobile agent such that their agent could be one of the listed compatible agents when this new service goes live. Our expectation is for the production pilot to occur this fall.\n\nIf you are interested and think you have a mobile agent that is close to release, please review this Open Collaboration MOU, and contact us via Hyperledger Rocket.Chat or via my email available in the MOU.\n\nWe would expect to have all participates identified with signed MOUs by Aug 6th 2019.\n","username":"jljordan_bcgov","ts":"2019-07-23T23:19:48.727Z"}

{"msg":"I did some work to improve the indexing script. It's substantially cleaner and more useful. It counts and reports/hyperlinks implementations for each indexed item in the new impl section that swcurran added. It also shows the last status date of each RFC, so we can see what's stalled. And it supports tagging. I have defined and used 4 tags so far; you'll see them when you go look at the latest version of /index.md. \n\nI went in and added links to implementations for a number of RFCs. They are definitely incomplete/imperfect, but even so, it is very encouraging to see how much real progress we've made that we just weren't giving ourselves credit for. This change caused a number of RFCs to move from PROPOSED to DEMONSTRATED status. I went ahead and merged those changes, because this status change is not controversial; it's just a reflection of us having data about impl code. Many of the things that are now in DEMONSTRATED status should probably be in ACCEPTED status instead, but that's a more controversial move and one that I think others might want to advocate.\n\nPlease note: I also added a new unit test that is picky about the metadata at the top of each RFC.

{"msg":"Many of the uses cases targeted by ACA-Py at the present time are enterprise oriented. In the case of an organization-representing agent, the \"cloud\" agent holding the keys and credentials of the organization makes sense. Cloud Agents would also still need to maintain keys and relationships even in the case that it is not used as the main agent of an individual or organization. For example, if a cloud agent is operating as a moderator for the edge agent running on my phone, my edge agent and the cloud agent providing that service have a relationship with keys and potentially credentials associated with it.\n\nSo the cloud agent wallet does not store the same data as the edge agent and I would say it is discouraged to ever duplicate private keys or other secrets.

For example, each could have the endpoint \"https://agents-r-us.com\" that would be the end point for you and all of Agents-R-Us's clients (aka \"lost in the crowd\" or \"herd privacy\"). WIthin the Agents-R-Us agency, you would configure a unique route for each DID that would lead to the same agent. No one reading the DIDDoc could correlate the three DIDs. This is described in the (I think) DIDDoc Conventions RFC.\n\nIn the current vision, unless each of your persona needed to issue credentials, they would not need to have a public DID at all, but that might change. Or there might be a good reason to support credential issuance for each persona - for example, delegation of authority.  In that case, you might have many issuing DIDs, all seemingly independent, and all leading back to your agent.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2019-08-16T00:38:25.742Z"}

Lower-level protocols are usually described more specifically and possibly with other verbiage: \"cryptographic algorithms\", \"DID management procedures\", \"DIDComm conventions\", \"wire-level message exchange\", \"transports\", and so forth. This helps us focus \"protocol\" on the place where application developers that consume Aries do most of the work that creates value.\n```\n\nI would like to float the following terms:\n\n**Application-Level Protocols** for the high-level protocols that RFC 00003 describes, that we mostly intend when we use \"protocol\" without any adjective.\n\n**The DIDComm Protocol** or just **DIDComm** for the collection of conventions that is used as a foundation by all Application-Level Protocols.","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-09-05T05:55:49.262Z"}

{"msg":"1. There is a writeup on what AnonCreds 2.0 is somewhere - I've been looking but can't find the reference. @MALodder knows it. The API you are asking about is the revocation from an Indy perspective.  My guess it is essentially the same, with the URI for the tails file replaced with a reference to a transaction on the ledger for the root of the merkle tree construct that replaces the tails file.\n\n2. The tails file concept (array of ints) goes away, replaced (AFAIK) with a merkle tree where the bits of the leaf nodes represent the credentials and status. The root of the merkle tree is in the ledger, and when credentials are revoked, the a new tree/transaction is written.  @MALodder knows better :-)\n\n3.

That does mean that the metadata and some data from the backup - number of records per table, the unencrypted tags - would be visible to anyone with access to the backup.  I suspect that more metadata would be needed about the backup to restore it, but don't have concrete examples. \n\nIf there was a need for more data and so a different key was used to encrypt a package, you don't see a concern with embedding the wallet key with the database backup?","username":"swcurran","ts":"2019-09-26T04:21:19.243Z"}

{"msg":"Hi, \nIn the ACA-PY architecture deep dive its mentioned how one instance of a cloud agent is designed to be paired with one controller. What is the reason for this? Is it due to concurrency issues in having concurrent processes hit the same agent? Or other reasons?\n\nI'm thinking of the scenario where within a business I have multiple processes executing that need verifiable credential capability e.g. I have a process to on-board customers that requires verifying credentials, I scale this out horizontally such that I can have multiple versions of this process, each on-boarding a different customer, running concurrently. How do I connect these up to an ACA-PY cloud agent, or multiple agents that all act as on behalf of the business entity.\n\nIf I write a controller that sits in front of an agent, then send the verifiable credential verify requests from my internal processes to it, then the controller forwards on to the agent, how is this different from having my processes talk to the agent directly? Is it simply because my controller will queue up the requests into a linear order to send on to the agent? or is there another reason for doing it? In such a system, to scale out agent capability horizontally I could create a cluster of controller-agent pairs and load balance requests from my internal services between them correct? \n\nI'm asking because if concurrency is the only issue then isn't it fairly trivial to have the agent implement a queue itself and avoid the need for the controller as described? I'm pretty convinced there's some reasoning behind the one controller to agent principle that I'm missing probably due to not knowing much about the ACA-PY implementation.\n\nCheers,\nEd","username":"EdCurran","ts":"2019-10-01T13:07:42.051Z"}

{"msg":"@sklump, Interesting question how delegatable credential is created. I am considering adding a level of abstraction to privacy questions with actors and roles in order to better describe the delegation process. In an earlier discussion of the rfc/hipe the holder or individual \"actor\" should not create credentials due to privacy because the individual would have to register on the ledger which is required for issuer. Better is that the issues (institution actor) has role  to manage creating credentials so they can be revoked. Not to try to describe how solution would look like but it would a combination of adding an option to delegate in the first or updated consent certificate so when delegation is required then holder needs to be able to respond to proof request by a verifier which is the one delegating to.\nThis is my initial thoughts how it could be done.","username":"janl","ts":"2019-10-02T19:53:01.370Z"}

{"msg":"```Motivation\n\nSawtooth/Transact (and many other ledgers) use anonymous (to the platform) public keys to identify transaction signers, verify that messages are correctly signed, and perform ‘light’ permissioning checks. For example, Sawtooth supports an on-chain transactor permissioning setting which is represented by a simple list of valid public keys (all keys are permitted by default).\n\nAn understanding of ‘who’ (person, system, organization, etc...) is associated with a public key is explicitly not handled at the platform level. This is delegated to the ‘application layer’. In Sawtooth/Transact, this is handled by the design of the transaction family (transaction formats, storage formats, and smart contracts). For example, if a transaction family wants to restrict the creation of certain record types to a set of ‘administrative users’, it needs to handle the mapping of the identity of those users (in the real world) to their public keys.\n\nIn a simple scenario, this may be a simple list of public keys that the smart contract reads out of state. Such transactions would only be considered valid by the smart contract when they were signed by a key in the application-specific ‘administrators’ list. In a more complex scenario, bootstrapped organizational administrative keys might submit transactions which update user identities and their associated rights. Smart contract logic would interpret this access control data to determine if the signer of the transaction had been granted permission to perform the action.\n\nSawtooth/Transact use an approach called Smart Permissions to delegate these permissions checks to ‘organization’ specific code. This allows organizations to provide their own implementation while sharing the same fundamental contract business logic. For example, two organizations may have radically different ways of determining who can create invoices, while the process for creating a valid invoice may be identical.\n\nThe root-of-trust problem is significant. How can we ensure that the bootstrapped administrative org keys are actually owned by that organization (and controlled by organizationally trusted parties)? How can we provide patterns which allow organizations to verify their individual’s identities, and publish the right evidence to the system to verify permissions? Is it possible for the individuals themselves to submit evidence of their permission to transact?\n\nAries’ DID and VC support potentially provides a path which addresses a number of the root-of-trust identity problems, allowing organizations to provide and revoke permissions to individuals, and allowing individuals to manage signing keys to close the loop on the ledger transaction construction/validation process.\n```","username":"jsmitchell","ts":"2019-10-09T16:32:56.997Z"}

{"msg":"Hi Daniel, Great work with slides. Here are few comments from my side:\n- slide 4 - mapping for agent/framework   on the current slide there is just one mapping of the agent to layer two which suggest that it is very limited to the simple communication. But in my understanding Agent is mainly in Layer Tree where all complex use cases with VC are implemented. As well from perspective of someone who would like to build something on top of that stack I think they should mainly build against agents not core components. It would definitely make the adoption much easier. \n-  I got the point of not calling aries yet sdk but overall it is inevitable to use i t as a SDK otherwise Aries would need to become something much bigger (like ready application but this would blow up the scope)\n-  slide 8 - adding other components like payments, smart contract etc. expand the scope of aries defined on slide 2. If we are focusing on SSI technology having stuff like payments does not sens (remember that some of those components would be huge - payment is good example).\n- slide 15 - funcs does not seems to need plugins build in but maybe we cold think of allowing for implementing own \"business logic\"/flows which reuse existing components to make it easier in higher levels to fulfill the user cases in the TDA. You could imagine that someone would build the flow for credentials specifically for driving license, this could be part of the functions sets which you can import. \n\nI think the key point here is to define the scope of the Aries and try to stay within its boundaries. SSI has a huge impact on a lot of components not necessary we want to have them in aries (like payments -> blockchain and regular, sending files, exchanging securely information (IM) etc..) \n\nBase on above comments I took liberty to modify a bit your deck and include above comments as well put a bigger picture on the vision of Aries within connection of Trusted Digital Agent (aka Digital wallet) - user friendly interface towards decentralized economy. You can find it here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ot2SersaBdFwt1KrkE9X5S7oIx-7h8l-9bhHvDfzvgs/edit?usp=sharing\n\nbtw. it is allow to comment in the document.

I assumed that every framework got its SSI features from Aries core, rather than implementing them on its own.

{"msg":"It sounds to me like some of the foregoing discussion mixes pluggability issues at multiple levels or layers.\n\nBig Aries subsystems are things like VDRI, KMS, and Creds. Each of these big subsystems needs to see the other subsystems through abstract interfaces, without worrying about the details of how they are implemented--and each also needs plugin capability such that we can supply the features of that subsytem in different ways. So, for example, we ought to be able to plug different implementations into the Creds subsystem, so we can support various flavors and versions of credentials in a single process or product.\n\nAs I understand it from comments by @troyronda , there's another kind of pluggability that's also desirable, which is replacing entire subsystems. That is, the subsystem of Aries that supplies KMS features could be either built using Go, or built using Rust. This is an interesting feature, and I get why it is desirable--but I don't think it's the same pluggability as the other one I just defined.","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-11-06T01:34:13.892Z"}

{"msg":"Perhaps the difference would be best illustrated by a more concrete example. Suppose I am writing an agent. I begin with features for the encryption envelope and message routing. Maybe I implement them in F# from scratch. Now I would like to use Aries to improve my feature set in 2 ways:\n\n1. I'd like to replace the informal key management that I have been doing with something more structured and spec-compliant, leveraging the Aries KMS.\n\n2. I'd like to implement credential exchange, say using JWT credentials.\n\nIt seems to me that plugins could help me in two different ways.\n\nApproach A: I introduce a dependency between my F# codebase and Aries core. This gives me standard C-callable interfaces for a KMS component and a Cred component. I then have to choose which plugin *underneath* these codebases I will activate to give Aries core the flavor I want. These plugins are libraries that I can either static link against, or install and link dynamically at runtime. I don't care what interface they provide, because I don't see any of it; the generic KMS component and Cred component call these plugins for me, as an indirect result of the C-callable functions I invoke against the generic KMS and Cred interfaces. I decide I will activate the plugin for JWT creds, and the plugin that activates mongo-DB-based persistence for KMS. \n\nApproach B: I don't care if there is such a thing as Aries core, except as a theoretical concept on paper. I consume an implementation of KMS that suits me, and an implementation of Creds that suits me. Alternative implementations of subsystems may or may not have a common generic interface; that's an uninteresting detail as well. Subsystem plugins like this bind tightly to specific details like which programming language's ABI [no, that's not a typo of \"API\"] they support, which persistence technology is behind the KMS, which cred ecosystem they use, which blockchain they like, etc.\n\nI'm not arguing for or against either approach here; I see that each of them has pros and cons. I'm just trying to highlight the difference. Did I clarify enough to accomplish that?","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-11-06T05:00:23.376Z"}

Weights come into play when talking about OR-connected attributes, like \"you can provide a passport *or* a driver's license\". The weight is meant to enable the verifier to express that they prefer one of the options over the other.\n4. The openid-thingy was taken from the Credential Manifest. I think it includes access to OAUTH into a proof. It is not relevant for the scope of this RFC draft, so we might just kick it out to prevent confusion.\n5.

I tried to find a mechanism for that, basically is all about permission saying how I know that this service can use my key to decrypt stuff or sign ... \nOne of the solution which I could think of is as this:\n- you register on a service K via did auth. \n- service K request to add to your did document their service endpoint with pub key dedicated for that service.\n- when service wants to decode something for you sent a message to your agent with prove that they are owner of the pub key which was used in the registration process (could come directly from did document or in form of VC)\n- agent can resolve that and confirm that the keys match and can do the operation.

{"msg":"I just wanted to repost a note that Ivan Herman sent to the W3C folks recently. Apparently there is a github handle `@context` (and I dunno, maybe `@id` and `@type` as well) -- so when they were having conversations in W3C github PR/issue streams and  used `@context`, a random person was getting tagged in the conversation. The owner of the `@context` github handle asked to not be tagged. The solution is to always encode `@context` inside the backticks so it's viewed as code by github, not as a reference to a github handle.\n\nSince our community occasionally discusses JSON-LD's `@context`, and regularly mentions `@id` and `@type`, I thought we might want to observe the same etiquette.","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-12-04T17:22:48.623Z"}

{"msg":"Yeah, I was thinking of a concept that I called `Protocol Invite` (likely a bad name, so very tentatively calling that). Basically, it would be static, out-of-band data structure that would express that a protocol interaction could be started and may provide some additional data to help start that interaction.  \n\nAdditionally, this data could contain information that would allow the scan to find an already existing connection or provide info that would allow it to start the did exchange protocol. I was think of using a publicly resolvable DID that I public entity would associate with all pairwise DID. Using service endpoint and routing keys would not work for Evernym echo system since we use a common service endpoint for all users of our agents and we don't reuse routing keys so there would not way to match.\n\nAnother think we were thinking about is a alternative path of the DID exchange protocol. I calling it a redirect (also maybe bad name). But basically, if the invitee think that it already has a connection with the inviter, he could send a message redirecting to a already existing connection (maybe provide evidence that it controls that connection via signature).

{"msg":"Hi! I'm a bit confused on how the connection protocol would work on a mobile device. Let's the scenario where an edge agent (mobile) would want to register with an agency (running aca-py). I'm assuming the interaction happens like 1. Edge agent gets the invitation from the agency (say by visiting a particular endpoint that just churns out invitations for simplicity). 2. Edge agent receives the invitation 3. Edge agent accepts the invitation and sends a connection request (this requires an endpoint for the edge agent) 4. Agency responds with a connection-response and 5. Edge agent sends an ack.

{"msg":"Short answer - yes. The idea is that the agency is semi-trusted - it can relay messages to (and optionally, from) the edge agent, but it can't see inside them - who they are from, what they are about. As such, it's possible to prevent it from learning a lot except about frequency and timing of messages.  That said, while we expect the mobile agent and the agency to be from the same vendor, it is definitely possible (because of the standardization of the protocols) for the mobile agent to be independent of the agency, to use multiple agencies, and even to receive and send messages for the same relationship using different agencies.

{"msg":"Just to be clear: the security issue that @kdenhartog raised and that @brentzundel commented on is not unique to ZKPs or CL signatures. If you prove something with any credential type, without someone asking you for the proof, there is a problem with replay attacks. This is because anyone can capture your proof and replay it at any time.

{"msg":"a) Wallets (storage) is created locally if necessary on startup of the agents.  They are just databases and you can use database tools to access them. However, all of the data in them is encrypted, which makes accessing them kind of boring.\n\nb) Depending on the startup options selected, data is stored in SQLite or PostgreSQL databases.  For aca-py, checkout the startup options.\n\nc) There is not currently a standard way to do that. A couple of approaches that might be useful for this.  Read and create a searchable database of transactions, and use it for discovery.  Find out the DID of Acme, and then find all of the Credential Definitions associated with Acme, and all the schema associated with those credential definitions.  However, you won't know how many of those are still in use, and you may not even be able to tell the which DID is Acme's.   Another way is that an Aries RFC could be created that enables such discovery. For example, after connecting with Acme, your agent sends a \"discover-credentials\" (made that name up...) protocol request, to which Acme replies with a list of credentials it offers. I don't know a lot about this protocol, but I think it is intended to be used for this type of thing - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0214-help-me-discover\n\nd) Take a look at the demo agent implementations in the /demo folder.

I expect the latter is the best option, but TBD. As well, different encryption keys should be used per agent. With that, you have one agent service, and depending on the messages arriving, different storage is accessed based on the agent in the message.\n\nFor (2) - currently you can use either sqlite or postgres. For sure postgres can be on a different machine - we do that with Kubernetes, where postgres is it's on pod, effectively a different machine. I suspect that you can do that with sqlite, but I'm not certain.

This is a very high assurance process and hence credential.\n\nExisting services currently have an account management, authentication and authorization process -e.g. how a university student logs into their account. The university may decide that login/authentication process is sufficiently secure to issue credentials using that process. This would likely be a medium assurance process.\n\nOur existing email service https://email-verification.vonx.io/ is very simple - it prompts for an email address, sends an email with a unique link in it and issues a credential to whomever accesses that unique link - presumably the owner of that email address.

{"msg":"Not entirely sure of the use case, but I can think of a couple of things.  First, a verifiable credential might meet the criteria, and we see a lot of uses for it. In that model, an Issuer issues the verifiable credential to a holder, and the holder can then prove that the issuer issued the credential to anyone else. The issuer puts metadata for the verifiable credential (a DID, a schema, and a credential definition) and it is that information that can be used to verify the validity of the proof.\n\nAlternatively, an entity can have a DID on a public ledger, and sign a message using that DID, and then deliver it (using Aries Agents over pairwise connections) to many recipients.  Each can use the DID on the ledger to verify the signature, and can connect to/message the DID owner for proof of control of the DID.

In the future, they would likely use verifiable credentials to establish that - a gov't ID for name, in person interview, etc.\n\n3a) That is described in the Indy anoncreds materials. Its too much for me to put here. In short, Alice makes a proof, and Acme verifies that the prove is correct.\n\n3b) Acme must know the DID of Faber (and has decided to trust it), or when first encounter must decide if they trust that DID, by finding out who that is. See this paper that I wrote about how this might be done. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nYq0iakgtyC21oUGWa5hLuJUoKeJFpURtGz6HcLIltY/edit We have the idea of a \"Credential Registry\" that is operated by a trusted party that might enable short circuiting the traversal process. E.g. to find out if a company exists, go to the Credential Registry for the jurisdiction in which it is registered. This is a production example of a Credential Registry: https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca. It contains verifiable credentials about every company registered in BC.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-01-09T21:39:03.485Z"}

There is any way to adapt the Aries Cloud Agent to run with multiple wallets instead of having hundreds (or thousands) of them?

Also I am seeing multiple commits around VCX in libindy. Would it make sense to use VCX for the users code instead of the Aries Cloud Agent?

{"msg":"Hello folks! We have been working on a mobile wallet app prototype that can show the received credentials in the UI and also use the credentials for proofs when using (different) credential-supporting services.

We would also like to sort (and possibly group) the credential attributes in the order the issuer defines. What we would like to get rid of is to hardcode these rules to the mobile app.\n2) There are different kinds of credentials that need different level of security. For example, when verifying a passport (issued by national authority), it may be required that the user is (bio)authenticated by the mobile device when the proof is done to make sure that it is actually the same person using the credential that it was issued to. In the other hand, when a movie ticket is verified, this level of security may not be needed.\n\nDoes anyone know if we have any way in the Aries/Indy-world to define and provide this kind of credential-related metadata?

{"msg":"I've heard there might be a way, but that's a python/mobile question vs. SSI that I know about.\n\nRegards questions above:\n\n1. In an enterprise system, you don't need an agent per user in the majority of use cases.  Not sure of yours, but for what we do, there can be one agent that scales up as needed - e.g. instances of the agent that are all processing requests, much like a web server. All share a common database (agent storage); protocol state is persisted, so any instance of the agent can handle any request.\n\nThe authn/authz question is too broad, but if you are looking for Open ID Connect auth with verifiable credentials, you can look at https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc. In the /docs folder there is a \"DemoInstructions\" document that you can run.\n\nThe multiple host app question is complex and depends on use cases. I would say there has been some theory provided on what to do, but no implementation of which I'm aware.\n\nThe challenge with your approach (e.g. that the mobile agent is just a UI, with the agent and agent storage/wallet in the cloud) is that the keys are not in the control of the user, they are in the control of the vendor hosting the service. What you want is that the keys are in the direct control of the user and that's hard to do in the cloud service model. And that loss of control may compromise the SSI element of the solution.

We are currently on our own testnet, but this might change. #3 is obviously the cheapest (only one schema def and one cred def per issuer) and most flexible solution. However we have to standardize the possible values of the type attribute somewhere else. AFAICT the claim=value restriction is not really implemented in ACA-PY today. The prover would have to set the attribute as a tag and the verifier would set a restriction using the wallet query language. So many things that can go wrong here...\nAnother approach to restrict only on a specific type using #2 would be to match only the tag of the credential definition id.

Other DID methods use similar techniques, but different details - different ledgers, different write mechanisms.\n\nThey are usually put there when initializing an agent and configuring, but it somewhat depends on the DID method. For example, with Indy, only credential issuers generally have public DIDs (put on a ledger) and so only agents that issue credentials need to write a DID.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-02-14T23:32:57.325Z"}

With Streetcred, first we need to set the network same with the URL_Ledger (for me is BCovrin Test network) we run on acapy-controller demo. After that, on Faber Controller, I created a *connection invitation* and convert it to QR code for Streetcred to scan. The connection is set, but the *connection state* I checked on Faber Swagger is \"*respone*\" not \"*active*\". So that we can not issue credentials. Then I sent a \"trust pinging\" to connection-id we created and magically the state of the connection has changed to \"*active*\".

{"msg":"As was indicated, aries generates and stores its own keys, for example, for the didexchange protocol to handle messages being sent and received. Thus, there are methods to use the keys to encrypt with their public key and decrypt with my private key. For @PradeepJaligama to provide his own keys and use the KMS to store the private key, I think his external application/controller could (maybe through a new rest API function) call a new function in the storage level, to store his keys. And another call to the KMS to decrypt something upon demand and return it back up to the outside application. Does that seem doable? A good idea?

{"msg":"Hi all, I have a question regarding aries-framework-dotnet. I'm currently writing my thesis on agencies/mediators in Aries and one of the goals is to allow inter-vendor edge agent -> mediator relationships. While looking through the code of aries-framework-dotnet I found an implementation based on the `basic-routing` message family.  (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/blob/master/src/Hyperledger.Aries.Routing/RoutingTypeNames.cs ). The aries-rfcs have no reference of this protocol or message family. Is this protocol documented somewhere, and are there any plans on making this an Aries standard? Using a combination of existing protocols (routing/forward, mediator coordination, transport return route / pickup) a part of this is already achievable, some parts are not. I think it would be great if for example an edge agent based on aries-framework-javascript could use aries-framework-dotnet as a mediator.","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2020-04-18T12:45:20.637Z"}
{"msg":"This protocol is experimental and not part of an RFC. There have been some efforts to standardize edge/mediator protocols, but nothing specific. In general, edge/mediator transport is considered to be \"vendor specific\" and isn't required to be standardized.

{"msg":"I've tried to wrap my head around this issue today, but have some unresolved thoughts.\n\nIt doesn't seem right to introduce a new protocol when there are already protocols in place to achieve most functionality.\n\nthe `basic-routing` protocol in `aries-framework-dotnet` achieves the following:\n- Retrieving messages\n- Deleting messages\n- Add keys for which messages should be stored\n- Add device info (for push notifications I assume)\n\nThe adding of keys for which to store messages could be achieved using the already existing Mediator Coordination Protocol. This allows to separate the storing of messages from the forwarding of messages. When an endpoint is available for the recipient the Mediator Coordination Protocol in itself is sufficient to setup mediation.\n\nWhen the recipient of a message does not have an endpoint a way is needed to retrieve messages. Currently the pickup protocol can be used for this. This is however only for picking up pending messages and doesn't have an inbox. Compare it to POP where messages are deleted after retrieval. As per PR 414 (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/414#issuecomment-594466265) an error in the flow could introduce for lost messages. To solve this retrieval of messages could be separated from the deletion of messages . This is how the `basic-routing` protocol in `framework-dotnet` currently does this.\n\nIn a comment on explicitly separating the pickup from the release-from-server-storage process, Daniel Hardman said that it would be so close to how IMAP works we maybe should abandon the pickup protocol all together and let agents use IMAP instead (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/414#issuecomment-594689457). Although he makes a valid point, I think the complexity of integrating IMAP into agents is way above that of a simple message access protocol in Aries. Also the implementation of the `basic-routing` protocol shows the need for something like this.\n\nI created a quick 'Message Access Protocol' document based on the pickup protocol, inspired by the `basic-routing` protocol. It would replace the pickup protocol. It is nowhere near complete, but gives an idea of the  goals: https://hackmd.io/BFh1ZQN4SNWxLgybqzazkA  I did not add a the concept of an inbox. The implementation  in `aries-framework-dotnet` where this design is partially based on does use an inbox. Would it be useful to introduce the concept of inboxes? It could also be implied that when an agent is granted mediation trough the Mediator Coordination Protocol an 'inbox' is automatically created.\n\nThis would only leave the 'Add device info' functionality. For this maybe some metadata functionality could be added to the protocol. Or maybe something like out-of-band notification info that the mediator could use to notify the edge agent of new messages (e.g. device id for push notifications)\n\nI think the impact of not defining a protocol for this would be that interoperability between different code-bases would be harder.\n\nI would really appreciate some thoughts on this topic. If we can come to an agreement I will invest the time of creating an RFC. @swcurran @jljordan_bcgov @tomislav \nalso pinging @danielhardman  due to the comments on IMAP, and @TelegramSam  as the author of the pickup protocol.","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2020-04-19T18:45:42.108Z"}

Consider the same scenario in the paper world - it's exactly the same (which is what we want).  If Acme can monitor verified credentials without the holders permission, we wind up in a surveillance situation.\n\n- Since Faber has no idea where Alice used her credential, they don't know who to notify.\n- Since ACME got a trusted credential, they have no need to assume it is otherwise good.\n   - If ACME later discovers the error, they might stop trusting Faber (since they are not authoritative, not trustworthy), but they aren't going to continually ping Alice or Faber to ask \"Is that information I received still right?\"\n- Faber could announce that they had a problem with the issuance of credentials, but that is use case specific.

{"msg":"MvvmCross has been largely lacking support for modern patterns. Aries .NET relies on the dependency injection packages using `IServiceCollection` and `IServiceProvider`. Most DI frameworks support these. MvvmCross still rolls their own thing. Having said that, you would have to register all services yourself to work with MvvmX. As someone who has used MvvmX in the past quite a lot, I would advise against it. It's a very opinionated framework that lacks good support. An alternative I can suggest is a framework designed and maintained by the Xamarin team which is very lightweight and open source. In fact, it's a copy/paste kind of solution - you pick the features you want and just add them to your code. https://github.com/xamcat/mobcat-library","username":"tomislav","ts":"2020-05-02T14:00:27.526Z"}

{"msg":"I believe that using a websocket for mobile agent communication is an excellent idea. In fact, the toolbox is written to use websockets as a transport when supported.","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-05-20T20:35:52.740Z"}
{"msg":"There big question is, who hosts the other end of the websocket?","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-05-20T20:36:10.085Z"}
{"msg":"And related: That other end needs to queue messages when the mobile agent is disconnected.","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-05-20T20:37:17.743Z"}
{"msg":"One answer is a cloud agent: Your mobile agent connects to this cloud agent, who performs the routing functions for messages bound for the mobile agent.","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-05-20T20:37:36.277Z"}
{"msg":"Another more limited form is the use of a mediator: an agent that will receive messages on your behalf (but cannot decrypt them), and sends them to you when you connect.","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-05-20T20:38:11.624Z"}
{"msg":"The third, more generalized but less ideal form, is that any agent could support that sort of queue.","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-05-20T20:38:50.824Z"}
{"msg":"My general vote is the mediator approach. A mobile app has a direct connection (the last option I mentioned) with a mediator, and the mediator queues messages for retrieval (likely over a websocket connection).","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-05-20T20:39:54.896Z"}
{"msg":"Other agents are given that mediator as an endpoint: they don't need to know how the message gets to the mobile app.","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-05-20T20:40:31.770Z"}
{"msg":"Use of the mediator also provides some herd privacy. If many people use the same mediator, the party on the other side cannot use the serviceEndpoint or mediator to correlate me.","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-05-20T20:41:25.622Z"}
{"msg":"that does require that a mobile app has a mediator. This could be provided by the mobile app vendor, but may also be selected in a different way.","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-05-20T20:41:58.677Z"}

{"msg":"I am not the most technical person and this may be slightly off subject, but I had an idea that I think might be useful for this conversation about agents.  Protonmail is opensource so I realized that you could use the same code base/technologies to make a cloud credential wallet instead of a cloud inbox.  their mobile agent is open source as well so if you didn't want to completely re-invent the wheel you could create a cloud credentil wallet agent and mobile agent designed the same way as protonmail and you could piggyback off there technology and benefit from their community security updates.

{"msg":"I don't think the options need to cancel each other out. Option 1 is a good option if you're willing to host your own agent. Option 2 I think is the best for a lot of people as they don't want to set up any infrastructure of their own. Option 3 is less desired in my opinion as picking up messages becomes increasingly more tedious as the number of connections grow.","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2020-05-21T09:19:01.256Z"}
{"msg":"In aries-framework-javascript we are also aiming at the second approach. Maybe we could formalize how a websocket connection is created as just opening a websocket is not enough. Without the party that opened the connection sending a message to the mediator, the mediator has no way to identify who opened the websocket connection. In my propsal for framework-javascript (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/issues/40) I proposed to use the `noop` message from the pickup protocol with a `~transport` decorator for return routing. This indicates to the mediator that it can be used to send messages, authenticates the party that openend the connection, and also allows to determine which messages (from the sending did) should be send over the connection.","username":"TimoGlastra","ts":"2020-05-21T09:19:19.584Z"}

{"msg":"If this isn't already in an RFC, I'd love it to be. Note that this mechanism is not required in the strictest sense: it is optional if the mobile app and mediator are provided as a bundle by a vendor.","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-05-21T20:31:59.236Z"}

With paper, we get a sticker to go on our license with the new address (at least that's what happens in BC). With verifiable credentials we can revoke the credential with the old address and issue a new one.  Revocation can also be used for when Bad Things happen, such as when a driver permit to drive is revoked because of a bad driving record.  Another example is when a permit for something (for example, a building permit) is issued to a company, and later that company is dissolved.

Indy wallets store: DIDs, the private keys associated with DIDs you create, other ledger transactions that you create (schema, credential definitions, revocation registries, revocation entries).\n3. The \"metadata\" are the objects needed to prove and verify claims from credentials. That means in Indy -- schema, credentials definitions, RevRegs and RevEntries).\n4. \n- Issuer creates DID, schema (or reuses an existing one), Credential Definition (public keys per claim, pointer to Issuers DID, pointer to Schema)\n- Issuer optionally creates a Revocation Registries (if creds will be revocable) which has a pointer to the CredDef.\n- Issuer offers a credential to the Holder; Holder requests the credential, providing a blinded link secret; Issuer issues credential to the Holder.\n   - the credential references the CredDef (points to schema and Issuer DID), is signed by the Issuer DID private key, each claim is signed using the keys in the - CredDef, the Holder gets a credential ID (for revocation)\n- Verifier sends a proof request to the Holder with the list of claims they want proven. Claims have restrictions about the credentials they can come from (e.g. what schema, what Cred Def, what issuers, etc.)\n- Prover finds credentials that meet the criteria in the cred def and constructs a proof.\n    - They prove they have the link secret that proves the credentials were issued to them.\n    - The DID and signature on each claims prove they were issued by the issuer\n    - The signing of each claim using the CredDef keys prove they were not tampered with.\n    - If revocable, the Prover creates a \"Proof of non-revocation\" to show the claims are from credentials that are not revoked.\n- Verifier gets the Cred Def from the ledger, the schema from the ledger, the Issuer DID from the ledger and uses those to verify the proofs from the Prover.\n\nRevocation is a little more complicated and there is detail available here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation\n\nHope that helps.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-06-23T00:23:27.126Z"}

{"msg":"HI all, I was wondering whether in Aries there is any specification on how an application's frontend (e.g. web or mobile) should interact with agents. I have seen the `Out-of-band` rfc for establishing the connection between the user's agent and the \"enterprise\" cloud agent. But how would the frontend be updated on changes in the relationship of the two agents for example after a presentation was sent and acknowledged or a verifiable credential has been received?","username":"jangerritharms","ts":"2020-06-23T14:19:18.350Z"}

{"msg":"@TelegramSam Thanks for responding. Probably I had a wrong model in mind. I thought a web app would talk directly to a user's agent (similar to how a dApp communicates with MetaMask) where as the intended architecture is probably that a web app talks to an app's backend that integrates with that app's cloud agent. And that cloud agent communicates with a user's cloud/edge agent. So how the app's frontend communicates with the app's backend is outside the scope of Aries specifications.

This means, for example, that dates can't be strings but instead have to be encoded as integers using something like Unix epoch.  Strings are usually encoded by issuers as a hash of the string.

Or we could come up with a fancy scheme that uses something you have, something you are, and something you know.

{"msg":"Our recent discussions about ‘enhancing’ the Connections/DID Exchange protocols with ‘profile’ information has brought up an issue I’ve been struggling with for a bit now. (thread)","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-07-06T23:23:31.172Z"}
{"msg":"As a community, we have placed a huge significance on the act of a user ‘accepting’ an invitation to connect. Our emphasis on placing the user in control of this interaction is good. I believe that our timing of this user action has some negative side effects.\n\nIt is desirable for a user to have good, quality information available to allow them to make an informed decision. This becomes difficult when evaluating an Invitation to connect, because a secure connection has not yet been established. We therefore aspire to include more information in an invitation to allow the user to make a decision. I believe that keeping the security aspects of the protocol and the information aspects of the protocol separate is worth it in the long run.\n\nAn analogy might be made here to visiting a website in the browser: TLS is leveraged to transfer information from a web server to a browser when a user first visits a website. After viewing the page, the user then chooses whether they will further engage, or discard the relationship (TLS connection work).\n\nI believe we should consider the exchange of DIDs to be similar: useful to establish a secure communication channel. If we move the user’s decision point on whether to ‘accept’ the connection further down the timeline, we have the ability to exchange credentials and pass other information along in a secure manner.\n\nIn a practical sense, this means we label newly formed connections as ‘pending’ or ‘resolving’ or something similar. These connections might even be hidden from the user. When enough information is received over the connection, the user is then prompted to ‘accept’ the connection, alongside verified, rich information. Should the user decline, the relationship may be discarded.\n\nPerhaps the greatest benefit of this mental model switch is that we can align the moment of ‘connection’ and ‘trust’ in the user experience. A user is presented with enough information to make a quality decision, and perhaps also assign some level or type of trust to the relationship.\n\nAs the error we’ve made is a mental model (which I’ve likely contributed substantially to), no protocol changes are necessary for this improvement in user experience. We must change how our apps work, and how they present choices to their owners.\n\nWe should also engage in discussing what information is sufficient, as a baseline, for agents to require before involving the user. As this aspect of the process is likely to improve over time, we may safely choose an imperfect but expedient answer to this question. We will improve over time, and it is far less critical that we have only 'one' way to accomplish this.","username":"TelegramSam","ts":"2020-07-06T23:24:43.961Z"}

Yes, we could just give guidance \"Hey - don't trust the other side -- verify them\" -- that what we say today.  Responsibility is on both sides to figure out how to get that. I think we need a higher level abstraction that provides ways to do that. Sure, a proof is going to be a good way to do that (although there may be others), but a short form way to say what proofs might be acceptable would help. For example, we really want a way for a user get information about a service.  We don't want the user to have to construct a proof on the fly to do that.

Alice wants to connect; does she want to hire Bob, or network with him, or demand payment for his unpaid bill? In this case, asking how we elevate trust is the wrong question, because the trust we need is dependent on the context that exists only in Alice's brain. For either Alice or Bob to say, immediately after connecting, \"Hey, here are 3 ways to build trust with me\" makes no sense. What they should be saying is, \"I propose to use this new channel to negotiation a contract with you as a contractor. GIVEN THAT CONTEXT, here's a trust framework we can use (which implies things about reasonable issuers and credentials, and maybe about protocols) -- and here are 2 or 3 protocols we could use to build trust up to \"Level C\" in the governance framework, which is the one the recommend for people signing contracts.","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2020-07-10T22:10:31.509Z"}

They may have their own database as a check basis, and if this passed in credential is valid in their database, then it will return true, otherwise will return false. So what are the advantages for verifiable credential approach, comparing with this tradition approach. Thanks.","username":"lijiachuan","ts":"2020-07-15T11:55:04.238Z"}

{"msg":"Your first sentence is not correct.  When you verify a credential, you receive a DID that must be public (on a ledger) so you can access the associated public key to verify the credential.  You do not have to contact the Issuer to verify the credential.  For example, you may have a pre-defined list of DIDs that you know and trust, and you just make sure that the issuer is on the list.\n\nIf you don't know the DID of the issuer, you will want to find out who the are.  One way to do that would be to connect with the issuer and ask who they are (e.g. request a credential that shows they have authority to issue the credential you are verifying). There are other ways to do that as well. \n\nYou don't need to contact the issuer to verify the credential. You may need to in deciding if you trust what the issuer has said in the credential.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-07-15T20:56:27.620Z"}

Thanks.\n\nI think the webhook is one \"push\" model about information exchange between two systems/applications, we can call it trigger application and action application, and normally this could be one backend interaction. Image application A is the trigger app, and application B is the action app. When application A has one special event happened, then it will invoke application B's webhook. So here I would like to have your thoughts that, whether application B can use web socket to let user know that there is a new event/data received, and user can take related action accordingly?

Aries framework Go is the exception here, it does not support Indy based credentials. However from what I know they also don’t support revocation at the moment.\n\nRunning Aries completely decoupled from a ledger should be possible if you don’t use public DIDs, and use a credential method that doesn’t require you to store schemas and credential definitions on the ledger. This is not possible with Indy.\n\nHowever for revocation using a ledger is crucial. Without the revocation status being anchored in a ledger the verifier will need to talk directly to the issuer about revocation status. How else can we know for sure the credential hasn’t been revoked? This introduces some privacy concerns, and also makes the holder dependent on the infrastructure of the issuer.

{"msg":"which is the motivation of the question","username":"daidoji","ts":"2020-10-15T18:35:10.381Z"}
{"msg":"Simple answer no.  Any Aries framework implements an interface to allow a controller (business logic) to control an instance of the framework.  Together the instance of the controller and framework are an Agent.  The interface exposed is different per Aries framework -- e.g. .NET is a library embedded in the controller, ACA-Py (Python) and aries-framework-go expose a REST API for the controller to use.   The framework's all send ping the controller when something happens (\"Hey, I received a message for this protocol you started\") so that the controller can tell the framework how to respond.  As such, as a basis, all of the frameworks expose to the controller an interface to execute the whole protocol, which is more complex than a simple request/response.\n\nThat said, some frameworks expose a simplified API endpoint to let the framework handle the whole protocols in some default way.   For example, ACA-Py has a `credential-issue/send` endpoint that says \"Send this credential to this connection and let me know when it is done\".   That is close to what the simple Issuer HTTP API is that you are talking about.  BTW -- I don't think it is a \"W3C Issuer API\".  It's talked about in the CCG, but is not a W3C standard.\n\nFinally, because DIDComm is inherently async messaging, a synchronous \"request/response\" HTTP protocol is not going to work in some (we think a lot) of use cases.  But that's a deeper topic.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-10-15T18:36:31.739Z"}
{"msg":"@swcurran okay, oh wow.  I guess I was way off then in my understanding of various topics but thanks for that that answer.

Hmmm.","username":"daidoji","ts":"2020-10-15T18:40:18.150Z"}
{"msg":"In light of that answer, if you were working on a project where you wanted to use Aries but were required to interop with other teams who might not being using did methods that were based on Indy and DIDComm how would you go about it?

{"msg":"would you build a middleware instead for the workflows you wanted to support or is there some other kind of generalizable protocol one could use to do that?  Or is DIDComm that protocol and I just don't understand it yet?","username":"daidoji","ts":"2020-10-15T18:42:58.547Z"}
{"msg":"If you want to use Aries, you definitely need to understand the tao of DIDComm.  I'd then look at the interfaces exposed by the frameworks to see what they do out of the box.  Then I'd be looking at what the other teams are doing and hence what flexibility you have. Chances are an API could be built from what the other team is doing to the Aries agent with minimal effort.  It might be done in the framework, or as a controller that \"wraps\" the framework.\n\nTough to answer beyond that.  :-)","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-10-15T18:52:12.166Z"}

In our opinion this is an important feature that should be part of an RFC to promote interoperability. We (Lissi) think the best way to implement this feature is to add an attachment (e.g. credential_image~attach) to the credential offer message.\n- should this be an optional part in the RFC 0036 issue-credential?\n- Is there already a discussion on this topic somewhere?\n- what do you think?","username":"mickra","ts":"2020-10-29T14:45:24.290Z"}

I'd like to make a POC with a mobile agent, but can't find a good tutorial on how to do it. Is there some \"practical\" resource on the topic? Also, to develop a mobile agent is it necessary to use the Xamarin framework? I looked up the agent-framework-javascript repository, but it seems to be in a very early stage of development.

Then, when a registered user wants to login, the website and the user (via their agents) do a challenge-response flow where the user has to prove that he was \"issued\" a token by the website. The website checks its database to see that the \"login credential\" of the user has not been revoked (for w/e reason) and acts accordingly.

The commitment is represented by the formula g^x*h^r in a modular field, where g and h are generators, x is the link secret, and r is a randomly chosen blinding factor.\n\nWhen a credential is used later, part of the proof is to show that the holder of the credential knows the link secret. This is done by generating a new numeric expression that derived from the same link secret as the commitment in the issued credential. The original commitment is not simply revealed; rather, a mathematical relationship between the unrevealed commitment in the issued cred and the new expression chosen by the holder is proved.\n\nThis binds the holder to the credential on the basis that the holder knows a secret that only the holder of the credential is supposed to know. This is quite similar to binding the holder to a DID in the credential (a technique that ZKP-oriented credentials support but that is rarely used because it adds no extra value). The similarity is that binding to DIDs is also based on knowledge of a secret -- the private key of the DID controller.\n\nIn addition to the crypto of the actual proving, in Hyperledger Indy (all vendor stacks I know of) and most of the other Hyperledger stacks, the whole proving conversation takes place over DIDComm. This means that the prover has ALSO used authenticated encryption to prove that they are the owner of a DID. The net effect is that the prover is simultaneously bound to the credential(s) by link secrets, and to the relationship with the verifier by DIDs.\n\nHTH","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2021-01-14T17:42:06.645Z"}

{"msg":"Thanks Daniel, this is great and your rebuttal of the paper I linked is very thorough. Much appreciated.\n\nI actually know the cryptography behind privacy ABC's relatively well and am very much an advocate/admirer of what has been achieved in Indy over the years.\n\nI am just a bit confused about how DIDs in DIDComm diverge from pseudonyms in the literature. Pseudonyms are generated from the link secret as a commitment, they can be provable bound to a credential. I.e this nym you know me by was created from the same link secret as the secrets in the credentials I used to create the proof I am presenting. They also include mechanisms that ensure a link secret can only produce a single pseudonym per defined domain.\n\nDIDs in DIDComm are (I think) created from a key pair. Is this associated to the link secret as @daidoji mentions. I didn't think they were. These give you authenticated encryption but it is not entirely clear to me how they achieve credential or domain binding features.\n\nSo in theory I could establish a connection using DIDComm using secrets in my wallet, but forward proof requests to a friend and respond using a proof they generated for me.\n\nI recognize this is hard and you discuss it in detail along with mitigations in your write up.\n\nI am more interested in the decision to move away from pseudonyms, because both credential binding and domain binding as described seem like useful features that are not obviously possible today.  Or maybe I am still missing something.\n\nThanks","username":"wip-abramson","ts":"2021-01-14T19:47:15.602Z"}

{"msg":"hi everyone,\nas the SSI ecosystem grows, we feel there is a growing need for a standardized wallet security ecosystem and therefore a working group called \"Wallet Security\" is to be launched under DIF umbrella.\nIn particular we think that:\n- we should get a common understanding, terminology about wallet security in the community\n- talk about wallet security architectures to analyze similarities\n- create a specification and interface to communicate about wallet capabilities, security, regulation-conformance and other points of interoperability\n- define mechanism to enable wallet security assertions, certification and ways to prove them\n- define specifications about wallet user authentication, ways how to ensure them and how to communicate them to issuers/verifiers\n\nIf you are interested about this topic and like to comment, participate, criticize:\n- please review the Wallet Security WG Charter: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18H2hVjHZEBjbnzod8tLogJIEzySdecbk9d-QBJaqHP0/edit\n- subscribe to the mailing list: https://lists.identity.foundation/g/wallet-security\n\nAfter gathering initial feedback, we will have an open discussion meeting soon.\n\nI hope this is in the best interests of the community and will get the necessary feedback to make an impact.\nBest regards,\nPaul Bastian","username":"paul.bastian","ts":"2021-02-08T17:30:02.766Z"}

{"msg":"Hi guys! I've got a security question:\nIs there a standardized way how mobile agents show the name of a verifier? Let's imagine next to a door is a printed static QR code. If you scan it, your mobile agent connects to the doors agent (Notice: the doors agent decides about its connection label presented to the user! In this case: \"VIP Palace Inc.\"). Then the doors agent sends a presentation request which the user agrees to. If everything is ok, the door opens. Fine.\nNow imagine someone malicious prints a QR code and sticks it over the original one. When the user scans this malicious code, the mobile agent connects to the attackers agent. This time, the attackers agent also uses the label \"VIP Palace Inc.\" and requests the same credential while the user has no idea who he is communicating to.\nIf I don't miss anything, this is a way for phishing information presented via credentials, isn't it?","username":"haggis","ts":"2021-02-24T14:00:21.540Z"}

{"msg":"normatively, neither. Since that's a portion of the security considerations section, the purpose is not to state how something must be done, but to rather say here's some things you should consider while designing. Ultimately this is not a decision that should be made at this layer, but what you do at this layer will affect the layers which depend on this decision.\n\nFor example, vc-js takes a document loader in and in that document loader you define a strategy for how you plan to resolve a DID. So if your VC proof contains did:example:123?version=4 and the resolver that's used in that document loader returns a valid JSON-LD document with a ldp key (the JSON object like Ed25519VerificationKey2018) and it's in the appropriate verification method it will validate for you.\n\nHowever, if you built a document loader that doesn't resolve did:example:123?version=4 (say because example did method doesn't support resolving old versions) then it won't validate because no did document is able to be resolved and therefore no public key can be found to validate the VC.\n\nIn other words, this is up to the VC validation logic you choose until a protocol spec is written on how the VC MUST be processed in which case some did methods may not be able to comply with the that spec because they will have made design choices at the DID layer which impact that processing logic.","username":"kdenhartog","ts":"2021-03-04T06:57:32.099Z"}

When Alice needs to send a message to Bob's cloud agent, which way is correct? 1. Alice constructs an encrypted envelope with Bob's cloud agent, and sends it directly to Bob's cloud agent through Alice's cloud agent. 2. In addition to constructing an encrypted envelope with Bob's cloud agent, Alice also needs to construct an encrypted envelope with Agency, and the message is forwarded through Agency。","username":"ye_zi","ts":"2021-03-12T03:40:20.105Z"}

And, we require connection_id while issuing credentials, presenting proofs and messaging. What I have noticed is that private DIDs are not used in this OpenAPIDemo after establishing connection.

{"msg":"Hi everyone, in the \"present-proof\" protocol, is it possible for a verifier to share the proof presentation submitted by the holder with a third-party so that the third-party can also verify the proof?

{"msg":"The third party could verify the same cryptography as the verifier  -- who the issuer was, that the claims had not been tampered with/forged, and the proof of non-revocation, if provided.

I understand how it works in Anoncreds using CL signatures and that the issuer basically signs a commitment to the link secret as the first message of the message block which also contains the holders attributes. I guess when you are referring to the current W3C VC standard and proving that you are in control of a private key, you are referring to the utilization of BBS+ signatures rather than CL signatures, as they do not demand for a link secret anymore, but rather allow for one keypair per credential? \nCould you provide some resources on the mechanism where the Holder must have an \"identifier in the VC from the issuer\"?

The missing mobile notification (Firebase / APNs) feature was the main reason that prevented us from using ACAPy as a medation agent and so we are going with AF for .net.\nBecause AF for .net does not make use of Askar yet (afaik) we are bound to the experimental postgres feature in Indy. \nThere are 4 strategies that we tested:\nDatabasePerWallet (load scaling is good but postgres initial db size is 8 MB. Not reliable for multi-million edge wallets)\nMultiWalletSingleTable (bad load scaling with increasing connections),\nMultiWalletSingleTableSharedPool (bad load sclaing with increasing connections),\nMultiWalletMultiTable (not implemented)\n\nWe are currently evaluating our own implementation of \"MultiWalletMultiTable\" that keeps all tables in the same DB but puts the edge wallet name as suffix.

But I recommend that you look at those signatures schemes to be sure.\n\nFor the verifier to prove the Holder is Alice, they must collect enough information to know that. For example, in many business context \"knowing Alice is Alice\" is based on a gov't ID, and so enabling Alice to have that in a trusted way is needed.  For example, in BC, to get such a digital ID, you have to do an online live session or record a video that is both reviewed by a human and checked against the ID database held by the province -- basically a Level 3 Assurance process. Once you have that, the process is to have the holder prove that credential to the verifier.  Of course it doesn't have to be gov't ID -- it's really up to the verifier to decide what they think is sufficient to know Alice the Holder really is Alice.  The verifier needs to know what the Issuer did to verify Alice before they issued a credential.  The governance framework as the basis for issuing a credential is really important.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2021-11-05T14:55:37.495Z"}

{"msg":"HI all, \n\nI’ve recently been working with Hyperledger Aries (versions 0.6.0 & 0.7.1) & have generally found it to be a really amazing framework.\n\nHowever I notice there seems to be some inconsistencies resulting in errors when executing some of the API calls for the Acapy agents. \n\nFor instance I was able to successfully run a full sequence of schema/credential definition, credential request/issuance & credential verification on a new instance with my Issuer, holder & verifier nodes. \n\nHowever, when attempting to run the same sequence again for a brand new set of credentials I get the following error t the send presentation API call:\n\n`Error when constructing revocation state: Error: Invalid structure.

In my current understanding of one of the Aries framework (Dotnet to be precise), on doing so, all the credentials of wallet-A would now be overwritten with credentials of wallet-B.

{"msg":"BC Gov has posted a funded \"Code With Us\" Challenge for individuals/teams interested in updating Hyperledger Indy to support the new `did:indy` DID Method, specified [here](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/). The opportunity and response guidelines are [posted here](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace/opportunities/code-with-us/e3dd1605-cc1d-4c30-a9ee-245940bccd0d). The total funding for the challenge is $70,000CDN and is divided into 4 phases. The first 3 phases require the use of Python working on the [Indy Node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node) and [Indy Plenum](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum) repos, while the 4th phase requires Rust development in the [Indy VDR](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr) repo. Those responding may choose to apply for only the Python work, only the Rust work or both.\n\nQuestions can be asked here or on the website hosting the opportunity.\n\nApplications for the challenge will be accepted up to January 10, 2022. and the work is expected to begin shortly after that date, with completion expected by March 31, 2022.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2021-12-22T19:13:46.092Z"}

{"msg":"Indy AnonCreds supports strings and integers. All strings are hashed into an integer, and it is the integer that is actually signed - as defined here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0036-issue-credential#encoding-claims-for-indy-based-verifiable-credentials\n\nAs such, it is possible (and has been done) to encode different data types into strings -- e.g. base64 images to text. To do that, both the issuer and the verifier (at least) and usually the holder have to agree about the format of the strings -- how to decode them.\n\nWe are currently looking at the possibility of using Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) as a way for the issuer to express what they are issuing. We're primarily looking at OCA for localization (multi-language support of labels on data), but data formats would also be supported.\n\nhttps://humancolossus.foundation/blog/cjzegoi58xgpfzwxyrqlroy48dihwz","username":"swcurran","ts":"2022-01-04T19:31:52.025Z"}

{"msg":"I assume you mean \"received by a verifier\".  \n\nFrom a general a general Aries coding perspective, the verifier can keep the presentation and recheck it if they want.\n\nFrom a specific implementation -- it would depend on what the the framework you are using has implemented.  I think in any framework, the controller could save the presentation.  Some frameworks may hang on to the presentation in secure storage, and so in theory you could re-process it - others may not.\n\nIn either case, you would need a way to invoke the \"verify presentation\" on the saved data. I suspect that few frameworks include a way to do that directly -- it would have to be added.  In ACA-Py, that could be done via a Plugin, or if it really makes sense, could be added to the core.\n\nIs there a good use case for using this as a general feature?","username":"swcurran","ts":"2022-01-13T22:42:42.271Z"}

{"msg":"Our policy has been to not save protocol objects in the wallet (aka secure storage) after use as (in our opinion) is the responsibility of the business logic -- the controller.  That keeps the secure storage smaller (things are deleted), only necessary items are kept in the wallet long term (e.g. private keys, connection records, etc.).","username":"swcurran","ts":"2022-01-13T22:50:31.137Z"}

{"msg":"What we have used in the \"issue credential\" model is to allow three options for the protocol state object -- keep in full (lots of data, all the back and forth messages), keep minimal (minimal info kept about issuance) and delete.\n\nThe same could be done for presentations. Keeping the entire state is a lot, but keep just the minimal might be useful.\n\nit's a reasonable option. \n\nIf this is using ACA-Py, could you capture some of this and put it in an issue for discussion?

{"msg":"Hello. I'm looking into use ACA-Py to send/receive verifiable credentials between mobile agents, possibly using multi-tenancy and in a serverless environment (e.g., AWS Lambda). The ACA-Py cloud agent would only act as a message mediator between the sender and receiver, and would not be responsible for issuing or verifying credentials. While I have tried to get up to speed on the ACA-Py project, I am new so I apologize for any ignorance in my questions.\n\nFrom my understanding, the ACA-Py cloud agent does not have persistent wallet storage, only in-memory. If I wanted to implement a persistent storage backend for the cloud agent, what all would require implementation? I see there is an [abstract BaseStorage class](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/aries_cloudagent/storage/base.py). Beyond implementing a concrete persistent storage class, what else would need to be \"swapped out\" or \"injected\" to use this new storage backend?\n\nMy assumption here is that, because the cloud agent would be in a serverless environment, a persistent storage backend is required to persist the peer DIDs that are established to allow for communication between the sender and receiver mobile agents. In this case, I believe the sender and receiver would act as the controller, where the messages that they send between each other would ultimately stem from a user interacting with the mobile agent.\n\nThe multi-tenancy would be used so that there would only need to be a single \"instance\" (i.e., Lambda function endpoint) that could manage the communication between different sender-receiver pairs.\n\nThank you in advance!","username":"rtatton","ts":"2022-01-23T19:33:09.232Z"}

{"msg":"That makes sense. Actually, in the case of a serverless function, it's okay that the queues are not persistent as this can be external to the cloud agent's functionality. \n\nHowever, because state is not guaranteed to be persisted across function invocations, the wallet would need a storage implementation that is external to the agent. For example, if using AWS Lambda, the wallet could be persisted using S3, DynamoDB, or one of their SQL databases. Perhaps this could be as simple as saving the SQLite or Postgres DB file to S3 such that it's loaded upon function invocation and just before finishing the invocation.","username":"rtatton","ts":"2022-01-25T20:06:20.549Z"}

{"msg":"Here is another question. If I create a DID in wallet (storage), make it public and push to the ledger.  After that If restart my server it'll not run because: \"New seed provided which doesn't match the registered public did\". How can I get around in this situation?

{"msg":"It depends on how you are creating the DID in the ledger.  Your wallet and the ledger have to be in sync (same DID, verkey, private key), so if you destroy your wallet between reboots, you have to make sure you can reproduce the same DID.  You do that by using the same seed.  It sounds like when you are starting, you are using a random seed and so it is different any time.\n\nIf you do want to be able to continue running after reboots, you should be making sure you are persisting your secure storage (wallet) across reboots.\n\nNote that while you can recreate an identical DID by using a seed, you cannot do that with a Claim Def, so if you delete your storage and recreate it, any Claim Def you create will NOT match the Claim Def on the ledger.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2022-01-26T22:01:53.877Z"}

Here obviously I get the error \"seed doesn't match the registered public\"  because I am providing a seed of the old DID. \nSo, how can I start my acapy with new public DID in this case?
