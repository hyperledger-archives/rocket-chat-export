TROUBLE SHOOTING Getting-Started Guide (GSG)

If you setup the demo and encounter a 307 error recommend to take the following steps to cleanup and start over. The communication with the ledger is affected and it is not possible to run the demo. Here are some recommendations for other errors.
306: you already have a configured ledger. Perform clean start.
301: you are trying to create a ledger but it is already configured. A single failure will cause a problem when opening the ledger. Perform clean install.
212: wallet is not found. When this occur close container with docker-compose down and start again with docker-compose up

Steps for clean start

1. Remove existing instances
2. Reset source files
3. Perform a new build
4. Start demo

1. Make sure containers are closed

docker-compse down (to make sure containers are closed)
docker image ls (find image names that need to be removed in next step)
docker image rm getting-started
docker image rm indy_pool
docker volume ls (find volume name that needs to be removed in next step)
docker volume rm gettingstarted_sandbox

2. Reset source files

git tag (choose the latest version and use it as <branch_name>)
git checkout <branch_name>
git reset --hard (WARNING: make copies of any changes you want to keep prior to taking this step)
git fetch --all
git pull

3. Perform a new build

docker-compose build --no-cache (adding no cache to make clean build)

4. Start demo

docker-compose up
