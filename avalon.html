@danintel do you know if the code for Avalon comes over from Labs, or if it starts from a new, blank repo?

@danintel I started trying to add people to https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/avalon-maintainers/members and I see a bunch of the usernames in this file: https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/CODEOWNERS are invalid GitHub usernames. Could I ask you to submit a PR to fix that file, and tell me who to add to the maintainers group?

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:27:44 GMT):<br/>
OK @danintel I've added/invited all of those people to https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/avalon-maintainers/members - do I need to undo this and move this repo back to labs?
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:31:27 GMT):<br/>
I just spoke to @EugeneYYY (he is next to me). He says to start with Avalon empty for now.  So undo the move and move it back to labs.  The CODEOWNERS change can remain (but does not have to).

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:34:24 GMT):<br/>
Will the new repo be a squash commit or something?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:39:08 GMT):<br/>
@EugeneYYY ?
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:44:01 GMT):<br/>
@rjones  No squash commits--preserve the commit history if possible. It is waiting for approval from Intel. Sorry for the confusion. @EugeneYYY says a simple placeholder note pointing to the HL labs repo is all that's needed for now.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:46:21 GMT):<br/>
OK. Now I'm more confused as to your goal.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:46:40 GMT):<br/>
Is the code in the avalon repo the code that is coming in, or not?
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:51:04 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it is the code that is coming in.  @EugeneYYY says we need approval before populating Avalon.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:51:17 GMT):<br/>
Approval from ?
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:52:03 GMT):<br/>
Intel internal corporate approval.

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 21:29:16 GMT):<br/>
Hi @danintel and @EugeneYYY .  Can you elaborate why moving code from the labs repo to the main avalon repo needs Intel's legal approval?  It's already Hyperledger code, contributed with a DCO (right?)  
</p>
<p><strong>EugeneYYY</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 21:40:07 GMT):<br/>
We have several companies actively working on and contributing to the TCF github. We need to synchronize everybody to make sure that everybody will switch at once to the new repository. We learned only today that a new repo is available so within a couple days will move everybody at once to the new repo  
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 21:41:15 GMT):<br/>
all of the git remotes should magically work.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 21:41:31 GMT):<br/>
when you move or rename a repo, github does some magic redirects

</p>
<p><strong>EugeneYYY</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 21:49:40 GMT):<br/>
We are new to this process and everybody under pressure to have code done by Eth DevCon V so nobody wants any surprises at the critical time. I assume we also need to copy all TCF maintainers to Avolan.  
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:01:32 GMT):<br/>
@EugeneYYY That's great that there are contributors from several different companies (we prefer to talk about individuals, not corporations, as the active folks here).  Coordinating with them on a move and making sure github redirects etc are in place is important.  Just wasn't clear why legal needs to be involved.  Are we talking about other new code not already in the Labs repo?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:01:51 GMT):<br/>
@EugeneYYY those changes are already gone with the first move. The maintainers list was reset.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:03:02 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/avalon-maintainers/members contains the current list.
</p>
<p><strong>EugeneYYY</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:04:09 GMT):<br/>
Yes some contributors have code (almost) ready  and in the process pushing of their code
</p>
<p><strong>EugeneYYY</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:04:20 GMT):<br/>
Intel legal is not involved
</p>
<p><strong>EugeneYYY</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:08:55 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I looked at the maintainers list, but it is not the same as for TCF, e.g. there is no Manoj. Only tom and Dan are maintainers. We feel it is safer to postpone transition until Avalon/TCF team is aware and ready for transition. I will get back to you within couple days (folks are across diff geographies)
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:09:23 GMT):<br/>
ah, ok, my mistake
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:20:11 GMT):<br/>
@EugeneYYY all of the settings are gone. Moving it back to labs does not bring those settings back
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:21:51 GMT):<br/>
Hi, Brian, Ry. We have some internal processes here at Intel that are involved with ensuring the quality of the code we submit to open source projects.  When we make the transitions from HL Labs to HL top level project, we want to make sure that the quality fo the code matches the destination.  We think everythring is ready for that transition, but would like to reveiw and receive approval from our immediate mamagment before we make that transitions.  That review will take place next Tuesday.  If HL can accomidate that delay, it will make our lives as Intel contributures a bit easier.

Yes, it looks good. It makes sense to include both active and pending members because pending members are medical leave or off on holidays.  
</p>

In the event it hasn't been transitioned in time, through the magic of whatever back and forth you guys have already done it autoredirects back to the lab which is pretty cool.

Also noticing the wiki space hasn't been touched yet.  A gentle reminder that meetings need to be documented esp for Anti-trust reasons.  Confluence has something called "meeting notes" that makes it easy.  Let the CA team know if you need help at #community-architects

<p><strong>HarshaIntel</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 03:47:07 GMT):<br/>
@Silona sure Silona. We will align with you on the details and setup this meeting. This was a voting to know participant's preferences. Thanks for the offer!
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 20:07:54 GMT):<br/>
@rjones @EugeneYYY  The plan is to populate the other three repos later, but for now you can create empty repos for the other three with the same access rights. Move https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/trusted-compute-framework to https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon (and a redirect would from the former to latter would be great too) .

The following people were in the old Hyperledger Labs `trusted-compute-framework-committers` but are not in the new Hyperledger `avalon-committers`. I tried to add them all, but I cannot. That is because they are members of `hyperledger-labs` but *not* members of `hyperledger`, so I get an error when I try to add them. As a result, they cannot commit and they cannot review:

- @kubasiemion kubasiemion

<p><strong>prakashngit</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 23:15:39 GMT):<br/>
I was a maintainer, looks like I am not longer one now
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 23:19:45 GMT):<br/>
The question I have is: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=16324764 I understood this to mean, and based on conversations we've had in here, that the four listed repos would move into main Hyperledger GitHub org.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 23:20:43 GMT):<br/>
when I look in the user list for Hyperledger labs, I don't see @prakashngit in there

</p>
<p><strong>prakashngit</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 23:26:28 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:16:26 GMT):<br/>
hey all 👋
first of all thanks for the hardwork on this project 👍
i've been through most of the docs of the repo (not the spec I'll give you that 🙇 ) and successfully (at least I thought) developed my first workload based on the tutorial and other example apps
my workload works outside of TCF (built it as a separate standalone C++ app) but i cna't get it to work in TCF 
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:16:55 GMT):<br/>
i know that the workload is recognised succesfully has the TCF behaves differently with a random workload id
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:17:08 GMT):<br/>
other example apps work fine
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:17:28 GMT):<br/>
and i'm using the `generic_client.py` script to submit my work order
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:17:52 GMT):<br/>
TLDR: i'm after the common mistakes / troubleshooting procedure i could go through to debug my workload
</p>
<p><strong>manojgop</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:15:53 GMT):<br/>
@jopasserat can you check if your workload is registered successfully. You can build TCF with debug flag TCF_DEBUG_BUILD=1 and check for log messages regarding registration of workload. This will also enable enclave logs.
</p>

@jopasserat can you check if your workload is registered successfully. You can build TCF with debug flag TCF_DEBUG_BUILD=1 and check for log messages regarding registration of workload. The
debug flag will enable enclave logs which will be printed in stdout. This should help you debug your workload
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:28:40 GMT):<br/>
what message should I look for in the lojgs?
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:28:40 GMT):<br/>
what message should I look for in the logs?
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:29:04 GMT):<br/>
i assume it's registered since i don't get the same error than when submitting an invalid workload id
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:36:11 GMT):<br/>
once submitted i get an error 5 from the generic client
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:36:24 GMT):<br/>
"Work order is computing. Please query for WorkOrderGetResult                  to view the result"
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:36:32 GMT):<br/>
and the TCF log loops on the same message
</p>
<p><strong>manojgop</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:18:55 GMT):<br/>
That's normal operation. Currently only pull model is implemented by TCF. Client is expected to call WorkOrderGetResult periodically to get result of work order. 
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:25:08 GMT):<br/>
how do I know it's actually doing something? my workload is pretty light (similar to the heart evaluation) and I had left the client query for > 5 mins without getting the results back
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 23:58:53 GMT):<br/>
update: workload registered and started (commented out most of the logic to replace by the equivalent of an echo) 
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 23:59:14 GMT):<br/>
=> there's something behaving differently in and out TCF in my C++ code
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 00:00:00 GMT):<br/>
also noticed a large (and growing until disk was full...) `core` file under `scripts/`

@ferrarifei  Start with the examples and tutorial at https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/docs#tutorial 
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 19:31:17 GMT):<br/>
fixed the issue in my code => everything runs smooth
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 19:31:48 GMT):<br/>
question still remains of: is there a way to get more info about an execution?
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 19:32:04 GMT):<br/>
only clue i had here was this `core` file that suggested a crash at runtime

<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 21:57:02 GMT):<br/>
@jopasserat `export TCF_DEBUG_BUILD=1` might help. See  https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/PREREQUISITES.md#environment
Also look at the Avalon Listener and Enclave Manager log output.
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 10:18:33 GMT):<br/>
where shall i find the Avalon Listener and Enclave Manager log output? separate files (couldn't find where they'd be stored)? or part of the docker-compose tcf log on the console?
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 14:59:28 GMT):<br/>
@jopasserat The output goes to the terminal. It can be redirected to a file if needed.

<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 15:00:18 GMT):<br/>
@ferrarifei The technical details of Intel SGX enclaves are encapsulated in the Avalon libraries and Avalon Enclave Manager.

@ferrarifei The technical details of Intel SGX enclaves are encapsulated in the Avalon libraries and Avalon Enclave Manager.
If you want to learn about low-level details, I would look at the Intel SGX SDK and example programs.
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 16:20:36 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks @danintel  i guess the crash was too "sudden" in my case to see anything interesting in logs

</p>
<p><strong>ferrarifei</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 13:16:45 GMT):<br/>
Is there any more information about what is in the picture, I wonder how the SGX guarantees integrity for code and integrity and confidentiality for data
</p>
<p><strong>ferrarifei</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 13:20:01 GMT):<br/>
What's the relationship between workload and worker？
</p>
<p><strong>ferrarifei</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 13:20:13 GMT):<br/>
I know sgx applications are divided into two parts，app and enclave(trusted and untrusted),If I want to run my application to the SGX TEE, Do I need to modify it to two parts?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 13:24:29 GMT):<br/>
@ferrarifei I will try to answer you in simpler words
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 13:25:10 GMT):<br/>
Please read about remote attestation, how the quote from the device is sent and verified remotely is the key to integrity protection of your application
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 13:25:57 GMT):<br/>
Workload - Your business logic, Worker - A framework component which distributes work to the workloads.. At high level
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 13:28:16 GMT):<br/>
Ideally you need to design your application such that the core business part resides in the enclave, ensuring that even if your untrusted part is compromised the trusted part cannot be. But please refer to an example application in the https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon , it is easy to understand and well documented.

must I use C++ to write application as a workload?
</p>
<p><strong>Sun0216</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 14:17:01 GMT):<br/>
What is the purpose of using docker, and what does it have to do with SGX? I mean, are enclaves running in containers?
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 14:25:40 GMT):<br/>
TLDR: same algorithm, different params. Eth adopted keccak-256 before it got standardised with a different set of parameters under the name SHA3 https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/554/23688
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 17:39:52 GMT):<br/>
with regards to @Sun0216 's question :point_up: : from the current state of the repo it seems workloads are C++ only for the moment correct? How far are we from having the possibility to implement workloads using other programming environments /  Docker images in Avalon?
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 18:52:49 GMT):<br/>
Ethereum purposely calls it Keccak for that reason. It still causes confusion because sometimes Keecak refers to the official SHA-3 in non-Ethereum contexts (such as the OpenSSL library)
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 18:54:52 GMT):<br/>
@jopasserat Yes, workload implementations are only in C++ for now. There was a PR to add a Java workload, but it has appeared and disappeared twice.
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 18:58:20 GMT):<br/>
@Sun0216 *Language support:* For now only C++ is supported for workers. However, any other language can be added. There was a PR to add Java, for example.
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 18:59:22 GMT):<br/>
@Sun0216 Docker is used only as a convenience. It has nothing to do with the Avalon security model or enclaves.  Docker makes it easier to build and setup Avalon, but you can also build without Docker (although it requires several more steps)

</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 19:08:10 GMT):<br/>
Intel SGX enclaves can be thought of as a "reverse sandbox". A traditional sandbox restricts the software from accessing system or external resources on a machine (such as a Java VM). A SGX "reverse sandbox" or enclave keeps the system--other applications and even root--from accessing data inside the enclave. The PDF link at this webpage gives a good technical overview of Intel SGX enclaves: https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2016/06/06/overview-of-intel-software-guard-extension-enclave

@ferrarifei  *Avalon libraries* are provided in source form from https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/

<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 22:09:26 GMT):<br/>
i was more thinking of accepting workloads from Docker images the way iExec permits. isn't it on the roadmap? that's what I assumed from the reference to " native applications" in the wiki
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 22:12:33 GMT):<br/>

Hi All, 
I would like to send request to Avalon (I built the TCF based on https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/BUILD.md), but I am not sure where and how. Is the tcf listen port 9090? Should I use localhost:9090 to receive a request? Please help. 
Thank you in advance, 
Tom
</p>
<p><strong>rkrish82</strong> (Wed, 08 Jan 2020 07:22:14 GMT):<br/>
Tcf will listen on port 1947 and currently in docker mode either you have to get into tcf container to use it or you can do port mapping in tcf container to use outside the container.

The Linux Foundation’s CommunityBridge engineers are working on a tool to measure the health of critical open source projects and one of the key areas identified is QA Testing.  They request that our communities provide  honest and detailed information on testing tools and methodologies you use in your projects for us to come up with a detailed analysis, which they will share with all respondents and projects. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9H5G2GV. It’s only 5 questions long.

hi @EugeneYYY @rranjan3 do we want to make a decision on where to save the workshop resources? (demo keys and configs for besu target, docker-compose.yaml, truffle-config etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:01:32 GMT):<br/>
easiest is to have a "local" folder as a self-contained place to build a local test environment (as we did for DevCon)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:02:15 GMT):<br/>
it can have "besu", "fabric" subfolders to launch respective target blockchains
</p>
<p><strong>EugeneYYY</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:03:03 GMT):<br/>
You are talking about folders within VB VM (vs. in GITHUB repo), right? Then, it makes sense to me

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 19:21:40 GMT):<br/>
is there a trick when we map environment variables into a container? My container seems to understand the proxy as network traffic works but if I try to read the proxy environment variables themselves they are empty.
In container
```
$ env
<snip>
SGX_SSL=/opt/intel/sgxssl
SGX_SDK=/opt/intel/sgxsdk
TCF_HOME=/project/TrustedComputeFramework
https_proxy=
http_proxy=
</snip>
```
Docker Definition:
```
ENV http_proxy=$http_proxy
ENV https_proxy=$https_proxy
ENV TCF_HOME=/project/TrustedComputeFramework
ENV SGX_SSL=/opt/intel/sgxssl
ENV SGX_SDK=/opt/intel/sgxsdk
```
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 19:21:59 GMT):<br/>
on the physical host those proxy values are set
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 23:15:26 GMT):<br/>
so I think (but don't know) that the dockerfile only considers environment variables passed to it through the `--build-arg` flags.
The ENV items defined inthe image can later be overwritten using the `-e` flag on the `docker run` command line.
This doesn't come up in the avalon dockers because they are mostly launched with `compose` and the compose file essentially does what these command line flags to `docker build` and `docker run` do.
</p>
<p><strong>rranjan3</strong> (Sat, 14 Mar 2020 05:22:30 GMT):<br/>
What image do you use in this case @Dan ? Even in a vanilla bionic container, you should see several variables for `env`
</p>
<p><strong>rranjan3</strong> (Sat, 14 Mar 2020 05:48:14 GMT):<br/>
`$http_proxy` in your docker definition would be a variable in context at build time. To give it a value, you either use `--build-arg` or if using compose, add `args` under `build` as -
 `   build:
      context: ./
      dockerfile: ./DOCKER
      args:
        http_proxy: $http_proxy
` 
Then declare in the Docker definition as - 
`ARG http_proxy` // Needed when setting via compose. Not sure if that is the case for `--build-arg`

```

This would read your envt variable on host and set it within container. Yet another way to pass proxies is through a config json - https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/
But the latter 2 are for runtime of the container. Build time still might require the first approach.

thanks. I think what happened was I am using a dockerfile that was designed to be run from compose where those things would get set.

Hi Avalon enthusiasts,

The topic for the upcoming session on 03/24/2020 is DCAP presentation By Dan Middleton (Intel) 

Details:
We will look at how to use datacenter attestation primitives.
This attestation flow enables more distributed communication patterns than what we have today. 
The added flexibility also means there are a lot of possible paths to choose which can seem confusing. 
In order to get started we have created a lab that chooses one concrete path.
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/dancap
We will start by explaining attestation and then use the lab to demonstrate creating an attestation at one CSP and then verifying it in a (virtual) on-prem datacenter.

Regards
Harsha

Hi team! i'm trying to better understand what can and cannot be done with the workloads at the moment. Two questions:
  - the architecture overview document suggests workloads can be expressed not only in C++ but also in Rust when pre-compiled at build time. would that imply embedding the whole Rust toolchain in the build? or would i be able to deploy a binary/library compiled against the SGX SDK outside Avalon and call it as part of the workload (while still respecting the plug-in API of course)?
  - i've seen C++11 flags being manually specified all over the Cmakelists for the workloads. Is the framework restricted to C++11 for now?

thanks a lot for your help :)
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 21:27:06 GMT):<br/>
@jopasserat The idea is to support other languages for the worker, but that's not there yet.  Only C++ is supported now.
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 21:29:50 GMT):<br/>
Your C++ binary could call other languages, but that's not how it's designed to work. The worker executes inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), currently Intel SGX. Having the worker execute code outside the TEE defeats the purpose of Avalon.
</p>
<p><strong>jopasserat</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 21:49:57 GMT):<br/>
yes yes of course, i was interested in the ability to bring other elements as part of a single workload running within the same TEE

Dear Avalon enthusiasts, the Avalon Developer Forum meeting is cancelled for the next week only due to an unexpected conflict that will prevent a large portion of our regular attendees from joining this call.
We shall resume our Avalon Developer Forum calls from the next one, i.e. on July 28th, 2020.  

Thanks!

If I've been using docker build is there an analog of `make clean` ?
If not, can I just rm all the build directories?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 13 Jul 2020 14:43:07 GMT):<br/>
n/m `git clean` seemed to do more or less what I needed.

Hi, I am trying to run a basic hello-world tutorial of hyperledger avalon as explained here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC4mAXrwgoc but at the point where i run generic client here https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/pre-release-v0.5/examples/apps/generic_client#echo-workload-using-a-uri
 i am getting error 
"import config.config as pconfig
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'config.config'"
Any leads how to resolve that? Probably I am missing some obvious step.. but i am new to this so apologize if the question is too stupid. Would appreciate any help related to this :)

Dear Avalon enthusiasts, those who are interested in understanding Intel SGX EPID-based remote attestation, we present an abstract, easy-to-follow and compact description here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342833256_Towards_Formalization_of_Enhanced_Privacy_ID_EPID-based_Remote_Attestation_in_Intel_SGX  The background on formal methods is not necessary.  So you can safely skip the verification parts.
</p>
<p><strong>MuhammadUsamaSardar</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:52:30 GMT):<br/>
In addition to the great talk by Dan on DCAP in March, we are also finalizing the draft of Intel SGX DCAP-based remote attestation, that we hope would be helpful to understand DCAP flow further.

Hi, I am trying to understand Hyperledger Avalon. For now, I have been able to execute workloads from 'examples/apps/'. However, I have a few questions.
1. How are these workloads sent to the work order processing enclave? As I understand currently these workloads are compiled in dockerfile and added to the enclave while it is being initialized. The clients then send the workload id to be processed. Please verify if my understanding is correct?
2. Let's say I have to add a new workload in already running network, how would I do that?
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Thu, 06 Aug 2020 18:03:48 GMT):<br/>
1. The workloads are sent using JSON RPC (Direct model) or with the blockchain connector event handler (Proxy model)
2. You can write your own requester (client) to submit workloads or use the generic client under `./examples/apps/generic_client/` that comes with Avalon (the latter is good for rapid prototyping).
</p>
<p><strong>MuhammadUsamaSardar</strong> (Thu, 06 Aug 2020 18:10:40 GMT):<br/>
Will slides of today's session be shared? The insurance company example was interesting. Are the details documented somewhere for further understanding?

For anyone who missed the virtual Hyperledger meetup today featuring Eugene speaking about the Avalon project, the recording is at:

It is really encouraging to see that the recording already has over 200 views on YouTube.  It seems like there is interest in this content, so if anyone from the Avalon project would like to present at any other meetups in the future please let me know.
</p>
<p><strong>MujtabaIdrees</strong> (Thu, 06 Aug 2020 23:56:09 GMT):<br/>
Do we have any tutorials/documentation on how to write custom workload client? Or any leads on how to submit a custom workload using generic_client?
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 01:09:44 GMT):<br/>
No. It is simole though.  Look at and modify the generic client.

Thank you for your response, following your tutorial at https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/docs/workload-tutorial and its corresponding video, I now understand how a new workload can be added in Avalon. Now, I have the following questions:
1. All worker nodes (wpe) need to build workloads inside the enclave, before it is initialized. A worker can only process those workloads which have been added in its enclave before measurement. Please verify if my understanding is correct?
2. Can a worker node(wpe) have multiple enclaves running inside? If yes then how can I configure it?

Hello, Im trying to build Avalon with instructions from Github. And I faced a problem in the section "Docker-based Build and Execution". I run ./generic_client.py and got the error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'config'.

I did that with Intel SGX Simulator mode and running multiple worker pools together (avalon-shell is running).

I am testing trusted workers with graphene and I have a question regarding the verification and signing keys. Why are you using two different types of keys in this case? As I see the keys types being used are: 
1. Signing/Verification key type: ECDSA (SECP256k1 curve) 
2. Encryption key type: RSA 2048 bits
why can't we have let's say two RSA keypairs instead? Is there a significance of using these specific key types?

Dear Avalon enthusiast,

Topic for 5th Nov HL Avalon Dev forum session: Basics of and how to use the datacenter attestation primitives (DCAP) for Intel SGX TEEs with Avalon (Proxy Model).
Presenter: Mr. Ramakrishna from Intel. 

We had a similar session in March 2020, the recording of which can be found here: 
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/avalon/2020-03-24+DCAP+attestation

This shall be a follow-up/revision session.

Is there any convinient way to debug Avalon. For example, specifically WPE, it takes so long to rebuild container. Are there any tools/scripts already provided, or I need to build an empty container to debug by myself?
</p>
<p><strong>PlyTools</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 08:03:45 GMT):<br/>
I'm tring to build an empty environment contrainer, mount local avalon source code to the container, build avalon components standalonely in the container and debug it based on remote attachment of IDE to the container. This is the best way I know now.

Hi,
I have a question.

I'm trying to get Avalon to work on multiple VMs (VM1 and VM2) with Fabric blockchain network.
VM1 have fabric network (created by minifab) and avalon-pool (worker name is kme-worker-1).
VM2 have only avalon-pool (worker name is kme-workeer-2).
Next I want to run generic_client from VM1's avalone-shell with specified kme-worker-2.

I ran the following command on VM1.

```shell
cd $TCF_HOME
./scripts/start_fabric.sh -u -e
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker/compose/avalon-pool.yaml -f docker/compose/avalon-fabric.yaml up -d --build
scp -r $TCF_HOME <user_name>@<VM2_IP>:~/
```

I ran the following command on VM2.

```shell
cd $TCF_HOME
vi config/kme_config.toml
	# :%s/kme-worker-1/kme-worker-2/g
vi config/wpe_config.toml
	# :%s/kme-worker-1/kme-worker-2/g
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker/compose/avalon-pool.yaml -f docker/compose/avalon-fabric.yaml up -d --build
```

After that, I try ran `docker exec -it avalon-shell bash`.
Next, I try ran `examples/apps/generic_client/generic_client.py -b fabric --workload_id "echo-result" --in_data "Hello" -o --worker_id "kme-worker-2"` in VM1.

But I get following error messages...
	2020-11-06 09:46:25,863 - ERROR - Worker is not active
	2020-11-06 09:46:25,863 - ERROR - Unable to retrieve worker details
	


Am I following the right procedure?
And, Is the configuration I'm trying to build feasible?

Dear Avalon enthusiasts, We have recently concluded a project with the collaboration of T-Systems and TU-Dresden in which we have forked Hyperledger Avalon and enabled it to run with SCONE trusted compute workers. Please find the whitepaper and feel free to explore our git (https://github.com/T-Systems-MMS/hyperledger-avalon-scone).

@HarshaIntel what timezone should the Avalon call use? The current one (Pacific/Midway) is invalid.

Hi!! I'm new to Avalon. I'm building a Hyperledger Fabric based application. There I have few offchain applications running some machine learning algorithms. Can I use Avalon to orchestrate this application ? Is is yet possible to run worker programs in a form of a docker container without implementing the workers from the scratch ? Sorry for my dumb questions.
</p>
<p><strong>tharindupr</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:41:48 GMT):<br/>
For anyone interested I found this Avalon + Scone integration which provides a docker based worker implementation : https://github.com/T-Systems-MMS/hyperledger-avalon-scone

Great work. This is the exactly I was looking for. Thanks

The Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee recently created a Chat Task Force to look into what could be done to improve the experience of using the community's chat tool.  For reference, more about the Task Force is at: 
 https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TF/Hyperledger+Community+Chat+Taskforce

I wanted to get your input so that the Task Force has feedback from Hyperledger Avalon community as they make decisions about what, if anything, to change.

If you would like to have a discussion about this, please let me know and we can set up time to talk.  Or if you would prefer to write down your thoughts, that would work too -- you can see the questions the Task Force has at the page at: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TF/Community+Chat+Interview+Questions
