{"msg":"Hi team! i'm trying to better understand what can and cannot be done with the workloads at the moment. Two questions:\n  - the architecture overview document suggests workloads can be expressed not only in C++ but also in Rust when pre-compiled at build time. would that imply embedding the whole Rust toolchain in the build? or would i be able to deploy a binary/library compiled against the SGX SDK outside Avalon and call it as part of the workload (while still respecting the plug-in API of course)?\n  - i've seen C++11 flags being manually specified all over the Cmakelists for the workloads.
