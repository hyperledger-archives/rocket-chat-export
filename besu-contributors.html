@rjones after the migration of the code from PegaSys to HLF repos we have a 1.3 Release Candidate and then Release due soon after (RC 25/26 Sept, Release 2/3 Oct) Given these will be the first "releases" from the Besu code base are there any requirements we will need to meet (like Foundation approval) or do we execute the releases as we would have prior to the migration?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 01:00:43 GMT):<br/>
@bretthenderson I think there is an email thread with @grace.hartley and @dhuseby on that very topic

@bretthenderson Grace and I met earlier this week to discuss this
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:28:37 GMT):<br/>
I got the security team contact information
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:29:01 GMT):<br/>
and I sent her in the right direction on the CII badge stuff https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/programs/badge-program/
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:29:34 GMT):<br/>
and we are putting together a checklist of criteria for security audits so that we can send out RFPs to get bids from some auditors

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:30:12 GMT):<br/>
@bretthenderson that's pretty much it for now...we have a plan for migrating from your JIRA to our JIRA but that will happen *after* the release
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:30:48 GMT):<br/>
Should mention this here too:
We plan to migrate the PegaSysEng/pantheon repo to hyperledger/besu and do the tech.pegasys.pantheon to org.hyperledger.besu rename on 16 Sept AEST (UTC+10). There will be a code freeze from 1600 on 15 Sept AEST (UTC+10) until the migration is completed. We'll notify this channel when that is complete. Any work not on the master branch of the PegaSysEng/pantheon repo by the time of the code freeze will need to be manually migrated to the new namespace and applied to a fresh clone of the new hyperledger/besu repo.

We are starting our #HyperledgerBesu contributor calls next week with an APAC/AMER friendly time, 0100 UTC on 17 Sep (or 11am Brisbane Tues 17 Sep, 9pm SF Mon 16 Sep) - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/2019-09-17+Besu+Contributor+Call

Our next call will be an EMEA/AMER friendly time at 1500 UTC on Tues 1 Oct (or 5pm Paris/Berlin, 11am New York, no agenda yet).  Calls will be bi-weekly and will alternate APAC/EMEA friendliness.
</p>
<p><strong>bretthenderson</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:13:37 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Dave. Will work with you to sort out how we migrate our Jira tickets over as you say, after release.

hi - could we have the DCO discussion here in public please? @shemnon @rai 
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:48:52 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:49:40 GMT):<br/>
It is arguable if the CAB line matters for DCO compliance or not.
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:50:23 GMT):<br/>
Who can we reach out to about that?
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:50:32 GMT):<br/>
To check if it does or not
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:51:25 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby is this a discussion you're having with Dolan right now?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:51:42 GMT):<br/>
@rai in the past we've used multiple SoB lines.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:52:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to understand the objection, it wasn't clear from my first reading.  You want more than just the email corrected, but also have it changed to SOB.  That's fine.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:52:38 GMT):<br/>
For now, for today.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:52:54 GMT):<br/>
since I know that is A-OK and there is no objection from LF Legal to that.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:53:17 GMT):<br/>
There is a parallel conversation that I think @dhuseby is having with LF Legal about this.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:54:01 GMT):<br/>
The bug in todo project that I linked to is basically all of LF Legal and the big project management (CNCF, etc) saying this is an example of a problem
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:54:02 GMT):<br/>
Without the change to SOB part I was confused as to why it even mattered.  But if we require SOB by all claimed authors and skip the Co-Authored-by statement I think that will make it clear it was a multi-authored commit.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:54:19 GMT):<br/>
yes, it does.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:55:19 GMT):<br/>
I cannot wait until I have said the final word that I ever say about DCO compliance, but I fear my headstone will read `Signed-off-by: Ry Jones <ry@linux.com>`
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:56:01 GMT):<br/>
LMAO
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:56:02 GMT):<br/>
Your earlier point about the tool itself not checking is correct. However, the tools are a first line of defense. The people that may be checking someday are lawyers
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:57:23 GMT):<br/>
Ok, so two sign off lines for now, I'll let chris hare know
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:57:46 GMT):<br/>
OK. You, personally, can fix the commit message and be done with it on this PR
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:57:58 GMT):<br/>
here is another tool: https://gist.github.com/ryjones/07ac650dcc5e83c91e8308ec98bacda4 that I've used
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 19:00:53 GMT):<br/>
Ah, ok, I thought it had to be done by the person for enforcement reasons. But what about that error about the email? Does he need to provide a repliable email?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 19:01:19 GMT):<br/>
yes. I added the corrected thingy in a comment.
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 19:01:20 GMT):<br/>
I could sign off if I just use the current github email that's there
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 19:01:27 GMT):<br/>
ahh
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 19:01:30 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 19:01:33 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 19:02:12 GMT):<br/>
since that is the SoB line he's used on other commits in the Besu codebase
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 19:02:35 GMT):<br/>
Wait, so the sign off doesn't have to be by the authors? That's Adrian's email and we're talking about a commit by Chris Hare and I

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 19:25:38 GMT):<br/>
So is it safe to say that contributor-licence-agreements are not good enough for LF?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 20:41:51 GMT):<br/>
Why is `Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed` enabled on the repo?  This is a significant break to our workflow.  Consider that we require a clean Jenkins build for each PR on top of master that means whenever someone else's PR goes in and we have to merge from master that we need to get a new approval every time.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 20:43:17 GMT):<br/>
This is cause because `Require branches to be up to date before merging` is also selected, and we then have a status check afterwards.
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 20:45:40 GMT):<br/>
Additionally, PRs can be approved with understanding that the comments are uncontroversial and will be addressed. This is especially important when collaborating with folks on the other side of the world
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 20:55:24 GMT):<br/>
This may also go with approve with conditions, "Approved assuming the CRLF issue is fixed"
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 21:05:07 GMT):<br/>
I've unchecked `Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed`.
</p>
<p><strong>EdJoJob</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 22:36:44 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors?msg=CDARpfoLz5ZpGWuRB) this ultimately points at a bash script, which we have embedded (with modifications) into our CI pipelines.  So now we can have _at most_ 1 non-DCO commit on master
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 22:42:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes unfortunately there's no way with GitHub to check the DCO on a squash & merge commit before it hits master.  Hopefully we can get into the habit of keeping sign off lines but otherwise we may need to look at doing the squash on the branch and then a rebase merge.  We'll see how it goes.
</p>
<p><strong>EdJoJob</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 23:49:48 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 09:37:18 GMT):<br/>
The only thing in there is the apache license. Such a OSS thing. 🙂
Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 13:46:06 GMT):<br/>
@faraggi I usually initialize new repos with just the default license file, since it's a requirement for our projects.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 15:06:57 GMT):<br/>
@faraggi here is a counter example: https://github.com/hyperledger/hl-landscape where I'm waiting for a repo to come in from CNCF
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 16:09:32 GMT):<br/>
Oh, to be clear: I think its great to do so! :thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 16:37:17 GMT):<br/>
I shipped some Besu poker chips to Australia, so you'll all need to meet with @EdJoJob to get one
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 18:39:15 GMT):<br/>
Besu's codebase has a code of conduct - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md
Hyperledger Project has a code of conduct - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Hyperledger+Code+of+Conduct

Can these live side by side or do we need to update the CoC in besu or do we need to mention that both apply? @rjones 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 18:49:06 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon I'm not sure?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 18:49:06 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon I'm not sure - could you please send email to community-architects@hyperledger.org ?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 21:33:55 GMT):<br/>
I just committed the fork block numbers for Goerli and Ropsten.  Since the next release is supposed to be 1.3-RC perhaps we should consider a 1.2.4 release so the ropsten fork is off a client not labeled "RC"
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 21:49:21 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 21:53:14 GMT):<br/>
Good point. We can discuss this in the product meeting tomorrow. Basically we need to figure out if the 1.2.4 replaces the RC, is the RC or if we want a RC one week after 
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 21:56:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure we want to re-schedule the RC at such short notice, there are probably a few other pieces that need the extra week to be finished off for actual RC, but I dont see why not do a 1.2.4 this week and keep RC planned for next as normal
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 21:59:16 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking of an out of cycle release, just for the fork numbers.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 21:59:29 GMT):<br/>
Still do 1.3-RC as scheduled and 1.2.4 relatively "soon"
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 22:02:01 GMT):<br/>
That sounds reasonable! The only PRs we need are the fork block ones, right?
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 22:02:09 GMT):<br/>

The question is if we do a CD style "here it is" or do a fork off of 1.2.3.  There are a few more PRs (including the besu renaming) than just the fork block, but nothing worse than what was done 1.2.2->1.2.3 with the database stuff
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 23:13:52 GMT):<br/>
I do think we need to wait for Geth and Parity to +1 the testnet forks.

<p><strong>RobDawson</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 23:25:34 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to suggest we go ahead and do a 1.2.4 release this week.
</p>
<p><strong>RobDawson</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 23:26:33 GMT):<br/>
@EdJoJob and team I think are working to coordinate this happening.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 23:31:14 GMT):<br/>
I'm strongly in favour of sticking with our continuous delivery process and 1.2.4 comes off master as usual.  The only thing to check is that pruning is still off by default (which I think it is).
</p>
<p><strong>bretthenderson</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 00:24:57 GMT):<br/>
Current thinking is we do a 1.2.4 release Friday AM (Aust)/Thursday PM (US)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 03:58:07 GMT):<br/>
Seriously, lets hold off until Geth and Parity signal it is OK.  May a bit paranoid.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 03:58:11 GMT):<br/>
may not be
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 03:58:27 GMT):<br/>
There is an all core devs call this week.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 03:59:05 GMT):<br/>
So first thing monday AUS looks like a better target.
</p>
<p><strong>RobDawson</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 06:09:52 GMT):<br/>
sounds reasonable.  We should check in tomorrow?
</p>
<p><strong>RobDawson</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 06:10:54 GMT):<br/>
given the most pressing reason for the release was to get the hardfork numbers out, holding until the signals from geth and parity makes sense.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 08:49:23 GMT):<br/>
Would 1.2.4 include changes from https://pegasys1.atlassian.net/browse/PAN-3140 and https://pegasys1.atlassian.net/browse/PAN-3155 that are already in master?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 13:58:29 GMT):<br/>
So Hudson Jamison chimed in on the AllCoreDevs gitter last night and made the fork numbers official.  We can release as soon as the release notes are ready.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 14:58:36 GMT):<br/>
Also, Rinkeby set their fork block, for 13 Nov.  PR is out for review.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 15:54:16 GMT):<br/>
PR is merged.  The next stop is a mainnet block number.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 15:54:30 GMT):<br/>
And that won't be for at least 6 weeks.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 19:53:11 GMT):<br/>
Yes, as usual we'd take the release from current master.  And for the benefit of those new to besu, we follow trunk based development (https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com is a good explanation and I'd recommend the book `Continuous Delivery` by Humble and Farley as well).
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 21:28:54 GMT):<br/>
OK, so final schedule for the next few releases is as follows, using Australia/USA dates:

23/24 Sept: Besu 1.2.4
6/7 Oct: Besu 1.3

</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 12:51:48 GMT):<br/>
For clarity, after a lot of back and forth :sweat_smile:,  here are the dates for the next couple Besu releases for Australia/Americas:
1.2.4: 23/24 Sept
1.3: 3/4 Oct
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 00:17:53 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>iikirilov</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 16:13:41 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/62 makes all future PRs automatically request reviews from everyone specified in the CODEOWNDERS file. Is this intentional?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 17:18:39 GMT):<br/>
Yea,  I'm not liking that PR either.  Unless we are going to push down code owners to specific directories and make it a subset of the maintainers it looks like Github's CODEOWNERS is a net negative as it makes requrested reviewers hard to use and adds a whole lot of noise.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 17:19:58 GMT):<br/>
Furthermore, perhaps these repo wide change should be discussed in rocketchat first?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 18:48:46 GMT):<br/>
@iikirilov I don't have strong feelings about how code ownership is split up. If that PR isn't to your liking, that's fine.

Hi Besu contributors, I'm working on https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/36 and it's becoming bigger every day... so I think it will be hard to review if I provide this in one big PR. But merging this unfinished work would require CLI options to be disabled as we probably don't want to have user test it until it's more advanced. So I don't know how to handle this big long lasting thing. Any advice? Thanks.

Hello @all,  we are looking to move CI of Besu over to CircleCI over the next few weeks. In the interim we will use Jenkins & Circle simultaneously; of which only Jenkins will count towards builds being merge-able on PRs and the like.

You may see some oddities in the Circle build checks during this time - please disregard these for the moment.

If you have questions or concerns please feel free to reach out.

@NicolasMassart - I gave the docs maintainers team write access to the docs repo, I can remove write access for the larger Besu Contributors team whenever makes sense.  Should we wait for steven to accept?

@mbaxter should edjojob be removed? he isn't in the list
</p>
<p><strong>mbaxter</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:34:25 GMT):<br/>
probably - although he's on the list of admins so it makes no functional difference at this point
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:37:15 GMT):<br/>
the functional difference is someone can request a review from @besu-docs-maintainers and it goes to that list. I really don't care - he has the power to remove himself, as an admin
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:37:19 GMT):<br/>
and it's your project.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:37:20 GMT):<br/>
yes, I did not put admins in the maintainers list as they are already admins and have all access.
</p>

Uncle Block question: In Ethereum, what block number and block timestamp does an uncle block receive? Is it the values which reflect when it was originally mined, or when it was included as an uncle block?  To save asking related questions again, it would be great if you could supply a link to where in Besu does this processing.

Besu doesn't currently find Ommer blocks to include when mining.  However, ommer's are just headers of blocks that are not on the canonical chain. So the block number and everything else about the block are the same as when it was first mined.

Hi there, 

This bounty is reserved for EthWaterloo participants. The bounty is left open for participants to showcase their creativity :smile: Basically, anything that helps enterprises using Ethereum. Two ways we think about this are either using mainnet as a way to bridge various private networks (even if it's as simple as posting data from a private network to mainnet and retrieving it from another network) or to make things easier for enterprises using Besu on mainnet (think integrations, reliability, perfomance, etc.). 

Hopefully that helps! happy to answer any follow up questions.

Looks like you are using Java 13.  Gradle still doesn't support it.  If you use Java 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 things should work smoothly.

Thinking about what documentation is needed for the plugin API and at what point we consider plugin APIs stable enough to be considered as no longer changing/shoud be doc'd. My understanding is that we need two things: 
1. Some general information about how get started building a plugin 
2. There's JavaDoc in the code

Re 1.  Who's a good person to talk to about this? 
Re 2. Do we want to publish this outside the code?

The technical steering committee is chancing how they are calendaring meetings. (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TSC/2019+11+07+TSC+Agenda).  They need to hear from people on projects who may need access to scheduling meetings.  I think that would be me, Bret and Felipe?  Any others?  For those maintainers who want to schedule calendar items (like the recurring contributor call) we need to email David Huseby (email in the link) soon.

Hello Besu contributors!

Prompted by recent the experience of discovering a defect immediately following the Besu 1.3.3 release (resulting in the Besu 1.3.4 release), a question was asked that I figured we could do with converting from being tribal knowledge into a written down process (e.g. a HLF Besu Wiki page).

*When do we remove the Besu binary release artifact from Bintray?*

_(context: a bug being discovered in that version of Besu)_


As a release tag is created as part of the release process, in theory anyone could build a binary of the defected version, so removal of the binary from Bintray does not prevent that version from ever existing. Perhaps never removing the binary a sensible option?

Maybe when a catastrophic defect is found (data corruption, security breach, product break), then would warrant removing the binary?

Should we potentially also be deleting the release tag in addition to removing the binary? 

What are peoples thoughts on this matter?

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 06:50:22 GMT):<br/>
I'd say remove the binary if there's data corruption in common cases or significant security breach.  I wouldn't remove it for failing to start.  Repositories work best when things remain reliably availalbe so it's a big deal to remove something.  I wouldn't ever remove the release tag in source code - it's important to have a historical record.

putting the question another way: why keeping it? What's the use of a faulty release? What's the use of tagging a non working repos state?
ALso in my experience, users sometimes do upgrate going through all intermetidate versions and test at each step. So going from 1.3.2 to 1.3.4 passes by 1.3.3 which will block them. Why giving a stick to be beaten with?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Sat, 09 Nov 2019 01:38:28 GMT):<br/>
Because repositories work best when you can count on them to continue to have the artefacts and not have things mysteriously disappear.  Otherwise you wind up having to mirror the repo and maintain your own. Similarly the github repository is an important record of history, documenting what has happened. Rewriting that history to pretend the bad release just creates confusion about where it went or what was in the actual release.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 09 Nov 2019 19:04:13 GMT):<br/>
So that is something I need to flesh out I think.  For the 1.4 release I think it's time to start making some APIs fixed and open.  And we need a plugin "how to" for some plugin types.  But some are quite involved (Key Value Storage) so for now the tutorial would be for something simpler.

> What's the use of tagging a non working repos state?
A challenge with altering the git history comes from git being a distributed version control system, not a centralised version control system. As each client mirrors the repo, unless you have access to all client, then you cannot have full confidence of removing the buggy release tag.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 16:58:22 GMT):<br/>
No active plans.  Right now we don't have a stable extrenal API we are willing to stick to, so that would make external builds unstable.  Anything with 'internal' in the GAV is subject to sudden and unplanned changes.

<p><strong>GregTheGreek</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 14:38:48 GMT):<br/>
We have Parity (outright) and a fork of Geth (multi-geth) - so only if they support it upstream?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 15:46:42 GMT):<br/>
IIRC parity would have warpsync (which is currently broken on mainnet) and I'm not sure if multi-geth keeps up with warp-sync.  However they are also light client RLPx calls so if ETC has mainnet style light clients it would support it too.  I'll find out here shortly.

We have been using CircleCI and Jenkins for the last couple of weeks and that has been working well. We are at the next stage where we are going to turn on Circle build checks as we progress to using CircleCI only and will eventually discontinue the use of Jenkins.

So to close the loop on this.  It appears all clients have fast sync.  "getc" which I presume is Geth Classic, Parity, and Multigeth all advertise eth/63, which is the ethereum subprotocol that supports fast sync.

Kotti synced in about 12 minutes, almost all the time was spent downloading blocks over a residential internet connection.

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 21:33:35 GMT):<br/>
But to me, all broken links to specific articles or pages before Besu 1.2.1  should be simply pointing to https://besu.hyperledger.org/
Otherwise you will end up with anachronic disaster trying to make old links point to new content. SO just making them point to Besu doc site root is the simple way as people could still go back in the changelog commits history to see a previous version it they want to se the previous link.

Hello,
I have tried making a pull request about these documentation changes but im stuck with the DCO probot of github.
It is PR #203

Hi, looking at you PR, it seems that you work on your fork on the master branch but you did not clean your fork master after the first PR was merged, so you continue pushing commits from your master that contains DCO issues, and you can see that your PR commits list contains far more commits than just the links related ones.
What you should do is create a topic branch as indicated at step 2 of contribution workflow doc in https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-workflow
Then you only have the expected commits in the PR and when we merge the PR you can update your master and get rid of the topic branch.
I'm looking at the best way to fix this situation.
</p>
<p><strong>sweexordious</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:03:33 GMT):<br/>
Exactly yeah, i see commits that aren't mine. 
Following your steps, i recloned my repo, created a new topic called BESU-110, switched to it, pushed the results. So, i can see the new branch on my github repo, however when i create a PR from that branch, i still have that DCO problem. 
I think what i will do, save the changes i made, delete my fork, fork it again and then, create a new topic, make the changes, push them and then PR ? do you think this will work ?

Sorry for the late replies as i am in school and i dont have permanent access to my computer.

</p>
<p><strong>sweexordious</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:04:46 GMT):<br/>
The newest PR i have made from my newly created branch is PR #204 
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:57:14 GMT):<br/>
the issue is that you may have pushed faulty commits to your master branch on your fork. No need to delete your fork (it would break links with some previous PRs, I don't know if you have some, but still).
</p>
<p><strong>sweexordious</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 22:00:47 GMT):<br/>
I have one previous PR but i guess i can sacrifice that.. I guess ill just have to remake the changes again on a new fork.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 22:01:49 GMT):<br/>
Wha you could do,You can just rename you master, pull the fresh one from upstream, push it to your fork and go from there.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 22:02:11 GMT):<br/>
then remove the old renamed master
</p>
<p><strong>sweexordious</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 22:15:45 GMT):<br/>
I will look into that and let you know the results.

I am writing a JSON RPC API that returns a complex data structure (it is a map of BigIntegers to ints). Is there an existing JSON RPC API that I should follow that does something similar? Is this sort of thing a good idea? Would I be better off trying to return smaller parts of this? 
I was going to put in some sort of check to make sure the blob being returned wasn't too big.  Is there any other checks you suggest?

How does besu answer to websocket ping as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.2 ? Because I have an issue with web3j using websocket that really coincides with the connection lost detection (every 60s by default).
My guess, but I did not explore the code enough to tell, is that this ping is handled as a request and of course is not a valid one. Hence having these two logs:

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 11:45:12 GMT):<br/>
a very simple java code to test (given that you have imported web3j as a dependency, see http://docs.web3j.io/getting_started/#gradle) is:
```
import java.net.ConnectException;
import org.web3j.protocol.Web3j;
import org.web3j.protocol.websocket.WebSocketService;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    final WebSocketService wss = new WebSocketService("ws://localhost:7546", true);
    try {
      wss.connect();
    } catch (final ConnectException e) {
      System.out.println("ConnectException: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    Web3j.build(wss);
  }
}
```

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 11:46:10 GMT):<br/>
So if anyone could confirm the way Besu handles ping requests, tests were made with hyperledger/besu:1.3.4 docker image. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:02:35 GMT):<br/>
For what I read in Besu code, the websocket handler passes the buffer directly and tries to unserialize it as JSON, which fails in case of a ping frame. Also the debug log shows a line `DEBUG | WebSocketService | Received Websocket request  (host=172.17.0.1, port=49722)`, notice the double space where the buffer.toString() should be displayed after the word "request", which matches the idea that ping frame containing an opcode 0x9 which is not a printable caracter.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:04:38 GMT):<br/>
For the debug log, see https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/ethereum/api/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/ethereum/api/jsonrpc/websocket/WebSocketService.java#L119
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:29:49 GMT):<br/>
We let vertx handle our websocket requests.  My guess w/o looking at code is we are shunting all websocket work down the "this is a request" pipe and should be special casing pings and pongs.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:30:42 GMT):<br/>
Is that something we can do in Besu? Do you want me to create a Jira ticket?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:31:15 GMT):<br/>
Make a JI, I think we can handle it, jsut need to examine the vertx apis.  There are several vertx bugs related to it so I think it's totally doable.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:31:32 GMT):<br/>
Great thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:32:02 GMT):<br/>
I think we already have a JI howeber...
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:33:24 GMT):<br/>
It's in the pre-migration DB, we don't have a BESU- JI
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:34:51 GMT):<br/>
PAN-3279 - we still got people going to the old DB so this one will need to be migrated by hand.  PAN- is on the "to decommission" list.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:35:09 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I can create it based in the old DB then.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:36:17 GMT):<br/>
But more than just being about web3j only it's basically the websocket RFC that asks for handling ping/pong
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:36:38 GMT):<br/>
Yep, web3j correctly implements the RFC and is a good test example.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:37:01 GMT):<br/>
The bug is at the websockets level, web3j is the means to reproduce.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 20:39:12 GMT):<br/>
Just a quick thing. Vertx WS has got a specific handler for control frames (ping, pong, etc). It is the `websocket.frameHandler`.

I don't know why this isn't handled by Vertx automatically, but if we want to do it in Besu it should be easy.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 20:39:36 GMT):<br/>
I'll hand it off to you then.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 20:39:56 GMT):<br/>
From what I've seen we get the ping, start handling the poing, then get sent into our handler code when it should be skipped.

`org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.api.jsonrpc.internal.results.TransactionReceiptResult` is a return JSON object containing a nested object (another JSON object).

The idea with complex datastructures with jackson annotations are they become an daisy-chain of annotated classes, when encoding/decoding occurs then Jackson takes care of the rest
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 01:14:23 GMT):<br/>
`Map<BigInteger, Integer>` should be auto intrepreted by Jackson into a JSON object.

Hello,
I have been playing with the json-rpc methods and i noticed a field ID in every method call. it means what ? when i delete it i get no answer, and when i change its value to arbitrary values, i still get the results with that ID i send.

Example:
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.","method":"eth_mining","params":[], "id": "something"}' http://127.0.0.1:8545

I get the following response:
{
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "id" : "something",
  "result" : true
}
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 22:47:06 GMT):<br/>
See https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#notification
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 22:47:06 GMT):<br/>
The ID is needed in multiplexed situations.  Over WebSockets or if you pass in an array of RPCs instead of a single RPC.

FYI: You can get email notifications of Besu wiki changes by going to the wiki (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Hyperledger+Besu) and in the top right hand corner click on "Watching" and select "Watch all content in this space".  There's not a lot of activity so shouldn't overwhelm you but will make it a lot easier to follow proposals and discussions there.  You can just watch individual pages as well but I'd recommend at least trying watching the whole space first.

I am trying with the BESU-54 https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-54 . It's about checking number of parameters before calling the json-rpc method.
So far, i found where the code of each function is. Now im wondering, whether i will have to add to all of the methods code a parameters number check or there is a better way to do it ?
Thank you

CircleCI question - One of my PRs is failing with memory issues (integerationTEsts, exit 137) - Is it OK to change the CI to make integration tests an XL container?

@shemnon I have no issue with it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 03 Dec 2019 19:03:13 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon is that something I need to do, or is it something you can do in the codebase?

Ommer questions: 
- Who gets the transaction cost reward (gas etc) for the Ommer? The original miner, the new miner, or no one?
- If a Ommer is included in a block, and the Ommer includes a transaction that was valid, but is no longer valid (maybe there is a state update due to another transaction included in the heaviest chain ) is there any transaction cost?
- The block rewards related to Ommers gets smaller as the included Ommer gets older (that is Ommer reward for a block that shares a common Grand Parent gets more than for a Great-Great-Grand Parent). Are the transaction cost rewards similarly affected?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 05:28:24 GMT):<br/>
- The miner of the ommer (not the miner of the block with the ommer references
- Transactions in ommers don't matter.  They can be totally invalid.  Only the header matters, and only the ommer reward is processed.
- Transactions in ommers don't generate rewards.

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 07:32:35 GMT):<br/>
As Danno said no transaction fees are paid for ommers. The transaction fees charged when/if the ommer was imported as a non-canonical block have no effect on the canonical world state (because it's off on a non-canonical fork, not the canonical chain so it's exactly as if those transactions never happened).

The only thing ommers affect is the block reward payments: The original miner gets a bonus (of blockReward / 32) for each ommer they include and the ommer miner gets  a small payment (blockReward * (block.number - ommer.number) / 8) when the block is included as an ommer.

You may find https://www.symphonious.net/2019/11/01/exploring-ethereum-ommers-vs-non-canoncial-blocks/ and https://www.symphonious.net/2019/11/27/exploring-ethereum-what-happens-to-transactions-in-non-canonical-blocks/ useful.
</p>
<p><strong>drinkcoffee</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 10:36:42 GMT):<br/>
So, the Ommer reward is just for rewarding the other miner for doing work, but the submitter of the transactions will have the transactions put back into the transaction pool, because they will effectivey not have been mined.

@ajsutton , thanks for the very informative artcles. Very helpful!
</p>
<p><strong>drinkcoffee</strong> (Sat, 07 Dec 2019 02:18:54 GMT):<br/>
@ajsutton Looking at equation 163 of the yellow paper, it looks like the equation for Ommer reward is: (1  + 1/8 * (Ui - BHi)) * Rblock; which is: (1 + 1/8 * (Ommer Block Number - Canonical Block Number)* Block Reward. For example, looking at this block (https://etherscan.io/uncle/0x88a638f806782a6cd3d7e9960beb27aad607c7acaec34a96a8c3f8ee71cd7b27), the Uncle / Ommer block number was 9058659, the Canonical block number was 9058660, the block reward is 2 Ether, so the Ommer reward is: (1 + 1/8*(9058659 - 9058660)) * 2 = 1.75 Ether
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Sun, 08 Dec 2019 20:11:46 GMT):<br/>
Yes I misread the code, it should definitely be less than one blockReward. The code in besu is:
```
final long distance = header.getNumber() - ommerHeader.getNumber();
      final Wei ommerReward = blockReward.minus(blockReward.times(distance).dividedBy(8));
      ommerCoinbase.incrementBalance(ommerReward);
```

Added the process for updating the changlog and what should be included - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Changelog

This is a change in process for maintainers - the new process means updating the CHANGELOG.md file as part of development for PRs to be included in the changelog. Let me know if anything isn't clear and it would be great if reviewers could check this is being done while we get used to the new process. 
</p>
<p><strong>cjhare</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 23:43:38 GMT):<br/>
For clarity, must the update to the CHANGELOG.md be part of the contributors PR, or is a seperate PR acceptable?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 03:40:26 GMT):<br/>
It can be a separate PR and not all PRs need a changelog entry.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 13:21:27 GMT):<br/>
I know Fabric has a script to generate a list automagically which can be pruned.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 21:27:47 GMT):<br/>
We now have three upcoming or recent upgrades noted in our changelog (Istanbul, Muir Glacier and Agharta).  I'm wondering if we should just have a table showing forks and minimum releases at the top of the changelog.  Still only list the most recent upgrade and any upcoming ones but as a permanent part of the changelog format.
</p>
<p><strong>EdJoJob</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 21:45:39 GMT):<br/>
Putting myself in the shoes of someone running Besu on a public network, I would like this idea.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:19:11 GMT):<br/>
ooohh.... I like that alot.  There are two categories: mainnet and classic, and 7 networks for those categories (mainnet, ropsten, rinkeby, goerli, classic, mordor, and kotti)  But three different levels of support for each persistent network: unsupported, supported (code exists), and scheduled (code is turned on at a block number).  And then, the question of what is the order of the blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:19:46 GMT):<br/>
And on the wiki page perhaps a complete table?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 23:07:33 GMT):<br/>
I feel like you've thought about this more than I have already. :) I was just going to have
Istanbul | 1.x.x
Muir Glacier | 1.x.x
Agharta | 1.x.x

But no objections to having more information if it's useful.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 23:12:24 GMT):<br/>
But since testnet block numbers roll out later than the impls there is a slow trickle of updates.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 23:14:11 GMT):<br/>
True. It probably does make sense to have more info. I was just going based off of the notices we currently have in the changelog (but it's at a nice simple point where testnets and mainnet all have blocks assigned).

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 20 Dec 2019 18:10:04 GMT):<br/>
It's a general problem.  It's either deal with the occasional issue twice a year when we update reference tests or copy the whole test suite into the code base.  Neither is ideal.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Dec 2019 18:13:09 GMT):<br/>
maybe I can help there.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Dec 2019 18:13:34 GMT):<br/>
For Tuweni I had to move the test files I cared about into the repository. I was given a lot of trouble by some software the ASF uses to check content.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Dec 2019 18:14:01 GMT):<br/>
So what I can do is package the reference tests into a jar, and distribute it as part of Apache Tuweni.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Dec 2019 18:14:33 GMT):<br/>
Would that be useful? Obviously that means Apache Tuweni needs to keep up with reference tests, which is never ideal.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 20 Dec 2019 18:19:13 GMT):<br/>
My concern with that approach is we can't see the reference tests easily in the IDE.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Dec 2019 18:54:02 GMT):<br/>
to go back to the PR - it all made sense right?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Dec 2019 18:54:22 GMT):<br/>

Hello ! I published a PR but the pipeline remained blocked and does not launch the tests. Do you have any idea where this may come from? https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/294 
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 08 Jan 2020 13:35:45 GMT):<br/>
That's quite a big PR you've made there, @matkt !
I'm not sure why tests aren't running. @joshuafernandes @shemnon ? @abdelhamidbakhta

<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Wed, 08 Jan 2020 20:19:52 GMT):<br/>
Hi! I created a new PR to test and the new one does not launch the tests either. Could this not be linked to a permission problem. Will the circleci not only work with a PR created by a maintainer or something like that?

We are creating a proposal in the Capital Markets SIG (CMSIG) to workshop a simple Token using TTF (Token Taxonomy Framework) towards implementation in Besu. This is at the suggestion of Mani Pillai CEO of swapshub. It would be great to have some participation from the Besu community.
The TTF has active membership from Accenture, IBM and others who are prominent in Hyperledger.
The CMSIG  is the ideal venue for this, since we have a mix of members, both business and technical -we may be able to attract more since we are completely open. The actual effort can be housed in Hyperledger labs.

Would be good to know whether there are any comparable initiatives out there.
We can rapidly bootstrap a basic token definition and make plans for a BESU implementation.

Our meeting is tomorrow  (Jan 15) at 10 am EST (15 UTC) join us at https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community.backup  The agenda is here

Hello everyone,
 
I want start first by wishing you and the teams a happy new year. I hope you enjoyed your holidays and spent quality time with your families and loved ones. 
 
I am writing to ask for help about besu issues.. I tried my best to understand the code etc, but i still don't know how to contribute. The issues are still hard for me to work on. 
Also, i dont have a great coding background to start dealing with all the libraries used and understand how they interact with each other and be able to solve issues..
So, if there is a way to fast forward me, guidelines, books, technologies or anything that can help me find a path so that, one day, i can be able to contribute to the real coding issues and not just documentation PRs, i will be more than grateful.

 
Thank you so much for your time.
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 16:20:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi @sweexordious .
First of all, thanks for _wanting_ to contribute. We welcome all types of help with open arms!

A good place to start is in our 'Getting started Issues': https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-69?jql=project%20%3D%20BESU%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20labels%20in%20(good-first-issue%2C%20help-wanted)%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC

You can choose any issue from there and comment on it to signal you want to work on it. 
Feel free to ask here or in #besu for help understanding the issue or resolving it. (don't hesitate to tag me in the message as well)

</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 16:21:41 GMT):<br/>
You can also participate in the contributor calls in which (if we have time left) will go over contributor questions about specific issues.
</p>
<p><strong>sweexordious</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 17:58:35 GMT):<br/>
Thank you so much for your answer.
In fact, i tried couple of 'good first issue' and i made the PRs. However, i wanna go deeper if possible, and have better understanding of the code base..

Hi all - we're considering updating picocli in besu from 3.9.6 to 4.1.4.
By making this change we're intending on making use of ArgGroups to save us from writing a bunch of code.
It's reportedly a backwards compatible change so we're not expecting any technical issues in this change, but does anyone have a reason not to make this change?
</p>
<p><strong>usmansaleem</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 01:32:57 GMT):<br/>
There is cli validation code and dependent options checks which might become obsolete and/or require changes. Other than that, we should upgrade to get benefit of new features provided by picocli

The Fabric team has started using Mergify to help with merges - an example [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/573). The config file they're using is [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/.mergify.yml). If it's of interest, I can enable it on whatever repos you like.

<p><strong>GregTheGreek</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 19:44:00 GMT):<br/>
lol...
</p>
<p><strong>GregTheGreek</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 19:44:11 GMT):<br/>
we might need to cut a release manually on the chainsafe repo
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 19:51:35 GMT):<br/>
5 hours.  Then two weeks for hte RC
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 19:51:41 GMT):<br/>
It's beta 3
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 19:51:46 GMT):<br/>
two weeks is RC 2.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 19:52:06 GMT):<br/>
If you want to implement it over 1.3 we can cut a 1.3.9 where the ETC fork data is the only delta.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 19:54:16 GMT):<br/>
So I think the ting to do is to make a pr off of 1.3.8 (https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/commit/45178419ec4ede37f8ae2b3688d50a0a80b9300f) and then when you are ready we can make a 1.3 branch and merge it into there.  I believe we can do a release off of a branch but I'd have to ask the folks who do the release how hard that is.
</p>
<p><strong>GregTheGreek</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 20:03:31 GMT):<br/>
release is in 5 hours?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 20:06:09 GMT):<br/>
Beta 3.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 20:06:27 GMT):<br/>
I think getting the change into a 1.3.9 is a more prudent course.
</p>
<p><strong>GregTheGreek</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 20:06:38 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>GregTheGreek</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 20:06:47 GMT):<br/>
Well we can open the PR our changes are ready i believe
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 20:07:34 GMT):<br/>
a pr into beta 3 would be good too.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 20:07:40 GMT):<br/>
which is the current master
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 20:11:02 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, PR into master first and then backport to the branch is the usual approach (not that we do branches much).

I have some questions referencing the rollback of the latest PR that modified the ALL-CAPS.md files in the repo root:
(https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/321)

1. If we have a roadmap in the repo do we want duplicate content on the wiki? (same goes for other files in the list)
2. can those files exist, yet point to contents in the wiki?
3. ROADMAP.md isn't mentioned in these links: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TSC/Common+Repo+structure and https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TF/Repository+Structure+Task+Force
4. I'm still unsure of NOTICES file content.
5. I'm still unsure on what hard rules have been established and what is just still being discussed regarding the ALL-CAPS files.

I believe these lines here will always clash with our tests because of how truffle migration files are structured.

Hi all, we have been receiving some feedback over the past little while around ease of use of Jira vs Github for raising issues. The community response points to Github being a more familiar tool, as well as general access being already available, making it a lower barrier to entry to log issues, view progress of work, and engage with other contributors to the project. Based on this, we are considering switching the repository of Besu tickets from Jira to Github. Are there other considerations or other feedback that we should think about? This topic will also be tabled at the next few Besu contributor calls for discussion as well.
</p>
<p><strong>EdJoJob</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 02:15:10 GMT):<br/>
We are in the process of formalising the `plugin-api`s of Besu, as such we would like to publish the javadoc of the `plugin-api` jar.  The standard is to have this accessed through javadocs.io, which would require us publishing the Besu repository on bintray to JCenter.  Are there any objections to this action?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 17:32:14 GMT):<br/>
javadocs.io?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 17:33:14 GMT):<br/>
JCenter is fine. Maven Central is fine too. There is relatively no difference, except JCenter makes that sorta automated for you.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 19:12:07 GMT):<br/>
For the nat errors, the particular errors indicate to me the device advertising upnp services doesn't fully comply with the UPNP spec.  jUPNP is fairly strict in that regard.

I believe our current release schedule is 1.4-RC1 today and then the full 1.4 release at the end of the month.  There's some ongoing performance work that makes it more efficient to query logs over large numbers of blocks (https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/367 is part of that, I believe there's more to come). Unfortunately that's not going to make today's RC1.

For ETH2 clients like Teku that optimisation is pretty essential because it allows us to query the whole chain to find validator deposits. We're getting really close to encouraging ETH2 enthusiasts to try our Teku and currently it's hard to setup besu in a way that will work - those performance improvements will fix that.

So, would it be reasonable to backport those optimisations to the 1.4 RC breanch and release an RC2 next week? Then Teku can just recommend people use Besu 1.4-RC2 which will hopefully also increase the amount testing it gets.

I don't have any device advertising UPNP, that's the thing ;)
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 10:14:54 GMT):<br/>
Oups, ran NMAP to be sure, my box is advertising upnp service, even if the checkbox is unchecked in the UI... :weary: 
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 10:15:41 GMT):<br/>
So I guess it's the device that doesn't comply to upnp. But this is probably not the cause of the shutdown instabilities.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 13:51:13 GMT):<br/>
Yea, post a bug for the first thread.  Looks like we need to stop mining and wait for it to stop before shutting down the DB. I had mentioned it in a review but it was waived off.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 13:51:43 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 16:21:20 GMT):<br/>
Each new external contributor we have on the doc repos fail to handle the DCO. I don't think any doc update or adding a banner about the DCO will change anything as it's obviously an issue with users not reading the guidelines first. Is there any way to prevent them to commit without the DCO in first place?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 16:27:40 GMT):<br/>
No, I don't think github allows hooks on PR publishing that would prevetnt a PR from being opened.  Once the PR is opened all normal build checks come in and that's where the DCO checks are being applied.
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 16:30:08 GMT):<br/>
What about a bot that comments on their PR with the error and instructions on how to fix it?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 19:52:43 GMT):<br/>
The thing is that 100% of the contributors we had on the doc who had a DCO issue simply abandoned. So having a bot or myself telling them what to do to fix is useless. They are just lost.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:10:31 GMT):<br/>
The bad news is our hands are tied.  The DCO mandate comes from the Linux Foundation.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:11:48 GMT):<br/>
The wiki does not have a DCO requirement.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:33:44 GMT):<br/>
The doc is a repo, not a wiki. But I did not say to get rid of the DCO but find a way to make sure that contributors don't discover it only when CI runs on the PR.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:36:39 GMT):<br/>
You could add a .git hook in your repo, right? an on-commit hook to force a `-s` or check the commit for a valid signature?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:37:02 GMT):<br/>
Isn't the commit hook local only?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:37:31 GMT):<br/>
sure, as part of your "byfn" readme you could say "add this"
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:38:17 GMT):<br/>
for gerrit, it was something like ```$ scp -p -P 29418 <your username>@<your Gerrit review server>:hooks/commit-msg <local path to your git>/.git/hooks/

$ curl -Lo <local path to your git>/.git/hooks/commit-msg <your Gerrit http URL>/tools/hooks/commit-msg```
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:39:03 GMT):<br/>
perhaps part of your build process is to check for valid git.username and git.email and a valid commit on HEAD?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:39:08 GMT):<br/>
At the scp line you already lost all our contributors. Well I think that the issue is they just don;t read the readme or any doc, otherwise the would know about the DCO. They are too used to the standard Github contribution scheme.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:39:30 GMT):<br/>
gotcha.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:52:47 GMT):<br/>
One issue we have also is that most contributors are using Github desktop our Github website directly to provide the changes, and they don't enable sign-off. So they would have to add it manually to the commit message.
One thing I wonder is, could we fix the DCO directly from the CI job? If no DCO added, use the Github user name and github no-reply email address which is username@users.noreply.github.com for the DCO?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 21:05:12 GMT):<br/>
that isn't a valid DCO AFAIK
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 21:07:28 GMT):<br/>
Yes after writing this I told myself that the point of the DCO was to be added by the user, sorry. I'm trying to think in every direction to find something... tired to lose contributors because of something people say it will "minimize the barriers for contribution". In our case it's a blocker.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 21:21:20 GMT):<br/>
The only thing contributors are forced to do is forking the repos first. Mayne we could use the fork event ( https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#forkevent ) to trigger something.
The only action I see as something we could trigger is the creation of an issue in the new fork telling the user to be careful of the DCO, read guidelines and add thanks for contributing.

@EdJoJob when I go here: https://bintray.com/beta/#/hyperledger-org/besu-repo?tab=packages I see an error which says there are unpublished files that will be deleted. Perhaps related?

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 21:25:23 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>EdJoJob</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 21:25:24 GMT):<br/>

+1 for it to be a plugin
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:26:30 GMT):<br/>
I was hpoing more contributors than Nicolas would have chimed in.  In my mind the line is "would anyting other than an ethereum client ever use it."  Bytes and units - yes others would use it.  Crypo?  Yep, definately used by others.  But ethstats is something that only clients would ever use to report.  So when weighing wether to add more jars to the dependencies that's when I ask "Should it be an external dependendcy or not"

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:26:50 GMT):<br/>
That is for jars for the core client, which are mandatory for everyone running besu.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:28:05 GMT):<br/>
Enter the plugin system.  Plugins are not mandatory and end users can strip them out, or not install them in the first place.  And for this feature it may work well as a plugin becuase not all enterprises may want to post to ethstats.net.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:28:19 GMT):<br/>
Especially for their internal chains.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 17:46:44 GMT):<br/>
Well other clients such as rskj could use it. I also am building light clients with Tuweni that would use it.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 17:52:34 GMT):<br/>
what all is in that jar?  Can it be done without logl?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 17:52:56 GMT):<br/>
Other softeware actually usingit supports the library case.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 17:53:14 GMT):<br/>
But I also feel the plugin route would be a good alternative too.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 17:54:57 GMT):<br/>
Does rootstock use ethstats?  Or is it just the same protocol?  Calling it ethstats and using it in rootstock seems like it needs a more generic name.

New Maintainer candidate: Antoine Toulme - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/422
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 20:14:31 GMT):<br/>
the naming discussion can happen in Apache Tuweni I guess.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 20:15:26 GMT):<br/>
logl is just a functional proxy to not tie ethstats to a particular logging impl. If it bothers you, we can also use lambdas to log. I think ethstats (right now) only logs very seldomly.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 20:16:12 GMT):<br/>
If I had to pick another stack than logl, I'd go with slf4j. Opinions in slf4j go the other way, but it's also a good proxy into any logging lib.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 20:29:35 GMT):<br/>
Right now the only logging library in any Besu code is Log4j2, for better or worse.  Any change to that is an issue that IMHO should be addressed in isolation not in context of any specific contribution.  Because java logging is complex it has long term impacts.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 20:30:27 GMT):<br/>
Another alternative is to use logl internally and provide only the jars for logl->log4j interop.  We do this in several places where the log4j2 api jars are what we compile to and we look for the log4j2 impls underneath.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 20:31:14 GMT):<br/>
But if we re-examine logging one I think we should seriously consider is Google' fluent logger.  It would solve a lot of problems we have accidentally passing in a throwable as a formatting argument.  And provide richer configuraiton such as "log no more than once per minute"

</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 20:34:37 GMT):<br/>
understood.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 21:01:55 GMT):<br/>
Besu does have dependencies already using slf4j so that would be a preference for me over also introducing logl.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 21:07:04 GMT):<br/>
I've had this thread open for a few days still pondering exactly where I sit on the question of what goes into besu vs Tuweni. I think it would be weird for example to have built an EVM in Tuweni and use that in Besu - just feels too core.  That's exacerbated by the different foundations and governance involved as well.

It's not clear to me where ethstats sits on the "build vs buy" kind of spectrum. It's probably ok to "buy" but not completely clear cut for me.

I really like the idea of building EthStats as a plugin and it was my first thought when I saw the PR as well.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 16:00:29 GMT):<br/>
I am of the opinion that we should wait for inactivity before we remove steve as a maintainer.  The "vote a maintainer out" clause was intended to deal with misconduct, not change in employment.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 16:01:11 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 06 Mar 2020 06:35:40 GMT):<br/>
Something to do with shanghai state pool clearing and the way parity did precompiles.  For some reason they required some value or Parity deleted the precomple.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 06 Mar 2020 07:03:38 GMT):<br/>
Yeah not sure there is an EIP for that one. As Danno said it boiled down to a buggy implementation but either it was in both Parity and Geth or there was some other reason that the buggy chain wound up being considered canonical so now every client reproduces the bug for those key addresses in that particular hard fork.

Besu 1.4.1 is going out tomorrow and there are a few PRs for which there is no changelog update:
* https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/434 (cc: @mackcom) 
* https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/436 (cc: @anthonybuckle)

If you'd like the change documented in the release notes, please add a line to CHANGELOG.md by tomorrow afternoon EST. Thanks :smiley: 
</p>
<p><strong>mackcom</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:08:43 GMT):<br/>
@timbeiko What do you need for the change log, and how do I add it?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:18:08 GMT):<br/>
@mackcom something like this - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/461
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:19:12 GMT):<br/>
In the future it's easiest to do it as part of the PR.  I myself am bad about it but it would be good if we all got in the habit of either (a) updating the changelog in the PR (b) saying that the PR is not changelog worthy or (c) pointing to another PR where the changelog entries are already taking care of what changed.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:20:10 GMT):<br/>
So I proposed last week we do the next contributor call on EMEA/AMER time.  Was there any objection to or support of this proposal from any of the contributors?
</p>
<p><strong>mackcom</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 17:33:01 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I've put in PR#462 with the changelog update. thanks.

Hey, folks. For first time contributors with DCO struggles, there is a way for you to fix it (usually). I was able to fix [this PR for cello](https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/pull/117) using the instructions in the error.

Next Tuesday is the next Besu contributor call, on EMEA/AMER friendly times. - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/2020-03-17+Contributor+Call

If you are in the USA check the times as the call is fixed against UTC, so the call may be an hour later.

</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Mar 2020 18:54:32 GMT):<br/>
It might need debugging/acceptance testing as this type of things tend to fall apart at the edge.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Mar 2020 18:54:40 GMT):<br/>
It's ready for review.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Mar 2020 19:25:46 GMT):<br/>
Nice.  Have you given it a spin on mainnet? I understand 1/3 of geth nodes are already talking eth/65.  IIRC transactions are still passed around even while syncing so we don't need a fully syned node to see it work.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 28 Mar 2020 06:38:21 GMT):<br/>
No, not yet. I am building an acceptance test first.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 28 Mar 2020 07:07:04 GMT):<br/>
alright, here is the important bit. An acceptance test you can see here: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/608/commits/defbed1d0abf2bf326b68178cac3aba53a2832a9
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 28 Mar 2020 07:07:17 GMT):<br/>
```  @Test
  public void shouldGossipATransaction() {
    final Account account = accounts.createAccount("account-one");
    final Amount balance = Amount.ether(20);

    TransferTransaction tx = accountTransactions.createTransfer(account, balance);

    Hash txHash = archiveNode1.execute(tx);

    cluster.verify(txPoolConditions.inTransactionPool(txHash));
  }```
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 28 Mar 2020 07:07:43 GMT):<br/>
this is between 2 archive nodes, so neither can mint blocks. One receives a transaction, and it is gossiped to the other node.

Hello everyone, I am Shivam interested in contributing to Besu. Having said that, I picked up the issue https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/490 to get a better understanding of the codebase, and I am  stuck  on the issue because I can't figure out  how to get a node by its id, and how to submit the hash rate once this node is obtained. 
</p>
<p><strong>sbs2001</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 12:32:47 GMT):<br/>
Please provide some pointers on how to achieve that.

<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 10:14:39 GMT):<br/>
Hi @sbs2001 ! welcome to the Besu rocketchat. 
Have you taken a look at our wiki, which goes over how to contribute to the project?
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Contributing
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/How+to+Contribute

Once you've done that, feel free to let us know which issu you'd prefer to work on so we can assign it to you.

</p>
<p><strong>sbs2001</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 10:16:43 GMT):<br/>
I have gone through the guide :)
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 10:17:55 GMT):<br/>
Awesome. Have you an idea of where you'd like to contribute?

</p>
<p><strong>sbs2001</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 10:22:57 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/490 (labelled as good first issue) is the specific issue I wanted to work on , APIs are something I have worked on past so I thought contributing to json-rpc client would be good starting point.
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 11:16:17 GMT):<br/>
Concerning Issue#490, After looking at these docs, I believe you shouldn't get the miner's Id, but rather submit a random ID string. 

https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1474.md#eth_submithashrate
https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_submithashrate 


https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/a91b704b013aaabb3bfc796f5a3d8c940dfb7f05/consensus/ethash/api.go#L86
```
// SubmitHashrate can be used for remote miners to submit their hash rate.
// This enables the node to report the combined hash rate of all miners
// which submit work through this node.
//
// It accepts the miner hash rate and an identifier which must be unique
// between nodes.

I got email from Circle CI that soon they will start expiring artifacts - does Besu rely on older artifacts stored on CCI infra?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 18:39:10 GMT):<br/>
```The two changes you can expect to see are: 

Build artifacts redirects: we are making non-HTML build artifacts on CircleCI redirect to short-lived pre-signed cloud storage URLs to improve the performance of our artifacts hosting. You should not notice any changes and no action is required.
Build artifacts storage policy: beginning on April 30th, we will start automatically deleting build artifacts that are older than 30 days for paid & free accounts. To download your older build artifacts before then, follow these instructions.
Note that this policy change will not impact other CircleCI output data such as caches, workspaces, and logs.```

I'm not sure if this is a calendar mistake on my part, but I have an invite for both the APAC/AMER and EMEA/AMER contributor call next week. Which one is happening? Both?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 11 Apr 2020 16:53:50 GMT):<br/>
AMER.  We did another shift with HLGF/EthCC.  Perhaps we should discuss skips ont he next call, do we shift the schedule or just miss a month for one geography?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 11 Apr 2020 16:54:01 GMT):<br/>
In the event we have to cancel meetings.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Sun, 12 Apr 2020 04:14:53 GMT):<br/>
Just missing a month and keeping the schedule consistent would be my vote.  My calendar has wound up confused as well.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Sun, 12 Apr 2020 22:27:12 GMT):<br/>
We seem to have some intermittency in unit tests around EIP1559. https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hyperledger/besu/2555/workflows/e7df6869-7e8b-4b92-ab78-0ae0cd8b552b/jobs/12502/

@abdelabdelhamidbakhta any chance there’s a static variable controlling 1559 somewhere that tests are toggling and interfering with each other?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Sun, 12 Apr 2020 22:55:54 GMT):<br/>
Yep, at least TransactionEIP1559Test is setting ExperimentalEIPs.eip1559Enabled and not restoring the original value afterwards.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Sun, 12 Apr 2020 23:14:01 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/700 should fix it.  If someone could review that and merge it should get our master branch build passing again.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 01:24:58 GMT):<br/>
approved and merged

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 01:32:24 GMT):<br/>

That being said, the APAC/EMEA toggle won't happen again.  If we cancel then it's a month off for whoever gets impacted.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 14 Apr 2020 16:05:34 GMT):<br/>
Oh, it was not because of the cancelation, it's just that I did not add it to my own calendar. The full HLF one is a bit huge for my needs to be honest and as events don't seems to be visible as recurring meetings, it means I would have to add each one individually so there's as many chances that I miss them...  But I guess this is the best we could have and that I may have to organise better on my side...

Hey all, 

While I assume most people are aware of this, it hasn't ever been announced here that we have the `Help Wanted` label on Github for issues we believe would be well suited for the community to take on, you can see the full list of issues here: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22

There is also a `Good First Issues` label which, as the name indicates, highlights which of these `Help Wanted` issues may be best for people with less experience on the codebase. If you have any questions about a specific one, feel free to comment here or on the issue :smile:

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:07:37 GMT):<br/>
that said the tidbit on compatibility is not as dire as it looks - it's just new nodes constantly throw exceptions when they communicate with older nodes. It's enough of a deterrent to call this incompatible.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:09:06 GMT):<br/>
On that note, this calls for an acceptance test that mimicks the mainnet. Say 100 tx per second, 3 besu nodes, and 100 peers connections and disconnections every minute or so might stress the system just like mainnet does.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:15:28 GMT):<br/>
PicoCLI has the notion of `fallbackValue` https://picocli.info/#fallbackValue-annotation which we are not using in Besu. If an option is specified without a value on the command line (ie arity 0..1), it is assigned the `fallbackValue`.  It's different to `defaultValue` (which is assigned if the option is not specified at all on the command line). Without using the ~fallbackValue~, there is some unexpected behaviour eg boolean attributes will be toggled if specified more than once on the command line. In Besu we currently get around this by custom code that throws a ParameterException if an option is specified more than once on the command line and/or in config files.
I propose
* adding `fallbackValue` to any CLI options that have arity of 0..1
* any boolean options that currently have arity of 1 can be changed to arity of 0..1 with a `fallbackValue`
The custom code that prevents options being specified multiple times could be removed, but this requires discussion since it is changing existing behaviour.

</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 27 Apr 2020 05:44:29 GMT):<br/>
Apologies, it is not Besu code that does this. PicoCLI prevents the options being specified more than once on the command line. However, it is possible to specify an option on the command line and in the config file which is where confusion can arise.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 27 Apr 2020 15:32:02 GMT):<br/>
Maybe a fix would be in order for the toml parser to do something like prevent boolean double flips, throw an error if an option is both on the CLI and in the config file, or at least a warning.  

Fixing it in the toml defaults would fix it for future booleans whereas going to fallback only fixes it for curent booleans and we may make the same mistake in the future.

If I run `besu --config-file=config.toml --rpc-http-enabled` 
where config.toml has `rpc-http-enabled=true`
besu starts with rpc disabled
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 27 Apr 2020 21:53:56 GMT):<br/>
Yesh... this is a PicoCLI usability surprise.  We get the double flip because we do TOML as though they were defaults.  But this also impacts us if we ever want boolean flags to default to true.  We dodged this with Jake's CLI standards where all boolean flags are -enable only.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 27 Apr 2020 21:54:46 GMT):<br/>
Separate design issue: if there is a CLI flag and a config file value, do we want to allow it to happen with CLI winning?  Should we throw an error or log a warning if a flag is specified in both places?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 27 Apr 2020 21:55:37 GMT):<br/>
We also probably want an error-prone check to deal with the boolean flag surprises.  We can't be sure the next engineer writing this will know those issues.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 27 Apr 2020 22:26:23 GMT):<br/>
The priority is CLI arg, then system env var and then config file.  So it can be useful to have a config file that sets `p2p-enabled=false` and then be able to override that with `--p2p-enabled` on the CLI.

Currently you can't do that and have to add the boolean explicitly (`--p2p-enabled=true`).

📣 We just released a new version of Besu, 1.4.4 📣

1.4.4 includes logs and filters for private contracts, EIP-2315, Splunk logging integration, and optional native library encryption.

We've disabled eth/65 support by default and performed additional testing on 1.4.4 to ensure the issues with 1.4.3 are no longer occurring.

Changes and known issues are listed in the Changelong - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

One thing to watch out for is what does this do to our auto-help text.  Will it add =<foo> to each boolean enabled?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 28 Apr 2020 22:12:09 GMT):<br/>
Interestingly besu is currently inconsistent (`--p2p-enabled=<p2pEnabled>` but just  `--rpc-http-enabled`).
With arity 0..1 it would come out as `--p2p-discovery-enabled[=<BOOLEAN>]`
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 28 Apr 2020 23:31:17 GMT):<br/>
just checked. `fallbackValue` does not appear in the generated help text
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 28 Apr 2020 23:31:17 GMT):<br/>
ah ok but changing the arity does affect it
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 28 Apr 2020 23:31:17 GMT):<br/>
ah ok changing the arity does affect it
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 00:47:52 GMT):<br/>
so if we add fallbackValue=true for all "enabled" booleans (so that they read semantically) and this adds `[=<BOOLEAN>]` to the help for those options - is that ok? And then we can have `p2p-enabled=false` in the config which can be overridden on the command line with `--p2p-enabled`

<p><strong>PaulHarris</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 02:18:01 GMT):<br/>
to me having the fallback value and arity 0..1 makes sense, then the enabled flags always fall back to true if just the flag is specified. hopefully the help generated isn't too bad, doesn't seem major.

Hi all. Besu 1.4.5 is scheduled for release in less than 48hrs from now. If you have anything in flight it would be good to get it in otherwise it will be another 2 weeks for next release.

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 19:58:31 GMT):<br/>
I am following the chat around discovery ; FWIW I implemented DNS-based discovery in Apache Tuweni. After its next release, I'd like to propose to add dns discovery to Besu using that module.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 21:10:08 GMT):<br/>
Are there hedges against DNS spoofing?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 21:10:15 GMT):<br/>
i.e. DNSSec support?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 22:06:09 GMT):<br/>
dnsjava support DNSSec, so I can code to piggyback on that.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 22:08:08 GMT):<br/>
can also use DoH - DNS over HTTP
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 22:21:09 GMT):<br/>
bring in the wishlist @shemnon 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 22:29:09 GMT):<br/>
Do any other ethereum clients do DNS discovery?  i.e. do we have to interop with other clients or is this something we would be starting on our own?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 22:59:30 GMT):<br/>
geth does, yes

Hi all. I've found an edge case that the FlatTraceGenerator doesn't handle. I want to put together a test case to demonstrate it before raising the issue. I'm trying to figure out how the test blocks are generated for the tests so I can add an extra one to the test data export. Can someone point me in the right direction?

<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 22:17:45 GMT):<br/>
Hi all. As we are still in the process of testing release 1.4.5-RC1, and the next release being due next week, I propose we cancel the actual 1.4.5 release, and move to 1.4.6 in the next release window which is in ~1 week. Any thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 22:21:05 GMT):<br/>
I agree with scrapping this release, but since we haven't actually build a 1.4.5 I feel like the next release would still be 1.4.5 - just starting from a newer commit from master (and -RC2).  Although, I don't think it really matters if we skip a version number.
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 22:27:19 GMT):<br/>
Yeah what I'm unsure about is having an RC2 that is off of master, and not off of the RC1 branch, seems a bit at odds. If we going back to master I'd be tempted to skip the version to show the distinction
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 23:14:01 GMT):<br/>
I think going RC 2 off of master is fine.  I don't think RC2 always implies it is just deltas from RC1.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 23:14:33 GMT):<br/>
Plus then we will get questions from the field about "Where's 1.4.5?  I need it for my collection"
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 23:19:06 GMT):<br/>
my experience in this area is that the dev team will argue about release numbering far far more than users will care about it
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 23:20:03 GMT):<br/>
and in this case since we're not breaking semver (does besu follow semver, anyway?) it seems really moot
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 23:55:46 GMT):<br/>
@benjamincburns all of our projects must follow semver. there was a regression in Fabric where there was a breaking change across a minor version, but AFAIK that's the only time that's happened
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 02:53:04 GMT):<br/>
Hey folks, I noticed that when we send a tx with the wrong chainId, Besu returns a generic "Invalid Params" (not super helpful). Is there a reason why we don't map the WRONG_CHAIN_ID tx validation result to a specific RPC error? Or did we simply forget to map this error? I'll push a fix for it but wanted to check if we have a specific reason for not doing this.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 05:10:35 GMT):<br/>
We're possibly swallowing the reason somewhere and throwing a generic failure.  Because it's a signing error we may need to add some way to tease that detail out.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 05:10:42 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 19:11:34 GMT):<br/>
there is an option in circleci to enable building forks - I just disabled that - should fix the problem (and stop us from spending money outside hyperledger)
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 19:12:56 GMT):<br/>
let's see if that works. If not, I'll have a look at bringing back the regex in a way that it won't mask out our builds
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 19:13:53 GMT):<br/>
we've set up additional build monitoring to alert the ConsenSys slack on failures to Besu and Orion, so we'll be able to check against that to be sure that things are still coming through  
</p>
<p><strong>EdJoJob</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 22:51:24 GMT):<br/>
building forks is required to allow PR's to be built.  Without that setting it is impossible for us to evaluate a pull-request which we require to be off a fork, considering the permissions in GitHub
</p>
<p><strong>EdJoJob</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 22:54:35 GMT):<br/>
(or at least that was the case when last I looked)
</p>
<p><strong>EdJoJob</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 22:55:14 GMT):<br/>
also this particular build was not being built under the Hyperledger CircleCI account, which is part of the reason it failed

Done (undone)
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 00:31:44 GMT):<br/>
In the process of testing 1.4.5-RC2, we're still experiencing issues with significant test flakiness (assuming everyone has noticed the alerts at this point) so are not planning to go ahead with the release for tomorrow.  Alongside this we're also using the new proposed release process where we fastsync from scratch and monitor performance.   

Once @shemnon's PR above is reviewed and merged, our proposed next steps are: 
1. @joshuafernandes restarts our fastsync nodes with 1.4.5.-RC3 
2. Rai rerun AT scripts to see if the flakiness has decreased 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 00:32:21 GMT):<br/>
Based on the outcome of those, release next week. 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 00:48:09 GMT):<br/>
@joshuafernandes - per the proposed release process we should probably also upgrade our already synced production nodes to 1.4.5-RC3 once we have it

Re: vertx version downgrade.  Some more focused internal testing shows that this may not be the main issue.  3.5.4 had 3/13 flakey tests, and 3.5.0 had 2/14.  Given that there are known security advisories for 3.5.0 I vote we hold off on the downgrade and investigate further.

also we should probably investigate moving over to a more supported config for alerting webhooks. The `notify: webhooks: ...` that we're using now was actually an experimental feature in the CircleCI 1.0 config and it's no longer included in the v2.1 config that we're using now.

Do we cherry pick the revert into what is RC1 or do we do a full scrub and re-build next wendsday?  I'm up for either, just want to know what the rest of the maintainers would prefer.

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:52:59 GMT):<br/>
Which PR introduced the bug this PR fixes?  How come our nightly boxes didn't show this issue?  Was it only going to show when finding new peers rather than retaining existing peers? 
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:53:48 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, it's a finding new peers issue. It was @shemnon 's change to devp2p packet expirations
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:54:15 GMT):<br/>
We actually found an existing bug though so it's actually good news!
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:54:20 GMT):<br/>
There were _two_ bugs.  Eth/64 and the devp2p packet expiration.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:54:25 GMT):<br/>
the expiration fix is inbound.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:54:27 GMT):<br/>
So if we cleared the peer table on our nightly upgrades then we could have found it sooner? 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:54:35 GMT):<br/>
@rai - absolutely!
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:55:04 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I think we would've seen it in that case.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:55:34 GMT):<br/>
Is there an easy way to get a running node to drop all of it's peers? 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:55:36 GMT):<br/>
For the eth/64 bug only geth and openethereum would reject us, and current versions only.  Nethermind and older clients connected just fine.  So Goerli has older clients that are compatible as do all the other netwokrs
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:56:17 GMT):<br/>
Only Mordor was the stopper, because only newer clients have the network details as defaults.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:57:08 GMT):<br/>
Dropping all the peers won't help.  Older clients will find you and try and connect to you.  Some have _long_ memories about who they've seen.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:57:09 GMT):<br/>
My vote is for a full scrub and rebuild next Wednesday. 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:58:07 GMT):<br/>
So it's really starting a new node from scratch we need to do more often if we're going to catch these types of bugs sooner? 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:58:26 GMT):<br/>
basiclly, yes.
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:58:43 GMT):<br/>
What about an admin rpc that will clear the peer table?
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:58:43 GMT):<br/>
What about an admin rpc that will flush the peer table?
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 20:58:55 GMT):<br/>
But that's a drag on the network if we're starting new fastsync nodes all the time isn't it? 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 21:00:34 GMT):<br/>
An rpc that clears the peer table is probably easier in the long run than starting new nodes all the time isn't it if what we're trying to test for is 'can peer on mainnet' rather than 'can fastsync' 
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 21:01:44 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, it would definitely be a more targeted way to poke the bear
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 21:27:09 GMT):<br/>
If we do full scrub and start next Wednesday is there a way to test that geth and openethereum clients won't reject us once the fixes are in? Or we won't know for sure until we rebuild and start fastsync again on Wednesday? 
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 21:27:36 GMT):<br/>
We could probably get that admin api in by next wednesday
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 21:56:30 GMT):<br/>
a dev gorli chain should be sufficient.  check the peer table and look for Geth running an eth/64 capability - https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#admin_peers
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 23:04:26 GMT):<br/>
Does besu actually store the peer table to disk? I didn't think it did.  And even if we cleared our peer table, other nodes would still know about us and make inbound connections which is how I would have guessed we wound up finding peers.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 23:05:35 GMT):<br/>
Right that's what shemnon said too - missed it in this wonderful RocketChat interface. :)

<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 23:29:15 GMT):<br/>
I don't know for sure but I just assumed that's what all p2p systems do so they don't always rely on bootnodes :P

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 30 May 2020 02:11:12 GMT):<br/>
No, besu doesn't store the peer table to disk.  But other nodes are up long enough that they will gossip an old nodes ghost for quite a while.

Cool.  The privacy nodes on Ropsten are behind now too - is that because they're on the RC version as well?  Or is there another problem with them? dev-besu-ohio-privacy-reorg-0 and dev-besu-ohio-privacy-reorg-1

Those ropsten nodes started a from-scratch fast sync.  They finished chain download but are working on state download.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sun, 31 May 2020 19:43:20 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon - are https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1005 and https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1006 the two PRs needed to fix the 1.4.6-RC1 bugs?  So if we started a fastsync with the latest master we'd be able to confirm we won't see the same issues as Friday? 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 31 May 2020 19:43:33 GMT):<br/>
Those are the two.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sun, 31 May 2020 19:43:42 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 31 May 2020 19:45:01 GMT):<br/>
1006 passed the EF's tests - https://hivetests.ethdevops.io/?suite=1590939003-029126e600861c71f531f2a85d61c160.json - down to 5 conformance bugs from 8 (which was up from 7 with the bug)
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sun, 31 May 2020 19:55:07 GMT):<br/>
I'm not across what exactly those tests do. Do they tests test for the peering with other clients and versions?  ie, if we pass those tests we'd expect to catch bugs like 1005 and 1006 before we cut an RC and start syncing? 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 31 May 2020 20:25:01 GMT):<br/>
They failures in the reference tests went up because we were rejecting all ping packets, including the two tests I was trying to fix.  Now we are passing those two tests as well as all tests we passed before.  So I consider this external validation the fixes worked as intended.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sun, 31 May 2020 20:42:59 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the explanation.  When/how do we run the the EF tests?

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 01 Jun 2020 14:24:10 GMT):<br/>
the EF has a server at https://hivetests.ethdevops.io/ where they post results they run every 2 or so days.  I've tried to build hive myself and the docs are awful.  I'm working on the ethereum/tests gitter to see how it's done.

Hi,
The peer discovery service uses UDP protocol as mentioned here https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-kubernetes/blob/master/helmfile/ibft2/charts/besu-node/templates/node-service.yaml
We use ambassador in BAF (blockchain automation framework) for proxy which doesn't support UDP protocol. Is there a support for TCP protocol for the same or any other alternatives?

You could use a static peers file, but that would only allow for a static topology.  Dynamic peer discovery in Ethereum only uses UDP.

Update on pre-release fast sync testing. We observed that the node under test did complete its sync, but the machine crashed not long after (about 1h). We don't have a conclusive reason for the crash yet, but some of the syslog messages make it look like a memory availability issue (udev was complaining that it couldn't create something due to a failure to allocate memory).

Update on pre-release ~fast~ full sync testing. We observed that the node under test did complete its sync, but the machine crashed not long after (about 1h). We don't have a conclusive reason for the crash yet, but some of the syslog messages make it look like a memory availability issue (systemd-udevd was complaining that it couldn't fork a child process due a failure to allocate memory).
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 21:13:42 GMT):<br/>
Someone needs to make a call about what this crash means for our go/no-go decision on shipping in light of this. @timbeiko says that he thinks that he observed a node crashing not long after fast sync completed recently, which makes me think that there's enough to be concerned about this issue repeating for our users. That said, I don't think we really have enough information yet to even categorize it as a bug. That is, I have no idea how frequently this issue will occur in the real world.

If it's simply because the node we were running needed more memory, is this even a bug? The machine in question had 7.69GiB (thank Amazon for the weird numbers).
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 21:15:37 GMT):<br/>
@madelinemurray what do you think we should do? My weak suggestion, based on the feeling of not having enough data, is to try running it again on a machine with more memory, with DEBUG logging enabled, and potentially with better system-level monitoring via something like telegraf.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 21:21:49 GMT):<br/>
So, it finished fast sync and was processing the remaining blocks up to head and it ran out of memory.  Right? 
Do we have other nodes running the RC that were able to process those blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 21:23:12 GMT):<br/>
Any chance we can duplicate the db of this node and start two instances with the RC, 1 instance with the same 8GB and another with a bit more memory?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 21:24:18 GMT):<br/>
@ajsutton idk if we have other instances running the RC. I think @timbeiko was running one (and apparently had issues as well).

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 21:24:23 GMT):<br/>
It was more than 1 h.  after 90 min it started falling behind and after 3h45m it ran out of system memory and the node became unresponsive.

The obnoxious thing at the moment is that all of the system-level monitoring during the period which the node was malfunctioning was dropped, so we can really only infer what happened from clues in the besu log and syslog

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 21:50:44 GMT):<br/>
That's the only thing that strikes me as large scale memory usage, other than general mainnet load.

<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 22:30:01 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 22:53:23 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, lots of meetings this morning.  Personally I'm not too concerned that we need more than 8Gb for a MainNet sync - the world state for MainNet keeps growing and generally it's resource requirements keep growing too.  I definitely wouldn't be holding the release just for that concern, though it probably is worth doing some work to better understand what's using the memory involved.
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 22:55:19 GMT):<br/>
I'm mostly concerned about the stability aspect - I'm surprised that it managed to take down the whole machine...
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 22:55:30 GMT):<br/>
aye, lets hold till we get more data, @benjamincburns and I are looking at graphs trying to work out what happend atm, but arent clear as to what it was meant to be doing ie pruning kicked in/ full sync block issue / what exactly
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 22:55:36 GMT):<br/>
normaly I would have expected the kernel to kill the process and systemd to restart it

I've seen this happen before.  Quite often see EC2 instances die like this when memory is pressed heavily.  I get the impression the OOM killer is either effectively disabled or configured in a way that tends to make it kill the wrong stuff
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 22:59:37 GMT):<br/>
I have the kernel logs though and it didn't even fire :-/
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 22:59:52 GMT):<br/>
and I've definitely seen oomkiller working on EC2 instances in the past

<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:00:04 GMT):<br/>
though you're right - it often does kill the wrong process
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:00:40 GMT):<br/>
I've never had the kernel logs before so don't know what it was doing.  But this is definitely not new behaviour to me - the question is more around whether the increase in memory requirements are an issue.
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:00:45 GMT):<br/>
Personally I'd feel a lot better if we could determine the reason for the crash beyond just "it ate all the memory"
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:02:01 GMT):<br/>
Given we only started doing clean syncs on 8GB boxes recently, do we know it used to work reliably previously? If it has worked, in previous runs did it just squeak through using nearly all the memory?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:02:27 GMT):<br/>
Come again, this has happened before?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:03:42 GMT):<br/>
I've seen this kind of crash quite a while back around the time we were first implementing fast sync.  If you used all the memory on the box it turned into a zombie.  Seen it happen more recently with Teku as well (due to known memory usage growth during non-finalization)
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:06:37 GMT):<br/>
is this on OpenJDK 11?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:07:49 GMT):<br/>
should be
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:08:01 GMT):<br/>
11.0.2 from memory
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:09:26 GMT):<br/>
does physically enforcing max limits on mem prevent this?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:09:26 GMT):<br/>
does physically enforcing java max limits on mem prevent this?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:10:16 GMT):<br/>
ie if it cant use up 100% of resources at least the box is still alive for us to glean some info from
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:14:23 GMT):<br/>
when running on bare metal without artificial memory limits imposed by something like cgroups, we should be seeing OutOfMemoryExceptions
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:14:24 GMT):<br/>
No.  -Xmx only controls the on-heap memory, but RocksDB uses a bunch of off heap memory which isn't restricted by that.  It makes it very difficult to correctly tune the memory settings for Besu with a big world state, relatively slow disk and limited memory (ie these EC2 instances)
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:14:45 GMT):<br/>
yeah, but we have native code in the mix now
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:15:07 GMT):<br/>
You'll only get java OutOfMemoryError if the java heap runs out of memory.  RocksDB's behaviour is different because it's native and using off heap.
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:15:39 GMT):<br/>
yeah

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:16:18 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, the default grafana dashboard seems to be adding the two together which is very misleading.

<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:16:19 GMT):<br/>
I just wish the damn INFO level logs said something like "pruning database" or something right around the time things went pear shaped
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:16:25 GMT):<br/>
but there's nothing meaningful in the logs
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:16:38 GMT):<br/>
and there's nothing conclusive in any of our other monitoring
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:16:42 GMT):<br/>
so we need a proper memory profile perhaps? giving it more mem seems like it just buys extra time?

</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:17:17 GMT):<br/>
that's system-wide though, not just besu
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:17:56 GMT):<br/>
absent some information that tells us conclusively why this crashed, I think we have to run it again, otherwise why did we bother doing this test in the first place?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:18:09 GMT):<br/>
My understanding, which could be outdated is that the biggest factor in memory usage is around world state and what transactions are doing.  So potentially we just processed a series of transactions that loaded and/or changed a bunch of world state at once, causing more nodes to be held in memory in Besu and growing the size of RocksDB's memory because it couldn't compact fast enough.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:18:30 GMT):<br/>
Well that's why I'm interested to know if we've seen this run well in the past and if so, how close to full memory was it.
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:18:33 GMT):<br/>
it had finished processing old world state entries
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:18:43 GMT):<br/>
No, every transaction touches world state.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:19:11 GMT):<br/>
If previous versions were really close to memory limits, then adding some more blocks on top to MainNet could easily be enough to push it over the limit.
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:20:04 GMT):<br/>
>Well that's why I'm interested to know if we've seen this run well in the past and if so, how close to full memory was it.

Josh and I don't have any knowledge of this succeeding or failing in the past - we don't run full syncs very often
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:20:24 GMT):<br/>
When did we introduce this as a gate for releases? Is this the first one?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:20:32 GMT):<br/>
which is part of what has me erring toward running it again
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:20:51 GMT):<br/>
I'm questioning whether it's a sensible test to run.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:20:54 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:21:03 GMT):<br/>
Do we have records showing what the memory usage was?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:21:04 GMT):<br/>
those were fast syncs, though - right?
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:21:24 GMT):<br/>
All fast syncs move to full sync at the end - this was a fast sync
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:24:38 GMT):<br/>
hang on - i thought that was in the full sync state
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:31:38 GMT):<br/>
It had gone fast sync and then had gone to full sync and had completed full sync.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:31:52 GMT):<br/>
Are we sure it's besu causing the remaining memory pressure?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 00:32:09 GMT):<br/>
@here: We had a T3.large with Besu 1.4.6-RC2 drop all of a sudden - we believe this to be related to memory / slow disk and not really related to code directly. We are going to:
 - Update our requirements to have a fast disk which doesnt put as much pressure on memory or slower disk with more memory 
 - spin up a few comparison boxes on i3.large & t3.xl and compare sync performance of 1.4.2 and 1.4.6 and get more data for this, consequently update our test box & process
  - the release for 1.4.6 *will* go ahead on Monday AEST as planned
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 00:33:39 GMT):<br/>
I think thats the general gist, but please update anything if I've missed it?
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 01:31:37 GMT):<br/>
I'll update the doc to indicate our minimum spec for mainnet is t3.xl
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 02:55:03 GMT):<br/>
@joshuafernandes @benjamincburns - I'm updating the min specs now.  Is 8GB for the JVM still right for mainnet?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 03:41:34 GMT):<br/>
The short answer is that right now we don't know. We're going to do some experiments to get a better idea. I expect that a recommendation of 8GB is a safe bet for now, though.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 03:58:41 GMT):<br/>
I think the correct answer is "let the JVM decide" and just specify a system memory minimum. Specifying -Xmx and -Xms turns off new logic that it uses to commuincate with the container to decide how much to let the heap grow.  Our memory problems are more related to RocksDB than the JVM.

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 09:37:29 GMT):<br/>
The API for a `Gauge` in Besu's metrics doesn't support labels as we do for counters and timers.  Originally this was a deliberate omission because it seemed better to just include it in the name.  In practice however there's a few places where it winds up being quite clumsy - in particular the metrics around executor queue lengths.  Any objections to adding label support to gauges?  It would affect the plugin API but, while I haven't worked out what the API should be exactly, it should be natural to have it as an additional method so shouldn't have any backwards compatibility issues.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 12:28:02 GMT):<br/>
No objections :+1:
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 17:00:01 GMT):<br/>
The problem we will run into is that gauges are not idempotent.  Once you add a labaled gauge you can only use that gauge going forward.  This was my experience the last time I tried this.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 17:01:01 GMT):<br/>
There are many places in besu were we create a counter with the same name and Prometheous doesn't care.  But if we have a gauge with two different callbacks Prom doesn't know how to handle it.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 20:59:51 GMT):<br/>
From memory Prometheus won't let you create two counters with the same name either, but the Besu wrapper handles it so you get the same Counter instance back if you use the same name multiple times.  That works great for counters because all the inc calls are meant to just add up.

For gauges having two with the same name doesn't make sense because they can only have one value at a time (and the API the besu wrapper exposes just provides a Supplier which is even less conducive to having two instances).

But with labels on gauges you could have the same name but different label values and that would be valid.  The Besu wrapper will probably have to work a little magic to make it easy to use but I'm pretty sure it will be doable.  It will still throw if you use the same name and label values though.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 22:57:05 GMT):<br/>
As many other products and platforms are doing, we are making the change in terminology in Besu from whitelist/blacklist to allowlist/denylist. Since this involves CLI options, we will first be adding additional CLI options as alternate names, and then will follow the process in Besu for breaking changes to remove the whitelist/blacklist CLI options. Work has started on this issue https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/1076

Hello contributors, I had a query related to the production deployment of Besu. Having read https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Deploy/Cloud/ and the sample Kubernetes project, is https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-kubernetes/tree/master/helm/consortium/besu the better architecture? In that case, is it expected that each participating organization run a set of validators and a set of nodes (with or without private TM)?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 22:26:28 GMT):<br/>
It depends :) Some people that have everything in house ie Dapps, chain, other business apps etc  (no external users) will find the non consortium variants easier to manage. If you have a core group admin'ing the validators and users come and go, then the consortium is the preferred approach. Couple of things to bear in mind that participating members do not _need_ to be validators - the can join as members - there is an upper bound on effective number of validators. Also when users join they can be their choice of setup (cloud, on prem VMs/instances/ etc or on K8S)
</p>
<p><strong>sownak</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 08:16:29 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. Are the validators members as well? i.e. do they participate in the blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 08:26:58 GMT):<br/>
Yep, they're the most important part - think of them as founding members :) The validators create blocks so without them the chain wont grow. After the initial set are created you vote new validators in (members that will now be responsible for block creation)
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 08:27:46 GMT):<br/>
Essentially you have 3 loosely defined roles:
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 08:27:46 GMT):<br/>
Essentially you have 3 loosely defined roles:
- bootnodes - all nodes connect to them first to get  a list of peers to connect to. 
- validators - create blocks and the chain grows. Sometimes the initial validator pool are also bootnodes
- members - normal nodes which you'd pair with a privacy tx mgr
</p>
<p><strong>sownak</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 08:34:52 GMT):<br/>
Perfect, thanks a lot. Will the roles be different for another consensus? I guess validator is only for IBFT2
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 06:16:26 GMT):<br/>
This largely depends on the type of consensus algorithm used - POW have miners to create blocks eg ropsten network. POA algorithms like clique/ibft2/etc use validators  eg (goerli network, private networks etc)

<p><strong>abdelhamidbakhta</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:53:25 GMT):<br/>
Hello, we are considering introducing lombok (https://projectlombok.org/) to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes. One of the main reason is to have some consistency across the codebase when using some design patterns. For instance, currently there are 3 different ways of implementing Builder pattern in Besu. We also believe introducing Lombok would improve readability and maintainability of the codebase. We have a showcase pull request (https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1148) to illustrate the potential benefits of using Lombok. This PR uses Value and Builder annotations from Lombok, the impacted class is a configuration object. This is a common case where we have repetitive code that could be drastically reduced. The impact for contributors would be to add a plugin in their favorite IDE. All instructions for IDE setup are here: https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij. Please feel free to comment the pull request and/or discuss here if you have strong opinions. We plan to add a whitelist of Lombok annotations that are ok to use. We will enforce this rule with an error-prone check ultimately.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 22:41:59 GMT):<br/>
I won't stand in the way of this but my preference is very strongly against it.  The issue with tools like Lombok is that they reduce the lines of code by increasing the complexity.  Contributors don't just need to configure their IDE, they also need to read up and fully understand what Lombok is doing so that they can read the code and understand the "magic" that these annotations do. I'm much more concerned with reducing complexity than with reducing lines of code so my preference would be to continue using plain Java - we can still fix any inconsistent patterns that are being used (and Lombok won't stop being introducing new inconsistencies).
</p>

I would tend to cautiously agree with Adrian.

I do not see how this helps the project - this code is already written. Are we planning on changing that part of the code?

It might be interesting to reduce complexity, maybe by removing builders altogether since they are not used as part of an API.

<p><strong>abdelhamidbakhta</strong> (Sat, 27 Jun 2020 05:29:32 GMT):<br/>
I strongly disagree @ajsutton because we want to enforce the use to only some of the annotations. Like Builder Getter Setter. They don't generate any magic code. Exactly same as if it was in vanilla Java. It cannot introduce any kind of complexity with this kind of annotations. Please give me a concrete example.

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Sun, 28 Jun 2020 21:57:52 GMT):<br/>
So what I mean by "magic" is the generation that Lombok is doing. There is an annotation in the source file that "magically" expands to become a full builder. That introduces extra complexity for someone reading the source code because it's another layer of indirection - you can't just follow through the Java code in your IDE you have to also know or lookup exactly what the lombok annotations expand into.  It's only a small amount of additional complexity and yes people will learn them but my experience is that complexity winds up being a problem because lots of little complexities build up.

Code is written much less often than it is read and writing code is much simpler than reading it (especially since the things Lombok can generate can generally also have source code generated by IDEs).  As a result when I evaluate changes like this I inevitably land on the side of keeping code as simple to read as possible even if that makes writing it harder.  I appreciate that you're making different trade offs and seeing the cost/benefits differently - it's ok for us to disagree on that. :)

I thought it was important to raise my concerns that we were reducing lines of code at the cost of extra complexity. But as I said I'm not attempting to block this despite personally not liking it. If others are generally in favour of this then I'll happily follow along.

It won't materially affect me if Lombok comes in - but I generally have concerns about including a code generation "engine-room" in the production code.
I suspect it won't solve our "3 different builder problem", but will instead add a 4th way of doing it. I also suspect that some developers won't use the Lombok solution so our builders will keep changing.TBH, my IDE does most of the auto-coding I need, and doesn't add extra layers to our actual code base.
We're not likely to go back and refactor code with the lombok solution, we've got more important features to produce - so it means we'll actually have a 4th builder pattern ...

I see little benefit in using Lombok. There is less code to write and look at but this comes with the downside of dealing with generated code during the build process and the additional setup to use the project. Whilst this extra code can be considered boilerplate it still important and I would rather our code was explicit rather than relying on code generation for this. It also seems like the wrong way to solve the code consistency issue for builders. That I think would be better solved by using errorprone or something similar rather than forcing using of Lombok.
</p>
<p><strong>abdelhamidbakhta</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:26:08 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for your feedback guys. I understand your concerns. Dealing with design pattern inconsistency was simply an example. I agree Lombok will not remove this for other inconsistencies. Dealing with generated code during build phase is transparent, do you see any issue @jframe  ? @ajsutton  I agree code is written less times than reading. And this is why i believe we should make reading easy as possible. Some of our classes are very big, and more than half of the code is for getters, setters, builders, constructors. They take place. I mean even mentally they take place in your brain. IMO it is better to have only code that brings business logic. You know directly what is important. And it was definitely important to raise your concerns indeed. I would agree if you were planning to use more complex annotations. However if you limit to trivial stuff like getters, setters and builders i don't think there is any kind of extra complexity. Would you be more willing to use something interface-based like https://immutables.github.io/ ? It provided safe defaults and does not require specific plugin.
</p>
<p><strong>abdelhamidbakhta</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:33:52 GMT):<br/>
I think https://immutables.github.io/ would actually be better if we consider using dependency injection.
</p>
<p><strong>abdelhamidbakhta</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 09:04:47 GMT):<br/>
And because immutables is restricted to generating simple, safe and consistent value objects we won't have to write error prone rules to whitelist only partial features like we would have with Lombok.
</p>
<p><strong>davemec</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 11:20:22 GMT):<br/>
I have used immutables in the past and they made the codebase a lot easier to both read and maintain. I think this is a better choice than Lombok.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 14:46:25 GMT):<br/>
So the goal wouldn't be to introduce a 4th builder pattern, but to replace the other 3 builder patterns we use into a single consistent pattern.  It's much easier to read code if when you recognize a pattern it's always the same pattern.

Apparently we have two new known flaky tests. I've requested this in ConsenSys slack, but I'm going to request again here. If we know for sure that these tests are flaky and it's not due to a new bug, can we please make sure that they're ignored in the AT test run prior to the release? @madelinemurray @shemnon 

Apparently the tests in question are `PeerDiscoveryTableRefreshTest.tableRefreshSingleNode` and `PeerDiscoveryTimestampsTest.lastSeenAndFirstDiscoveredTimestampsUpdatedOnMessage`
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 20:45:18 GMT):<br/>
For reference, every time a test fails during a release it wastes about a half hour of Yeti's time, and IIRC, we need to see up to 3 separate green builds of Besu in order to complete the release. The time sink here is really significant for us.

Alternatively we can just cancel the release if we see a red build, but even in that case we need to roll things back.
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 20:51:48 GMT):<br/>
In the past we didn't really disable tests because it led to them being ignored. I get that it kind of wastes Yeti's time, which is an argument to push back releases to dev teams :sweat_smile: 

For this specific case, I don't have a strong opinion. The tests have issues opened for each of them. I think if Yeti is releasing then it should be your call :+1:

<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 20:53:25 GMT):<br/>

BTW, If we're not sure that these are bad tests and we think that they might be bugs, I'm more in favor of postponing the release than ignoring the tests. Obviously it's a bad policy if every intermittent test failure is automatically blamed on the test rather than the code under test. If we do that, we'll obviously release bugs to our users.

Isn't it possible to bring in a subset of commits from master into the RC branch in one go?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 21:01:55 GMT):<br/>
You can `git cherry-pick --no-commit` to combine multiple commits into one.
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 21:02:11 GMT):<br/>
Technically yes, but it's a bad practice for a number of reasons. Commits should be thought of as semantic units of work. By smashing a bunch of unrelated commits together you wind up breaking that ideal, and making it harder to trace the changes back to their origin

Immutables is definitely much, much nicer than Lombok.  It worked out of the box with the IDE and preserves the ability to "click through" code.  The fact that we write an interface to define the object accurately reflects the fact that the implementation comes from elsewhere and Immutables actually generates a full Java source file for the implementation it generates.  As a result you can find implementations of the interface and be taken to perfectly readable Java code defining it (it's even more lines of code that we'd write but I'm fine with that). 

There's magic happening but the generated source file shows exactly what's been done and the complexity and need to understand Immutables impact writing code, not reading it - you have to know to write an interface with the right annotation and that the generated class will magically appear with an `Immutable` prefix in the name but since code is written much less than it's read even if you have to look up that construct every time you need it you don't get the same "death by a thousand cuts" you do if that complexity impacts reading the code.

Basically immutables resolves all the concerns I had with Lombok. From what I can see it looks really good.

My gut feel says Immutables won't change the amount of work we do - as our IDE does much of the heavy lift.  But - if people feel like this will reduce overall tech debt and complexity, sounds good.
Do we need to consider if this affects PRs etc - i.e. will PRs be rejected if they don't use Immutables where possible? I.e. Is this part of our Coding standards?
</p>
<p><strong>davemec</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:50:46 GMT):<br/>
I would vote for this becoming a part of the coding standards if we move forward with using it. Otherwise the code can end up being hard to maintain if it is mixed in here and there.
</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:46:14 GMT):<br/>
The immutables approach is much nicer with it not modifying existing classes and having the generated source code there. Wasn't too much trouble to get work with intellij though I did have to ask intellij to rebuild even after a gradle build so this might be an ongoing nuisance. So think it's going to be ok to use, not so sold on the benefits but the downsides that were there with lombok are gone for most part.

Just wanted to share some info here. Today I did some comparative performance testing to determine the impact of the JVM implementation on Besu performance. I tested OpenJDK 11, Amazon's Corretto, Azul Zulu, and GraalVM Community Edition. Of the ones tested, GraalVM had the best performance. We actually observed a 50 TPS throughput improvement as compared to OpenJDK.

I'm going to do some more testing tomorrow with the enterprise versions of GraalVM, but I wanted to drop a note here in the meantime.

Hi Contributors,
while implementing the tls logic for Orion transaction Manager, faced an issue with certificate generation. I was following the documentation on the link https://docs.orion.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Tutorials/TLS/  and found an issue with the documentation.
so the nodeurl, clienturl and othernodes should be in a format
nodeurl = "https://<YOUR-COMMON-NAME>:8080/"
clienturl = "https://<YOUR-COMMON-NAME>:8888/"
othernodes = ["https://<YOUR-COMMON-NAME>:8080"]

as without the https:// the orion is not recognizing the string as a URL.

Hi,
While following the besu documentation for deploying the smart contract over the besu network with IBFT consensus, I am getting the issues like method is not defined, I am following the link https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/Client-Libraries/web3js-eea/
Also while performing this request "curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_accounts","params":[],"id":53}' <RPC address>" I am getting the empty response from the server. I am not using any "alloc" section in my production ibftConfigFile.json. 
How can I generate the ethereum account for my network and what are the steps or methods I should be using to deploy the smart contract on the Besu network for production?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 27 Jul 2020 21:23:12 GMT):<br/>
Since IBFT networks don't (currently) have mining rewards you must use an `alloc` section in the genesis.  Otherwise there's no way to put ether into the system, so the empty response to `eth_accounts` is expected.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 27 Jul 2020 21:23:29 GMT):<br/>
what calls are you getting "method is not defined" from?

</p>
<p><strong>lakshyakumar</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 03:54:19 GMT):<br/>
Then do you guys have a guide to generate the eth accounts to be kept in "alloc" section, for a production network?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 17:24:46 GMT):<br/>
Besu itself does not support the eth_accounts API (it always returns empty), since it is associated with node controlled keys.  It is a deliberate choice not to have besu act like a cryptocurrency wallet.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 17:25:13 GMT):<br/>
Consider looking at EthSigner (https://docs.ethsigner.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#eth_accounts) which is a service you put in front of besu and it supports the wallet methods.

Hello Besu contributors, I am looking to make code contributions and I have a specific issue (#544) that I would like to be my first issue.  How do I have this issue assigned to me?
</p>

Here is a proposal to change when we do release candidates for Besu: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38142364

It was discussed on the last contributor call and agreed upon by attendees. We are now sharing it to get feedback from a broader set of maintainers and contributors :slight_smile:

Hi all. I'm trying to add some sub commands, and I need access to properties and other objects that are currently private in the BesuCommand object. I can do some dodgy reflection to work around it, but it's not ideal. Is there some other approach that I'm missing?
</p>
<p><strong>bmg</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 14:18:24 GMT):<br/>
Ideally it would be nice to have all the cli options defined in BesuCommand public for access in sub commands, and to modify the run() method in BesuCommand to perform all the initialisation but not call startSynchronization(). This would allow sub commands that re-use the parent run method to initialise everything
</p>

Happy to create an issue for this (and implement it) if there isn't some existing approach that I've missed
</p>
<p><strong>bmg</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 14:43:51 GMT):<br/>
Making Blockchain, WorldState (read only) accessible via the plugin API would be nice also.... oh and being able to register additional json rpc commands.... :)
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 15:10:15 GMT):<br/>
An issue describing it how you did here would be most welcome! We can discuss the merits of it in a more permanent way there.
</p>
<p><strong>aldoborrero</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 15:10:32 GMT):<br/>
Also, continuing on what Brian has said, is there also a possibility of having inside MainnetEvmRegistries class all the factory methods public? For example, in Besu Exflo, we are creating a new internal instance of the EVM to provide additional tracing semantics and we have to resort as well to use reflection: https://github.com/41north/besu-exflo/blob/54d6659f3d0bcdd1fc2fc95b20c06c7d319160fe/ingestion/base/src/main/kotlin/io/exflo/ingestion/tokens/EVMFactory.kt#L112

@rai sounds good, I'll drop it in the repo later this evening
</p>
<p><strong>aldoborrero</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 15:11:41 GMT):<br/>
Better to discuss this in a proper issue as well
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:46:37 GMT):<br/>
Definitely in a github issue so we can get the design right.  My thinking is that this can be done with the fork numbers from the genesis file, IIRC those all are in the GenesisConfig but I don't think we have a plugin API for the genesis config.
</p>
<p><strong>bmg</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:50:59 GMT):<br/>
Yeah there is no plugin api for that, we ended up recreating a lot of things separately like protocol schedules and so on independently which is not ideal.

Hello all! I am adding a new jsonrpc method to Besu. Is there a guide or convention used for determining a value for the "id" member of the Request object for each json-rpc  method? I don't want to just assign one arbitrarily.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 15:57:59 GMT):<br/>
Hi, we've had some issues on the Besu doc build on Read The Docs because of the code block tab plugin. It was deprecated and now it's not working anymore.
So I created a PR to fix this because it required to update all the templating system and the code blocks tab syntax... a lot of changes, I'm allready sorry for the reviewers...
Here is the PR to review: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs/pull/489
Note that until this PR is merged, no other PR will be able to build, so it's a bit important.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 17:29:19 GMT):<br/>
This PR is merged and build are now back to normal. I updated all the pending PR so you will be able to fix the few remaining issues (like md lint issues).
Also, new thing, all our PRs are now built by ReadTheDocs and the status is returned to the PR checks list.
It also means that you will be able to preview your PR changes directly in RTD by following the "detail" link in the checks list for all your new commits. No excuse not to check the rendering of your doc changes now ;)
Thanks for all your very useful contributions, I hope this will help making the contribution process even easier (I know testing locally is a bit hard sometimes)

Hi,
I am trying to enable the tls on besu node in my production network, following the process defined here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Configure-TLS/
In the prerequisite section you mention about Besu’s password-protected PKCS #12 keystore, but I am not able to findout the guide which gives some indecation about the content and structure of the keystore. could you please point me to some reference where the structure of the content of the keystore required is described.
Thanks you
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:03:45 GMT):<br/>
hi @lakshyakumar - creating a PKCS #12 keystore isn't specific to Besu which is why it's not covered in the Besu documentation. Searching should turn up plenty of guides/examples but let us know if you have any issues getting it set up.

Hi Contributors,
On our production besu network when modifying the `extradata` field in `genesis` file from the generated one to the rlp encoded array of validator nodes, the network stoped deploying the smartcontract on the nodes. The faliure in the deployment script caused by the timeout after the "waiting for the transction to be mined" message from the node. The network was working fine before editing the genesis file.
can you suggest some possible causes?

here is the genesis file I tried to make, I have used the `"constantinoplefixblock": 0`,
in one of the tries but still failing to get the transaction mined.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:16:49 GMT):<br/>
So when you changed the genesis, is this prior to mining any blocks?  And all validators have the same contracts?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:18:24 GMT):<br/>
Is this a long lived chain?  If you want to add and remove validators you need to use the ibft series of JSON-RPC calls and the other validators need to vote the nodes in/out.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:19:11 GMT):<br/>
But to deploy a contract you just need to have a peer on the network that talks to one of the validators, and they can introduce the contract to the chain.  Try setting `--bootnode=` with all of the enodes of the validator nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:21:13 GMT):<br/>
or adding them in `static-nodes.json` file for the non-validating peers.

<p><strong>lakshyakumar</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 03:19:54 GMT):<br/>
we are creating the `extraData` field with validator information in genesis prior to setup the network.
I have used the static-nodes.json to provide the enode of all the peers, and able to see in the logs that the member peer is connected to all the validator peers. any other possible cause?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 05:43:13 GMT):<br/>
You can try cranking up the logging level on the node you are sending the deployment transaction to (`--logging=DEBUG` or `--logging=TRACE`).  See if it hits the transaction pool, then see if it is marked as invalid for any reason.  Could be non-zero gas price and zero account balance, could be nodes are not propagating zero gas transactions, could be something wrong with the contract and it fails execution prior to mining.

Hi everyone!
I would like contribute a tool for Besu(not contribute to Besu Blockchain itself), and where can I summit our projtect?
</p>
<p><strong>andrewyen</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 06:09:06 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 17 Sep 2020 05:05:58 GMT):<br/>
Do you have a pubic repo for this tool we can look at?  We haven't started a contrib repo yet, nor accepted any other repos in yet, but that's mostly because we haven't had any standalone ccontributions yet.

there's a number of things we need to re-architect to get similar mainnet performance.  The first is my "Bonsai Tries" project where we make trie leaves O(1) readable.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 03:22:09 GMT):<br/>
The "Silkwork" project is also another thing we are keeping an eye on, standard component APIs between microservices would be a boon to all ethereum like blockchains.

</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:21:35 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon am toying with the idea of having separate executables for besu vs besu-tracing. Would it be possible to enable tracing via an env var instead? That would probably be a bit less disruptive. Otherwise I am not sure where we reconcile this to a switch.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:21:54 GMT):<br/>
And of course tracing disabled by default - no need to turn that on unless the user explicitly asks for it.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:21:58 GMT):<br/>
Are you willing to do the build file mungling in the gradle script?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:22:17 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon you know I am. It doesn't even hurt anymore.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:22:37 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps we should have a run script template we keep in source control.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:22:49 GMT):<br/>
not sure gradle supports taht.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:22:49 GMT):<br/>
not sure gradle supports that.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:23:03 GMT):<br/>
but an env var switch is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:23:39 GMT):<br/>
that would be cool if gradle was a bit more reliable, indeed. Right now we depend a bit on their application plugin to do the right thing if we upgrade.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:23:53 GMT):<br/>
We already apply regexp to mangle the start script. This is not different.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:27:32 GMT):<br/>
Looks like we can template it - https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.jvm.application.tasks.CreateStartScripts.html

hey folks, I have opentelemetry metrics working well now here. I would be interested in peppering Besu at strategic places with tracing as well.
Tracing allows you to track how much time is spent in specific places. I see how anything touching merkle trie or the JSON-RPC interface would make sense. Where else would it make sense to add tracing? Would the blockchain classes also make sense like validating blocks?

Do you plan to implement a custom OperationTracer and use middleware pattern to inject open tracing if enabled ?

We're queueing up a release for tomorrow, so we are a bit full.  I'll try and get the review tomorrow evening.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Nov 2020 22:58:01 GMT):<br/>
Have you done any load testing?  I'm particulraly concerned about the wrapping of the trie node reads and DB reads.  We once had prometheus metrics there and the performance impact was very noticeable, and it got worse when metrics were turned on.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Nov 2020 22:58:52 GMT):<br/>
anything that is expected to be sub-millisecond I think are bad candidates for tracing.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 17 Nov 2020 23:01:03 GMT):<br/>
I have soaked this code with a mainnet sync
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Nov 2020 23:11:50 GMT):<br/>
how long did it take?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 17 Nov 2020 23:48:25 GMT):<br/>
It ran out of disk after 200Gb, roughly 48h in. It didn't seem to have much problems. It was also monitored by our ethlogger tool which kept asking for every block and transaction along the way.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 17 Nov 2020 23:48:51 GMT):<br/>
Do you have specs for how you run nodes for this type of testing? Type of instance, how much disk?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 05:16:30 GMT):<br/>
300Gib (growing like mainnet grows), 2.5 days.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 05:16:43 GMT):<br/>
Those numbers make me concerned it was slower.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 05:17:08 GMT):<br/>
A Goerli full sync is a good measure. 8 hours/80 Gib on a mac.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 05:30:47 GMT):<br/>
I don’t have the detail of when it filled the disk. Note also that having the json rpc calls probably ate some of the cpu
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 05:31:02 GMT):<br/>
So I can rerun if you like

:besu: *Besu 20.10.1 is out*  :besu:

:star2: Highlights :star2:
- Two new JSON RPC endpoints to get miner rewards data, `eth_getMinerDataByBlockHash` & `eth_getMinerDataByBlockNumber`
- A new JSON RPC endpoint to change the gas limit, `miner_changeTargetGasLimit`
- The transaction pool now prioritizes transactions by gas prices
- EVMTool is now part of the binary distribution
- We now provide a new metric to track performance during block import: MegaGas/Seconds
- We have support for OpenTelemetry metrics
- We added support for qip714block config parameter in genesis file, paving the way towards permissioning interoperability between Besu and GoQuorum.

:besu: Besu 20.10.2 is out :besu: 

:star2: Highlights :star2: 
- Added support for batched requests in WebSockets. #1583
- Added protocols section to admin_peers to provide info about peer health. #1582
- Added CLI option --goquorum-compatibility-enabled to enable GoQuorum compatibility mode. #1598. (This mode is incompatible with Mainnet)
- Fixed a longstanding issue with eth/65. It should now work on mainnet, and will likely be on by default starting from 20.10.3 :tada:

Hi team.
When I am trying to define
`--rpc-http-api=EEA,WEB3,ETH,NET,PRIV,PERSONAL`
It is failing because `PERSONAL` is not found.
Is it not present in HL Besu?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 03:51:11 GMT):<br/>
Not in besu.  It was a deliberate architectural decision not to put wallet functionality in the core client.  If you need a wallet solution ethsigner (https://docs.ethsigner.consensys.net/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Install-Binaries/) provides a JSON-RPC proxy that serves the PERSONAL rpcs and forwards the rest off to the configured node.
</p>
<p><strong>jagpreet</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 03:53:16 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for a quick reply. I will look into the ethsigner binary.
</p>

Hi, I had question regarding the version support for besu, are we actively developing 1.4.4 and 1.5.5 both or is it that only the support is given for 1.4.4 and active development is on 1.5.5, or is it something else?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 16:30:12 GMT):<br/>
Active development is only on the most recent releases, which is 20.10.x at the moment.

:christmas_tree: :besu: *Besu 20.10.3 is out!* :besu::christmas_tree:

:star2: *Highlights* :star2:

- eth/65 is now enabled by default :tada: !
- We’ve fixed some edge cases with our tracing APIs not aligning with Parity’s
- Block Validation errors are now are at the INFO log level
- Added memory as an option to --key-value-storage. This ephemeral storage is intended for sync testing and debugging.

@atoulme - documenting this (old) PR of yours - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/715 and have a couple of questions. 

1. Is the `--pid-path` CLI option is only relevant when you're using the Docker image shipped with Besu?
2. If you use the Docker image and don't specify the `--pid-path` option, the pid file is written to a tmp file? 
3. If you do specify `--pid-path`, the pid file is written to that file?
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 30 Dec 2020 04:08:51 GMT):<br/>
@atoulme - and another one - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1492

I'm adding the `--metrics-protocol` CLI option but do we also need equivalent docs on using open telemetry metrics as we have for Prometheus? https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Monitor/Metrics/
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 03 Jan 2021 01:38:49 GMT):<br/>
hey Madeline, just seeing this
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 03 Jan 2021 01:38:49 GMT):<br/>
hey Madeline, just seeing this, I'll reply in threads.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 03 Jan 2021 01:39:56 GMT):<br/>
1. No, you could use a linux service for example and use that to know the PID of Besu.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 03 Jan 2021 01:41:12 GMT):<br/>
2. If you look here, I made the PID path a default part of the besu config for Docker: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/715/files#diff-f34da55ca08f1a30591d8b0b3e885bcc678537b2a9a4aadea4f190806b374ddcR18 - and it's used in the HEALTHCHECK instruction a few lines below.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 03 Jan 2021 01:41:19 GMT):<br/>
3. yes?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 03 Jan 2021 01:44:02 GMT):<br/>
sounds like we would yes. That said, we have a few more changes on the way for that. My latest PR here adds some docs: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1557/files under docs/tracing
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 02:04:33 GMT):<br/>
Auto-merge doesn't re-merge, you still have to do that yourself.  Still, it's an improvement for when I forget to come back to merge.

Hi, could anyone have a look at this doc site change please?
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs/pull/576
I ask here as it implies putting back Ethical ads back and I don't want anyone to be surprised by that. 
Displaying ads was initially required by RTD.org as it's a free OSS hosting plateform and a way to fund them, but the custom template we used was not able to do it. Now that I found a way to add it back, we may be able to show our support to the great work RTD community does.
Thanks.

Review Request - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-native/pull/27/files - Bintray exodus
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 02:17:26 GMT):<br/>
Hi @shemnon, wouldn't be a barrier for some users to force them to have a github account to build the distribution? Certainly it will not be a problem for someone cloning the repository, but what about someone just downloading the source tarball for building it? I don't know if this is the right place to ask this or if you prefer a comment in the PR
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 02:20:29 GMT):<br/>
Hi @shemnon, once bintray shuts down, is the idea to get the `org.hyperledger.besu:besu-native-altbn128` artifact from github packages?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 02:22:29 GMT):<br/>
Folks, I am opening up https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1882 to start working on introducing new forms of PoW - namely keccak256 for ETC.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 02:23:15 GMT):<br/>
This PR is just a lot of refactoring and introducing more variables, and must not have any functional impact. I mean to push this in first to get an easier time introducing a different PoW later.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 04:23:02 GMT):<br/>
So... watch this space.  There's an issue with github packages and authentication.  It may move to artifactory.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 04:38:01 GMT):<br/>
Not seeing tests kick in... what am I missing?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 04:53:12 GMT):<br/>
Hmm... triggered for me - https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hyperledger/besu https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hyperledger/besu?branch=pull%2F1884 - could you try a force push with a slightly different commit message?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 05:11:23 GMT):<br/>
Good now
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 06:47:18 GMT):<br/>
Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 12:01:48 GMT):<br/>
yes, that would have been my next question, if that wouldn't force everybody to have a github account. Certainly, it will not be a problem for somebody cloning the repo, but maybe for whom want to build it from the source tarball

I've just added a new git submodule for some QBFT reference tests so these tests can live in a seperate repo. When you next update to latest master you will need to do a `git submodule update`  to get the new submodule so Besu builds again.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:04:14 GMT):<br/>
OK. If they aren't active any more, perhaps they become maintainers emeritus?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:20:27 GMT):<br/>
Yea, we haven't run a cleanup query, I'll be sure to look that over for the quarterly report.  There are several with no commits in the past quarter that should be migrated.

Hi, it looks like Circle CI is not running on doc repos PRs since a few days. Did anyone do some changes?
For instance this PR https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs/pull/615 is still waiting for CI to be started. There's no workflow started in Circle CI.
However nightly workflow seems to work.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 22 Feb 2021 15:51:49 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 22 Feb 2021 16:53:50 GMT):<br/>
@NicolasMassart I don't see anywhere that stuff has changed. I triggered a re-delivery of the message, and it didn't build
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Mon, 22 Feb 2021 20:06:25 GMT):<br/>
Strange... Let me have a closer look tomorrow.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 07:32:00 GMT):<br/>
It seems that it unlocked itself... I won't investigate until it fails again, it's good for now ;)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:54:38 GMT):<br/>
@NicolasMassart I promise I did nothing but re-trigger the event send
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:56:53 GMT):<br/>
It indeed seems that sometimes Circle CI has issues and can't run on the webhook trigger. If retriggering is enough, I'm fine with that.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:58:31 GMT):<br/>

We will need to do an out of band release to get a change like this in for Ethereum mainnet - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/compare/master...shemnon:cutOff
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 15:25:16 GMT):<br/>
My proposal: 
(a) restore the release-21.1.0 branch at the last release point 
(b) wait for reference tests to be released that include something like this https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/793
(c) apply just that change against 21.1.0
(d) release Monday as 21.1.1
(e) tweak main branch to be 21.1.2-SNAPSHOT
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 15:27:45 GMT):<br/>
(d) could be to release just as soon as tests pass.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 15:46:43 GMT):<br/>
@here Can we get other maintainers opinion on my proposed 21.1.1 out-of-band release :point_up:
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 15:47:10 GMT):<br/>
Basically mainnet just dropped 2314 from mainnet.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 15:47:10 GMT):<br/>
Basically mainnet just dropped EIP-2314 from mainnet and we need to ship it before ropsten forks.
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 15:49:35 GMT):<br/>
sounds good to me
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 15:50:29 GMT):<br/>
I'll make the PR to remove 2315 from master and we can cherry-pick it over
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 15:52:21 GMT):<br/>
Updating the reference tests will block the release however, so that needs to finish first.  Because it's Dmitry in Russia it may not happen until much later today since it's somewhere around midnight there.
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 15:53:12 GMT):<br/>
For sure, just gonna have the PR so when the reference tests do get updated, we can be ready to pull that into the same PR
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 16:16:22 GMT):<br/>
We should also update the 21.1.0 release notes, right?
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 16:25:07 GMT):<br/>
yes, I'll include that

</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:16:07 GMT):<br/>
She's the new Besu PM and it will make it much easier for her to do her job if she can at least open/close/move issues on Besu.

</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:16:27 GMT):<br/>
BTW and apropos of nothing, I think it might be great going forward to have discussions in the besu team a bit more in the open on this type of things. I didn't see the discussion on discord but saw the comment on ACD. I'd like to get more involved and open to more involvement from others.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:16:54 GMT):<br/>
@timbeiko we can vote her in as a maintainer
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:17:20 GMT):<br/>
Who is she? Can we meet?
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:17:45 GMT):<br/>
@atoulme got it. She doesn't have "5 significant contributions", and by virtue of her role probably never will. I (and other Besu PMs) got "lucky" in that we had our contributions in when the docs repo was still bundled, so they counted as "Besu contributions".
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:18:06 GMT):<br/>
I would count changelog wrangling as significant contributions.
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:18:09 GMT):<br/>
She is taking over my role as a product manager for Besu at ConsenSys, I suspect she'll be at the next Besu contributor call, yes :-)
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:18:33 GMT):<br/>
then she can participate - showing up on calls, helping folks on the besu channel, help with release notes, file issues
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:18:36 GMT):<br/>
and we will vote her in
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:18:43 GMT):<br/>
cause we definitely need the help
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:18:56 GMT):<br/>
Ok got it :+1: I think that works. Especially if we can count the changelog contributions, which she'll do as part of her role :+1:
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:19:08 GMT):<br/>
awesome
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:19:32 GMT):<br/>
If she makes contribs to the besu-docs repo it helps too
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:20:24 GMT):<br/>

Settings - Manage Access.  I think you need the admin role to see it.

Hence the screenshot
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:23:01 GMT):<br/>
Got it - don't have that access. Maybe a good topic for the next call. A triage role would also be useful for new engineers joining. I remember David having issues moving his tickets when he started. It seems like a quick fix to remove a lot of friction.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:23:25 GMT):<br/>
at the Apache foundation there was an equivalent discussion
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:24:10 GMT):<br/>
imo and based off those discussions, it's not just code that counts, showing up counts too. The contribs have to be significant in the sense that they help the project, and that can mean holding calls, helping folks, writing tutorials, docs, filing issues, etc.

Changed my mind on going off of 21.1.0 release.  Since Monday is only 2 days earlier I think we should just do an early 21.1.1 release
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 20:57:58 GMT):<br/>
From main.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 22:23:23 GMT):<br/>
if you're the one volunteering the release, that's fine. Out of interest, we do have release instructions documented right?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 22:55:56 GMT):<br/>
looks like this page is of interest: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Release+Rotations I don't see release instructions, is there a "release" task in gradle or something?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 06 Mar 2021 01:02:47 GMT):<br/>
Theres an checklist we had in a consensys repo to verify all the steps, I'll have to rely on rai or abdel to post a wiki page outlineing all the steps.  Basically it's checking in a pr with the reelase version, letting the build run, and then add changelog entries and hash references to a few other repos (docs, homebrew).  ConsenSys will also update some canaries they run for their benefit but that doesn't need to be part of the public repo.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 06 Mar 2021 01:03:16 GMT):<br/>
the gradle build detects when its a non-snapshot build and does the extra steps around the binary, which IIRC are very few.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 06 Mar 2021 04:02:55 GMT):<br/>
yeah would be good to have that out in the open as a wiki page, including the SOP steps such as sending a here to the room about the release starting.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 06 Mar 2021 14:33:31 GMT):<br/>
My thought is to do "release parties" over video the weeks we don't do Office Hours.  Someone drives the automation and while it's building we have a non-business office hours.

Just that one to bring the nodes back into consensus.  The only must have line is removing it from the protocol spec.  The rest were to disassociate BLS12 from the berlin fork, but keep it in as it looks likely for London.

```
$ besu --version

</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 01:05:57 GMT):<br/>
I have a custom log4j config. But I wasn't getting this message on previous versions.

Office Hours Question: Do we want to change meeting times/days?

Since we are going to have to update calendar invites with new meeting codes this is a good time to ask the current maintainers if they would prefer different times and or days for the office hours call. 

I think we will still need at least two meetings as we have 3 major time zone areas so support (AMER, EMEA, AU/NZ) but if we want to make dramatic changes now is the time.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 16:48:19 GMT):<br/>
It's a bit confusing - sorry I could not join today, had a conflict. I know you mean to have office hours to help folks with Besu - is that working right now?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 16:48:51 GMT):<br/>
Can we engage in a good way where we have meetings to discuss specific things?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 16:55:52 GMT):<br/>
I am a bit concerned about meeting fatigue, so we've been trying to keep the maintainer business and open call on the same call, called "office hours".  Rather than a meeting a week alternating between maintainers and community.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 16:56:19 GMT):<br/>
Should we do a separate community call?  I was thinking that it followed demand rather than preceeded it.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:04:55 GMT):<br/>
so, meetings are hard. The Apache folks tend to default to email for that reason. I also have seen a good stride of improvement in the Apache Kafka community where they use the wiki for design discussions.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:07:34 GMT):<br/>
That doesn't really answer what you're asking here. I think doing meetings is hard and somewhat wasteful, but they can be good if there is an agenda, participation and moderation. Do we *need* meetings right now?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:09:11 GMT):<br/>
maybe we could do a review of issues and backlog and create a roadmap for the project, that'd be great.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:30:08 GMT):<br/>
the TSC likes to have each project have at least some in-video session.  And I think it's better for "making it real" to have the video sessions.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:30:19 GMT):<br/>
As for email, nobody in ethereum uses email.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:31:08 GMT):<br/>
My concern of not having an interactive meeting is that we will split into multiple small groups and randomly add things without any co-ordination.  And that also gives a greater gravitation pull to only working with people at your own company.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:31:31 GMT):<br/>
Hence the request to have a roadmap discussion at the next two calls.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:32:06 GMT):<br/>
It's also a lot easier to do support type tasks interatively on a zoom call with a screen share than playing "guess the wrong config item" via chat.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:32:21 GMT):<br/>
But we have yet to have a community member come on a call seeking support.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:52:46 GMT):<br/>
Another project did drop community calls when there was nobody showing up. I'm not taking a position, just pointing out there is precedent.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:53:22 GMT):<br/>
I would be interested in the uptake of the Cactus pair programming sessions that happen every weekday morning Pacific, and if that might be a model
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:58:12 GMT):<br/>
Which project?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 20:00:47 GMT):<br/>
"nobody in ethereum uses email" meh, that's not a great reason, and the folks Besu targets are enterprise devs right?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 20:01:44 GMT):<br/>
Those enterprise devs cannot run zoom on their locked down laptops. Or cannot use slack even. Or rocket.chat for that matter. They can maybe use the web interface of rocket.chat, but there's no archives.

Email is still it.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 20:06:54 GMT):<br/>
These are enterprise devs, not military contractors.  They've come on zoom, are on rocket chat.  And nobody uses our email list.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 20:11:09 GMT):<br/>
If there was a demand for email there would be more mails being sent.  We've had the email list since day 1
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 20:11:53 GMT):<br/>
(Of course it's always day 1 at amazon... :grin:)

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 20:26:19 GMT):<br/>

One more question now that I'm on the website: https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/11/04/announcing-hyperledger-besu-20-10-0 - who sends those blog posts? Looks like we're a few releases behind.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 20:36:09 GMT):<br/>
That's under the domain of the Hyperledger marketing committe.  We probably need a new quarterly post.

I can run the office hours - rough agenda here if anyone wants to add anything https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/2021-03-30+Besu+Contributor+Call
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 23:57:17 GMT):<br/>
I won't be able to make the call (evening appointment conflict). I would like a roadmap caliber update as to what is going on with QBFT and GoQuorum compatibility. Now that I am no longer at ConsenSys I see just how little is communicated about ConsenSys's intentions in that area and when and what should be expected.  If the outcome is to point to some EEA discussions that is fine, but the need to be accessible to people who are not members of the EEA.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 01:02:13 GMT):<br/>
Office hours call - has zoom info changed? I'm getting an error 1001
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 01:04:25 GMT):<br/>
Of course it has because it would have been Danno's meeting... Here's a zoom if anyone wants to office hours with me right now Location:
https://consensys.zoom.us/j/98345085456
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 01:27:33 GMT):<br/>
Ok I'm calling the office hours done. I've made that zoom meeting recurring and set up auto-record, so it should be fine to use on an ongoing basis.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 03:13:13 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon I will follow up on the roadmap update.
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 31 Mar 2021 06:36:20 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon thanks for raising this. I think we need to do a better job at communicating updates, perhapse the contributor calls are a good place to provide that. Regarding the specific question on QBFT interop with GoQuorum, its still work in progress, but getting closer. I expect this to take another month or so. The two current issues being investigated are: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/2095 and https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/2094

Hi everyone, when looking at this issue (https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs/issues/614) to document a new metric, I found that only the four standard Ethereum metrics are documented on the relevant page (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Monitor/Metrics/#view-prometheus-graphical-interface). Looking on Prometheus, there are almost 100 total metrics. Some may be self-explanatory. Is this something that should eventually be documented? Do users need this?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 08:53:15 GMT):<br/>
Hi doc maintainers. We have an issue with Javadoc.io not being available for some hours, now more than a day, so it may not be temporary.
It prevents PRs to be merged in doc repos because of the link checking CI test. I will provide a PR to remove these links to be able to keep working on other subjects. Meanwhile I will look for a way to host the javadoc by ourselves as it's obviously not working when we rely on third parties. Will keep you posted on this.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 11:11:42 GMT):<br/>
Generating the javadoc in our CI process would enable to have it hosted on github pages and look like this https://nicolasmassart.github.io/besu/latest/
Is this an acceptable solution for you?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 11:14:16 GMT):<br/>
by the way I had to fix some html in the javadoc for the p2p module as when running gradle it generates the javadoc for all modules. Here I only published the plugins api one as the others are not relevant.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:08:01 GMT):<br/>
@NicolasMassart could it be a part of https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/ ?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:21:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes we can do that. But it has some drawbacks too:
- the javadoc has to be merged in the doc repos, requires the besu repos CI to push a PR to the besu-docs repos.
- It requires to find a way decorate the javadoc with header and footer to make the user able to go back to the doc. Probably not impossible. But requires to think a bit about it.

Hosting the javadoc on the besu repos github pages is more straightforward and could be a temporary solution. For now we have no javadoc available at all except if you build it by yourself or download the artifact on jfrog.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:24:06 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, perhaps only by reference then.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:24:32 GMT):<br/>
It will be the fastest way yes. Will let me time to think about something better...
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:25:21 GMT):<br/>
Also we can't update existing doc versions, only the latest (master)... so links will be broken for stable and all past versions... It was a mistake to rely on such a service...
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:25:56 GMT):<br/>
But we rely on too many 3rd party services anyway, starting with Github.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:26:06 GMT):<br/>
We should IPFT everything..
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:26:06 GMT):<br/>
We should IPFS everything...
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:31:09 GMT):<br/>
regardless, I could make a javadocs.besu... or something point somewhere
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 02 Apr 2021 16:18:42 GMT):<br/>
I had an answer from the dev who created javadoc.io and the site is back online.
So it will enable us to find something to replace it and having it integrated properly with the current doc site. I created an issue for that. :fingers_crossed:

You can be mentioned using @vmichalik but you can't be assigned or approve a PR.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 06 Apr 2021 13:27:40 GMT):<br/>
It only requires a Github account be mentioned.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 06 Apr 2021 13:28:39 GMT):<br/>
But when you are part of the org, mentioning you is easier as you appear in the suggestion list while you type the mention name.

Hello. `eth_estimateGas` on Besu rejects if we send the `nonce` argument with an error `Caused by: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field "nonce" (class org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.api.jsonrpc.internal.parameters.JsonCallParameter), not marked as ignorable (11 known properties: "gasPrice", "value", "gasLimit", "gas", "from", "to", "feeCap", "gasPremium", "strict", "data", "payload"])`.

the spec https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API doesn't specify anything about `nonce`. however, other platforms like go-ethereum/GoQuorum ignore if that argument is sent. This is useful when using Web3j Transaction request factory methods to build the Transaction object (code https://github.com/web3j/web3j/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/web3j/protocol/core/methods/request/Transaction.java), as we can re-use the same Transaction object to estimate and send. Having the error from Besu means that we need to build the transaction twice.

Would it make sense for Besu to do the same behaviour as Get/GoQuorum? ofc, other option is also create a change on Web3j to force the nonce as optional and/or allow to easily deep copy a transaction object. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 16:00:02 GMT):<br/>
`eth_call` has a 'strict' option.  This is something I think we should add to `eth_estimateGas` and add ignoring nonce checking to the non-strict checks. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#eth_call
</p>
<p><strong>ricardo.silva</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 08:59:06 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon and would you say that the option should be default `strict` or non-strict?
</p>
<p><strong>ricardo.silva</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 09:05:16 GMT):<br/>
also, here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Objects/#transaction-call-object it mentions that the object for `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas` already has a `strict` option. so what `eth_estimateGas` does with the struct param at the moment?

eth_estimateGas should do the same validations, which right now is just skipping the balance check.  The bug would be to add nonce checking to the strivt-only checks.

Bumping this message here. Does anyone have thoughts on the necessity of documenting metrics?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 17:21:37 GMT):<br/>
Absolutely. I would even want to standardize them.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:28:06 GMT):<br/>
all 4 of them?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:29:47 GMT):<br/>
are there any Besu metrics that are private network specific that would be worth putting out as well?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:33:47 GMT):<br/>
Those are the only standardized metrics.  The EIP review process bordered on punitive (one prolific contributor couldn't restrain himself) so Adrian didn't push for any more.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:51:32 GMT):<br/>
to be clear - I would not standardize in EIPs. I would standardize with the EEA.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 20:48:10 GMT):<br/>
You should start from those four then.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 16 Apr 2021 00:08:05 GMT):<br/>
Right, I appreciate the pointer!

The only difference I can see at CI level is that we have Docker hub credentials passed as env in Consensys Circle CI config but not on besu-doc. But I'm not usre it's about docker here, seems more related to Git or NPM.
Also when running `git ls-remote ssh://git@github.com/stevenvachon/chai-subset.git` locally it works fine, so why is this command returning an error on CI? :thinking:

If you enable metrics on Besu, then you can view the available list (with descriptions) at http://<host>:<metricsPort>/metrics. For example http://localhost:9545/metrics.

If this is the full list, could we perhaps point users to this? Or could we improve this page (it's not very reader friendly)? Unfortunately Besu will need to be running first.

Hi. As part of the work of privacy interoperability with Quorum, I have created this PR that runs the Quorum Acceptance tests against Besu. It's added on this PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2122

at the moment, even if the tests are failing, the job will result in success (I'm ignoring the result). I suggested to merge as it is as then we can work on the fixes in small chunks (on PRs) instead of work on top of this PR.
when all issues are solved, we can remove the line that makes the job succeed.

do you agree with this approach? thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:33:27 GMT):<br/>
I think it would be good to get this PR merged sooner rather than later. It does add an extra step to the end of the build process (~8min) so will extend build times.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:36:16 GMT):<br/>
Given it runs in parallel with acceptanceTests it shouldn't affect build times.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:37:07 GMT):<br/>
Sorry I misread, it's the one chained after buildDocker.  My suggestion would be to make buildDocker not depend on unitTests to avoid extending the build times.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:37:46 GMT):<br/>
But otherwise I agree getting it merged in smaller steps makes a lot of sense.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:39:34 GMT):<br/>
Ok if it makes sense to make buildDocker run parallel to the tests
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:40:02 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, as long as we don't publish until we see all tests passing I don't see any reason to delay building the docker image and getting started on the quorum tests.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:48:04 GMT):<br/>
ok fair enough - when does publish happen? it's not part of the buildDocker step?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:49:00 GMT):<br/>
It's done as part of the publishDocker step which doesn't run on PRs at all.  It already depends on unitTests explicitly anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:49:11 GMT):<br/>
got it
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:50:08 GMT):<br/>
We should add acceptanceTestsQuorum to the list of tasks to wait for before publishing at some point as well. Possibly now or just when we make it actually fail.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:52:58 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors?msg=fMhg4rS5bYW7fsDFy) Renaming the git branch master to main you mean?  I thought I read somewhere that github could do it in a way that supported redirects so it should be pretty seamless.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:35:34 GMT):<br/>
It redirects URLs but not `git pull` so not seamless.  It does provide instructions for updating your local checkout though. https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/renaming-a-branch
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:56:19 GMT):<br/>
So the main issue is that going master->main is a TSC directive because of D&I stuff.  It needs to happen by the end of Q2.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 15:52:59 GMT):<br/>
as long as a new branch isn't created with the same name, it does a fixup on the backend.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 15:53:46 GMT):<br/>
I would go here: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/branches and edit the branch name directly.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 15:54:28 GMT):<br/>
If you can't do it due to permissions, I will do it once you tell me to.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:24:28 GMT):<br/>
We also need to tweak some of the CI automation.  And for a little bit until CI settles we may need both. And check branch protection rules tied to master.

<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 16:54:13 GMT):<br/>
Ahoy there, I'm looking to further extend besu in a couple of areas, namely adding/modifying the behaviour of some json-rpc endpoints. In and of itself this shouldn't cause any problems, just implement `JsonRpcMethod` and provide a way to register it via the plugin. The problems start when you want to do something vaguely interesting on the endpoint, let's say you wanted to override `eth_getTransactionCount` to have an optional to parameter you would need to get hold of an instance to `BlockchainQueries`. To do this we add something into the `PluginContext` via `addService` maybe a class with a bunch of things we deem acceptable? But it feels a bit messy, open to ideas.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 17:03:38 GMT):<br/>
That was the design path I was going down.  But we wouldn't expose all of the Besu internals, just specific services.  BlockchainQueries is somehting I would push against becoming an API.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 17:05:07 GMT):<br/>
Rather, I would prefer an in-process call to other exposed endpoints.  Possibly directly through a service, where the service corresponds to standardized eth endpoints. That should get most of what want from BlockchainQueries
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 17:10:34 GMT):<br/>
I once had arbitrary RPCs prototyped, but that must have been pre-hyperledger.  I'll have to check my old machine to see if I still have it.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 17:11:37 GMT):<br/>
I was working on how to interact with the CLI flags to turn RPCs on and off, interacting with the built in RPCs.  But then Hyperledger integration became my top task.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 17:34:02 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I guess you lose control with what you expose at that point. What do you think would be needed for the example above? Just`WorldStateArchive` I guess?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 18:17:35 GMT):<br/>
Whatever you use has to be through the `plugin-api` module.  WorldStateArchive isn't a good candidate for that keyhole.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 18:20:23 GMT):<br/>
PoAQueryService may be the model you need.

Flaky tests update: 3 changes in Besu which address the causes of recent instability: 
1. install `haveged` on AT executor. 
2. set the property `securerandom.source=file:/dev/urandom` explicitly for ATs
3. disable ATs for SECP256R1 because there is a static reference to the signature algorithm in KeyPairUtil so this needs some refactoring to handle multiple algos

<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 17 May 2021 10:14:08 GMT):<br/>
Hi Besu contributors - I have a question for discussion:
As a PM and non-code contributor (responding to community questions, attending office hours, adding documentation, triaging issues and improving scoping detail on them), I'd like to get write access so I can be even more useful - particularly because this is required to manage Besu tickets in Zenhub. 
It doesn't look like I will be able to achieve this under the current maintainer rules. 
Is there any appetite to more formally recognise non-code contributions? As an example of a system for qualifying them - here's Kubernetes' non-code contributor guide: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/non-code-contributions.md

Just my opinion on Circle CI vs Github Actions:
- migration will require work (rewrite all workflow to GHActions, use new images, find actions to replace Circle Orbs,...)
- we should move doc CI to Github CI too if we move the code repos -> consistent contrib UX.
- I see the pros: enables contributors outside of HL to run CI. No need to pay. Slightly more flexible and modern tooling. Any others?
- what will be the cons of this? What about centralisation in Github?
- how is it compatible with DCO? (I don't see any reason why not, but as DCO always finds a way to make things complicated, we'd better check)

I thought "Triage" level access allowed Github issues editing?  IIRC that doesn't require maintainer level access since you can't merge PRs.  I also think @ryjones needs to invite you to the Hyperledger org before we can add that.

yup. git me a GitHub username to invite

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 17 May 2021 15:31:50 GMT):<br/>
Is this just a zenhub issue?  [Github permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#repository-access-for-each-permission-level) say triage has "Close, reopen, and assign all issues and pull requests"
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 17 May 2021 15:32:30 GMT):<br/>
Also, "Apply Labels," but not "create, edit delete labels"
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 17 May 2021 15:34:43 GMT):<br/>
My guess is that ZenHub doesn't support the (relatively) new Triage permissions

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 May 2021 18:12:14 GMT):<br/>
bad programming?  we should only have the master branch and quarterly release branches on the main hyperledger repo.  If there's another branch breaking things for people I can delete it.
</p>

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 May 2021 18:15:39 GMT):<br/>
If so HLP has a "Real Name" policy that DCO is enforcing,  A force push can fix it.

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 11:13:48 GMT):<br/>
I totally agree for a PR to update maintainers entry conditions to enable non code contributors who helped the project. @SajidaZ and @VijayMichalik are clearly good candidates and we need them for this project to suceed.

@shemnon That's what we were thinking. It felt like it was better to have it there than in our of our individual forks for discovery purposes
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 20:54:45 GMT):<br/>
it might be worth dropping the branch and renaming it to 'the merge' after we fix any DCO issues
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 20:54:51 GMT):<br/>
since rayonism is "done"

@SajidaZ  just pointed out this thread.  those two PRs are addressing pending transaction ordering for 1559.

<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 04:32:28 GMT):<br/>
2292 implements an idea from one of the openethereum devs: https://gist.github.com/sunce86/7755a6360ef4885146163c218df29ccb
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 04:33:51 GMT):<br/>
2296 is mostly about trying to clean up what has become pretty unwieldy and tightly coupled code.  we actually merged 2292 in the 21.1.6 release, and I am working on adapting that implementation into the interface in 2296.

@atoulme I will definitely take you up on your offer to review :)

Should we update the rules to become a maintainer first? It would be a simple PR on MAINTAINERS.md to add non code maintainers with explicit criteria.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 09:00:06 GMT):<br/>
Note: I'm for having @SajidaZ and @VijayMichalik join the band, it's only that I don't want anyone to request maintainership because they just answered a question on RC and be frustrated or annoyed because we refuse... So we need to have objectively enforceable rules.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 09:03:44 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon Contributors are not a specific status in this doc, it's just someone who can create a PR or help in the wiki. Here we really need them, for technical reasons, to be maintainers to be able to handle issues properly.

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 15:23:38 GMT):<br/>
My point of view on this whole thing is this: the project should greedily feel ok to accept contributors as it best serves its interests. Do not worry about the next time or the precedent - the real danger would be if there's no next time.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 15:31:22 GMT):<br/>
As a TSC member I need to advocate for precedent and process.  Without it we are just a bunch of github repos.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 15:32:21 GMT):<br/>
resolving #2307 before #2303 and #2304 is the course of action that will keep other TSC members uninterested.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:52:29 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 21 May 2021 08:54:41 GMT):<br/>
I explicitly made #2303 and #2304 dependent of #2307 for being merged so there's no doubt about the process.

But please continue to cast your vote (approve PR) so as soon as we reach the approval (either way) we can merge. The sooner the better as we really need @SajidaZ and @VijayMichalik to be fully empowered to help.

How does one go about having a new Besu release out around here? I'd like to make sure we get one out for Magneto soonish.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:29:16 GMT):<br/>
It looks like this old release schedule has been abandoned since I left: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Future+Release+Dates
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:31:05 GMT):<br/>
If one of the Chupacabras can give us the release checklist from GAR-e ( @rai @matkt @GarySchulte @SajidaZ ) it can be pushed manually instead of by the GAR-e tool they use.  It takes two maintainers to release: one to make the PRs and one to approve and submit.  CircleCI does most of the rest of it.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:31:22 GMT):<br/>
There was a release last week so if they are still on 2 week schedule there should be one next week.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:32:00 GMT):<br/>
no idea what GAR-e tool is?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:32:21 GMT):<br/>
ConsenSys has some canaries they would want to update and then possibly some twitter pushes.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:32:33 GMT):<br/>
this might be a good enhancement. I'd like anyone on the project to be able to issue release candidates.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:32:50 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise, in effect we depend on one of the participants.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:36:52 GMT):<br/>
I watched Rai do the last deployment, and my takeaway was that the deployment process revolved around 
* tagging/branching PRs
* waiting for builds
* pushing a release to github and to homebrew
* updating canaries

I think I can get the checklist from GAR-e, but I am not sure how applicable the checklist is going to be for Magneto.  

Are there separate binaries/releases we use for etc?  TBH, when @atoulme mentioned ETC on the contributor call that was the first I had heard that besu was seeing use on classic
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:37:53 GMT):<br/>
no special binaries
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:38:00 GMT):<br/>
just different flags
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:38:23 GMT):<br/>
cool, so would the release candidate process we are about to begin suffice for magneto?
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:38:35 GMT):<br/>
let me dig up the exact dates
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:38:38 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 22:33:56 GMT):<br/>
RC would be on-brand for testnet releases.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 22:41:47 GMT):<br/>
Maybe a rephrase then. How does one go about making a release candidate?
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 19:47:18 GMT):<br/>
sorry for the slow reply here, the current release candidate schedule is:
*  first testnet release of Besu is 21.1.7, May 28	
* 21.7 RC 1 includes mainnet support, June 8
* 21.7 RC 2 June 22
* 21.7.0 mainnet ready release, July 6
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 19:49:16 GMT):<br/>
as far as what is involved in a release candidate, the primary difference to a normal release is the creation of a release candidate branch that the release is cut from
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 19:50:27 GMT):<br/>
seems we also do customer communications for major releases that point release and RC releases do not have
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 20:44:55 GMT):<br/>
ok I'll catch that RC

Hi all, just a PSA here that ConsenSys has merged all Orion functionality into Tessera, which works as a drop-in replacement, so we're entering a deprecation cycle for Orion which will last 6 months to November 30th, 2021.

<p><strong>rai</strong> (Mon, 31 May 2021 13:41:59 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for the inconsistency! We didn't sufficiently decentralize the release before abdel went on parental leave. With gary recently becoming a maintainer that meant that if either Karim and I had to take leave then we didn't have the reviews to release.

Now the inconsistency is more to accommodate last minute changes to London and lining things up with the testnets :sweat_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Mon, 31 May 2021 13:42:38 GMT):<br/>
We're gonna be doing a housekeeping sprint soon that will include a bunch of release-related improvements
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 31 May 2021 16:45:13 GMT):<br/>
Any maintainer could have approved the release PRs.  The next time this occurs ping Antoine or myself and I think we can make it happen.  Or any of the Aussie maintainers.
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Mon, 31 May 2021 16:48:31 GMT):<br/>

Hi Vijay, I'm a software engineer with more than 15 years of experience working on different projects for the Chilean financial market, I have advanced skills on JAVA mainly, I've worked with the most common enterprise application stacks from Oracle, IBM, and JBoss, as also with the main frameworks for implement integration solutions for mission-critical software. Last years I have been playing the Software Architect role and now I'm involved in some PoCs related to dlt technologies, so I'm very interested on get more involved to get deeper learning and understanding of the technology. Leave you my LinkedIn profile to look for further detail on my experience if you want.

Also, who has the task to write the quarterly report? (like this -  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TSC/2021+Q1+Hyperledger+Besu).  I'm too far out of the loop to write it this quarter.  It's due this week.

Here's the updated Wiki for today's contributor call:
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/2021-06-21+Besu+Contributor+Call

*We're going to cover:* 
- QBFT Update 
- PKI Update 
- London Hard Fork + Besu Release Update 

Does anyone have anything to add? 

Thinking @shemnon we can chat through Q2 report as well!

Once the 21.7.0 release crazyness can we get a release checklist or an open version of GAR-e so non-ConsenSys maintainers can cut releases?

<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Thu, 08 Jul 2021 16:27:45 GMT):<br/>
Totally agree, this is something we need to do. I have digging into it in my backlog but not sure when I'll get to it - will go hunt around for some other volunteers though!

Still updating nodes and launching syncs but yes. I realized there's no step clearly announcing this because the branch gets deleted.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 08 Jul 2021 19:58:41 GMT):<br/>
For a non-main branch I wonder if we even need to announce the build.

Hi team!
I updated the besu-doc repos, now default branch is `main`. I updated also ReadTheDocs configuration and CI.
Update the contributing doc is in progress.
If you notice any issue due to this change, please tell me.
Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Mon, 02 Aug 2021 15:43:30 GMT):<br/>
NOTE: it will require that you rename your forks default branch to `main` too. You should have an alert that we renamed when you go on your fork in the Github website. You may experience error if you try to fetch or pull without renaming.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Mon, 02 Aug 2021 15:59:15 GMT):<br/>
I updated the wiki, mostly in the doc contribution sections, so please feel free to update to "main" if you see any remaining "master".
Thanks.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 19:34:34 GMT):<br/>
The `besu`, `besu-docs`, and `besu-native` repos have all flipped from using the `master` branch as the default branch to using the `main` branch as the default branch.  To keep up with these changes 

(a) rename the default branch in your forked repositories to `main`.  Github will provide reminders when you navigate to your repos.
(b) update your working copies to use `main`.  This script will work for remotes named `origin`
```
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```

@shemnon re: libnss, For rosetta it is easiest to use the x86 homebrew. (it installs in /usr/local/homebrew, whereas the m1 homebrew is /opt/homebrew)

once you have x86 homebrew installed, you can:
```arch --X86_64 /usr/local/homebrew/bin/brew install nss```

PR to plumb GasLimitCalculator into ProtocolSchedule, so we can remove 1559-specific logic from GasLimitRangeAndDeltaValidationRule and AbstractBlockCreator.  This has been a bit of a chore to re-plumb, but I am ok with the result.  I am sure this breaks myriad tests and mocks, so I'd appreciate any feedback before I put a bunch of work in on that:

<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Tue, 17 Aug 2021 10:11:13 GMT):<br/>
congrats to @antonydenyer, our newest maintainer!
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Tue, 17 Aug 2021 10:12:39 GMT):<br/>
if anyone has the rights to add him to the maintainers github group, please can you do so? thanks!

how is the governance of the besu maintainers github user list supposed to work? I'm seeing this sub-list which contains a mix of people who are not all super engaged here right now -> 
https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/besu-maintainers/members?query=role%3Amaintainer
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Aug 2021 13:35:32 GMT):<br/>
First we need to have @ryjones send `antonydenyer` an invite to the Hyperledger organization, once Antony accepts the invite he can be aded to the group.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Aug 2021 13:40:22 GMT):<br/>
Also a heads up, about the first week of September I will be proposing another round of maintainer inactivity cleanup.  I'll be using the Linux Foundation Insights too to guide this, so if everyone could go to https://myprofile.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/edit/profile and update their current organization that would make the stats cleaner.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Aug 2021 14:16:25 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 17 Aug 2021 15:25:10 GMT):<br/>
also means right now I can't update Tuweni on 17, and neither can Besu probably
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 17 Aug 2021 15:25:25 GMT):<br/>
maybe there's a beta version of gradle to try, didn't have time to dig in

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Aug 2021 23:22:57 GMT):<br/>
@lucassaldanha @macfarla Here's my proposed solution to pull the privacy data out of the EVM code: add a notion of "context variables" that can be set/removed from the message frame and used by precompiled contracts.  The mainnet and privacy transaction processor push the privacy metadata handler and data into the context and the precompiles pull the data out.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:50:59 GMT):<br/>
I'm contemplating ripping out the EIP-1702 plumbing (account versioning) that was put in place for Istanbul (it was in before it was out).  I don't think we will be going do that for mainnet and there were no differences for enterprise chains.  Most importantly there was no way to trigger it's use.  Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 16:35:09 GMT):<br/>
Here's what it would look like. https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2657 @atoulme @macfarla @lucassaldanha

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 00:53:04 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon rationale to move to Tuweni Wei? Do you want to move to Tuweni Gas too? Just trying to understand how that works.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 00:53:28 GMT):<br/>
Very likely the Gas class of Tuweni is too crass for the use case
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 02:41:32 GMT):<br/>
Re: Wei... trying not to duplicate too many classes. I may just factor it out completely, not sure.  It's only _needed_ for the call operations, which has a cascading impact in the world state updater.  May just use a UInt256.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 02:42:20 GMT):<br/>
But it does have an embedded "unit" which makes type checking easier.  I may just copy it into the EVM as it's fairly lightweight, the type is the main value add.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 04:26:21 GMT):<br/>
ok no strong opinions there
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 04:26:52 GMT):<br/>
FWIW I managed to sync up besu to puxi to the latest block, so EIP-3074 works on my branch right now.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 06:03:01 GMT):<br/>
LGTM
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:13:37 GMT):<br/>
@atoulme - I clarified with Rai about eth/64 support.   He did not disable as part of the clean-up: 
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2278

IDK why I had that impression
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:32:15 GMT):<br/>
no worries
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:34:23 GMT):<br/>
and that said - it would be totally ok to have a flag to run besu with eth/66 only, come to think of it
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:34:29 GMT):<br/>
It would help with testing.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:42:50 GMT):<br/>
Should be a simple operation, once the CLI flag is plumed down to the right place just only add ETH/66 to the capabilities.  Plumbing the flag down is the real work.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:45:29 GMT):<br/>
I got some comments about the Docs to my `TransactionGasCalculator` PR, but any about the content?  If not can I get an approval? https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2659
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:08:27 GMT):<br/>
I need to get hold besu config from within a plugin. Thinking of wiring up a `ConfigQueryService`? The other option is to get rid of the validation in `PicoCLIOptionsImpl` so that in the plugin you could specify args that you are interested in. Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:10:39 GMT):<br/>
What flags in particular are you looking for? Making a generic flag searching service concerns me a bit.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:11:45 GMT):<br/>
`-rpc-http-port` etc
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:11:45 GMT):<br/>
`--rpc-http-port` etc
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:12:33 GMT):<br/>
I want to call back into besu using rpc
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:13:03 GMT):<br/>
But also want to make sure it's enabled on startup
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:15:56 GMT):<br/>
Which call?  Two things (A) I would rather create a RPCSercvice that provides that config, and would be where adding RPCs would happen.  There could also be hooks to determine if it's currently up
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:16:19 GMT):<br/>
and (b) Wouldn't it make more sense to do the call directly?  Even if we have to expose a new Service interface?
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:21:01 GMT):<br/>
Hang on, I think we're getting wires crossed. In the plugin I want to use web3j so I can leverage all the existing tooling, but need to know if json rpc is running, if it's https. on what port and if the api is enabled that I want to use.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:23:10 GMT):<br/>
If you mean `RPCConfigService` that just returns the config then I'm up for that :smile: but figured whilst I was there I'd expose all the args.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:23:10 GMT):<br/>
If you mean `RPCService` is something that just returns the config then I'm up for that :smile: but figured whilst I was there I'd expose all the args.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:44:09 GMT):<br/>
I don't think having a plugin call it's own process via the network port is a good design pattern.  If web3j tooling is key it sounds like a microservice design pattern.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:44:49 GMT):<br/>
But yes, I would have RPCService report the RPC configurations, but not edit them.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:45:35 GMT):<br/>
100% not edit them - was going to be read only
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 19:48:07 GMT):<br/>
the alternative to using jsonrpc is to basically re-implement all the jsonrpc endpoints with methods calls and expose them to the plugin via a service. Whilst this would get you half way there you'd still need to do all the other business with serialization etc I could be wrong, but I think calling back in over jsonrpc is the best option.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 20:00:52 GMT):<br/>
Something that complex sounds like a microservice.  If you need something from the plugin APIs not in the RPC then the plugin could just be the piece that sends data to the microservice.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 20:01:31 GMT):<br/>
Assuming it's a triggerede action and not something on a timer.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 02:37:18 GMT):<br/>
If I remember correctly we write the ports used by Besu during startup in a file somewhere. Maybe it could be useful?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 05:30:53 GMT):<br/>
that looks like you're trying to do too much. Do you mean to make this a k8s deployment down the road? A helm chart can paper over this stuff
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 06:14:50 GMT):<br/>
Writing a custom onchain permissioning implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 06:16:36 GMT):<br/>
permissioning -> plugin -> query bespoke contract -> true/false
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 09:33:16 GMT):<br/>
This is what I had in mind https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2661/files
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:28:26 GMT):<br/>
yeah, that's hard to make elegant
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:29:35 GMT):<br/>
so in the tooling you want to use web3j, and therefore that's why you need access to http
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:30:02 GMT):<br/>
so having some sort of native jsonrpc server would serve you way better
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:30:49 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:31:17 GMT):<br/>
I mean, ok that sounds doable to me
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:31:31 GMT):<br/>
I might be way off but it might be easier to do that than anything else
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:32:08 GMT):<br/>
if you torture your code to use http you introduce inherent messes, if it's inside the same process. You'd need to architecture out a different way and not use a plugin as much
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:32:33 GMT):<br/>
either it's integrated or it's not :)
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:33:03 GMT):<br/>
how would web3j provide an interface for a provider?
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:37:49 GMT):<br/>
|>  if it's inside the same process
that's the beauty - it's in a different thread
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:38:50 GMT):<br/>
I mean, not to rail here, but you're going to call your own process over http and incur the cost of json marshalling/unmarshalling?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:38:56 GMT):<br/>
That's bonkers to me.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:39:27 GMT):<br/>
yeah it's not ideal ... but
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:39:55 GMT):<br/>
it's standards compliant and has a bunch of tooling available and requires no extra stuff in besu
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:40:29 GMT):<br/>
no, but hear me out, that struggle is real
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:40:42 GMT):<br/>
~requires no extra stuff in besu~ or more importantly less stuff to maintain
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:40:47 GMT):<br/>
if you open up http just for internals, then you _require_ http to be opened. You also require methods to be opened.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:41:08 GMT):<br/>
true
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:41:21 GMT):<br/>
And then when you go to deploy, you'll find yourself in a pickle because you're opening up potentially internal stuff you wouldn't want to expose
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:41:27 GMT):<br/>
let me go with an example
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:41:42 GMT):<br/>
we have a tool ethlogger that we use to ingest data from evm chains over json-rpc
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:41:48 GMT):<br/>
it likes to get the admin methods
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:42:15 GMT):<br/>
but we found out the hard way we can't just open this for ethlogger. If we do that, then jsonrpc cannot be opened to the rest of the world.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:42:26 GMT):<br/>
Kinda same quandary for you here
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:42:50 GMT):<br/>
In our case, we set out to introduce a jsonrpc proxy in front of geth to do caching and filtering
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:43:05 GMT):<br/>
but now we're running even more software lol
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:43:22 GMT):<br/>
anyway, maybe this is fine for now
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:43:34 GMT):<br/>
yeah - there's some responsibility on the node operator to know not to expose the ports to the world only internally
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:44:52 GMT):<br/>
yeah you think they know?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:45:11 GMT):<br/>
it's difficult to filter based on request payload
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:45:23 GMT):<br/>
they will eventually :laughing:
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:45:48 GMT):<br/>
I don't want to be there for that, or when they find this chat
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:47:17 GMT):<br/>
the first lot obviously know - it's the people after the people after!
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:48:17 GMT):<br/>
the other option would be ipc ... but no ipc sockets in besu :disappointed:
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:48:32 GMT):<br/>
it's a PR away you know
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:48:44 GMT):<br/>

I think it's a bad idea.  CLI flags provide no context as to their meaning and if we have plugins that depend on certain flags we restrict our future ability to evolve the CLI options in any way.  There are too many layers of organization that are blurred in this method.  Plugins should not care what other systems CLI options are, it's bad design.

<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 13:09:28 GMT):<br/>

yeah I'm not familiar enough as to whether the plugin data access covers enough right now that you could implement a Web3jService with it
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 13:55:30 GMT):<br/>
or if that requires additional access
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 13:55:56 GMT):<br/>
ideally your plugin is implementing Web3jService, and Besu offers enough primitives it's a breeze

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 20 Aug 2021 23:19:40 GMT):<br/>
But unfortunately, our RPC implementation isnt' really making a good use of the eventbus, so maybe it isn't that trivial.

hey everyone, I'm seeing some internet noise about another Ethereum client developer behavior making the rounds because they are critical, blunt and even could be misconstrued as aggressive. Their message seems worthwhile, but the conveying is a bit harsh. Note I lost interest and didn't read all of it, maybe a better analysis can come along in time.

I wanted to state that I enjoy working with you all as professionals. I am also reassured that we as committers have a code of conduct to address this kind of behavior. Let's just keep grinding.

Just thought of this, and I don't have the code handy to inspect.  If an enterprise network goes to the london hard fork must they take 1559 with them?  And the base fee floor of 7wei?  Are there configs that can be flipped to ensure block sizes never go into "too full" mode and up the base fee?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors?msg=AYtSutzXCqtWKFMX2) Following up on this. We have fixed the issue and it will require a new release of besu-native (0.4.2). I'll update Besu later on with the new version of the library.
</p>

Is there a reason besu-ntive-ec is a consensys repo rather than a hyperledger repo? I'm not seeing any consensys specific tweaks. Is it just because consensys repos are quicker to spin up?

@here Hyperledger will be moving off of rocket chat onto matrix chat sometime in the next quarter or three. To allow us to migrate earlier than the forced migration I asked RyJones to make a contributor room for us - https://matrix.to/#/#hyperledger-besu-contributors:chat.lfx.linuxfoundation.org
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 23 Aug 2021 20:03:15 GMT):<br/>
Matrix allows multiple clients to access the chat service.  I myself use Element on the desktop and my mobile devices.  There are others but I'm not sure which ones are good.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 23 Aug 2021 23:22:39 GMT):<br/>
It is easier to spin up. AFAIK there is no reason for not migrating it to HL later on. I'll send a msg to Csy strategy about this.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 23 Aug 2021 23:24:41 GMT):<br/>
Should we add this to the next contributor call? If we can come up with a date for the migration, we can start communicating.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 23 Aug 2021 23:24:59 GMT):<br/>
Also, we should probably have a channel for "non-contributor" as well.

hey all, I played with besu storage to get better performance, and I would like to benchmark. What's a good use case? Syncing? Or something else? What are good performance markers - CPU/RAM used and how long? Is that documented somewherte?
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:23:19 GMT):<br/>
A full archive sync is probably best, we did that for the Bonsai trie testing.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:23:48 GMT):<br/>
CPU over time is probably more useful than RAM.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:24:16 GMT):<br/>
CPU spend on GC is a better indicator than RAM itself.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:25:12 GMT):<br/>
:thinking:
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:26:10 GMT):<br/>
after that, perhaps RPC performance... though thats gonna ask more questions than it answers
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:48:09 GMT):<br/>
And there's two sync modes to consier: fast and full.  For full sync you will want to benchmark the latter part of a test network full sync, when there are actual TSes on the blocks.  early blocks of most testnets are quite sparse.

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 14:13:35 GMT):<br/>
yeah but if you sync in the wild, your network can crap out, your peers go away, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 14:14:03 GMT):<br/>
I will probably create a scenario with 2 nodes on a local network with explicit sync 1:1 with a static peer.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 14:15:21 GMT):<br/>
has anyone made archives of goerli nodes? I have a couple mainnet nodes here, looking to get a goerli node, but it's been hell to get good peers.

</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 14:47:43 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to nudge us to upgrade the other enterprise features to support eip1559 type transactions since we want to stay compatible with as much external tooling as possible, and particularly for gas-enabled private networks

<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 14:50:39 GMT):<br/>

Hey folks! Hyperledger staff has asked the Hyperledger Besu team to participate in Grace Hopper's Open Source Day on October 1st. It is a great opportunity to showcase Hyperledger Besu and get new developers working on our codebase. To prep for this event, Besu needs to have 30+ good first issues labeled in the project. Besu currently has 14 good first issues opened. Can this group work together to add any additional good first issues in the coming weeks? We need the 30 to be uploaded by September 15th. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 17:23:56 GMT):<br/>
yeah, london == 1559.  there are no flags to disable 1559 fee market mechanism, it is all driven by protocolSchedule.  

What would an enterprise network stand to gain from enabling london, but not the fee market mechanism?  AFAICT a 1559 transaction is essentially an ACCESS_LIST transaction with base fee/tip instead of gasPrice
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 17:28:42 GMT):<br/>
it seems like it would not be terribly difficult to implement a flag for static baseFee mechanism if we were worried about tooling dropping feature support for legacy transactions
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 17:32:04 GMT):<br/>
I think it could be as simple as adjusting max change denominator slack coefficient, and initial base fee to values that cause the basefee computation to always arrive at the same number, see LondonFeeMarket
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:13:26 GMT):<br/>
For zero fee networks I think they want to make sure that the basefee stays at zero.  i.e. no levering up if the blocks goes > 50% full.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:13:49 GMT):<br/>
So if the basefee growth % could be set to zero that should address it.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:15:15 GMT):<br/>
I think if initial basefee = 0, then the arithmetic would prevent it from ever changing.  would have to verify that though
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:15:58 GMT):<br/>
there might be some divide by zero concerns.  but generally speaking I think tweaking those constants would work

Do we package the native libs with Besu during assembly?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 12:52:03 GMT):<br/>
We should.  `besu-native` packages them up into the jar that it builds, and we consume that jar.  The privacy and testing have, however, created a dependency on non-packaged jars.  Namely libSodium and nss.  Those should be better documented as I _still_ can't get `nss` dependent tests running on an intel or m1 mac.  `brew install nss` doesn't put the libs in a place the JCE wants to see it.

It's something bouncy castle is doing...  *all* normalized points are subject to random blinding.  https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/commit/87ab5d8470829879219e50213912bab6b1ab8fe8

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:29:48 GMT):<br/>
Because of some security vulnerability report.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:30:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I am not saying BC is wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:30:15 GMT):<br/>
FWIW I am now trying to use /dev/urandom to get by.

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:32:01 GMT):<br/>
looks like we could override their secure random maybe
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:32:07 GMT):<br/>
I spent zero time looking at BC
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:32:21 GMT):<br/>
and was more focused on why we do this weird signature recovery when we're signing
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:32:40 GMT):<br/>
looking at that trace
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:34:00 GMT):<br/>
We want to sign something with a node key:
	at org.hyperledger.besu.crypto.NodeKey.sign(NodeKey.java:34)
which makes us normalize the signature 
       at org.hyperledger.besu.crypto.AbstractSECP256.normaliseSignature(AbstractSECP256.java:109)
which triggers a recover? 
      at org.hyperledger.besu.crypto.AbstractSECP256.recoverFromSignature(AbstractSECP256.java:303)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:34:33 GMT):<br/>
Signing would trigger the blinding.  It's the most important place to blind TBH
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:34:41 GMT):<br/>
recover must be how they do it.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:36:13 GMT):<br/>
Is this R1?  Because K1 should be native.  That code is tight and awesome. One thing we can easly credit bitcoin for.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:36:22 GMT):<br/>
no, we normalize the signature, and that makes us go for a a recovery
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:37:06 GMT):<br/>
ah, now I'm confused.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:38:47 GMT):<br/>
yeah this is the exact same code that was here: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/20.10.3/crypto/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/crypto/SECP256K1.java#L270
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:39:10 GMT):<br/>
so the changes to move this code out to AbstractSECP256 didn't affect the logic.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:40:05 GMT):<br/>
When we introduced the AbstractSECP256 we tried to keep the same code to prevent mistakes
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:40:22 GMT):<br/>
yeah sorry. I'm barking at the wrong thing.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:40:31 GMT):<br/>
Question: you are using the default K1, aren't you?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:40:35 GMT):<br/>
yeh
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:40:48 GMT):<br/>
normalzie signature isn't using native facilities.  That's a performance regression.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:40:53 GMT):<br/>
And did you set anything to use BC instead of the native impl?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:41:10 GMT):<br/>
no I didn't set anything
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:41:11 GMT):<br/>
The code path for normalize never gets a native option.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:41:24 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:41:29 GMT):<br/>
ok that would explain it
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:41:51 GMT):<br/>
so maybe that's a worthwhile improvement, run sig recovery with the native option
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:42:26 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon do you know if this is something that changed? Did we ever use the native option for normalize?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:42:44 GMT):<br/>
yes.  It was the R1 change that created new paths and didn't wire in K1 paths.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:42:49 GMT):<br/>
got it
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:43:23 GMT):<br/>
@atoulme I'll handle this if you want
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:43:30 GMT):<br/>
Unless you want to fix it :P
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:44:05 GMT):<br/>
`public SECPSignature normaliseSignature(
      final BigInteger nativeR,
      final BigInteger nativeS,
      final SECPPublicKey publicKey,
      final Bytes32 dataHash) {` does pure java recovery, and a very unelightend recovery forced mehtod.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:44:22 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:44:28 GMT):<br/>
it runs recovery up to 4 times
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:44:28 GMT):<br/>
Ethereum keys keep the sign bit so we don't need to do the 4x search
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:44:44 GMT):<br/>
:|
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:51:23 GMT):<br/>
It was actually this change that took the native path out... https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/commit/d6fabbda70d65ddac56bdda630a0e4b244cb2762#diff-7446961ea2f50a25525de78f67731cd449744cb25ed1feb026c7722013a68cdfR29
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:51:35 GMT):<br/>
normalzie never had a native path, but create did.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:53:47 GMT):<br/>
well ain't that an exciting possibility
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:54:05 GMT):<br/>
given how much time we spend signing stuff, that might help with performance ;)
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:54:37 GMT):<br/>
@lucassaldanha I can't commit to getting it done _soon_ but I definitely could use a fix.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:54:59 GMT):<br/>

Thanks for sharing! Completely understand, I'll make sure to follow up if you don't have bandwidth.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:58:03 GMT):<br/>
fwiw this might explain why we lose peers
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:58:12 GMT):<br/>
they might timeout on us while we're signing frames
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 01:00:02 GMT):<br/>
So, there never was a native normalize path.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 01:00:39 GMT):<br/>
my optimization pass was based on over-the-wire blocks, never looked into p2p stuff, so that's why that method slipped through./
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 01:01:20 GMT):<br/>
code should be there for a quick recover.  And the native code is blinded per process, so it shouldn't drain entrpy
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 01:03:58 GMT):<br/>
this is fun
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 01:04:18 GMT):<br/>
I am not sure why I had this pop up so much this time. I think it's because I have 2 besu processes on the machine.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 01:04:34 GMT):<br/>
The normalize is only used when signing in "non-native" mode, right?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 01:06:46 GMT):<br/>
btw, maybe we move this discussion into a thread?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 28 Aug 2021 12:48:41 GMT):<br/>
Maybe?  I don't know.  `calculateECDHKeyAgreement` is the target method and I am not sure how the bitcoin secp256k1 library supports that.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 28 Aug 2021 12:50:43 GMT):<br/>
That's at least a full day deep dive I don't have in my time budget at the moment.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 28 Aug 2021 12:58:11 GMT):<br/>
Keypair generation may also be a target.  `calculateECDHKeyAgreement` appears 6x on your stack and generateKeyPair appears 3x, so both should be done but key agreement will provide the bigger improvement.  There is a ECDH module but I didn't work too hard to make it work.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 28 Aug 2021 15:48:51 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 13:51:00 GMT):<br/>
for instance, why would a config option go in the unstable package as opposed to the stable one. how does one stabilize?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 14:12:42 GMT):<br/>
If a config option goes into the stable package it becomes an API and really cannot change it's semantics in less than 6 months time.  If it's in unstable it can change every release. So options transition from unstable to stable when we think the option won't change in any appreciable way for at least a year and that it will be relevant for years.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 14:13:33 GMT):<br/>
It's based off of Java's patterns, except that their timeframe was years and a decade.

Bringing this one back from the dead .... 

https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2704
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 16:17:20 GMT):<br/>
Dates look reasonable
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 15:54:11 GMT):<br/>
Would anyone here be interested in making Besu a clustered tech? Meaning we could have multiple Besu nodes with HA and possible specialization?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 15:58:01 GMT):<br/>
how would that differ from a microservices approach?  What would the clustering aproach look like?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 15:58:01 GMT):<br/>
how would that differ from a microservices approach?  What would the clustering approach look like?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:38:39 GMT):<br/>
it would not differ a whole lot. The clustering approach consists in using an existing technology, Infinispan, which can be configured to run as a single host or cluster with active-active participants.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:39:49 GMT):<br/>
Infinispan also has the immense advantage of wrapping up I/O access, and can write async and in batches if you're looking for the extra oomph when you sync. That's the stuff I've been testing and could not get clean numbers because my old local server has no entropy.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:41:05 GMT):<br/>
While I will buy newer hardware to test and get a real baseline number (sorry I really don't want to test this on cloud, I need a reproducible setup) I can tell you from anecdotal evidence that so far writes were just as fast with Infinispan involved. I didn't explore all the options yet.

Reads are even more interesting though.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:41:15 GMT):<br/>
I didn't get to test reads at this time.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:41:53 GMT):<br/>
Anyway, I have some crass changes in my fork under the infinispan branch, introducing a new storage engine with infinispan, right now configured to go to a rocksdb.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:42:38 GMT):<br/>
Infinispan can be a bit higher level and can cache java objects - the current interface wants key value stores to store and retrieve byte arrays, but infinispan can probably work at a higher level and deliver even more performance down the road.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:43:23 GMT):<br/>
During my testing, when entropy wasn't depleted, I noticed keccak256 was probably a good performance target at this time, and infinispan wasn't a perf bottleneck at this time when writing.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:43:54 GMT):<br/>
Anyway, I'm just sharing this as I go along. I am just trying to have fun with this :)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:47:35 GMT):<br/>
I think the real way to scope it out would be to share the branch we can see the scope of the change.  PLuggable backend DBs have been a dream of mine for a while.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:47:51 GMT):<br/>
ok the branch is out there
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:48:13 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/atoulme/besu/tree/infinispan
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:49:02 GMT):<br/>
here is the crucial place: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/compare/main...atoulme:infinispan?diff=split&expand=1#diff-e80050d20ec59df3859d1214613525bca8f99ccc21f9523c8cf614c6d48fcc06R70
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:49:17 GMT):<br/>
Now this turns into a very different exercise, because you trust Infinispan with persistence
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:49:28 GMT):<br/>
and Infinispan has a loong list of persistence options and clustering mechanisms
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:49:48 GMT):<br/>
and bear with me here. It can all be configured via XML. Which well isn't sexy at all. But it works.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:52:30 GMT):<br/>
so for example, if you can make it work for rocksdb, you could also choose to use a different store and swap them out https://infinispan.org/cache-store-implementations
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:52:40 GMT):<br/>
they support JDBC, MongoDB, Redis...
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:53:49 GMT):<br/>
the clustering happens over JGroups, which is super old now but just works. It's using UDP, there's discovery possible, you can do point to point replication, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:54:13 GMT):<br/>
The best part is Infinispan being somewhat mature, there's an operator manual, and proper resources to make it work.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:56:41 GMT):<br/>
how does performance measure at mainnet scale?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 19:55:24 GMT):<br/>
I don’t know. I’d need a baseline. I could cheat - use an Aurora backend for example, get all nodes using it.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 19:56:01 GMT):<br/>
Syncing on mainnet would not be a good perf baseline. What would a good comparison use case look like?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 20:02:16 GMT):<br/>
Time to get to sync and time for each block import at mainnet are what I was hoping for to compare.  Alternatives would be Goerli or an ETC chain.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 20:02:37 GMT):<br/>
But only mainnet has the sustained call volume to compare.
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 20:37:57 GMT):<br/>
@rjones just tagging you this to dig up a request from a couple of months back - can we get a besu-errorprone-checks repo to place some custom ones we've been using? per this PR https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2433 cc @usmansaleem
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 20:46:17 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors?msg=EbGoc9k6cZWA5Eu1K) would mainnet be a bad baseline because this is really a feature for enterprises?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 20:54:46 GMT):<br/>
I was trying to sync etc mainnet fwiw
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 20:55:43 GMT):<br/>
@RoboCopsGoneMad yeah, not sure if it's a feature for enterprise only, and I have no business having an opinion there, but Erigon is targeting mainnet with their own approach, not enterprise.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 20:56:00 GMT):<br/>
And maybe that's where we should start. Could we ask the community what they think?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 20:59:11 GMT):<br/>
Strategically (may not be my place to opine) I think appealing to enterprise node operators is better than going to battle with raw node count.  That's mutually assured destruction and not a "grow the pie" path. Focusing on a setup enterprises would want to run and not worrying about the "can it run on a RasPi4" crowd seems like a better tradeoff.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 21:07:47 GMT):<br/>
I very much like the notion that "the database is a _detail_ "
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 21:08:28 GMT):<br/>
could also come in handy when dealing with state expiry
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 21:24:54 GMT):<br/>
definitely not going for the RasPi4 discussion
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 21:25:23 GMT):<br/>
jGroups AFAICT is not gentle. You don't do active/active replication so easy.

<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Sun, 05 Sep 2021 18:05:16 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Sun, 05 Sep 2021 18:07:17 GMT):<br/>
at some point we expect the enterprises to be running on mainnet :slightly_smiling_face: 
but in general I think creating a baseline is easier with a shorter total sync cycle. so picking a testnet probably makes sense

Reposting this note. It looks like we're currently at 17 good first issues. It would be great to get 13 more. :)

_Hey folks! Hyperledger staff has asked the Hyperledger Besu team to participate in Grace Hopper's Open Source Day on October 1st. It is a great opportunity to showcase Hyperledger Besu and get new developers working on our codebase. To prep for this event, Besu needs to have 30+ good first issues labeled in the project. Besu currently has 14 good first issues opened. Can this group work together to add any additional good first issues in the coming weeks? We need the 30 to be uploaded by September 15th. Thanks!_

</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 08 Sep 2021 20:41:22 GMT):<br/>
TL/DR, the besu mainnet team at Consensys is looking at supporting (at least) flashbots post-merge, and we are starting to lay the architectural work for supporting multiple block proposal strategies.  Please weigh in with thoughts, ideas, criticisms.  We want to engage early since it will be a large change and possibly politically charged.

I'm looking at this https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/First+contribution and it seems to skip the first step where you see an issue that you want to work on and get it assigned to you. Have we documented this process anywhere? Is it just "reach out on RocketChat"?
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 08:40:26 GMT):<br/>
That's a great idea to add!
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 17:58:06 GMT):<br/>
Changelog looks a little sparse.  Are there anythings we need to document for the next release?  Maybe the ETC change to their protocol spec?  Anything else?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 18:21:19 GMT):<br/>
the ETC change is not merged, is it?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 18:47:30 GMT):<br/>
It should be before we do the build.  I consider it blocking for release.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 22:37:43 GMT):<br/>
Is there a reason we have `-V` rather than `-v` as the alias for `--version` in besu? All other CLI options are lower case
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 22:48:38 GMT):<br/>
`-v` usually means verbose
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 22:49:14 GMT):<br/>
And usually there is no short option for version-then-quit
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 22:52:29 GMT):<br/>
true. but `node -v` and `yarn -v` give version info

Some Besu source files have ` * Copyright Hyperledger Contributors.` or `* Copyright contributors to Hyperledger Besu` but most have `* Copyright ConsenSys AG.` - is one correct or is it ok to have a mix?

re the CI usage - we are investigating options. Looks like we might have to get rid of containerTests (third-party lib) which we're currently using to run Besu <> Tessera ATs - we've tried various things to make it more efficient but have run into dead ends
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Fri, 05 Nov 2021 01:38:53 GMT):<br/>
CI restricted context - community PRs have been getting "unauthorized" on unitTest step - I think it's the sonarCloud context. One way around this (this is what we do for the publishDocker step) is to run it only on main branch - but then we wouldn't get the report per PR. Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 05 Nov 2021 03:13:53 GMT):<br/>
We have issues with sonarcloud not running for non-writers ate Hedera.  Since SonarCloud is not gating it won't impact the approval.  However some of the issues are nice to see mid-process.

I had issues in the past with trying it as a separate step, when remounting the project, the previous build wasn't there because it had run in a different executor. You might want to test that this generates test coverage correctly.

homebrew wasn't updated.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 09 Nov 2021 15:57:32 GMT):<br/>
has anyone tried to upgrade us to latest version of vert.x? we are on 3.9.8 and latest is 4.2.1.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Nov 2021 16:13:44 GMT):<br/>
I'd be interested in homebrew usage stats. I know Fabric dropped support when the number of downloads was single digits per quarter
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 09 Nov 2021 16:35:07 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we have a way to distinguish from besu and github downloads.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 09 Nov 2021 16:38:25 GMT):<br/>
Judging by repo clones (not sure if that is first time users or upgraders) we are well above that. 35 unique cloners/month right now.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 09 Nov 2021 17:04:07 GMT):<br/>
I also think the overhead of maintaining besu's homebrew is much lower than fabric's.

upgrading to Vert.x 4 is gonna be non-trivial. i'm still gonna go for it, but if this spins out of control anymore I may ask for either a buddy to help, or to upgrade a submodule at a time incrementally, to avoid a long lived migration branch.
</p>

We are currently debugging some peering issues with Besu. In the process we realized that we don't have an easy way to recover the [ENR (Ethereum Node Record)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-778) of a Besu node. It can only be recovered in the log output, right after the start.

We were thinking to return the ENR via the API. Our first thought was to add it to the existing `admin_nodeInfo`. But other clients, like geth, have the same endpoint and existing tools could have troubles with the response, if there is an unexpected field in it.
So we were thinking about a new endpoint called `admin_enrInfo`, to use a naming pattern similar to node info.

What do you think? Any feedback is welcome.

Moving folks to Emeritus maintainers after at least a quarter of inactivity - do we normally reach out to them before moving them over? Is there a procedure?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 04:01:58 GMT):<br/>
There is no procedure.  It should be done more regularly.  Last year I published a proposed list and at-tagged those being moved.  Only two requested a reprieve that I granted.  I think the same thing can be done, post a provisional list and then wait a couple of weeks for reactions.

I'm somewhat skeptical the epoch based addresses will be a thing.  EIP-1559 was hard enough on the downstream tools and nearly blew up in a bad way.  This has a bigger impact (throw in the solidity complier to the mix and 20 byte assumptions) and the coordination costs go up exponentially.  Just my opinion however.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 12 Nov 2021 00:47:53 GMT):<br/>
I also have this nagging thought in the back of my head that verkle is the next casper.  Lots of hype but the first proofs of concept were regressions performance wise. The quicker a full-scale proof of concept happens the better.

Hello. Sorry for bothering you. I started working on Besu in Consensys and had to raise an issue on incubator-tuweni with the dns-discovery module. I also raised a PR that would resolve those issues for me (us) (https://github.com/apache/incubator-tuweni/issues/345). Would someone mind looking at it, or letting me know who might have a look at it? I heard that Mr. @atoulme could help me.

Hi all, I need the review of a gradle expert, for a inefficiency I found on the downloadLicenses task.
Basically I am not able to build my draft PR because the assemble step is always failing due to timeout https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hyperledger/besu?branch=pull%2F3065
and after some debugging I found that the license check is the culprit, and I think the current implementation of the plugin is inefficient, specially for project with many subproject, like Besu, and I submitted a possible fix here https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin/pull/203.
In the meantime we wait for a new release of the plugin, is there any workaround we can use to make the build work?
</p>
<p><strong>fab-10</strong> (Tue, 16 Nov 2021 11:57:47 GMT):<br/>
Worth to mention that with this fix the build time should decreases of at least 9 minutes
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 16 Nov 2021 16:22:05 GMT):<br/>
did something change recently to put us over the timeout?
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 16 Nov 2021 16:23:03 GMT):<br/>
there are plenty of previous runs that take 12-13 mins, and still complete... great find though.
</p>
<p><strong>fab-10</strong> (Tue, 16 Nov 2021 16:28:28 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors?msg=kvGLx8pScj8pPXAfs) I think that since I have added datatypes as dependency in the config subproject, that has raised the build time over the timeout of 10min, that indeed is already very high for this task
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Tue, 16 Nov 2021 18:00:26 GMT):<br/>
I am wondering, what is the procedure with releasing the library

Besu maintainers Admins - Looking at this list https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/besu-maintainers/members we are a bit light on Admins ie those with the Maintainer label.

i think this may have just drafted me into the quest to remove Orion from acceptance tests too
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 21:13:53 GMT):<br/>
Although a much bigger problem may be Tessera's dependence on testcontainers. If we go through with this swap of the OrionTestHarness for TesseraTestHarness, we now require a docker stack at unit test time, which seems like.... not what unit test means.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 21:20:26 GMT):<br/>
is there any reason we shouldn't use a Mock enclave from PrivacyReorgTest?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 21:35:36 GMT):<br/>
Docker tests at unit test time gets a soft no from me.  If we tie it in with a junit `assume` check for local dev and make sure it runs at full speed at checkin that would satisfy me.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 21:55:05 GMT):<br/>
even if we did that we'd have to make a docker stack available on the ci executor used for unit test
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 21:55:18 GMT):<br/>

@mbaxter tagging you in here - I know you're busy with your current project - you're currently one of 4 members with Admin access to the besu-maintainers github group (can add/remove members). What are your thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 22:51:59 GMT):<br/>
I think PrivacyReorgTest is pretty problematic and likely warrants refactor. Maybe i just don't understand the role of the Enclave during re-orgs though... It was very difficult to mock out and I don't really grok why
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 22:52:20 GMT):<br/>
what about the acceptance tests that depend on Orion? Can I remove those?
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 22:52:59 GMT):<br/>
Sorry if I sound like I'm in a rush, i'm just eager to avoid the vert.x upgrade becoming a long-lived branch that requires constant rebasing

yes! awesome, I started doing this but I didn't understand the key rotation at work on the enclave implementation so i wasn't sure what to mock. a static key turned out to be a bad idea. I could totally take this on if someone could describe the minimum complexity needed for the mock.

<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 23:09:27 GMT):<br/>
I am not keen on having to dual-purpose mixHash and random, but the spec does not leave us much option.  We can separately encode, but we do not have a way to discern when we decode whether the field is mixHash or random, thus we change the mixHash to Bytes32, use it to back both fields, and differentiate only by accessor

You're right, it has been corrected

<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 18:32:29 GMT):<br/>
@antonydenyer brings up a really good point:  https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/commits/main
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 18:32:39 GMT):<br/>
that looks bad, and it's all sonarqubes fault.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 18:33:24 GMT):<br/>
it's already a non-required check, but the optics are real bad since github displays the one failure
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 19:55:53 GMT):<br/>
for instance, check this out: this pr passes, all green https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3108
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 19:56:09 GMT):<br/>
but when it is merged to main, it failed sonarqube
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 22:50:44 GMT):<br/>
I need to put the Vert.x upgrade on the back burner, but anyone else is welcome to pick it up from my draft PR. It's really close, there are just 2 classes that are failing during acceptance test, and I suspect all their tests are failing for the same reason.

</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 02:31:24 GMT):<br/>
is it maybe that it's missing jflo signoff? `frankisawesome authored and jflo committed yesterday` but all the signoffs are frank?

Re the docker base image vulnerabilities ticket https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/3045 - do we need to stick with jdk11 or can we use 16/17 for the docker image?
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 15:04:06 GMT):<br/>
I would be ok with 17 if we pass all tests on 17, which means updating the build executors first
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 15:34:27 GMT):<br/>
if you want to use it that way, the besu contributors group should have read access, and the teams below should have the correct access per repo
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 15:34:58 GMT):<br/>
as it is, any member of any team has write to three repos, and triage for one
</p>
<p><strong>fab-10</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 16:43:22 GMT):<br/>
the ticket talks about `openjdk:11.0.7-jre-slim-buster`, but now we are using `openjdk:11-jre-slim-buster` that follow the most recent version of java 11, so it could be that there no security issues already
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 17:17:18 GMT):<br/>
To fully support Java 17 in build we need to upgrade to Gradle 7.3
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 17:38:22 GMT):<br/>
the sonarqube failures are because it considers "new" code to be all commits since the last release. I think those failures are legit :(

<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 20:03:15 GMT):<br/>
sounds like that one was to focus on the image itself being end of life, agnostic of jdk versions. @GarySchulte any problem with combining these any more? I'm ok with it.

sonarqube is reporting acceptance-test code as uncovered lines - how do we fix that - eg https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=hyperledger_besu&metric=new_uncovered_lines&pullRequest=3118&view=list

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors?msg=ocqPxT8oDzDjtN46a) I think we need to support Besu on Java11 for some time, since some organizations are slow to upgrade to the last java version, so the solution here could simply be to use another OpenJDK distribution, that has no vulnerabilities as suggested here https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/3045#issuecomment-985437175
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:53:15 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 15:49:13 GMT):<br/>
(a) 11 is losing support in 2023.  We need to be ahead of the ball - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 15:50:33 GMT):<br/>
(b) we are long past the age of company wide Java versions. We are well in the age of bring your own JDK.  If an enterprise balks then the node is either run in a docker container or a local JRE/Java runtime is deployed with the app.  There are now no loger deep OS integrations and stuff like the Apple JDK being bound to the OS version no longer applies.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 15:51:27 GMT):<br/>
Creating a third "all in one" distribution with a JDK wrapped in sounds better to me than staying on Java 11 past the release of Java 18.
</p>
<p><strong>fab-10</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 15:57:23 GMT):<br/>
I am perfectly fine with upgrading to Java17, if no organization needs to run Besu on Java11, just saying that based on my recent experience , some organizations (big banks for example) do not like to run docker and uses old version of java
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 21:57:21 GMT):<br/>
Java 17 is a designated LTS release, so I don't expect any flack from a big bank or other enterprise.  Java 12-16... different story.

I'm implementing 4488 but I'm not sure what kind of integration test to write. I wasn't able to find anything (yet), but I assume something like London or Berlin should've had an integration test that covered before/transition/after.

i need to cover a gas calculator, a block body validator, and a transaction selector for mining. I'm imagining a test where I start a chain off with a london block, configure the upgrade for block 2, mine an upgraded block, and then assert on the changes. Is this the right way to think about our integration tests, and is there an existing one that does something like this that I should reference?

</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:12:15 GMT):<br/>
Hey @shemnon, I know you initially voiced some difference of opinion regarding the repurposing of DIFFICULTY as RANDOM in EIP-4399.  

What are your thoughts about doing a rename on whatever hardfork contains EIP-4488?  e.g.
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3111#pullrequestreview-825808634
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:13:09 GMT):<br/>
Are there Operation name dependencies other than how the operations print in traces, if the Operation name changes?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:14:04 GMT):<br/>
No dependencies.  The name should change if the functionality changes.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:14:43 GMT):<br/>
So one hardfork has the operations array with DifficultyOperation, and the next adds RandomOperation.  Actually, if you add both but add Random last it will over-write the initial add.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:14:54 GMT):<br/>
Since they are all stored in an array.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:15:03 GMT):<br/>
indexed by opcode.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:17:42 GMT):<br/>
Thanks.  Tactically what do you think about the viability of changing the name ahead of the merge ?  We could soft-fork that change along with the client release that contains the terminal total difficulty block.  But there isn't really a hardfork that we can make that change with.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:19:59 GMT):<br/>
alternately we could make it part of the hardfork that contains eip-4488 (if indeed that happens ahead of the merge), or the first hardfork following the merge.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:37:21 GMT):<br/>
I should have read to the end of the diff.  No, not like that.  Difficulty should be one Operation, Random another.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:37:36 GMT):<br/>
The hard fork protocol spec puts in Random at the merge point.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 06:44:35 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately there isn't a merge hardfork, the transition is based on a terminal total difficulty instead :/  The challenge is that we will have to operate within the same protocolSpec with 2 different behaviors for that opCode.

Perhaps we can create a RandomOperation that has the condition that was added to DifficultyOperation, and simply enable it in the EIP-4488 fork ahead of the merge.  Then post-merge we can clean it up and remove the condition.

I would prefer that, a difficulty operation that has no merge logic.  Classic, Ropsten, rinkeby, and goerli will appreciate it.

Would the "fork" be the block where the terminal difficulty is dialed in?

sounds like this is best described as a client specific softfork, which is later a hardfork based on TDD

question - is ECIP-1049 settled history for eth classic ?  I.e. is there any reason to keep the ECIP1049-DEV network definition?  genesis file, dev network name, etc.  Is that still an active network or was that a long lived test net that is now dead?

<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Thu, 09 Dec 2021 22:54:47 GMT):<br/>
no, I think that as long as we keep the possibility to enable keccak mining for testing, we can maintain genesis files outside upstream
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Thu, 09 Dec 2021 22:56:00 GMT):<br/>
once we settle a long lived testnet, with a proper name, we can get it back, but there is no timeline for it yet

@rjones hello! looking at this ticket https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/3142 it seems like we just need one config for code coverage on sonar cloud, is it possible to give me access?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:42:39 GMT):<br/>
@frankliawesome I'm not sure what you need me to do. Sonar is mostly handled via in-repo changes
</p>
<p><strong>frankliawesome</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:50:45 GMT):<br/>
I think you're right.. Most stuff can be done via either config file or in UI changes but definitely seems like doing a PR in repo makes a lot more senes!

I'm sorry, I just realized that at any case we gonna need a name to attach the fork to. Right now we are focused on the [upcoming hard fork (Mystique)](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/452) but as soon as we get that out we plan to start testing more consciously ECIP1049

Hello @macfarla, what are the options you have in mind for the `TesseraTestHarness`? ref: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3135#issuecomment-992047203

<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Mon, 13 Dec 2021 03:11:26 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if would be possible to move the entire environment setup to Docker images handled from outside the tests themselves and use [CircleCI configurations](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/building-docker-images/) directly
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 13 Dec 2021 04:10:50 GMT):<br/>
we have work in progress to a) change Tessera so it can be run as a process with runtime port discoverability and b) get rid of containerTests and run tessera as a process for Besu ATs
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 13 Dec 2021 04:12:07 GMT):<br/>
Tessera PR https://github.com/ConsenSys/tessera/pull/1356 - once this is done, we need a Tessera release and then update Besu to use that for ATs instead of containerTests.

</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 13 Dec 2021 04:14:50 GMT):<br/>
but if we don't want to wait for that, we could ignore those tests for now, OR change integrationTests to run on the large executor (and change it back once that work is finished)

I tried changing the `executor` in my fork but it didn't work. I tried large and xlarge, but none worked. Same problem, "Could not find a valid Docker environment. Please see logs and check configuration". E.g [CircleCI#66944](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hyperledger/besu/12172/workflows/9aca0bea-da05-4b62-94d5-8230325901bb/jobs/66944)

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 14 Dec 2021 10:54:18 GMT):<br/>
I think the difference with those two failing tests is that Tessera gives slightly different error messages to Orion. So to fix those, just update the error message to what Tessera gives and that should be it!
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 14 Dec 2021 14:31:40 GMT):<br/>
I'll try that. My only concern is that the responses from Tessera seems a little generic and I wouldn't be sure if those are coming from the tested scenario or from some hidden problem. I'm mostly referring to the one returning "Index 9 out of bounds for length 9" instead of "EnclaveDecodePublicKey", which sounds like an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`

Hi @atoulme , regarding the Incentive Program that the EF rolled out here are some clarifications: it is not a grant, it is a multi year program designed to incentivize client teams (organizations) to dedicate time and resources to Ethereum roadmap (testnet participation, spec implementation, testing, R&D etc). Specifically to prepare for the Merge and the upcoming milestones, like Sharding. The 4608 ETH that the EF is prodiving to run the validators will not be available for client teams upfront, it will be used to load the validators but the withdrawal keys will be kept by the Ethereum Foundation and disclosed over several years. However, client teams will be able to directly access the rewards generated by those validators over time, if the team keeps contributing (this will be judged by the EF). The program can not be regarded as a grant (where money is directly available) but it will certainly lead to creation of grants/bounties once it's up and running (post-merge, the validators will be generating rewards). The EF just recently made the information public, but for the past 4 months the team at Consensys has worked on setting up the infrastructure to be able to run those validators safely. The infra is ready to receive validators but the handover has not happened yet. Let me know if you have any questions or remarks on this topic.

Hey all - I wanted to follow up regarding the Ethereum Foundation announcement earlier this week  and wanted to apologize that this was a surprise to the Besu community at large.

I want to emphasize that it is very important to me personally and all Besu maintainers from ConsenSys that Besu is an open, inclusive, vibrant community of contributors. We want Besu to stay that way and to grow to be even better.

With the announcement, we (ConsenSys) wants this incentive program to benefit the Besu community. We are committed to finding a way to ensure contributors are rewarded for their work on the project. We would love this group’s feedback on how best to incentivize the program. 

If the group agrees, I'd like to propose we as the Besu community discuss this topic in detail at the next contributor call on December 21st at 11 AM ET. ConsenSys would be happy to answer any questions others have. Tim from the EF is also planning on joining to help answer questions and provide additional context on the program. We'd also like to begin the process of how we can leverage these funds to enhance the Besu community. Also, please feel free to personally reach out to me if you’d like to discuss one on one.

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:16:53 GMT):<br/>
@rjones - can you set the hyperledger zoom link to automatically record? My hit rate with remembering to record meetings went up significantly once I started using that feature.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:32:31 GMT):<br/>
@madelinemurray the calendar link is for a consensys zoom link, so I don't have control over the settings
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:35:49 GMT):<br/>
@madelinemurray use this link: https://zoom.us/j/97540031823

Thanks @rjones.  @grace.hartley - do you have update access on the invite?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:56:44 GMT):<br/>
I updated it in the calendar
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 01:05:57 GMT):<br/>
Cool, I updated the wiki and added this item to the agenda
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 01:10:10 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @atoulme - enjoy the skiing.  Seems hard to imagine from this side of the world!
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 01:11:07 GMT):<br/>
kids will ski and I might just put my feet up and code. Appreciate the kind words Madeline, I hope you have a good summer ;)
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 05:07:56 GMT):<br/>
the network is still live for all I know, can't remember though :)

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 15:49:19 GMT):<br/>
Looks like there is a _third_ log4j vulnerability: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html (2.17.0) - Thoughts on wether we should roll another 21.10.x release and another 22.1.0-RCx?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 15:50:32 GMT):<br/>
Meta-question: thoughts on dropping log4j-core for just java.util.logging backed?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 16:05:05 GMT):<br/>
Here's a patch for 21.10.x - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3198
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 18 Dec 2021 16:05:12 GMT):<br/>
RC isn't as urgent IMHO
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 01:30:20 GMT):<br/>
Logback is better - use slf4j as api so you don’t force a runtime
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 01:30:35 GMT):<br/>
java.util.logging is slow
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 01:31:10 GMT):<br/>
Or even better slf4j can use java.util.logging as backend if you prefer.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 02:00:01 GMT):<br/>
The goal would be to get rid of attack surface.  We could include instructions on how to wire in your favorite, but I don't want to be spinning releases on weekends.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 02:10:25 GMT):<br/>
Reminder for future releases: do not use the `/ui/native/...` URLs from artifactory, in the release notes or changelog.  curl will return the intermediate hash pages and your hashes will be all wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 03:25:32 GMT):<br/>
Slf4j reduces the surface attack since you can plug any backend. I’m game to help!
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 03:25:49 GMT):<br/>
And yes big point on weekend releases…
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 04:10:12 GMT):<br/>
especially when I don't have the time to figure out why circleci hates the branch.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 04:38:20 GMT):<br/>
I am supposed to wrap presents tonight. Might not be a great time
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 04:41:29 GMT):<br/>
I see your pr. Happy to review.

PR to release 21.10.5 with just the log4j changes - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3199
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 05:51:34 GMT):<br/>
Then a PR to set the version to .6-SNAPSHOT (will need a rebase) https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3200
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 05:52:14 GMT):<br/>
the 3199 PR will push a release once merged, consider my posting it a vote to release.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 05:53:33 GMT):<br/>
After that (AUS could do this when the come online monday morning)
[ ] Update Homebrew (21.10.4 was missed, we should skip it)
[ ] Update the release tag in besu
[ ] update the besu-docs tag
</p>

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 07:02:32 GMT):<br/>
Both approved

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 03:07:23 GMT):<br/>
@rjones This feels tweet worthy to me. The text in #besu looks well worded (https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=qe5HWzwptNia9Ak2n)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 03:08:00 GMT):<br/>
Follow on question, how do we workflow tweet requests?  Is there a better person to ping?
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 10:46:56 GMT):<br/>
@matt.nelson.94 - are you the person for tweet requests?

We will definitely record and a Wiki page sounds reasonable. We will get started on it. It might not be ready for tomorrow's meeting, but will begin building it out on Wiki. Good suggestion!

hi, @andreolf1 - let's discuss the calendar in here
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 16:29:51 GMT):<br/>
@madelinemurray it looks like @andreolf1 has edited the invite - I'm not going to have a power struggle over choosing a Zoom account, could you two sort that out?
</p>

well, no.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 16:34:10 GMT):<br/>
We had moved the call to a different Zoom account with a public recording and now you have moved it back.
</p>
<p><strong>andreolf1</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 16:37:49 GMT):<br/>
Ok my bad. As last we could't record i though I added my zoom but i am totally fine to put the other one then (didn't know was changed, was thinking was still the Matt one). Would it be possible to change it back?

I will let someone from Consensys handle this - it's a community meeting

Ok thanks @rjones!
</p>
<p><strong>andreolf1</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 16:46:01 GMT):<br/>
Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 16:47:03 GMT):<br/>
I requested a hyperledger zoom account be used.  We have been having repeated problems getting the recording happening because it's been locked to a single user's account to record.  If, for example, ConsenSys Quorum is off on a company-wide retreat in a bad time zone I would still like the other maintainers to be able to run the call.
</p>
<p><strong>andreolf1</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 16:52:44 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good @shemnon  , do you have the latest zoom URL so  I can edit the invite and add the Hyperledger zoom account?

It would be good to document what exactly it is that all this entails and what was promised to the EF.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 03:35:30 GMT):<br/>
Does anyone have strong opinions on _how_ we install solc on the CI executor https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3204
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 03:37:37 GMT):<br/>
@RoboCopsGoneMad any final thoughts on this one https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3135
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:25:49 GMT):<br/>
For build simplicity I'm inclined to look at the compiled solidity as the test data, and putting generate methods in the build.gradle to re-generate when new 0.x versions of solidity ship.  While it works against the "don't check in generated code or binaries" ethos it increases the variables of the dependent tooling to create the build.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:26:50 GMT):<br/>
Plus, we could generate an array of compiled solidity versions if that ever becomes an issue.  0.8 introdues ABIv2 but that's benign outside of multidimensional arrays.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:27:41 GMT):<br/>
Do you mean get rid of the web3j solidity gradle plugin?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:28:01 GMT):<br/>
yes.  check in the .sol files for reference but run solidity and check in the .bin files.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:28:35 GMT):<br/>
mac won't let me put solc in /usr/bin, so I already have to hack the build for development.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:29:07 GMT):<br/>
so - essentially - revert this PR? https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2872
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:30:11 GMT):<br/>
Not a direct revert.  I would put the .bin files as separate sources and have a build target that generates them.  In theory a run of the tool will result in zero changes since the timestamp is not part of the .bin
</p>

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:31:00 GMT):<br/>
It's a comprimise, but the two alternatives attempted (web3j service dependency, solc local binary) don't seem to be fairing well.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 14:26:49 GMT):<br/>
Wouldn't the bundled `solc` work in CircleCI? I tried removing the `executable` and `version` fields and it downloaded version **0.8.9** on my local (I don't know why it couldn't find **0.8.10**) and the artifacts were generated successfully (ABI and BIN)
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:08:58 GMT):<br/>
I'm sorry, is the Community Call happening right now? I'm connected to the link listed here https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/2021-12-21+Besu+Contributor+Call. Is that the right one?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:11:37 GMT):<br/>
In an hour
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:13:25 GMT):<br/>
It _should_ have been at 7pt, because the meetings were originally pinned to UTC to avoid AUS/NA/EUR daylight issuesbut the notes went up with a daylight time in the US, so we are just sticking with that for this meeting.

Historicaly it's been pinned to UTC.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:15:56 GMT):<br/>
gotcha. So, it still says 15:00UTC at the top, but that's not consistent with, let's say, 11AM in NYC which is listed below
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:16:09 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:36:37 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for the confusion Diego! Yes, it begins at 11 AM ET, 4 PM UK.

no worries!

@shemnon there was a release of the splunk java logging lib. I need to open a PR with the new version and jfrog artifactory site. Do you have a PR open for this? I looked and didn't see any
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 18:38:35 GMT):<br/>
Hey All - 
Thanks to everyone joining for the contributor call today. You can find the notes linked below. The next steps from the call were:
-More detailed document around Incentive Program on Wiki (note we will likely not have this until first week of Jan)
-Conduct an offcycle contributor call

Agenda for next call (potentially off-cycle):
-Incentive program (30 mins) (Cost of running nodes)
-Besu maintainer progress/community concerns (30 mins)

I've kicked off an agenda for the proposed next Contributor call. Options for timing are Option 1: December 30th at 10 AM ET, Option 2: December 30th at 11 AM ET, Option 3: December 31st at 10 AM ET. 

For full transparency, almost all of the ConsenSys-side contributors will be out of office next week (because it is a ConsenSys holiday) so only a select few of us will be able to join the call.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 19:21:14 GMT):<br/>
I am available for all. My vote would be for 1 to get things going but 2 or 3 also works for me without any problem.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 21:22:52 GMT):<br/>
nope, that is good to merge
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 22:32:22 GMT):<br/>
that's how it used to work but when an internal server was down it did not - this fix should prevent that, and when released we can update the plugin https://github.com/web3j/web3j-sokt/pull/8
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 22:37:08 GMT):<br/>
No open security PRs.  We don't have dependabot turned on.  And based on what I'm experiencing at Hedera I wouldn't recommend it, very low signal to noise.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 22:46:46 GMT):<br/>
I get what you're saying, still thinking on it
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 22:47:41 GMT):<br/>
in other news - the web3j solidity plugin should get updated with this fix which should improve things https://github.com/web3j/web3j-sokt/pull/8
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 23:28:01 GMT):<br/>
gotcha!
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 22 Dec 2021 06:29:56 GMT):<br/>
no worries. I'll open a PR when I get a chance
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 22 Dec 2021 06:55:00 GMT):<br/>
All work for me as well.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 22 Dec 2021 15:30:21 GMT):<br/>
Same here, all work for me, no opinion on which
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 22 Dec 2021 15:34:18 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon  Could you elaborate on the poor noise you're seeing at Hedera? Asking because I've seen the opposite. In my experience, dependabot would open PRs to automatically update dependencies when security fixes are released, which was very helpful.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 22 Dec 2021 16:20:13 GMT):<br/>
Not all updates are security updates, and not all projects follow semver.  So unless our test cases are designed to test the libraries themselves things like performance regressions and flakey interactions are introduced.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 22 Dec 2021 16:20:47 GMT):<br/>
I think it's safer to at each quarterly update hand-upgrade each lib to the latests and let the RC cycle work through the bugs.
</p>

Hi All - I have scheduled the off cycle Besu contributor call to be at December 30th at 10 AM ET. Invite can be found here. https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/besu/viewevent?eventid=1367457&calstart=2021-12-30

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 30 Dec 2021 16:28:18 GMT):<br/>
Why was that message removed?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 30 Dec 2021 16:30:03 GMT):<br/>
hey folks, it looks like Sajida removed her message earlier.

Folks, if we use discord or email, or anything, please note - I don't think we should allow deletion. We are in a public forum and we work in the open. At the very least, providing a rationale for deleting a message sounds the least you can do, especially when you don't respond to questions in thread.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 30 Dec 2021 16:48:40 GMT):<br/>
The fact this message was removed raises more questions for me. Sajida had claimed she had mobilized operations and worked towards node hosting. What was done? What work was it?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 30 Dec 2021 16:52:08 GMT):<br/>
> Hi, regarding the Incentive Program that the EF rolled out here are some clarifications: it is not a grant, it is a multi year program designed to incentivize client teams (organizations) to dedicate time and resources to Ethereum roadmap (testnet participation, spec implementation, testing, R&D etc). Specifically to prepare for the Merge and the upcoming milestones, like Sharding. The 4608 ETH that the EF is prodiving to run the validators will not be available for client teams upfront, it will be used to load the validators but the withdrawal keys will be kept by the Ethereum Foundation and disclosed over several years. However, client teams will be able to directly access the rewards generated by those validators over time, if the team keeps contributing (this will be judged by the EF). The program can not be regarded as a grant (where money is directly available) but it will certainly lead to creation of grants/bounties once it's up and running (post-merge, the validators will be generating rewards). The EF just recently made the information public, but for the past 4 months the team at Consensys has worked on setting up the infrastructure to be able to run those validators safely. The infra is ready to receive validators but the handover has not happened yet. Let me know if you have any questions or remarks on this topic.

Just found I had Sajida’s message saved up. Here it is.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 30 Dec 2021 16:53:55 GMT):<br/>
@GarySchulte the 4 months figure mentioned during the call came from above.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 30 Dec 2021 16:58:14 GMT):<br/>
A good reminder here that this project will only fail if we let it. I am not about letting it. Please work in the open with all of us. I need commitment from everyone to work together in the open.

As promised on the call:
Proposal #1 - Bicameral proposal voting https://hackmd.io/MzykBNnpSYmySer_WJzi7Q
Proposal #2 - Disbursement Priority Tiers https://hackmd.io/2A9HkGwgRYyq8vOEntRlHA
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 30 Dec 2021 19:17:58 GMT):<br/>
I own that I requested this message be deleted because it failed to provide important context around the program and did not accurately reflect ConsenSys' view around the EF incentive program. Because it lacked some context, I was not comfortable with it remaining posted because it was perpetuating misinformation. But, your feedback is fair, that we should have provided a detailed reply around why messages are deleted and we will do that moving forward.
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 30 Dec 2021 19:18:32 GMT):<br/>
Here are the notes from the today's call. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62232351
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 31 Dec 2021 01:46:09 GMT):<br/>
That's not clear to me, sorry. What misinformation was it perpetuating? Did the message contain false information?

Didn't ConsenSys work with the EF for the past 4 months? What is the team at ConsenSys that she refers to? Is it a different team? Are nodes at ConsenSys already set up and ready to go like she says? I don't quite follow.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 31 Dec 2021 02:30:44 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon I like proposal #2. I put some thoughts on what I understand of the situation so far and proposals for a way forward here: https://hackmd.io/x1eSt7AyTAWgwt2vTPiK-Q

</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:06:09 GMT):<br/>
Not a fan of a bicameral setup for a host of reasons, not the least of which is that it presupposes conflict between "organizations" and forces someone to belong to one of them.  Seems like an invitation for discord.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:08:09 GMT):<br/>
From the second proposal, I definitely prefer the endowment model.  It seems most in-line with the spirit of the grant to support mainnet.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:17:49 GMT):<br/>
I think both proposals sidestep the issue of distribution and who/what constitutes a valid participant.  Do you envision only 2 potential organizations which would or could run validators?  If there is an implied short list of potential candidate validators we should specify that, conversely if anybody can run a validator there should be some qualifying criteria.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:22:36 GMT):<br/>
I also think it would be best if there was a fixed ratio schedule for rewards, rather than "if there is still funds left over from prior distribution tiers".  If operations are an open-ended cost up-to the total revenue from rewards, that will de-incentivize running an efficient operation.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:30:32 GMT):<br/>
generally I think Danno's proposal 2 as an endowment is viable, with clarifications about who participants are and how decisions are made.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:31:56 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon why did we need to roll back rocksdb?  I was hoping to bump it to latest once this was merged:
https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/9254
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 01:11:01 GMT):<br/>
Karim said a canary node failed in the 22Q1 updates pr
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 01:11:34 GMT):<br/>
IMHO there is no presupposition.  It reflects the current state of things in the Besu Community.  There's ConsenSys, and then everyone else.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 01:52:10 GMT):<br/>
There is a history of rocksdb updates causing canary issues, so I had considered doing it in it's own pr.  We can get again and tweak versions but I think rocksdb versions should be tweaked in isolation.

For Tomorrows Construbtor call I would like to add a discussion about the vision of where Hyperledger Besu is headed.  Here's my red-herring as an attempt to seed discussion: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/~shemnon/Besu+2022+Vision

added to the agenda
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 15:24:45 GMT):<br/>
it was missing some important information , which is why I thought it was perpetuating some misinformation. Some information includes around how the keys will be distributed, conflated the terms of client team vs. ConsenSys, and how the keys would be distributed, and expectations for running validator nodes.  I also think it missed information around how the EF wanted this to be a win for the Besu client team as well as the ConsenSys team working on Besu. We are pulling together a detailed overview of the EF incentive program and the work expected that better captures all of the elements of the program to make sure the Besu team has a complete picture of the program. A clear Wiki page rather than a Rocketchat message will help give everyone all of the information needed.
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 15:28:26 GMT):<br/>
I added a recap from the prior two Besu contributor calls given most of the folks on the call won't have been at the prior ones and it would be helpful for everyone to be up to speed.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 17:38:33 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 19:23:25 GMT):<br/>
merge question, probably for @GarySchulte ... is TDD a >= comparison or just > ? If my difficulty is == ttd, am I the last PoW block, or the second to last?
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 19:29:08 GMT):<br/>
I was also uncompelled by the bicameral proposal, however I found the tiered revenue proposal very useful. That is a good shorthand for outlining where the revenue would have to go.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 21:30:43 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @grace.hartley - will you be there to do the recap?
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 21:37:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I will plan on facilitating the call as well.

Here are the notes from today's contributor call. There are several action items that I will share here tomorrow. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/2022-01-04+Besu+Contributor+Call
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:39:01 GMT):<br/>
gm besunians. every log4j patch makes me want to work on a new release process. I'll start collecting thoughts into a wiki doc.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:40:33 GMT):<br/>
please forward me anything you've written down, or even random thoughts
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:21:44 GMT):<br/>
I'm listening to the recorded contribs call from last night, and I think there is a dilemma I need to square. We want immutable metadata, so to me that means embedded in the artifact*. If it is embedded in the artifact, we now have a modified binary which was only changed via the version number. Strictly speaking, that should be fully retested, which is the source of a lot of our release time pain.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:22:24 GMT):<br/>
How can we just assign a version number to an already released/tested artifact, and still keep it immutable?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:30:21 GMT):<br/>
You assign the version number upfront
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:32:21 GMT):<br/>
The number of bugs i've seen relating to detecting version numbers of software within code or in the named artifacts is too high. I've got some war stories.  That is why I feel simply changing the version number triggers a full rebuild and test cycle.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:32:42 GMT):<br/>
Automation breaks in strange ways when the word "-SNAPSHOT" disappers.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:34:26 GMT):<br/>
that is fair. The Apache process requires to produce a source distro that can be used to rebuild the release. The source distro is what is trusted, not the git repo.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:34:59 GMT):<br/>
That's kind of a ham handed way to do it, but it works across languages and everything
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:35:12 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger has no release standards.  I kind of view that as a problem.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:35:34 GMT):<br/>
Once an Apache release is made, the RC is uploaded to SVN and then is voted on, with everyone testing it.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:35:41 GMT):<br/>
More often than not we find problems there.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:36:08 GMT):<br/>
We also use Nexus and stage the release in a repo there before pushing to Maven Central
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:36:28 GMT):<br/>
so you can actually target that repo and update your versions and test the libs that way. It's very convenient.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:52:31 GMT):<br/>
I can take a look at helping with the release process - listening to the call, looks like there was a need for a volunteer
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 17:33:42 GMT):<br/>
Hey all! Following up on the actions from yesterday's contributor call:
1. Will the contributors please provide feedback/comments to Danno's Besu 2022 Vision doc? We will review again at the next contributor call. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/~shemnon/Besu+2022+Vision
2. We are considering a rotating schedule for the Contributor call. Can folks provide their feedback on whether they would like to keep the current schedule of one APAC friendly and one EMEA/AMER friendly OR would you like to shift to a rotating schedule with 3 meeting times throughout the month?
3. Team to work through what is the scope of an ideal release solution and then see what solutions (tag based or otherwise) would work. it looks like @atoulme was nice enough to volunteer above but wanted to double check.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 17:34:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I'm ok with helping with release. I can bring over some hard lessons I learned from Apache Tuweni
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 17:34:46 GMT):<br/>
that is awesome, thanks antoinne
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 17:35:07 GMT):<br/>
I have to think about the vision for Besu 2022, thanks Danno for putting it together, it's a good year vision and we don't need to do it all at once.
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 17:39:20 GMT):<br/>
Next: I think it is appropriate to schedule another off cycle Besu contributor call for Tuesday (1/11) or Wednesday (1/12) of next week to continue to discuss the EF Incentive Program. ConsenSys will be sharing validator node requirements and the Program Overview by the end of this week to inform the discussion. Any time preferences? I'm looking at 12:30 to 1:30 PM ET on 1/11 or 1/12.

in a past life, i had a really good experience with the gradle git plugin, but that was a semver project. has anyone tried using it with calver? I don't see any reason it wouldn't work, since the dev sets major/minor either way...
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:47:26 GMT):<br/>
I haven't used the gradle release plugin - what guarantees can it make about the release artifact?
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:48:44 GMT):<br/>
Also, who are the release approvers in this case?
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:50:06 GMT):<br/>
gradle release plugin is kinda old, not sure how active it is. it was an attempt to provide a maven-like release process for builds
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:50:19 GMT):<br/>
release approvers remains TBD
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:50:49 GMT):<br/>
i would suggest just supporting present day approval requirements, then improving on that by tightening it up
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:52:34 GMT):<br/>
I keep coming back to the fact that both the artifact we produce and the release notes are mutable.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 21:21:06 GMT):<br/>
We are going to do a release 21.10.6 today with just the log4j 2.17.1 update https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/commit/a890e427ca96abe08924dba4a05e4918cb473350

</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 23:03:42 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK we don't have a policy on this - it's been done ad-hoc - but for example - when I release and add the download links for 21.10.6 which supersedes 21.10.5 - should I remove the download links for 21.10.5? With the more serious log4j updates we did but this one doesn't seem as serious
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 23:24:39 GMT):<br/>
My take is it depends on why we rolled the security update.  If it's a bug in Besu code I've pulled the download.  Library issues are a bit different, as they can reasonably be live patched (until we go to jpms...)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 23:25:15 GMT):<br/>
I would be ok with leaving or pulling the 21.10.5 and older ones that haven't been pulled.

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 23:38:01 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 23:38:55 GMT):<br/>
Even if we go to another process, we're bound to go back to why in some time, so it might be worth listing our constraints. I do see quite a few above listed out. Do they all matter? Are they must-have?

Tomorrow from around 2:30 UTC I will be releasing Besu. I am new in the Consensys and never made a release before. If you would like to see how we release a new version, feel free to join. I am not going to record it.  I will be on this Zoom call: https://consensys.zoom.us/j/93768570437

In case you would want your commit to be cherry-picked to the release branch, let me know before then
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:28:20 GMT):<br/>
This will be a RC-2 release I think
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:37:03 GMT):<br/>
2:30... AM? PM?
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:52:05 GMT):<br/>
2:30 PM, sry
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:52:54 GMT):<br/>
so 16:30 UTC
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:52:54 GMT):<br/>
so ~16:30 UTC~ ... Apparently no its not! It is 14:30 UTC....

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:55:14 GMT):<br/>
so what you're telling me is that you're planning on a chill, LoFi beats party tomorrow, where you'll be livestreaming your release work, and you just dropped an exclusive alpha link.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:56:04 GMT):<br/>
That's during a critical work call for me, otherwise I'd totally drop by.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:56:39 GMT):<br/>
I'll try and make it
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:57:01 GMT):<br/>
As I noticed previously, when something goes wrong it might take "longer" so feel free to drop in/out as you feel like
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:57:19 GMT):<br/>
I think you're saying there's an after party
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:57:30 GMT):<br/>
I'll drop in if my call doesn't run too far over, it has a tendency to do so.

I thought we used snyk somewhere in our build pipeline to check for security vulnerabilities? Do I have that wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 22:41:19 GMT):<br/>
^ and if I do have that wrong - what do we use to test for vulnerabilities in dependencies?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 22:59:08 GMT):<br/>
It was not in the build pipeline.  I think I only ever took the email alerts and they went to my consensys email.  I tried to get others to sign up but I think all that did also left consensys
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 23:06:34 GMT):<br/>
hmmm ok so if we don't already have it - is snyk a good option or is something else better? this user mentions nexus IQ which is sonatype https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/3229
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 23:09:33 GMT):<br/>
also snyk says 0 issues https://snyk.io/test/github/hyperledger/besu/?tab=issues
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 23:14:44 GMT):<br/>
The report must not be running then.  My personal account found 50 highs.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 23:15:15 GMT):<br/>
I didn't like snyk because it had issues when we overrode transitive dependencies.  It's overly tuned for maven.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 23:16:48 GMT):<br/>
also, it's been at least 2 years since I took snyk seriously, so it may have improved.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 23:45:24 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks will see what thoughts others have
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 23:58:21 GMT):<br/>
also I did the snyk import a different way and I can see 50 highs
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 06:07:16 GMT):<br/>
So I may have gone down a bit of a rabbit hole with investigating reported security vulnerabilities. This one
http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-29582
In JetBrains Kotlin before 1.4.21, a vulnerable Java API was used for temporary file and folder creation. An attacker was able to read data from such files and list directories due to insecure permissions.
 is being reported by the dependency check gradle plugin and according to ./gradlew -q dependencies it's coming from tuweni but when I look there https://github.com/apache/incubator-tuweni/blob/9e4814ee853fedb22da48545b4f7648c758f112f/dependency-versions.gradle#L116 it seems to already have 1.5.2 - but there are a few different kotlin libs at different versions and my time down the rabbit hole is up. @atoulme I will put extra details in this thread, if you can shed any light on this that would be great
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 06:08:11 GMT):<br/>

Hey, you're looking at the latest dependencies, but the 2.0 release dependencies are here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-tuweni/blob/v2.0.0-incubating/dependency-versions.gradle
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 06:14:40 GMT):<br/>
They certainly seem to have this vulnerability. We've been due for a release for a little while. We need to kick a new one soonish. Feel free to post on the dev list of tuweni that you need a release to get this to come along faster.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 06:23:09 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks for the clarification. dev list of tuweni - do you mean like a mailing list?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 06:25:56 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 06:27:04 GMT):<br/>
I will put it on my list
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 06:56:34 GMT):<br/>
I don't think this fixes anything in particular but I was on a roll https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3243
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 06:58:39 GMT):<br/>
And this one - I made a start at upgrading the version of kubernetes client-java but there's breaking changes and I think this is better done by someone who knows something about kubernetes and NAT https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3239 - @JiriPeinlich maybe?

<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:47:21 GMT):<br/>
We're beginning the release process for hyperledger/besu, please don't merge anything to release-22.1.0-RC2 until further notice
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:32:58 GMT):<br/>
Hmm
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:33:13 GMT):<br/>
Then did I just miss the action?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:33:43 GMT):<br/>
Oh man ok
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:34:20 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:23:59 GMT):<br/>
It's now safe to merge into release-22.1.0-RC2 for hyperledger/besu again.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:46:09 GMT):<br/>
probably one of the most painful releases we have done.  that was a poster-child for the need to update our release process ;)
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:46:27 GMT):<br/>
listening to the call, I guess I don't think GAR-E should live on. I saw there was a checklist on it while it ran, that could be cool to get inspired from
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:47:02 GMT):<br/>
GAR-e is used for a variety of projects actually, so it would live on.  But we certainly can stop using it for besu
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:47:09 GMT):<br/>
ya
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:47:12 GMT):<br/>
I think besu is the only project that does branch based releases
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:47:12 GMT):<br/>
where
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:47:22 GMT):<br/>
where is the call link?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:47:37 GMT):<br/>
oh call is done just now, there wasn't much going on
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:47:39 GMT):<br/>
Besu is the only project Adrian doesn't exert control over
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:48:03 GMT):<br/>
So it makes sense the administrative parts differ
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:48:06 GMT):<br/>
lots of staring at the screen and looking at git issues, and other finnicky things
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:48:16 GMT):<br/>
cherry picks?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:48:43 GMT):<br/>
more like ssh cloning vs http cloning, and access token scope, and machine setup, and ssh-agent setup
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:48:57 GMT):<br/>
so Jiri hadn't run gar-e before?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:49:02 GMT):<br/>
that took Jiri on a loop to fix and figure out
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:49:04 GMT):<br/>
guess not
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:49:27 GMT):<br/>
I did not
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:49:37 GMT):<br/>
We should look into moving these to git actions.  Just as soon as any of us get free time.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:49:59 GMT):<br/>
cherry picks were ok I believe, but it took a while to recognize that the local git / hub config were an issue
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:50:05 GMT):<br/>
IIRC gar-e is high up-front setup but very low repeated use cost.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:50:16 GMT):<br/>
add some thoughts to the wiki page! https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Release+Process+Improvement
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:50:33 GMT):<br/>
I would like to get away from driving releases on individual machines.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:50:34 GMT):<br/>
i am between tasks and am ready to work on this, i can make the time
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:50:53 GMT):<br/>
most definitely would love to get this off of individual machines
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:51:33 GMT):<br/>
A model I would propose is that every release gets a branch.  First commit is the new version number.  Build and release from there.  Second commit is the SNAPSHOT number.  Then that branch is merged into main so the history is preserved.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:52:13 GMT):<br/>
Also protects against main merges.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:52:32 GMT):<br/>
our CI build time makes that a fairly long process, but if it is entirely hands off then that reduces most of the pain, apart from not being able to merge into main during the process
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:52:55 GMT):<br/>
But if we build all releases off of a release branch then main remains open.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:53:23 GMT):<br/>
agreed
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:53:23 GMT):<br/>
anything that can break will break, I think a requirement for me is that we can't block main
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:53:24 GMT):<br/>
each release branch comes off of main or the maintinence branch
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:53:49 GMT):<br/>
we could potentially have merge conflicts if we use a release brach and allow merges into main
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:54:01 GMT):<br/>
so there would need to be an escape hatch
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:54:12 GMT):<br/>
In theory it's only the properties file.  But then we do a manual merge if it's more.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:54:19 GMT):<br/>
changelog also
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:54:32 GMT):<br/>
Yea, that wold be cleaned up in the merge commit.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:57:56 GMT):<br/>
another fun approach if you like is to not use a CHANGELOG file
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:58:05 GMT):<br/>
You can compile changelog from commits
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:58:27 GMT):<br/>
I like and dislike this approach. It works well in tight projects
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:59:12 GMT):<br/>
I used convential commits where you use a different tool called gitcz to create your commit message, and it formats your commit just so it's easier on the eyes
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:59:31 GMT):<br/>
then computing CHANGELOG is easy. We used semantic releases with that.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:59:42 GMT):<br/>
There is a github action that allows you to tag a commit message for inclusion in changelog
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:59:57 GMT):<br/>
I'm not 100% behind it though, since it forces one commit == one PR in a way
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:59:57 GMT):<br/>
i have similar mixed feelings to @atoulme 's
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:00:23 GMT):<br/>
I don't think CHANGELOG files are cool
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:01:39 GMT):<br/>
in my perfect world, a changelog is human readable, and would be derrived from issues.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:01:55 GMT):<br/>
commits are the domain of developers. they are a safe space for shitty puns
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:14:53 GMT):<br/>
As a manager in my $dayjob, I kinda like the idea of using issues and milestones in github
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:15:04 GMT):<br/>
it provides more clarity for changelogs.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:15:20 GMT):<br/>
What that would change is that we would likely require that an issue is filed for a PR
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:16:02 GMT):<br/>
which is a form of gatekeeping, but maybe less intimidating than having folks open a PR, watch CI go red, and then have to go fix a weird CHANGELOG file to add their PR number to it
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:21:28 GMT):<br/>
it's also a different responsibility imo to write release notes, one that is best left to a PM - tie in the release to a trend, put 3 issues together, add color and commentary
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:24:52 GMT):<br/>
Usually that's why we do votes at Apache, not to use this refrain too much but...

Developer does a RC
Folks try it out
There is a vote thread and we all vote on the RC. That's a good time to edit and review release notes.
When the vote is finished, the release is pushed, and we make an email to announce@apache.org with the contents of the release

The whole process is documented here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-tuweni/blob/main/RELEASE.md
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 19:59:01 GMT):<br/>
@sajz thoughts on the above?
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 20:41:30 GMT):<br/>
I agree that requiring an issue before a PR is a form of gatekeeping, I suspect we could work around that. Changelogs could be filled from both issues and developer-tagged commits, to allow devs to submit prs that don't warrant an issue/changelog inclusion, but if they feel an issueless PR should be included in the changelog, tag the commit.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 21:17:37 GMT):<br/>
or write the issue after, map back to the commit, make this a bit more flexible
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 21:17:55 GMT):<br/>
in all cases, this is only going to be as good as the person doing the release notes
</p>
<p><strong>sajz</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 12:46:07 GMT):<br/>
I think we need to better define the problem we are trying to solve and that will inform how we go about addressing it. I have read the previous points and there is probably value in adding this convo the next contributors call agenda.
</p>
<p><strong>sajz</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 12:46:57 GMT):<br/>
Hi, sharing here some updates on the Hyperledger wiki.
1. I have added a “*Programs*” page and within it a “*Besu Execution Client Incentive Program*” page with all the details.
 https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Besu+Execution+Client+Incentive+Program
 https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Programs (maybe in the future we can add “Bounties Program” and other programs we’d like to launch)
2. I also updated the Mainnet items of the Hyperledger Besu *roadmap* following the template that was in place.
It would be good to add the Enterprise (privacy, permissionning etc) related items to the page.
 https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Roadmap

I will be updating and adding more content to the hyperledger wiki next week.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 14:39:50 GMT):<br/>
Any info on the node size requirements?  Will those also land in the wiki?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 14:40:51 GMT):<br/>
There was some notable discussion about it on the last contributor call already, that gives context to this proposal.
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 14:53:43 GMT):<br/>
The time we spend downloading world state in Besu should be addressed with the snapsync changes Mr. matkt is working on. The other part of the download process that takes lots of time is download of the block headers. It appears that it might be enough to get “online” without downloading the whole block headers history. Maybe it would be enough to just download the last N block headers and then get online and start working, while in the background we would continue downloading the rest of the block headers. I was thinking, maybe have a startup option to specify from block of height H when downloading headers, and then finish the rest of the headers only in parallel to being already online and working. Do you see any strong reason not to allow for this behaviour?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 14:58:24 GMT):<br/>
An implementation of this aligns with the ACD desire for block and header expiry if we add two params, one number of headers and bodies download before going "live" (most recent X, likely aligned to a boundary)  and one  listing a number to download before we stop, which right now is functionally is zero.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 14:59:18 GMT):<br/>
Another tricky part is our download starts at zero and grows up.  This is a leftover design artifact from when we had no fast syncs and only had full sync.  "Backward" block downloading would be the biggest architectural change.
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:00:52 GMT):<br/>
I was recently working on Backward sync kind of implementation that we merged for the kinsugi, I was thinking about leveraging that.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:01:23 GMT):<br/>
nice
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:09:45 GMT):<br/>
It will still need some improvements for this use case. If I understand what you are saying correctly: First parameter determines starting block. From there, we first sync forward to be online as soon as possible. Then we start syncing backwards until we reach the block determined by the second parameter.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:11:45 GMT):<br/>
I was think both halves would be backward, although direction doesn't matter for the online-requred portion.  We start at the current head block.  Then we sync backwards.  Once we pass the first parameter the node can switch to online.  Then we continue backwards sync until we hit the stop depth.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:12:28 GMT):<br/>
We may want to load in a list of chain checkpoints and require that the stop depth be below one of the checkpoints for the particular chain.  To validate we are not syncing the wrong chain.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:13:17 GMT):<br/>
That was always the argument for downloading all headers, you would validate against genesis.  By putting in checkpoints we are making assertions those are off of the genesis chain.  If a user doesn't trust our checkpoints their historical block downloads should go to zero.
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:14:33 GMT):<br/>
list of checkpoints - do we already have something like this?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:14:53 GMT):<br/>
Nope.  We have a quasi check for the classic fork.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:15:18 GMT):<br/>
So we would need a generic structure for it.  The classic validation is loaded into the validations as a special case.
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:16:22 GMT):<br/>
Ok, that makes sense, thank you
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:17:46 GMT):<br/>
Would trying it with clasic start block but mainnet endblock and vise versa made a good test if the validation of being on a proper chain works?
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:18:13 GMT):<br/>
or is clasic and mainnet already too different?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:18:39 GMT):<br/>
That would be a good test, as they share the network number.  Most chains signal their chainID as their networkID, but not classic and mainnet.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:19:11 GMT):<br/>
However one peer validation that is hard loaded is to query the classic fork block and require the hash to be correct.  I would expect peers to do that to us too.
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:19:39 GMT):<br/>
hmm, makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:20:38 GMT):<br/>
I am still on collecting thoughts phase on it now, but I will work on this as my next task probably
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 16:56:02 GMT):<br/>
@RoboCopsGoneMad FYI would your wiki page help here?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 16:58:08 GMT):<br/>
@sajz do you want to add to the next contributors call agenda please?
</p>
<p><strong>sajz</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 18:19:48 GMT):<br/>
sure, just added it to the 2022-01-18 BCC agenda.
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 19:50:54 GMT):<br/>
Hey All,

I wanted to provide a quick update to the Besu community before heading into the weekend. There were a few action items that I wanted to follow up on:

1. Share the details of the EF's Incentive program on a Wiki page: Sajida drafted up an overview of the program. It can be found here. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Besu+Execution+Client+Incentive+Program

2. Share the Validator Nodes requirements: I just published the recommendations here. The ConsenSys team pulled together its high-level requirements. We are happy to have a conversation about this with folks who are interested. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62234516

3. ConsenSys team to review Danno and Antoine's proposals regarding decentralizing management of funds. Several of the ConsenSys maintainers reviewed the proposals. I also reviewed. We've come up with a revised proposal to try to address our near-term needs while giving us time to fully formulate a long-term solution. We tried to incorporate elements from the other proposals and also wanted to consolidate our feedback into one proposal rather than sharing disjointed comments. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Near-Term+Besu+Incentive+Program+proposal

4. Community Practices Improvements: Apologies, I have been out sick a few days this week so I haven't made as much progress on implementing some of these as I hoped this week. I will be following up on them early next week. However, Sajida has gone ahead and published a draft Besu Roadmap for 2022, which is a great start. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Roadmap

Next Contributor Call: I am going to schedule an off-cycle Contributor call for either Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. Please let me know if you have feedback on timing. Looking at 12:30 PM ET on either day. I would like to propose this meeting be focused on reviewing the Near-Term Proposal I shared above around the Incentive Program.

Have a good weekend!
Grace
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 20:07:01 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Grace, I hope you get better soon
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 20:11:03 GMT):<br/>
@grace.hartley I placed comments on the near-term proposal
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 21:28:52 GMT):<br/>
I have a lot of thoughts.  I'll post it as a reply to the email and link the listserve link here.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 21:41:43 GMT):<br/>
Hello folks, ETC has decided on blocks for the upcoming upgrade of its different networks in the [ECIP-1104](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1104). I implemented it in this PR https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3256. We have already tested private networks with the other client (core-geth) and they connect and sync flawlessly before and after the activation
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Sat, 08 Jan 2022 12:37:58 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the approval @Antoine. What's the next step? Who should merge it? Is it ok if I squash+merge it myself or should I wait for someone else to do it?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 08 Jan 2022 20:15:21 GMT):<br/>
You should merge it
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 08 Jan 2022 20:15:39 GMT):<br/>
It’s your pr and you can squash it if you like
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Sat, 08 Jan 2022 22:33:43 GMT):<br/>
One small comment re: what it takes to run nodes
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Sat, 08 Jan 2022 22:33:54 GMT):<br/>
(Woah, I don't think I should still be a moderator here!)
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Sat, 08 Jan 2022 22:34:16 GMT):<br/>
Back to the nodes: I think you want to test, either on the canary validators, but at the _very_ least on testnets, that Besu works with multiple CL clients
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Sat, 08 Jan 2022 22:35:02 GMT):<br/>
If there is an issue on the CL side, we do expect EL teams to be able to switch clients. You don't want the first time you run through that process to be while a major issue is happening on mainnet.
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Sat, 08 Jan 2022 22:35:38 GMT):<br/>
I suspect this doesn't change "ongoing" costs much, but it will probably change setup efforts, given you need to make sure you have a secure setup with 2+ CL clients.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 08 Jan 2022 22:52:37 GMT):<br/>
timbeiko
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 08 Jan 2022 22:53:17 GMT):<br/>
Changed.  Generally speaking maintainers get moderator. If this does not match anyone's status DM me and I'll adjust.
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Sat, 08 Jan 2022 22:53:48 GMT):<br/>
Might be worth double-checking the emeritus list just to be sure.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Sun, 09 Jan 2022 11:49:00 GMT):<br/>
Done, apparently squash+merge is the only enabled option
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 09 Jan 2022 13:19:43 GMT):<br/>
Either day is fine with me.  Prefer Tuesday to do it sooner.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 05:08:30 GMT):<br/>
Like I said, I have lots of thoughts about the proposal on Friday, and here are some (but not all) of them on a wiki page - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/~shemnon/Response+to+Consensys%27+First+Incentive+Proposal
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 06:06:43 GMT):<br/>
That's a very good write-up, and I agree with its points. I commented on the near term proposal myself with some similar points. I am excited for the great development this can bring to the project. Remember, it will only fail if we let it :)
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:46:24 GMT):<br/>
what is this snyk security scan check that has appeared on PRs? how do I get added to whatever org I need to to see the results?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:00:39 GMT):<br/>
I was working with @macfarla to try and see where the old snyk reports went.  Looks like in that process snyk.io "helpfully" added a webhook without any direct prompting.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:00:45 GMT):<br/>
I hate snyk for one more reason now.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:01:10 GMT):<br/>
oh, so this is something we used to have enabled?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:01:36 GMT):<br/>
It never had build integration before.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:01:45 GMT):<br/>
Am willing to act on the results in the PR that got flagged, if I can see them
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:01:48 GMT):<br/>
and if it does gain build interation it shouldn't be via my personal github account
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:07:27 GMT):<br/>
My main concern with adding snyk integration is that these should not gate individual PRs unless the finding is caused by the PR.  Most findings are prompted by external events (jackson getting yet another CVE, for example).
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:08:50 GMT):<br/>
So really these would gate releases, but without some "burn in" time a library upgrade is risky.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:09:16 GMT):<br/>
Do: prevent devs from introducing new vulns
Don't: require devs to fix unrelated but new vuln "while they are in there"
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:09:28 GMT):<br/>
sounds reasonable
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 16:06:47 GMT):<br/>
Our quality profile in sonarcloud has been changed from The Besu Way back to Sonar way. Was that done on purpose?
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 16:09:47 GMT):<br/>
our gates are correct (80% test coverage, don't scan for duplicates)
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 16:10:33 GMT):<br/>
but our rules are not being enforced, and it looks like they never have, so I'm not gonna touch it right now. Just know that we are still operating with the default Sonar Way rules.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 16:11:30 GMT):<br/>
Here is the Besu Way rules:  https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/hyperledger/quality_profiles/show?language=java&name=Besu+way
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 18:55:45 GMT):<br/>
I thought the decision was sonar was advisory and not gating for commits?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 18:57:15 GMT):<br/>
Also, besu way lacks duplicate block detection.  Duplicate code blocks are a key aspect to how performance was improved in the EVM.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:51:08 GMT):<br/>
yes, correct, sonar is not gating. we are also skipping duplicate block detection.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:52:55 GMT):<br/>
it's really the ruleset that i'm trying to clarify. we have a set of rules that is based on the Sonar Way but has 11 deactivated
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:53:08 GMT):<br/>
thing is, that ruleset isn't being applied
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:24:23 GMT):<br/>
anyhoo, am asking a bunch of sonarqube questions because I was writing this: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Usage+of+SonarQube
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 22:35:05 GMT):<br/>
I started to think about migrating to slf4j using logback as the backend, but now I'm seeing this feature of log4j2, [Garbage-free logging](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/garbagefree.html) and I'm wondering if it's worth to take the risk of potentially increasing the memory footprint of the node b/c of this migration. I couldn't find any reference to a feature like that in the logback docs. Would it make sense to migrate to slf4j and keep using log4j2 as the backend?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 22:35:59 GMT):<br/>
it's definitely a possibility
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 22:36:18 GMT):<br/>
as we're moving towards modules, we'd want that anyway, so people can plug whatever logging backend they want
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 22:36:53 GMT):<br/>
ok, cool. I'll start the migration and then we can decide which implementation we include by default in the distribution
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 22:53:36 GMT):<br/>
awesome!

We have been asked by a customer to release besu 21.10.7 with further dependency upgrades (thanks to log4j-related scrutiny). I have cherry-picked dependency upgrades onto this branch. I still want to have another look tomorrow but I think it's what we need for 21.10.7 (might have to exclude a transitive dep for okhttp) https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3265

I have scheduled the next Contributor Call to be at 2 PM ET today. Here is the wiki agenda. See ya'll there! https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/2022-01-11+Besu+Contributor+Call+-+Off-Cycle
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 22:45:15 GMT):<br/>
My first thought is that belongs in the RC - but who is it that needs it?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 22:47:45 GMT):<br/>
When is Mystique supposed to activate?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 23:22:02 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/blob/master/_specs/ecip-1104.md says 
`This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Classic networks:

5_520_000 on Mordor Classic PoW-testnet (Jan 13th 2022)
5_578_000 on Kotti Classic PoA-testnet (Jan 23th 2022)
14_525_000 on Ethereum Classic PoW-mainnet (Feb 13th 2022)`
</p>

Exactly. Core-geth already released their Mystique enabled version and I built a custom Besu from `master` to use as a canary for Mordor. It would be great if we can have the release before any activation but I made the PR too close to the block of Mordor (it took us a while the inter client private test) and given that the great great majority of Mordor is still core-geth, it would be probably fine if we wait for the upcoming RC (is there a tentative date for it?)

the timing of the next RC (or will we be ready for 22.1.0?) that's dependent on feature work the mainnet team are doing - @GarySchulte or @SajidaZ can you shed any light on this?

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 12 Jan 2022 08:22:29 GMT):<br/>
FYI 21.10.7 build is all green except for sonar. https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3265
I'm waiting on more info from the customer (emailed) before I do the release - they have requested earlier versions of some dependencies and I want more context before we go rolling things back. I'm looking at output from snyk and the owasp gradle plugin and can't see the vulnerabilities they are highlighting eg they have asked for Final commons-codec: commons-codec:20041127.091804 which is a really old version https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/commons-codec/commons-codec
I also highlighted the CVE with tuweni which doesn't have an updated release yet - and the customer's report did not flag.

Can the reasons for the rollback be made public?  It feels weird doing a special release for "a customer" with opaque requirements when the ETC fork is being delayed into the RC branch.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 12 Jan 2022 16:54:34 GMT):<br/>
agree. I've reverted the rollback so 21.10.7 is back on 1.39.0 and requesting scan report from customer - they are using Nexus IQ - because I can't see any serious vulnerabilities with it on snyk or owasp

Has anyone encountered this issue when building Besu before? 
> Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.6.12+commit.27d51765.Darwin.appleclang)
What is the specific version that we require? I didn't find anything mentioning that our build depends on Solidity in our build from source page (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Building+from+source).
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 01:58:57 GMT):<br/>
we recently changed to

right. refreshing my memory on this https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3203 - in order to support later solc versions (0.8), we had to make updates to the contracts which mean they need at least 0.7 to compile.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 04:00:04 GMT):<br/>
can you raise a docs ticket to add required min solc version @lucassaldanha ?

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 04:00:59 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 04:02:49 GMT):<br/>
or - we can go back to depending on the gradle plugin bundled solc, assuming that they fix their dependency on an internal server to get the version info

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 15:51:23 GMT):<br/>
(a) we would want `main` and `.*release.*` to be in the list
(b) long lived development branches are problematic.  The merge is a special case making the pain worth it, but we should take actions to minimize the impact.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 18:02:51 GMT):<br/>
I think I may not be understanding the value of scanning other branches than the one being built, when looking for DCO violations.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 18:16:28 GMT):<br/>
The only advantage I see is when a release or main branch has a DCO failure the world stops until it is fixed. Otherwise other lines may sit DCO broken without notice.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 18:16:50 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 18:17:43 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 18:18:26 GMT):<br/>
why not use crypto signed commits?
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 18:56:57 GMT):<br/>
seems to me we already have the DCO check gating the PR, can we apply the same requirement for the merge action to succeed?
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 18:57:24 GMT):<br/>
I would wager that it is vanishingly rare that a committer would not intend to sign off or fix it if they didn't know it was an issue
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 18:58:40 GMT):<br/>
ideally we don't stop the world, we just stop the committer

You would need to go to the Hyperledger Governing Council, and they would need to go to battle with the LF.  There's better battles to be waged.

<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 19:16:38 GMT):<br/>

I am not sure what we could use as contributors to trigger the workflow, but if there was an auto-merge bot that ensured DCO pass and merged with a sign-off friendly commit message, I'd use it
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 19:45:43 GMT):<br/>
labels would be an obvious choice, but IDK if we can or want to restrict the use of labels to contributors

If anyone who has executed a release successfully without using the Gar-E tool from ConsenSys ( @shemnon ? @macfarla ?) could provide input on the simplest possible thing that would work, that would be perfect.

</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 20:57:14 GMT):<br/>
If we could go back to using the plugin that bundles solc  we would be at a better place. It is one less step for someone to be able to build Besu.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:01:08 GMT):<br/>
it did do a worldstop, but in retrospect it was a pretty easy manual fix to unstop the world - and if we let long-running branches continue on with DCO broken, that's going to be a much bigger pain if we then want to merge back into main (which I can attest to from cherry-picking commits for 21.10.7) - rather than someone just having to fix up their most recent commit which is relatively easy. Also an auto-merge bot sounds great!

What is and is not sufficiently legal also amazes me.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:34:22 GMT):<br/>
For stuff like merge me, where do the commit messages come from?  I don't want to just take the PR description since we have some pro-forma template for first-time filers.  I also don't want a smash of the commit chain, since a long-lived PR can have some really crazy commit messages.  I would want a squash commit where I can summarize anew what the PR is.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:35:39 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:36:59 GMT):<br/>
for commit message, seems that a PR title and link would provide sufficient detail
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:39:03 GMT):<br/>
I rarely use github as my UI for doing change archeology, so I still think we need more than the title.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:40:22 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger once used Gerrit and self hosted git repos as the main workflow, so there is precedent to change providers, so I would want the data still in the git stream.

Hi Diego, we can do a dedicated release for ETC hardfork before we do RC3. 
I think it is good to have separation of concerns here. We don't want to rush RC3 as RC2 is still pretty recent and we might want to test some improvements in RC3 that are not yet ready (we don't have a date). We recently had 21.10.7 minor release to answer a specific set of concerns for a customer and I don't see why we couldn't do a specific release for ETC hardfork too, so if you want to roll with it, that is fine by me at least.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 14 Jan 2022 12:46:54 GMT):<br/>
Awesome, I'll take a look on how a release is performed (probably following the notes from @RoboCopsGoneMad ) and I'll propose a 21.10.8 only adding that commit

For tomorrow's contributor call, the ConsenSys team won't be ready to discuss @shemnon's most recent proposal around the Incentive Program. The US team has been out of office today so we haven't had a chance to give it a detailed review.  

Would the group we prefer we go ahead with tomorrow's contributor call and discuss other topics (roadmap, LF metrics, other bodies of work) or would the group prefer we push back the call to later in the week when we will be prepared to discuss?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 02:08:26 GMT):<br/>
Nothing urgent from me but also this call is 1am my time so I won't vote either way.

draft PR for a nightly scan of docker images with trivy - one problem is that a notification to a consensys slack channel isn't visible to other hyperledger folks - is there an option to send alerts to RC? Or are we happy to have the report visible in CI - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3295

<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 03:49:09 GMT):<br/>
given this seems to be a regression, I'm thinking if it wouldn't make sense to make a `21.10.9` release out of it. This is particularly affecting public nodes of ETC which are running on Besu. Kotti was downgraded b/c it hasn't upgraded yet, but Metamask is unusable for Mordor (already upgraded)
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 04:11:46 GMT):<br/>
I built a custom version with this patch applied on top of `release-21.10.x` and Metamask is working again
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 04:37:58 GMT):<br/>
Alternative idea - would enabling dependabot alerts help? I've only used it on JS projects https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 05:00:31 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense to me. I've approved the PR. You should be able to draft the 21.10.9 release

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:33:14 GMT):<br/>
Nothing happens, there is no server, it's all pull based. 

When someone who has besu in their tap runs the update command the brew software goes out to that github url and looks for updates.  If it sees any then brew does the tasks described in the homebrew repo.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:33:54 GMT):<br/>
So the update step updates the repo so that when brew users update or upgrade the current release is reflected.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:34:31 GMT):<br/>
ty, will add to doc

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:37:21 GMT):<br/>
Build process, 3c and 4b - "PROBLEM: so far, release-like artifacts with any version number are created by the act of opening PRs, not approving them!"

This is not a problem.  While the artifacts are generated they only exist on the CI server.  The build automation does not push these artifacts out to the servers (jfrog, docker) unless it is (a) building on `main` or `release-*` _and_ (b) building a non`-SNAPSHOT` version.

You need to have CI server access to get to these artifacts so they are not exposed to the world unless published.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:40:32 GMT):<br/>
When there are bugs that are tripped by version numbers (for example debug code that only activates in `-SNAPSHOT` versions) I've seen such speculative version builds used by QA to run full test external test suites.  So it's not something that surprises me.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:58:42 GMT):<br/>
but can't anyone create a `release-*` and set the version in gradle properties to whatever they want?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 16:01:23 GMT):<br/>
The PR has to complete into the release-* branch, you can't just push a randomly named branch.  That and github has branch protection rules that are meant to prevent all but admins from pushing to that branch.  (if not we need to update them)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 16:01:44 GMT):<br/>
So the webhook triggers on a PR merge.  Which still has the must be reviewed requirement
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 16:28:19 GMT):<br/>
thx @shemnon i've updated it.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors?msg=ajar58onvYCK7yLDq) :wave: a few thoughts about this! 

Overall, I like the idea of having equally sized shares to both cover node operations and a "Besu Community Fund". I also like the idea of using maintainers contributing to mainnet over vesting periods in order to split the bulk of the fees+rewards. 

The one challenge I can see with this is withdrawal key custody and liquidation of validators. Assuming ConsenSys remains the employer of the majority of Besu mainnet maintainers, the majority of the funds each period will the flow back to them. I think for security + accounting reasons, that probably means you'd want to send withdrawal keys proportionally to CS for each period. For example, if in a vesting period, 8/12 of maintainers of Besu who worked on mainnet are at CS, they should get 2/3rds of withdrawal credentials from that vesting period. If it changes in the next one, the share is updated. 

This means that, at that point, CS would have full control over that share of the validators, and hence the ability to liquidate. I think it's probably right/fair/simplest for that right to be fully theirs. For validators whose withdrawal keys have been sent to HLF, a separate process can be used to decide on liquidation (which obviously takes into account that CS may have a large share of 'extra' validators and should avoid double-dipping). 

Talked with Grace and Daniela today about all of this, and we will be looking into how this is feasible legally + technically. I won't make the contributor call on Thursday, but Grace should have some updates there.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 20:12:01 GMT):<br/>
If validator keys are going to CS, then the other employers who have maintainer should also be able to get the keys by the same process CS receives them.  What I want to avoid is a set of rules for CS and a set of rules for everyone else.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 20:14:05 GMT):<br/>
> What I want to avoid is a set of rules for CS and a set of rules for everyone else.

If anything is my north star in this process, that would be it.

@diegoll is this release urgent for you guys or are you using your patched version
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 21:09:55 GMT):<br/>
Another release anyone? Seems the vertx upgrade has changed the behaviour of --rpc-http-cors-origins="*" which previously allowed any protocol but in the new vertx only allows http/https https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3296 so @diegoll is proposing 21.10.9 with that patch.

Hello folks, it seems that the `acceptanceTestsQuorum` [are failing](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hyperledger/besu/12792/workflows/a832e434-f9e7-446a-99bc-88c613a14192/jobs/70750) on `main`. I was trying to spot the problem for [PR#3285](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3285) but then I re-run it on main and it failed in the same way. It looks like a problem on the _ethsigner_ image regarding file system permissions
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 21:22:58 GMT):<br/>
Btw, did anyone tried to run Circle locally through their [CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/)? I tried with `$ circleci local execute --job acceptanceTestsQuorum` but it fails b/c it cannot download the `ubuntu-2004:202101-01` image. Maybe this one is intended to be used only within the cloud environment but I couldn't find anything about it in [the docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#available-machine-images)
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 21:56:30 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 23 Jan 2022 23:22:09 GMT):<br/>
Following up on a couple of things from last week's contributor call...
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 23 Jan 2022 23:22:23 GMT):<br/>
* trace API work - a number of folks are working on the different methods - we are tracking this one via this (zenhub) epic https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/2884 but it's not totally transparent via github - I just linked all the sub-issues as a workaround. @daniellehrner has a PR for trace_call in draft and we're aiming to reuse his approach there on the others
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 23 Jan 2022 23:24:27 GMT):<br/>
* approach to updating dependencies - wonder if we should doc this in a wiki page eg after the quarterly release, we raise a PR to update all available dependencies so that they can have maximum time to bake in. Any updates that require significant code changes - raise a separate issue in github and prioritise accordingly
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 23 Jan 2022 23:49:57 GMT):<br/>
* security scan options - I've looked at a few different things here as well as what other Consensys projects are doing - scanning the docker image seems like a good option. we can use trivy via GitHub actions to scan code and the docker image. this is an example of what the output looks like for ethsigner https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethsigner/security/code-scanning?query=is%3Aopen+autofilter%3Atrue - I'm still trying to make sense of what will be useful for Besu - @rjones are we able to experiment with github actions?

</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 24 Jan 2022 00:35:19 GMT):<br/>
here's a PR which has a few things in it https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethsigner/pull/427 - you can see github actions report
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 24 Jan 2022 00:35:44 GMT):<br/>

</p>

LFR https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3317 to add trivy scan of docker file - output looks like this: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3317/checks?check_run_id=4917443542

I can't see anything different in dockerhub - https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/besu/tags - but I'm not in the hyperledger org - is that what would do it? @rjones

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 24 Jan 2022 15:59:23 GMT):<br/>
It looks very noisy and I didn't see (out of the 49) an actual vulnerability to besu or a library besu includes.  They are all mostly about the docker image chosen or the secondary docker stuff auto-loaded by the docker image chosen.  While useful for docker security I wouldn't want to add this to every commit nor would I want it to gate as it provides too many non-actionable errors.

ConsenSys paying your salary and the incentive program each independently disqualify.  Ask CS to pay for ultimate.

It would be a mixed bag for sure.  It would have better luck Hyperledger wide, but IBM's role in their own blockchain hits at another blocker.

Shall we hold RC3 for @diegoll 's SLF4J PR ( https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3285 ) or just plan to do an RC4 after?  It seems to me that a quarterly release with this PR would have good optics after all of the log4j drama
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Mon, 24 Jan 2022 21:58:14 GMT):<br/>
Either is good by me with a slight preference for getting an RC3 out there sooner rather than later.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 24 Jan 2022 22:22:00 GMT):<br/>
Putting it in a RC/Beta first however it happens is good optics.  It's worth holding it a few days IMHO unless someone else needs RC3.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 24 Jan 2022 22:22:28 GMT):<br/>
Follow-on, who are the engineers running the release?  I dropped off the contributor call before we could have release schedule dicussions.

I was planning to be primary for the RC3 release, but it makes no difference to me.  My main interest is in breaking the logjam for main 
(and sort out the RCx / Beta nomenclature at next contrib call
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 01:12:13 GMT):<br/>
agree we don't want PRs gated on this. What's there now isn't useful because we've just updated all the dependencies :) I think if we'd had this in place it may have helped us proactively with some of the CVEs

I found a test yesterday that fails on Java 16 https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/3318, since we're also talking about going to Java 17, does it make sense to run all our tests on Java 16 and iron out errors first? @shemnon
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 01:56:28 GMT):<br/>
Java 16 is never getting another security update.  Target 17.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 01:57:17 GMT):<br/>
How would we know what to look for with 49 non-actionable warnings? Devs are not going to go through it with a fine tooth comb each time.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 01:57:56 GMT):<br/>
Dependabot may be the only viable alternative.  It's bad, but better than the other alternatives.
</p>
<p><strong>frankliawesome</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 02:00:16 GMT):<br/>
And the idea would be if we're passing everything on java 17  we're naturally backwards compatible with 16? Not sure if that's how it works
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 02:47:16 GMT):<br/>
have you tried your issue on Java 17 @frankliawesome ?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 02:48:33 GMT):<br/>
I would expect the things we need to action would be critical/high priority ie they would show above the 49 things and no need for fine tooth comb.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 02:48:38 GMT):<br/>
Dependabot is next on my list!
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 04:24:02 GMT):<br/>
If we compile on 17 we have to use a Java 17 vm or newer to run.  But if we set the minimum to 17 it will never compile on 16.

btw, it's worth to mention that through this PR we would not end the log4j2 drama on our side b/c we're still depending on it, but it'll be certainly easier to change the underlying logging backend in the near future (if there is interest I can make a follow up PR migrating log4j2 to, let's say, logback)

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 06:35:17 GMT):<br/>

Not going to nitpick here, but if slf4j doesn't support printf style we could wrap String.format

<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 22:48:42 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that should still work. The backend is still Log4J2 so the usage of SLF4J is transparent from the outside

Hey folks! The ConsenSys team reviewed Danno's Incentive Program proposal. I worked with @timbeiko to draft a new proposal. This proposal included Guiding Principles, Funds Distributions, and Processes in an attempt to break down the different functions of the program.

FYI I've just merged this PR which will do a nightly scan of the develop docker image so we can see what it looks like. https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3295 - if it causes any problems at all, or we don't like the report, it's easy to revert it.

Hey All - Here is the agenda for Monday evening ET/Tuesday morning AEST contributor call. The main topic of discussion will be Incentive Program's Proposal #3. We will record and take notes per usual for folks who aren't able to join. Thanks! https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/2022-01-31+Besu+Contributor+Call

Hey M1 fans... https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/9386/files#diff-648afe3d986261d8f2015b2b131b0e4a448d4dc6946cfde1a7a836876cee255eR23-R25

so we are just waiting on the next release of rocksdbjni.  I am not sure if that is 6.28.1 and/or when that would be.  Maven still only shows 6.27.3 as latest.  @shemnon do you have any more detail on the problem encountered with 6.27.3 ?

<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:42:43 GMT):<br/>
thanks - I either hadn't seen that issue or didn't remember it.  Now to figure out what is up with aws
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:43:16 GMT):<br/>
If needed we could host a rocksdbjni build on hyperledger's artifactory.  Not sure who will make the binary bits however...
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:43:38 GMT):<br/>
we would want to put a tag on the version to prevent maven central collision

<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:43:57 GMT):<br/>
I would be down for that.  m1 has been a persistent thorn in my side

Hello Sally. I just slightly rephrased it and removed the `FATAL` level. Let me know if it makes sense

Proposal 3.5 - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62237321 

Mostly using Patron as a generic word and adding my employer.  Diffs can be seen on this page - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62237303
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 18:32:51 GMT):<br/>
Would the ETC Coop be considered a _patron_ in this case?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 19:19:54 GMT):<br/>
EF is only considering Ethereum Mainnet work, so no.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 19:47:06 GMT):<br/>
Looks good, thanks! Did you verify that the custom logging config file still works as documented?
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 22:34:47 GMT):<br/>
No - the program is targeted to incentivise client teams building on the Ethereum mainnet, not ETC or other networks (e.g. private chains).
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 22:55:28 GMT):<br/>
Hello Tim. The majority of my contributions were not ETC-specific and benefits ETH Mainnet too
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Sat, 29 Jan 2022 14:36:09 GMT):<br/>
This is a really good point @diegoll - it is hard to differentiate between mainnet ethereum, etc and enterprise contributions, since they all share the same codebase.  

Just because you would contribute to ETC specific items does not mean you would not be contributing to eth mainnet functionality
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Sat, 29 Jan 2022 14:38:52 GMT):<br/>
I think it is going to be essentially impossible to make an 'ethereum mainnet' distinction on the basis of code commits.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Sat, 29 Jan 2022 14:42:43 GMT):<br/>
IMO it should be either all "besu code contributors"
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Sat, 29 Jan 2022 14:42:43 GMT):<br/>
IMO we should include all besu code contributors if the goal is to incentivize besu development for mainnet
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Sat, 29 Jan 2022 14:49:17 GMT):<br/>
your contributions have definitely helped ethereum mainnet.  the sjlf4j replacement is a great example.  If Hedera can be a patron, why not ETC?  They are functionally idential

I noticed we have dagger2 in evmtool, that is awesom. I watched this video on it over the weekend, https://youtu.be/oK_XtfXPkqw and I think it is really good fit for  us. I think I'd like to try it for the merge configuration stuff. There area lot of `isMergeEnabled()` conditionals popping up in various places, and I'd like to use Dagger to inject the class that is Merge aware into any client code that needs it.

<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Mon, 31 Jan 2022 18:20:19 GMT):<br/>
Apologies, I didn't realize that, @diegoll. 

Happy to elaborate on the call, but my general view is that to separate transaction/validator fees, using a broader approach might make sense, although you still probably want to have some "check" about contributing to things that benefit mainnet. IMO the examples that @GarySchulte states would be sufficient to be considered for a certain period. 

That said, access to the principal/withdrawal credential should go towards organizations who have shown long term, significant support towards Ethereum mainnet. A rough list of things that contribute towards that are developing major features (e.g. sync/DB improvements), implementing consensus changes (e.g. hard forks), leading/contributing to R&D or testing efforts beyond the single client, employing a dedicated team to work on this full time, etc. 

I'm pretty sure the EF will want to maintain discretion about who would be included there, with CS and HLF being two organizations we are comfortable with today, but we can definitely open the door for others to be considered.

i have a test (unrelated to my pr) that is now failing consistently on CI, but not locally. I see the test reports go to:
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 31 Jan 2022 19:59:03 GMT):<br/>
```file:///home/circleci/project/besu/build/reports/tests/test/index.html```
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 31 Jan 2022 19:59:25 GMT):<br/>
do we retain that anywhere or is that trashed when the container that runs the test terminates?

</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 31 Jan 2022 21:00:41 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 31 Jan 2022 21:09:07 GMT):<br/>
Some work at Hedera.  We want the RLP string and also want to point _into_ that RLP string instead of duplicating it.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 31 Jan 2022 21:09:57 GMT):<br/>
If we can use the bytes directly we would just use the sliced bytes, but it will go through a protobuf encoding.

<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 02:59:15 GMT):<br/>
Folks, what do you think of creating an open space for talking about technical stuff? We can do something in between technical and the chill, off the record, space that was mentioned some Contributors Calls back. There have been really interesting points mentioned today, like the JVM optimizations stuff, or using dagger2 in this same chat. I personally wanted to talk about moving Log4j2 to logback and I'm not sure if the Contributor Call is the better place to came up with that conversation given the current structure they have
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 02:59:54 GMT):<br/>
Discord will make this sooo much easier.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 03:00:17 GMT):<br/>
I think we should book a regular non-recorded tech chat call on the weeks without contributor calls.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 03:00:34 GMT):<br/>
And I think contributor calls are totally a good place to do it.  Agendas rarely fill up the time.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 03:00:50 GMT):<br/>
(and this tech chat should be on discord)
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 03:02:40 GMT):<br/>
I've never used the voice channels that Discord offer, maybe that would be useful
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 03:08:51 GMT):<br/>
I've received zero feedback on this proposal - if no objections I will turn off GitHub discussions in 48 hrs.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 03:09:49 GMT):<br/>
these past Contributor Calls have been taken mostly by the incentive program, which is fine and the right place to be, with an heterogeneous audience, which is great for those topics, not so sure about hard technical stuff, at least until this Incentive Program situation is resolved (which hopefully would be soon). Anyway, we can try to make something like Besu Dev Calls, non recorded, every other week. Most likely most of us would have something to share, discuss or whatever
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 13:54:36 GMT):<br/>

The test pass locally in my ide, from the command line with gradle in isolation, from the command line with gradle in a full build, and even if I pull down the executor docker image, and run the test on that, just like CI should be doing.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 23:05:09 GMT):<br/>

Hello Ry, would you have the recording of this? so it can be added into [the wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/2022-01-31+Besu+Contributor+Call)

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 16:16:30 GMT):<br/>
I think it's because BesuEventsImplTest depends on random numbers to generate some data.  More tests means different random numbers.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 16:17:25 GMT):<br/>
or maybe not.  But random numbers make the tester in me itchy.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 16:21:45 GMT):<br/>
maybe? nothing so far has felt nondeterministic though. I have never gotten a failure locally, despite trying all the vms
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 16:44:52 GMT):<br/>
looks like you are on OSX, what version? i'm on 12.1
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 16:45:02 GMT):<br/>
i'm totally grasping at straws here....
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 16:57:19 GMT):<br/>
ok, so what makes Danno's machine just like CI, but mine, Jiri and Gary's aren't.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:15:56 GMT):<br/>
It's a static field issue.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:16:50 GMT):<br/>
:thinking:
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:17:15 GMT):<br/>
`org.hyperledger.besu.config.experimental.MergeOptions` has a static field `mergeEnabled`.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:17:44 GMT):<br/>
`org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.chain.DefaultBlockchain` sets the `blockChoiceRule` with code that checks that field.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:18:00 GMT):<br/>
Even if the other tests properly un-set the static field this presents a test problem.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:18:12 GMT):<br/>
Because tests cannot be run in parallel then.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:18:32 GMT):<br/>
We had this issue with goQuorum compatability.  We cannot depend on static fields to drive feature flags.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:18:54 GMT):<br/>
i was planning on redoing this with dagger
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:18:58 GMT):<br/>
When set the reorg is not detected because the fork choice rule says it's never a reorg.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:19:09 GMT):<br/>
Dagger is a good solution to this.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:19:54 GMT):<br/>
so this breaks differently on different machine due to thread scheduling of the tests?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:20:20 GMT):<br/>
exactly.  Which is why I have a generally allergic reaction to mutable static fields.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:20:24 GMT):<br/>
statics should be static.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:26:40 GMT):<br/>
did it ever pass for you?
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:27:12 GMT):<br/>
and how many cores do you have? gradle runs a test on each core...
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:36:17 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the time danno, really appreciate it. tough to fix bugs when you can't see em.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:42:49 GMT):<br/>
It passes for me if I run just those tests or do an incremental test that doesn't run any merge tests.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:43:16 GMT):<br/>
The reason bisect triggered it is that there were so many broad based changes the incremental tests ran the tests in question
</p>

license checking - I just created an issue here - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/3366 - any objections to changing the license checking plugin to match what we use for other consensys projects?

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:04:11 GMT):<br/>
Hi, Besu People. Let's talk about ACLs and stuff. Would here or Discord be better?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:07:45 GMT):<br/>
I invited the confusingly-named @RyanJJones10 to join [this GitHub group](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/besu-triage/members), which has `Triage` permission on all **Besu** repos.
</p>
<p><strong>RyanJJones10</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:07:45 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:09:20 GMT):<br/>
I noticed that the [overall parent group](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/besu-contributors/repositories) had _very broad_ permissions. I changed those all to `Triage`, since the child groups all have more appropriate powers.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:14:51 GMT):<br/>
Triage rights are not enough for how the PMs at ConesnSys want to use Zenhub.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:23:34 GMT):<br/>
ok, maintain? write?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:24:18 GMT):<br/>
Should there be a side group of Besu PMs with broader powers that are not maintainers?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:25:05 GMT):<br/>
Besu Contributors has 40 members. Only 29 people are in the maintainers file.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 21:29:48 GMT):<br/>
triage seems ok to me.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 21:29:58 GMT):<br/>
not sure what is missing there
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 21:36:02 GMT):<br/>
Zenhub requires write, it checks for it and refuses to work unless it has it.  It's in their FAQ.  So without write access zenhub is a read-only too.

I've set it to Maintain for now.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 21:47:00 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/besu-triage/repositories take a look
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 21:51:57 GMT):<br/>
@RyanJJones10 can you confirm you have the access you need now?
</p>
<p><strong>RyanJJones10</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 21:57:35 GMT):<br/>
It doesn't seem to be the case in Zenhub. I have the access in GH but not ZH - https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000037261-github-permissions-and-access-in-zenhub
</p>
<p><strong>RyanJJones10</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 21:57:46 GMT):<br/>
I could be doing something wrong so will do some more testing
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 22:01:19 GMT):<br/>
I blame zenhub.  I think you need plain old write as a github permission.
</p>
<p><strong>RyanJJones10</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 22:01:42 GMT):<br/>
That is correct
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 22:04:36 GMT):<br/>
ahhhh its a zenhub thing
</p>
<p><strong>RyanJJones10</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 22:27:15 GMT):<br/>
Definitely a ZH thing. Any ideas on how to get me write access in ZH then?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 01:35:04 GMT):<br/>
I set the access from `Maintain` to `Write`
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 03:02:15 GMT):<br/>
I remember this is why we ended up making @SajidaZ and @VijayMichalik "non-code" maintainers, because there didn't seem to be a way around it at the time. To move tickets between pipelines in zenhub, you need access to change the status of the ticket.

<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 16:33:00 GMT):<br/>
fyi, unit testing with dagger is kinda complicated. i haven't formed an opinion on it yet
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 16:33:01 GMT):<br/>
https://dagger.dev/dev-guide/testing.html
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 16:39:54 GMT):<br/>
Yea, we will still need unit, integration, and acceptance tests.  Hard to shake that.  It also will complicate our unit and integration story. That figures into why I never had time to take a serious swing at it.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 16:57:34 GMT):<br/>
i think it's ok so far. I'm still unclear how much cross-dependency happens when wiring up components. I think you have to specify both how something is created, and what classes it can be injected into, which gives me pause
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 16:57:56 GMT):<br/>
on the one hand, i like being forced to draw an explicit dependency graph
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 16:58:45 GMT):<br/>
on the other hand, then the wiring diagram itself becomes rigid as you decouple dependencies. my gut says I'm ok with that tradeoff.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 17:00:01 GMT):<br/>
the documentation is kinda meh, and you're gonna get a lot of android hits when searching for stuff
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 17:00:47 GMT):<br/>
but I am making progress, so far so good, 7/10 would buy again
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:41:43 GMT):<br/>
re: dagger. how do we feel about having a context like component that needs to be passed around to get dependencies from.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:43:02 GMT):<br/>
There are static accessors that can be used to get dependencies, but those are isolated dep graphs, that are recomposed at the point the are staticly accessed. Ok for somethings, not ok for stateful things
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:47:59 GMT):<br/>
is this to avoid the huge spaghetti bowl of BesuCommand?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:48:28 GMT):<br/>
dumb question, sorry - is Dagger working with the generic DI annotations
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:48:28 GMT):<br/>
dumb question, sorry - is Dagger working with the generic DI annotations? I know Java built some to quell the Spring folks
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:48:37 GMT):<br/>
for instance, configuration state. Lets say DefaultBlockchain needs to know if `--Xmerge-enabled` was flipped. If you get the MergeConfiguration using the static factories that Dagger produces. the singleton scope of the configuration object is relative to that newly created component (whole new object graph). It will be totally disconnected from one created by BesuControllerBuilder. I think the way to solve this is making sure every new one is produced by MergeOptions, but for cases where you can't produce the new thing from scratch, you have to pass around some sort of UrComponent.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:48:58 GMT):<br/>
yes, this is to address things like besu command
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:49:48 GMT):<br/>
it uses some JSR 330 annotations, but those are not sufficient. Realistically you'll need a mix of those and Daggers oen
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:50:04 GMT):<br/>
got it
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:50:25 GMT):<br/>
I mean, it doesn't add business value, it's just tech debt - so it's been kinda hard to get at it
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:50:31 GMT):<br/>
If dagger is "done right" after the assembly there should be no need for static accessors. I think the idea is if you need a component you ask for a `Provider<Foo>` to be injected, just make sure Foo isn't singleton.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:50:31 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:50:53 GMT):<br/>
totally right, i've made a singleton with nothing static
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:51:31 GMT):<br/>
so you don't pass around a single context like component, you inject the specific providers needed.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:51:32 GMT):<br/>
however, we need an incremental path, I don't think Dagger All The Things is gonna be realistic on a long lived branch
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:52:12 GMT):<br/>
right, that would work fine if an object was fully managed
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:52:14 GMT):<br/>
Where would we need the context like component?  Is this from "outside" the dagger injected systems
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:53:16 GMT):<br/>
we'd need it in cases where an object is not created by dagger
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:53:39 GMT):<br/>
If i I have dependencies, and I am not managed by dagger, I have 2 ways to get them
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:54:09 GMT):<br/>
1) have a component (basically any graph of dependent objects) passed to me, where I can ask it for the things I need.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:54:36 GMT):<br/>
I think the component generated by dagger would be that context component.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:54:46 GMT):<br/>
2) Statically create my own new graph. That will use the configured providers. If all of those are sufficient, great
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:54:51 GMT):<br/>
yes, thats right
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:55:52 GMT):<br/>
So that component could be long lived, but we can get fresh pieces as the system goes on.  It will hide the tracking of the singletons and create fresh dependenceis as we need them
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:56:00 GMT):<br/>
What classes did you have in mind?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:56:15 GMT):<br/>
that would be created throught     the life of the system
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:57:32 GMT):<br/>
one sec, let me try to avoid having to do that first, listen to this
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:58:21 GMT):<br/>
I wanna try it with the Configuration objects, because I think I can make a Module/Provider that lives in the CLI package, and creates a new Configuration object for anything that needs it. These wouldn't be singletons, but that wouldn't matter, because the Options don't change, and can just be re-read from the provider.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:58:59 GMT):<br/>
so in that case, it would be fine to say "gimme a config graph" and it's brand new, but generated from the respective options.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:59:13 GMT):<br/>
Then we can move the CLI flags into modules too...
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 23:59:42 GMT):<br/>
exactly. the first impl is just annotating an option, and making the `toDomainObject` the providing method
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:00:24 GMT):<br/>
sounds reasonable.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:02:36 GMT):<br/>
right, it'll be cool if it works. now wrt incrementally applying this to stuff... I'm imagining a BesuComponent that gets passed into constructors, and added to as dependent classes are updated. Eventually a constructor shrinks down to that being the only parameter, at which point you should be able to treat it as fully managed, and then let Dagger inject each one back into ... a new constructor that looks just like the old one.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:04:53 GMT):<br/>
realistically BesuComponent is just a root of other useful dependency graphs
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:09:36 GMT):<br/>
is it fair to say that this strategy would not work for any component that has mutable state?  Thinking about MergeContext of course
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:09:56 GMT):<br/>
Rather than pass in the compoent why not have the component populate the constructor?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:10:41 GMT):<br/>
Eventually as higher level objects become injected we will see unneeded args in the constructor, and then trim those out./
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:10:55 GMT):<br/>
thats possible, as long as the thing it is populating from is managed
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:11:37 GMT):<br/>
so mutable state is ok.... as long as you are mindful of how the thing is scoped within the component
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:12:14 GMT):<br/>
dagger will manage singletons vs prototypes for you
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:13:38 GMT):<br/>
having dagger fill the constructor is fine, but everything that you expect to be passed in has to be managed
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:14:32 GMT):<br/>
i think thats really an end state, not a starting point, which is what i'm talking through here. at some point I have to commit something, and it will look halfassed no matter what
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:19:20 GMT):<br/>
looking forward to seeing your PR.  will it be separate / ahead of the merge execution endpoint PR or embedded in it?
</p>

I'm gonna collect this convo into a doc to go with a different PR into main. After I do this for the merge options, i'm gonna see if I can apply the lessons learned to the Jumpdest cache config I did this summer. I think that could be a good demo of the technique.

<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 13:46:08 GMT):<br/>
Thought about this some more, and it won't work as long as Configurations are decoupled from Options. That is a one way dependency so the Module that @Provides the Configuration to the Component would need access to the Option. We either have to pass around a BesuComponent or move the PicoCLI annotations on to the Configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 13:53:18 GMT):<br/>
Maybe we can introduce a new root level gradle module that depends on both Options and Configurations, and let all app code depend on that, but wouldn't that be circular?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 19:31:48 GMT):<br/>
we probably need to re-architect it.  CLI Flags are a module, configurations depend on the flags. (using `@Named` annotations)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 19:32:09 GMT):<br/>
CLI flags are multiple modules.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Sat, 05 Feb 2022 23:40:13 GMT):<br/>
ok, where do we put them to avoid the circular dependency?
</p>

Make CLI f;ags their own module - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/39ee371556749a7123630566ae22981454c6df65/ethereum/evmtool/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/evmtool/EvmToolCommandOptionsModule.java#L36

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 06 Feb 2022 14:12:14 GMT):<br/>
Then add @Inject constructors to the Configuration objects.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 06 Feb 2022 14:12:47 GMT):<br/>
Make multiple CLI flag modules, one per configuration object at least.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Sun, 06 Feb 2022 14:50:35 GMT):<br/>
k, thats what I had in mind. Would put the modules right in the same package with the Configuration

<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 20:01:48 GMT):<br/>
anyone know why BesuController has a static inner Builder class that returns BesuControllerBuilders ? According to usage it seems like those are convenience methods used by tests, but I don't see why this isn't at least on BesuControllerBuilder
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 20:38:07 GMT):<br/>
it seems like it is being used as a factory to construct the subclasses of BesuController.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 15:32:58 GMT):<br/>
My take is that most of what the besu controller builder does will be subsumed by a dagger component.  The logic would be inverted and we would used flags to pick modules rather than letting the builder pick the implementations.  Possibly even in-module, have a super module that the provider returns what the main if blocks `fromGenesisConfig` spits out.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 18:49:31 GMT):<br/>
same thinking here. I like the idea of having the genesis config help drive the module layout
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 21:19:04 GMT):<br/>
I never really ascribed to the builder pattern. I find it rather annoying whenever a refactor is needed.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 21:19:26 GMT):<br/>
Just moving off that pattern would reduce some issues imo.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 23:39:31 GMT):<br/>
hoo buddy are you gonna like @Provides in dagger

WebSocketRequestHandlerTest is flaky. It's got some kind of concurrency issue
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 23:47:40 GMT):<br/>
I think there is a way to get some reporting out of CircleCI on which tests are flaky, which might be candidates to have dagger applied to them.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 03:37:28 GMT):<br/>
Flaky tests are reported here https://app.circleci.com/insights/github/hyperledger/besu/workflows/default/tests - the quorum ATs have been problematic lately and I don't know why

Hello. Is `create-contract-permission` branch of _permissioning-smart-contracts_ ready to use in production? I'll happily work on it under some guidance. What has to be done there? I can see no tests – I could write some, is that ok?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 18:20:16 GMT):<br/>
gm besu!
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 18:20:26 GMT):<br/>
Do we have a planned date for 22.1.0 release yet?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 18:23:54 GMT):<br/>
It is not production ready. It was done as a spike for granular account permissioning. However in the end we decided that using OpenZeppelin access control and roles was a better solution for the use case we were looking at. We kept the code as a branch just in case but I would recommend looking into the OpenZeppelin stuff before considering going back to that branch.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 18:58:15 GMT):<br/>
@loziniak do you have a use case in mind for the permissioning, or are you just looking for something to work on?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 19:46:32 GMT):<br/>
Anyone know what is this lgtm alerts badge we have on besu repo? when I click on the link I get "page not found" https://lgtm.com/projects/g/hyperledger/besu/alerts/
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 19:54:27 GMT):<br/>
It appears LGTM has data problems for besu in particular - https://lgtm.com/search?q=besu
</p>
<p><strong>loziniak</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 20:05:31 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I have a usecase. I'm running a private chain and want to disallow contract creation by users, just allow some admin account(s) to do this. Exactly the same as this person on StackExchange: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/97196/how-to-disable-deployment-of-smart-contracts-on-besu-private-network
</p>
<p><strong>loziniak</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 20:07:48 GMT):<br/>
I'll also check OZ access, thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 20:09:11 GMT):<br/>
Yep I think OZ might make your life easier here rather than reinventing the wheel
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 21:02:23 GMT):<br/>
yeah, it works for the other besu repos
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 21:55:24 GMT):<br/>
any ideas why it doesn't work for besu?
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 22:03:36 GMT):<br/>
can we push a tag to hyperledger/besu repo outside of the pipeline?  We'd like to tag the last `:merge` image that supports kintsugi as `:kintsugi`, and then drop support for the test net
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 22:04:14 GMT):<br/>
the test net is not going to be up much longer, and building out shims for it are not a good use of time
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 22:07:24 GMT):<br/>
I have never tried it, but I would imagine the permissions required for a tag are the same as for pushing to main.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 22:07:41 GMT):<br/>
since merge has no commit restrictions it should work.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 09 Feb 2022 23:17:25 GMT):<br/>
would it make sense to create a pre-release in github using that new tag?

I've got a PR to fix an NPE in legacy mode: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3390

There's a bit of existing code in this function that I'm not following: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3390/files#diff-301e1731fa376a0f0177dbe3d4f5da63c86c9cb0adbc788687b3cc41340d49ecL69

Is there a reason why an empty ForkId list returns null in legacy mode (and causes an NPE), or a new ForkId in non-legacy mode? Can they both return new ForkIds? @abdelhamidbakhta @rai
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 10 Feb 2022 06:46:33 GMT):<br/>
nope. I can't even load it in the admin UI to see what's wrong. File a support ticket with LGTM?
