The bounty is left open for participants to showcase their creativity :smile: Basically, anything that helps enterprises using Ethereum. Two ways we think about this are either using mainnet as a way to bridge various private networks (even if it's as simple as posting data from a private network to mainnet and retrieving it from another network) or to make things easier for enterprises using Besu on mainnet (think integrations, reliability, perfomance, etc.). \n\nHopefully that helps! happy to answer any follow up questions.","username":"timbeiko","ts":"2019-11-04T15:48:23.561Z"}

{"msg":"We are creating a proposal in the Capital Markets SIG (CMSIG) to workshop a simple Token using TTF (Token Taxonomy Framework) towards implementation in Besu. This is at the suggestion of Mani Pillai CEO of swapshub. It would be great to have some participation from the Besu community.\nThe TTF has active membership from Accenture, IBM and others who are prominent in Hyperledger.\nThe CMSIG  is the ideal venue for this, since we have a mix of members, both business and technical -we may be able to attract more since we are completely open. The actual effort can be housed in Hyperledger labs.\n\nWould be good to know whether there are any comparable initiatives out there.\nWe can rapidly bootstrap a basic token definition and make plans for a BESU implementation.\n\nOur meeting is tomorrow  (Jan 15) at 10 am EST (15 UTC) join us at https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community.backup  The agenda is here\n https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CMSIG/2020-01-15","username":"VipinB","ts":"2020-01-14T18:07:37.409Z"}

The community response points to Github being a more familiar tool, as well as general access being already available, making it a lower barrier to entry to log issues, view progress of work, and engage with other contributors to the project. Based on this, we are considering switching the repository of Besu tickets from Jira to Github. Are there other considerations or other feedback that we should think about?

We're getting really close to encouraging ETH2 enthusiasts to try our Teku and currently it's hard to setup besu in a way that will work - those performance improvements will fix that.\n\nSo, would it be reasonable to backport those optimisations to the 1.4 RC breanch and release an RC2 next week?

{"msg":"PicoCLI has the notion of `fallbackValue` https://picocli.info/#fallbackValue-annotation which we are not using in Besu. If an option is specified without a value on the command line (ie arity 0..1), it is assigned the `fallbackValue`.  It's different to `defaultValue` (which is assigned if the option is not specified at all on the command line). Without using the ~fallbackValue~, there is some unexpected behaviour eg boolean attributes will be toggled if specified more than once on the command line. In Besu we currently get around this by custom code that throws a ParameterException if an option is specified more than once on the command line and/or in config files.\nI propose\n* adding `fallbackValue` to any CLI options that have arity of 0..1\n* any boolean options that currently have arity of 1 can be changed to arity of 0..1 with a `fallbackValue`\nThe custom code that prevents options being specified multiple times could be removed, but this requires discussion since it is changing existing behaviour.","username":"macfarla","ts":"2020-04-27T00:15:28.552Z"}

Couple of things to bear in mind that participating members do not _need_ to be validators - the can join as members - there is an upper bound on effective number of validators.

{"msg":"Hello, we are considering introducing lombok (https://projectlombok.org/) to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes. One of the main reason is to have some consistency across the codebase when using some design patterns. For instance, currently there are 3 different ways of implementing Builder pattern in Besu. We also believe introducing Lombok would improve readability and maintainability of the codebase. We have a showcase pull request (https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1148) to illustrate the potential benefits of using Lombok. This PR uses Value and Builder annotations from Lombok, the impacted class is a configuration object. This is a common case where we have repetitive code that could be drastically reduced. The impact for contributors would be to add a plugin in their favorite IDE. All instructions for IDE setup are here: https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij. Please feel free to comment the pull request and/or discuss here if you have strong opinions. We plan to add a whitelist of Lombok annotations that are ok to use.

{"msg":"So what I mean by \"magic\" is the generation that Lombok is doing. There is an annotation in the source file that \"magically\" expands to become a full builder. That introduces extra complexity for someone reading the source code because it's another layer of indirection - you can't just follow through the Java code in your IDE you have to also know or lookup exactly what the lombok annotations expand into.  It's only a small amount of additional complexity and yes people will learn them but my experience is that complexity winds up being a problem because lots of little complexities build up.\n\nCode is written much less often than it is read and writing code is much simpler than reading it (especially since the things Lombok can generate can generally also have source code generated by IDEs).  As a result when I evaluate changes like this I inevitably land on the side of keeping code as simple to read as possible even if that makes writing it harder.  I appreciate that you're making different trade offs and seeing the cost/benefits differently - it's ok for us to disagree on that. :)\n\nI thought it was important to raise my concerns that we were reducing lines of code at the cost of extra complexity.

Dealing with generated code during build phase is transparent, do you see any issue @jframe  ? @ajsutton  I agree code is written less times than reading. And this is why i believe we should make reading easy as possible. Some of our classes are very big, and more than half of the code is for getters, setters, builders, constructors. They take place. I mean even mentally they take place in your brain. IMO it is better to have only code that brings business logic. You know directly what is important. And it was definitely important to raise your concerns indeed. I would agree if you were planning to use more complex annotations.

{"msg":"Immutables is definitely much, much nicer than Lombok.  It worked out of the box with the IDE and preserves the ability to \"click through\" code.  The fact that we write an interface to define the object accurately reflects the fact that the implementation comes from elsewhere and Immutables actually generates a full Java source file for the implementation it generates.  As a result you can find implementations of the interface and be taken to perfectly readable Java code defining it (it's even more lines of code that we'd write but I'm fine with that). \n\nThere's magic happening but the generated source file shows exactly what's been done and the complexity and need to understand Immutables impact writing code, not reading it - you have to know to write an interface with the right annotation and that the generated class will magically appear with an `Immutable` prefix in the name but since code is written much less than it's read even if you have to look up that construct every time you need it you don't get the same \"death by a thousand cuts\" you do if that complexity impacts reading the code.\n\nBasically immutables resolves all the concerns I had with Lombok.

{"msg":"Hello. `eth_estimateGas` on Besu rejects if we send the `nonce` argument with an error `Caused by: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field \"nonce\" (class org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.api.jsonrpc.internal.parameters.JsonCallParameter), not marked as ignorable (11 known properties: \"gasPrice\", \"value\", \"gasLimit\", \"gas\", \"from\", \"to\", \"feeCap\", \"gasPremium\", \"strict\", \"data\", \"payload\"])`.\n\nthe spec https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API doesn't specify anything about `nonce`. however, other platforms like go-ethereum/GoQuorum ignore if that argument is sent. This is useful when using Web3j Transaction request factory methods to build the Transaction object (code https://github.com/web3j/web3j/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/web3j/protocol/core/methods/request/Transaction.java), as we can re-use the same Transaction object to estimate and send. Having the error from Besu means that we need to build the transaction twice.\n\nWould it make sense for Besu to do the same behaviour as Get/GoQuorum? ofc, other option is also create a change on Web3j to force the nonce as optional and/or allow to easily deep copy a transaction object.

In and of itself this shouldn't cause any problems, just implement `JsonRpcMethod` and provide a way to register it via the plugin. The problems start when you want to do something vaguely interesting on the endpoint, let's say you wanted to override `eth_getTransactionCount` to have an optional to parameter you would need to get hold of an instance to `BlockchainQueries`. To do this we add something into the `PluginContext` via `addService` maybe a class with a bunch of things we deem acceptable?

Hyperledger staff has asked the Hyperledger Besu team to participate in Grace Hopper's Open Source Day on October 1st. It is a great opportunity to showcase Hyperledger Besu and get new developers working on our codebase. To prep for this event, Besu needs to have 30+ good first issues labeled in the project. Besu currently has 14 good first issues opened. Can this group work together to add any additional good first issues in the coming weeks? We need the 30 to be uploaded by September 15th.

{"msg":"Hi @atoulme , regarding the Incentive Program that the EF rolled out here are some clarifications: it is not a grant, it is a multi year program designed to incentivize client teams (organizations) to dedicate time and resources to Ethereum roadmap (testnet participation, spec implementation, testing, R&D etc). Specifically to prepare for the Merge and the upcoming milestones, like Sharding. The 4608 ETH that the EF is prodiving to run the validators will not be available for client teams upfront, it will be used to load the validators but the withdrawal keys will be kept by the Ethereum Foundation and disclosed over several years. However, client teams will be able to directly access the rewards generated by those validators over time, if the team keeps contributing (this will be judged by the EF). The program can not be regarded as a grant (where money is directly available) but it will certainly lead to creation of grants/bounties once it's up and running (post-merge, the validators will be generating rewards). The EF just recently made the information public, but for the past 4 months the team at Consensys has worked on setting up the infrastructure to be able to run those validators safely. The infra is ready to receive validators but the handover has not happened yet. Let me know if you have any questions or remarks on this topic.","username":"sajz","ts":"2021-12-16T08:39:48.133Z"}

We want Besu to stay that way and to grow to be even better.\n\nWith the announcement, we (ConsenSys) wants this incentive program to benefit the Besu community. We are committed to finding a way to ensure contributors are rewarded for their work on the project. We would love this group’s feedback on how best to incentivize the program. \n\nIf the group agrees, I'd like to propose we as the Besu community discuss this topic in detail at the next contributor call on December 21st at 11 AM ET. ConsenSys would be happy to answer any questions others have. Tim from the EF is also planning on joining to help answer questions and provide additional context on the program. We'd also like to begin the process of how we can leverage these funds to enhance the Besu community.

{"msg":"> Hi, regarding the Incentive Program that the EF rolled out here are some clarifications: it is not a grant, it is a multi year program designed to incentivize client teams (organizations) to dedicate time and resources to Ethereum roadmap (testnet participation, spec implementation, testing, R&D etc). Specifically to prepare for the Merge and the upcoming milestones, like Sharding. The 4608 ETH that the EF is prodiving to run the validators will not be available for client teams upfront, it will be used to load the validators but the withdrawal keys will be kept by the Ethereum Foundation and disclosed over several years. However, client teams will be able to directly access the rewards generated by those validators over time, if the team keeps contributing (this will be judged by the EF). The program can not be regarded as a grant (where money is directly available) but it will certainly lead to creation of grants/bounties once it's up and running (post-merge, the validators will be generating rewards). The EF just recently made the information public, but for the past 4 months the team at Consensys has worked on setting up the infrastructure to be able to run those validators safely. The infra is ready to receive validators but the handover has not happened yet. Let me know if you have any questions or remarks on this topic.\n\nJust found I had Sajida’s message saved up.

{"msg":"Hey All,\n\nI wanted to provide a quick update to the Besu community before heading into the weekend. There were a few action items that I wanted to follow up on:\n\n1. Share the details of the EF's Incentive program on a Wiki page: Sajida drafted up an overview of the program. It can be found here. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Besu+Execution+Client+Incentive+Program\n\n2. Share the Validator Nodes requirements: I just published the recommendations here. The ConsenSys team pulled together its high-level requirements. We are happy to have a conversation about this with folks who are interested. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62234516\n\n3. ConsenSys team to review Danno and Antoine's proposals regarding decentralizing management of funds. Several of the ConsenSys maintainers reviewed the proposals. I also reviewed. We've come up with a revised proposal to try to address our near-term needs while giving us time to fully formulate a long-term solution. We tried to incorporate elements from the other proposals and also wanted to consolidate our feedback into one proposal rather than sharing disjointed comments. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Near-Term+Besu+Incentive+Program+proposal\n\n4. Community Practices Improvements: Apologies, I have been out sick a few days this week so I haven't made as much progress on implementing some of these as I hoped this week. I will be following up on them early next week. However, Sajida has gone ahead and published a draft Besu Roadmap for 2022, which is a great start. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Roadmap\n\nNext Contributor Call: I am going to schedule an off-cycle Contributor call for either Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. Please let me know if you have feedback on timing. Looking at 12:30 PM ET on either day. I would like to propose this meeting be focused on reviewing the Near-Term Proposal I shared above around the Incentive Program.\n\nHave a good weekend!\nGrace","username":"grace.hartley","ts":"2022-01-07T19:50:54.708Z"}

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors?msg=ajar58onvYCK7yLDq) :wave: a few thoughts about this! \n\nOverall, I like the idea of having equally sized shares to both cover node operations and a \"Besu Community Fund\". I also like the idea of using maintainers contributing to mainnet over vesting periods in order to split the bulk of the fees+rewards. \n\nThe one challenge I can see with this is withdrawal key custody and liquidation of validators. Assuming ConsenSys remains the employer of the majority of Besu mainnet maintainers, the majority of the funds each period will the flow back to them. I think for security + accounting reasons, that probably means you'd want to send withdrawal keys proportionally to CS for each period. For example, if in a vesting period, 8/12 of maintainers of Besu who worked on mainnet are at CS, they should get 2/3rds of withdrawal credentials from that vesting period. If it changes in the next one, the share is updated. \n\nThis means that, at that point, CS would have full control over that share of the validators, and hence the ability to liquidate. I think it's probably right/fair/simplest for that right to be fully theirs. For validators whose withdrawal keys have been sent to HLF, a separate process can be used to decide on liquidation (which obviously takes into account that CS may have a large share of 'extra' validators and should avoid double-dipping). \n\nTalked with Grace and Daniela today about all of this, and we will be looking into how this is feasible legally + technically. I won't make the contributor call on Thursday, but Grace should have some updates there.","username":"timbeiko","ts":"2022-01-18T20:07:49.423Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors?msg=ajar58onvYCK7yLDq","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors?msg=ajar58onvYCK7yLDq","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}
