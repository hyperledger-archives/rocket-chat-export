Hi everyone,
thank you for yesterday's friendly call and follow-up email. It was easy to follow the instructions and join this channel.
I've already forked Besu repository and pushed changes we've made in a single commit to Marklar branch. Sensitive information has been removed from our code and replaced with Marklar keyword.
Commit: https://github.com/jlochman/besu/commit/f430cb927acf27b2804ecf75c81446077e7fa589

You'll see shortly, that the vast majority of our custom business logic is in MarklarUtils, where each method has been commented. Overuse of the "static" keyword is intentional and should aim to make our changes as simple as possible. Hopefully, it won't be much difficult to dig in and understand our code.

To have all the information in one place, I add a link to WP: https://gentlebit.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GEN_Blockchain_Whitepaper.pdf

Hi again, to better grasp how the self-regulating mechanism of our monetary policy works, I've modelled 3 different blockchain scenarios. If you have any questions, please, don't hesitate to ask.

Hi everyone,
It's been two weeks since our discussion started. Did you have a chance to look at the changes we've introduced in our commit? If something wouldn't be clear, I'll gladly answer any of your questions.
