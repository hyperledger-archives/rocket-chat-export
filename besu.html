<p><strong>Hyungsuk Kang</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 18:01:24 GMT):<br/>
is besu pantheon? if it is, can I just jump straight to its quickstart tutorials?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 18:06:17 GMT):<br/>
Yes, with some name changes.  We haven't moved the repos over yet but it is anticipated to include stuff like quickstart.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 18:06:51 GMT):<br/>
so stuff like `bin/pantheon` might becomes `bin/besu` but all the options should remain the same.

Any data on privacy? We are now meeting on the Privacy and confidentiality subgroup of the Architecture WG. We were wondering about Orion? We would appreciate if a privacy expert from Besu takes a look at our paper 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 15:31:45 GMT):<br/>
None of our engineers working on privacy are currently in this rocket chat.  Let me see if I can get them to onboard and discuss.

@VipinB - is there specific information you're looking for?  I can organise for someone to look at the paper if you point me in the direction of it.  

Here's links to the privacy and Orion documentation (the Pantheon documentation will be rebranded as Besu documentation shortly): 
https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/Private-Transaction-Processing/
https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Groups/
https://docs.orion.pegasys.tech/en/latest/
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 00:32:29 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @madelinemurray That is a good start. Will you (or one of your associates) be able to do a presentation on the Privacy and Confidentiality sub group call 2 weeks from today at 11 am EDT (3 pm UTC) the call is run by Mic Bowman. He will have someone from TCF (Trusted Computing Framework- soon to be renamed) presenting as well. Our output will be a cross platform paper on Privacy put out by the Architecture Working Group. We have already put out papers on Consensus and Smart Contracts; we are working on Interoperability and Privacy and Confidentiality. We normally have sections that are more generic, stating the problem and then sections on the individual frameworks in Hyperledger on the topic, which call out the ways in which they have solved the problem and the differences in their approach. By doing this we also hope to make the Engineers look at ways in which others have solved the same problem and to get feedback from the community members on how to improve their solutions.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 00:38:48 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB - can you send me the links to the Consensus and Smart Contracts papers please.  That'll help me figure out who's best to get involved in presenting. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 00:44:21 GMT):<br/>
The wiki for the Architecture working group is https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/AWG the papers are linked from there under the heading "Links to completed work". In fact those papers need updates from Besu as well as we intend to keep them uptodate and function as living documents.

@Hyungsuk Kang Hi! We're currently working on an ambassador program. We're still working out the details, but the idea is to give you more in depth support and feedback. We have a couple of requirements to becoming one, like having done the Besu Certification. PM for more details if this interests you.

We plan to migrate the PegaSysEng/pantheon repo to hyperledger/besu and do the tech.pegasys.pantheon to org.hyperledger.besu rename on 16 Sept AEST (UTC+10).  There will be a code freeze from 1600 on 15 Sept AEST (UTC+10) until the migration is completed.  We'll notify this channel when that is complete. Any work not on the master branch of the PegaSysEng/pantheon repo by the time of the code freeze will need to be manually migrated to the new namespace and applied to a fresh clone of the new hyperledger/besu repo.

- Docs for besu will be up on https://besu.hyperledger.org mid next week. https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech will still exist for a bit till 1.3.1 at which point we will do a redirect to https://besu.hyperledger.org

- Please subscribe to the Besu mailing list here: https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/besu/join, more details at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Hyperledger+Besu.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 15:07:26 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 15:08:49 GMT):<br/>
I think it is OK to change messages if that is not what you meant or made an error... This is not an immutable record- we have too many things like that
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 15:09:52 GMT):<br/>
It is also not a malicious thing- not everything is, this ability to change (by the original author) should not be limited.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 15:10:53 GMT):<br/>
should not, may not, or must not?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 15:11:20 GMT):<br/>
I also think that unless we see malicious actions (gaslighting edit/i-never-said-that stuff) with the editing we leave it as-is.  So should not.

</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 06:03:51 GMT):<br/>
Besu documentation doesn't cover all Ethereum concepts. Have you got experience developing using other Ethereum clients?  If so, the Besu docs cover concepts that are specific to Besu. 
</p>

In that case, I would recommend doing a refresher on ethereum basics.
You already know solidity, which is a great stepping stone, but some things on the protocol level change quite a lot.

Afterall, Besu is a ethereum client and you'll need to know the full stack at least a bit.
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 14:43:45 GMT):<br/>
Having said that; feel free to ask questions you aren't sure are generic ethereum or besu-specific, and we'll do our best to answer them, or to point you to the correct place.

Hi everyone! one question, it will be posible to create tokens like erc-20 or erc-721 in Besu just like in ethereum?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 21:24:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes, Besu has the full EVM implementation.  If you connect to mainnet you can interact with existing ERC-20 tokens.  If you create a private network you can still do ERC-20 tokens as well on your private network.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 21:24:16 GMT):<br/>
Same as ERC-721
</p>
<p><strong>cristpereirag</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 21:29:04 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for that info! So, if I already have a working token on Ethereum mainnet, I can use it on my Besu network?

I think you can deploy it on Besu without any change in contracts.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 01:24:49 GMT):<br/>
Yep exactly. And you can also sync Besu to MainNet and use the existing contract.

Version is StateTrieAccountValue: see line 101.
https://github.com/PegaSysEng/sidechains-besu/blob/master/ethereum/core/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/ethereum/worldstate/StateTrieAccountValue.java
Questions:
- What is the version for?
- Has this field been enabled / are people using it?

The Sidechains team have also extended the account state stored in World State. Our implementation starts with set of flags which can be used to determine if the world state has extra information. If the flags don't exist, then nothing is stored. If the (optional) version data isn't in active use, then it would be good if it could use the same mechanism.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 03:50:15 GMT):<br/>
It is for EIP-1702
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 03:50:44 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1702.md
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 03:51:43 GMT):<br/>
No one is using it yet.  It may disappear.  Since this affects world state we should be careful using it for anything not in an EIP.
</p>
<p><strong>drinkcoffee</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 04:01:41 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the quick response.  
World state is something which is local to a node isn't it? As such, isn't it up to the individual Ethereum Client implementation how it stores its information? Obviously we have to be careful to not cause state explosion.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 04:02:07 GMT):<br/>
No, this is what is used to calculate the world state hash as part of each block.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 04:03:06 GMT):<br/>
The RLP generated is thrown into a patricia tree (based on the account) and that is where consensus is derived to an extent. 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 04:04:29 GMT):<br/>
It's meant as a flag for introducing backwards incompatible change into the EVM or adding the eWASM VM.
</p>
<p><strong>drinkcoffee</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 04:04:51 GMT):<br/>
Hmmmm.... so, indirectly, the local RLP of the world state leaks. As such, for MainNet compatibility, we need to ensure any changes are transparent.
</p>
<p><strong>drinkcoffee</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 04:04:54 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 04:05:02 GMT):<br/>
basically.

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 11:06:08 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 11:07:46 GMT):<br/>
Then it's expected that it doesn't sync if it's alone. Your network is just this node and as you can see in the logs, it generates blocks `Produced and imported block #1,581` so that's ok. You can work with this. It's just a one node dentwork, but enough to test.

Hey @shemnon , I had a re-read of the version stuff (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1702.md). The version field is supposed to be 256 bits, and in Besu we only are storing it in an int (32 bits). Obviously, we could take a long time to get to (2**32)+1 assuming sequential versions.  In the EIP they talk about "32", but those are 32 bytes....
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 02:12:05 GMT):<br/>
I'd say the most important thing about EIP-1702 is that it has not been finalised.  There are a few concerns raised about it and so it will almost certainly change before it actually goes into a hard fork.  I suspect any attempt to depend on it will lead you into a very difficult spot.
</p>
<p><strong>drinkcoffee</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 02:26:17 GMT):<br/>
The Sidechains team are creating an extension to the account state. The goal is for it to extend the MainNet account state. I think the best way will be to have a bit set at the top of the nonce field. If that is set, then it means the data is in "Crosschain extension format", otherwise is in MainNet format. However, the version field seems to be also a good possibility - once the field is definitely going to be locked in.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 02:52:15 GMT):<br/>
So if the state needs to be stored on mainnet we can only do to nonces and the version field what is defined.  on a side chain, less restrictions.  But we need to keep evolutionary concerns in mind too in case the use of the fields diverges.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 02:53:15 GMT):<br/>
the field as an int was done before the EIP PR added the 2^256 range, and that was chosen because of the long standing obsession with keccak hash sizes.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 02:53:47 GMT):<br/>
it can move but there are other things that would need to move with it type wise.
</p>
<p><strong>drinkcoffee</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 04:36:44 GMT):<br/>
makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>drinkcoffee</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 04:38:34 GMT):<br/>
agreed. The plan is for this to be just on sidechains / private blockchains. If we end up having this on Ethereum MainNet, we would have to adapt it and probably would use the version feature to indicate the extra information is present. 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 04:39:18 GMT):<br/>
will this be enabled via a feature flag?  such as something in the genesis config block?

Environment
Pantheon version 1.2.3
- Mac high sierra
- Java 11
- VM:  ubuntu/trusty64

Tutorial : Section4. Start First Node as Bootnode


When I wrote  this code for boot node

`pantheon --data-path=data --genesis-file=../cliqueGenesis.json --bootnodes --network-id 123 --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=ETH,NET,CLIQUE --host-whitelist="*" --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" `

Could someone help explain, in a consortium network, should each org have one boot_node, miner_node and validator node?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:13:54 GMT):<br/>
No it's just that the quickstart shows all kind of nodes here a bootnode to help all other nodes find each others, a minernode (it's PoW quickstart here) and 3 regular nodes (not mining). It also has one node called RPC that's used as an entrypoint on the network.
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:43:41 GMT):<br/>
So for a consortium network use IBFT consensus, we only need one boot node for the network, one regular node for each org and some rpc nodes as the entrypoint? Does the rpc node also do same thing like the regular node? They don't have much difference except exposing the rpc endpint.
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:45:20 GMT):<br/>
Does the regular node have full block and state data?
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:45:20 GMT):<br/>
Does the boot node, regular node and rpc node have full block and state data?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:50:16 GMT):<br/>
Exactly. All nodes are syncing the same way, even the bootnode. So for an IBFT2 network, you need 1 node also used as a bootnode, plan to have 2+ bootnodes in case of failure of one of them, then you have other nodes on which you can also activate RPC, and of course some of them have to be validators. By the way any can be a validator, even bootnode. 
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:50:41 GMT):<br/>
All nodes have full block and state data.

Why are there so many blocks with 0 transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 12:08:48 GMT):<br/>
@RealDeanZhao thanks for this valuable feedback. We have a few examples today in our Besu doc, but nothing like a full dapp tutorial directly in our doc. We link to others docs for that as they do it very well too. Besu works mainly like other clients, so if you find a tutorial to create a dapp using Truffle for instance, you can easily use it on Besu as explained on https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Quickstarts/Private-Network-Quickstart/#truffle-pet-shop-tutorial for instance.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 12:12:24 GMT):<br/>
@RealDeanZhao about the empty blocks, it's expected. Blocks are created whatever happens, even if no transactions are made on the network. It's a feature ;) I'm not going to dive in details but having blocks generated enables us to check that the network is live and timeout unavailable validators. Otherwise, if we create blocks only when a tx is sent, how can the rest of the network tell between a stuck validator that fail at creating a block or no block because of no tx?

Does the format of this enode address look right?

  "id": 1,

```
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 13:52:41 GMT):<br/>
@SamuelDare  Yes, that looks alright. Jus verify that you need udp specification. Depending on that, the `discport` part is needed or not.

</p>
<p><strong>SamuelDare</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:55:53 GMT):<br/>
the nodes seem to be connecting just sending bad blocks. . I would have thought enode was a udp kademlia thing 
</p>
<p><strong>SamuelDare</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:56:08 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:57:40 GMT):<br/>
I dont think enode is causing the bad block, likely something in the extradata in the genesis.

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 07:06:48 GMT):<br/>
It's mostly useful on PoA concessus where calidators create blocks on a rotating basis. On PoW it's a financial incentive on public network, you are right that in private one it may not be the same. However, our PoW works the same on public or private network.

Hi mauchs, there's several (15+?) contributors and maintainers going to devcon this year. Some of us will be doing talks- we'll send the schedule once we get it.
Additionally, there will be a Hyperledger meetup during devcon, here's the link: https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Kansai/events/264886205/
There's a lot of stuff going on during devcon so at this point, things are already difficult to organize but I'll gladly meet up directly over there.

Testing for Crosschain Transaction code: Where would be the best place for Crosschain Transaction testing? I can see there are unit, integration and acceptance tests.  
The types of tests need to:
- launch one or more nodes on three blockchains
- Run one or more tests (it would be great to relaunch everything for each test, but then the tests might take a very long time to run).
- For many non-happy case tests, be able to remove network connections between nodes / remove nodes half way through a test.

The acceptance test framework seems like it could be a good starting point. However, is the goal to limit the number of tests in this test system so the acceptance tests run in a reasonable time frame?

> The acceptance test framework seems like it could be a good starting point. However, is the goal to limit the number of tests in this test system so the acceptance tests run in a reasonable time frame?

Yes, the goal with the ATs is to keep them running in reasonable time frame (as they are build on every master and PR commit).

As things currently stand with the AT framework, they are really aimed at happy path tests, few in number and relatively simple (compare to the potential unhappy path tests).

With Crosschain transactions, I could imagine that the interesting cases needing something more akin to real networks?
</p>
<p><strong>drinkcoffee</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 03:30:09 GMT):<br/>
So we will need to create some acceptance tests which do a lot with a couple of tests.

<p><strong>drinkcoffee</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 03:30:45 GMT):<br/>

One additional bit is that we need to be mindful of how long tests take if we make them gate checkins.  Right now all of acceptance, integration, reference, and unit tests are run for every checkin.  Perhaps we need a new set of tests that are not gating for a checkin?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 16:02:31 GMT):<br/>
For gas limit is is a single value in the genesis file, a CLI flag is coming in 1.3 (RC today or so).
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 16:03:02 GMT):<br/>
Block time depends on the consensus algorithm.  For those with configurable block times it is a parameter in the genesis.json.

Im going through this tutorial (https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/0.8.5/Tutorials/Create-Private-Network/) and am stuck on step 3 "Start First Node and Get Node Public key"

this command `pantheon --data-path=Node-1-Datadir --genesis-file=../privateNetworkGenesis.json export-pub-key Node-1-Datadir/publicKeyNode1` generates the following error:

`Unmatched arguments: export-pub-key, Node-1-Datadir/publicKeyNode1

what is the correct command to export the node public key?

Those are the 0.8.5 docs for pantheon, not besu.  Pantheon name fully changed to besu at 1.2.4 and the CLIs were significantly re-written in 0.9.0.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 17:31:02 GMT):<br/>
perhaps instead of `export-pub-key` try `pub-key export`

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 17:34:49 GMT):<br/>
those are the latest, you had the 0.8.5 docs selected before.  Probably a side effect of where it was linked from.

I run `besu --discovery-enabled=false --graphql-http-enabled --genesis-file init/testGenesis.json` then I point to http://127.0.0.1:8547/. For all GraphQL queries it returns an empty string, even for `{ __schema { types { name }}}`. What am I overlooking?

This looks like either the validator node isn't producing blocks or they are not connecting to the boot node and are not seeing each other.  Can you run a peer count query on each (https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Tutorials/Quickstarts/Private-Network-Quickstart/#counting-peers) and then check the --bootnodes CLI arg to make sure they are talking?  It may also be that docker isn't letting the docker images talk if they are not on the same docker network.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 14:37:59 GMT):<br/>
FYI, I also created a ticket to make an HTTP redirect form endpoint root path to the correct one.
</p>
<p><strong>offcode</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 14:40:02 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure it's a good idea. I'd expect the root to provide an IDE. A simple "You'll see an IDE here soon. Until then use /graphql" message would be better
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 14:43:46 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure a graphql endpoint role is to provide an IDE. At least there's no recommendation about that. DO you have examples of services doing that? @shemnon any thoughts?

<p><strong>offcode</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 14:49:11 GMT):<br/>
yes, MAY .I'm just saying a redirect would be more confusing than serving nothing at the root
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 14:54:31 GMT):<br/>
My concern with offering the IDE is security.  It is implemented by loading large amounts of javascript from a server we don't control in the clients web browser.  I consider the standalone Graphiql browser superior in that regard.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 14:55:13 GMT):<br/>
And I don't think Geth seriously contemplated the security implcations.
</p>

Yes you can build it form the public key returned by the `besu public-key export` subcommand https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Subcommands/#export_1 and use the `enode://<id>@<host:port>` format described in https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Node-Keys/#enode-url where <id> it the public key your just get with the previous command.

1. I can write a single query, no need to process the result, feed it into the next query, repeat.
2. Easy to explore the data (especially with the help of the IDE ;)
3. Federation to integrate different services
4. Hopefully better error handling than with the current json rpc

you have `--data-path=${NETWORK_ROOT}` in noe command and `--data-path=data` in the other, as you already ran`cd ${NETWORK_ROOT}/Node-$1` it means second path is `${NETWORK_ROOT}/Node-$1/data` so you look for a key file in `${NETWORK_ROOT}` on one command and a key file in `${NETWORK_ROOT}/Node-$1/data` in the other. Your two private keys are then different, hence not having the same public key. Let me know what happens if you run `cd ${NETWORK_ROOT}/Node-$1` then `besu --data-path=data public-key export`.

Hi everyone, I am trying to filter events from Besu(v.1.2.4)  in a private chain which currently have 2 200 000 blocks; the problem is the response time is TOO LONG; that is, to make a search on those blocks the response time is aproximately 369 seconds, I have made other test where I confirmed it approximately takes 1 second per 5000 blocks.  I am using web3@0.20.6. Please can you suggest how can I deal with this issue? Thanks!

Json rpc incurs a significant overhead as you can only query one transaction at a time.  With graplql you can query larger blocks of transactions per call

The root logs query is a bit wonky at the moment, but you can query from a range of blocks with a graphql query like this:
```
{
  blocks(from: 1420000, to: 1426000) {
    logs(filter: {addresses: [], topics:[]}) {
      index
      account {address}
      topics
      data
    }
  }
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 02:35:57 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon thanks for the code. I have just tested how fast is the query with graphql compared with rpc; the results are that to query in a range of 47000 blocks in a LOCALHOST chain, graphql takes 5.49 seconds; while rpc took 2.038 seconds.

Good to know.  There are many optimizations we still need to do in the graphql code.  There is also an issue in that the top level logs query isn't working.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 02:37:40 GMT):<br/>
How would you characterize your 2M blockchain, mostly erc-20 transactions?  Full blocks?  half full blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 02:42:44 GMT):<br/>
my 2 million blocks, that I mentioned before are in IBFT2.0 context, the majority of them does not have transactions and  other part are transactions from smart contract state change.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 02:44:44 GMT):<br/>
What's the total transaction count w/in an order of magnitude?
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 02:46:26 GMT):<br/>
I am very worried for the response time because rpc and grapql takes too much time to response for a reduced range of blocks(47000 blocks), so in a scenario where a search is needed in the whole chain it could take a LOT of time to resolve.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 03:04:23 GMT):<br/>
The architecture here may be to out the logs in a query optimized db.  The blockchain structure is not very query firendly.

Hi, friends! I have a doubt regarding “*Account Permissioning*”. The documentation states that “_A node with account permissioning accepts transactions only from accounts in the accounts whitelist_”. But also says that Account Permissioning can be used for _“Blacklist broken contracts”._ How is it possible? If the restriction is based on “list of accounts (External Owned Accounts, I suppose) that can send transactions (write) to the blockchain”, how can that prevent access TO a broken Smart Contract? Thanks!!

Hi guys, when using IBFT 2.0 it's possible to change the `blockperiodseconds` and block gas limit, after the network is running?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 11:21:10 GMT):<br/>
Let me just confirm my understanding with my colleagues for `blockperiodseconds`, but for gas limit, we just introduced a new option that makes you able to modify gas limit https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#target-gas-limit
You will have to restart your node to add this command line option then your node will push the chain toward this limit. If you want all your nodes to use this limit, you have to restart them one after the other, or per batches, with this new parameter.
I will get back to you for `blockperiodseconds`
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 11:23:22 GMT):<br/>
No, not really.  I think you can get away with making it shorter (may need to ensure all validators are updated at the same time). Making it longer would cause earlier blocks to be rejected by any new nodes syncing the chain because the timestamp difference between the existing blocks would be less than `blockperiodseconds` and thus the blocks are considered invalid.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 11:25:37 GMT):<br/>
Gas limit can't be changed in the genesis config - it forms part of the genesis block.  But each block can vary the gas limit by a small amount and as Nico pointed out you can set a target gas limit and if enough of the validators have a similar gas limit then it will gradually move towards that new limit.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 11:28:55 GMT):<br/>
With on-chain permissioning, the smart contract that controls permissioning can decide to allow or deny transactions based on a wide range of factors, including both who the transaction is from and the to address specified. 
</p>
<p><strong>carlosfaria</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 11:36:39 GMT):<br/>
Hi @NicolasMassart and @ajsutton thank you for your answers.
I understand that a blockperiod change could affect early blocks.

If I add a new Protocol Spec on `MainnetProtocolSpecs` that defines that, for instance, in block #5000 the `blockperiodseconds` changes to a different value, should it work? - I haven't tested it yet.
Thanks

</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 21:41:01 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the right way to do this is effectively to make it a hard fork that's activated at a specific block.  `MainnetProtocolSpecs` provides the hard forks for MainNet so it's not the right place for this to live, but you ultimately want to have an additional entry in the built `ProtocolSchedule`.  `ProtocolScheduleBuilder` is the class that builds this and inserts the specs for each hard fork.

The IBFT specific concepts like block period are actually added via the `protocolSpecAdapter` that's passed into it.  Our IBFT implementation essentially starts with a MainNet spec and then swaps out the bits that are different, including the header validator which checks the block period.  `IbftProtocolSchedule` defines those changes.

You'd also need the `BlockTimer` which is used by the block creation process to know that the block period has changed.

If you find usages of `IbftConfigOptions.getBlockPeriodSeconds` you can follow things through fairly well.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 23:28:15 GMT):<br/>
Increasing the CPUs solved this for now, but I am still curious why it was needed, because other nodes have less cpu and are working normally. :)
</p>
<p><strong>hmijail</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 02:16:35 GMT):<br/>
Does that mean that there is a specific place where non-MainNet hard forks would belong? 
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 02:29:15 GMT):<br/>
Currently we o my have mainnet hard forks and things that adapt them (eg for IBFT2 and clique). The IBFT adaptations live in IbftProtocolSchedule. ETC Collab is looking to add ETC support which would have different hard forms and they may introduce a new class to hold those. Depends on the details though. But MainNetProtocolSpecs is definitely just for mainnet things.

Hi, Everyone. I have a question.
I want to build a test environment using Hyperledger Besu.
I am thinking about choosing between three consensus algorithms: Ethash, Clique, and IBFT 2.0.
Please tell me if there is any data comparing the performance of each consensus algorithm.
Or is there a guide document on how to measure performance?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 07:23:38 GMT):<br/>
Ethash is PoW and is permissionless: anyone can mine blocks.  Not recommended for private networks.  Clique and ibft2 run off a set if validators that is seeded in the genesis and updated as part of block production.  Clique still has probabalistic finality while ibft offers real finality.

From the log, it looks like pantheon ibft has blocked access.
And what should I do to solve this problem?

@ajsutton I'm actually using the `MainNetProtocolSpecs` to define a new fork that replaces the `MainnetTransactionProcessor` with a `CustomTransactionProcessor` in a IBFT 2.0 network. And it works fine.
I'm doing it right? 
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 23:13:55 GMT):<br/>
If it works fine that’s ok. :) Where the code lives is mostly a design issue - MainNetProtocolSpecs should be exclusively about MainNet. The only thing that actually matters in terms of operation is what winds up in the ProtocolSchedule that is ultimately built. Files like MainNetProtocolSpecs and IbftProtocolSchedule just house utility functions to help build up that ProtocolSchedule and try to categorise it in a way that makes it clear which things are MainNet, which are IBFT2, which are Clique etc.

We have just merged a fix for the issue that was crashing the nodes. You can find more details about it on the ticket.

This is the PR with the fix: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/96

The fix is available in our master branch and should be part of our next 1.3.1 release (next week).

Thanks again for bringing this issue to  our attention!

Hi, I am new to Besu and I have following questions
1) Can Besu be configured to run as public network in parallel to private/permissioned network?
2) Does Besu uses a Fork of Ethereum like Quorum?
3) How does Besu differ from Quorum?
</p>
<p><strong>carlosfaria</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 08:33:25 GMT):<br/>
Makes sense @ajsutton Thank you for your support! 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 10:42:38 GMT):<br/>
1) that would involve two processes currently.  Besu supports one chain per process currently, although theoretically it could do multiple.  But you can run one besu node for a public chain and one for a private chain

2) Besu is fully mainnet compatible (and most testnets) and is up to date with ethereum specifications.  For private network some protocol details are changed such as consensus and private transaction support.

3) IIRC Quorum can not sync mainnet anymore and is fixed to private networks.  Besu supports more consensus engines (ethash, clique, and IBFT 1.0 and 2.0) and has other minor changes like prometheus support and ethql support.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 12:20:20 GMT):<br/>
> 2) Does Besu uses a Fork of Ethereum like Quorum?
No, Besu is a completely different client implemented in Java from scratch. It was called Pantheon before entering Hyperledger and being renamed Besu. You can read more about this on https://media.consensys.net/why-we-rebuilt-ethereum-from-scratch-9e38b6ebd4a2

Besu gives great APIs and monitoring capability which is great compare to other ETH clients like Geth or Quorum. But how Besu would be different or perform better when it comes to private/permissioned network compare to solution like Corda?

Having built on all , I would say things it primarily use case specific; and how much complexity / heavy lifing you want to do
</p>
<p><strong>SamuelDare</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 22:05:35 GMT):<br/>
Built on Fabric over a year ago and it was relentlessly complex. 

Corda isnt really a blockchain , and those performance cannot be directly compared. Hope it helps

Hi, guys.
I have a question about the 'Using the Pantheon with Truffle' practice.
Link: http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/HowTo/Develop-Dapps/Truffle/


I used estash to complete the test as usual (successfully transferring Ether with Metamask).
But with ibft I have a problem.

When I try to 'truffle migrage', I get the following problem:
pcmola@wonjongyoon:~/my/edu/pet-shop-tutorial_ibft$ truffle migrate --network pantheonWallet

From the log, it looks like pantheon ibft has blocked access.
And what should I do to solve this problem?

</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 03:51:44 GMT):<br/>
hi @pcmola - can you confirm if your IBFT 2.0 network is creating blocks?  If blocks aren't being created, the deployment won't work. 
</p>
<p><strong>pcmola</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 05:25:12 GMT):<br/>
As you said, it doesn't seem to be creating blocks.
I don't know if I checked correctly but when I check the latest block it keeps showing as only block 1.
pcmola@wonjongyoon:~/my/edu/pet-shop-tutorial_ibft$ curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ibft_getValidatorsByBlockNumber","params":["latest"], "id":1}' http://127.0.0.1:8545

I'm sorry, but can you explain how I can create a block?

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 05:28:55 GMT):<br/>
It could be that you haven't specified your validators correctly in the genesis file.  What result do you get from the following request: 
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ibft_getValidatorsByBlockNumber","params":["latest"], "id":1}' http://127.0.0.1:8546
</p>
<p><strong>pcmola</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 05:35:19 GMT):<br/>
I see the same result at http://127.0.0.1:8545.
{
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "id" : 1,
  "result" : [ "0x5d301767ae21d29200661a24d9318d57885316fe", "0xaf3aa4810e15eaf71631389e411d53493efe1aac", "0x89fc175f2317a9475f3d0cb3e7de36c968369bb2", "0x1b0265ee954c4bcd2b124ecd597771501ecf1a22" ]
}

</p>
<p><strong>pcmola</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 05:35:52 GMT):<br/>
The result is same for 8547(Node3) and 8548(Node4).
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 05:37:37 GMT):<br/>
Are they the addresses of your 4 nodes? 

You can use the following command to write the address of each node to a file: 
besu --data-path=data public-key export-address --to=data/node1Address 
</p>
<p><strong>pcmola</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 05:53:59 GMT):<br/>
I used pantheon so I used the 'pantheon' command instead of 'besu'.
Node-1 has the same result as address, but Node2 ~ 4 are different.

I've got a stupid question probably, but I used to have a working helmfile based setup, coming from the helm charts/helmfile you shared a while ago. Been trying to move to the besu image (but tbh, it started failing with 2.3 pantheon as well), and the bootnode launches, the validators launch, all the jobs run, but all nodes keep repeating "No sync target, wait for peers". I assume because no nodes are mining? Any idea on where to start looking?

Ny Sync Targets is because of no peers found.  Is this a private network or a public chain?

You can use the `rlp encode` sub-command to create the extraData string:

<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 02:16:24 GMT):<br/>
It's private network, not using private transactions.. It works when I use 1.2.5 to start the network.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 04:21:54 GMT):<br/>
I think a fix is coming in 1.3.1, out this week.

Hi, I'm setting up a besu permissioned network, but I have a problem. My nodes are located some in a single k8s cluster and some others in a external location, so I'm having a problem with them talking to each other, I'm setting permissions config with the enodes using the public external IP address of the cluster, but in the logs I can see what the nodes in the same cluster get is a request using the internal ip address, and thus they don't get allowed, if I call perm_addNodesToWhitelist with the internal ip, then they start to talk to each other
</p>
<p><strong>diestrin</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 16:14:23 GMT):<br/>
what am I suppose to do in this case?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 21:00:26 GMT):<br/>
One option would be to allow both the internal and external IPs but that's somewhat messy.  The other possibility is to use `--p2p-interface` to set the IP address that the DevP2P networking will use for sending and receiving to the public IP.  It's a fairly new option and I'm somewhat foggy on the details but worth a try.

Hi, I've been testing out the automated besu ibft setup on a kubernetes cluster and managed to get it booting up all the validator nodes. The only issue i am still enduring is that my setup is not mining any blocks. The only messages i am getting are ```2019-10-16 07:24:47.316+00:00 | EthScheduler-Timer-0 | INFO  | FullSyncTargetManager | No sync target, wait for peers.
``` Any idea what I might be missing?

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 10:28:35 GMT):<br/>
@ramvi the node is listening on localhost by default meaning you have to set the --rpc-http-host to your external ip (or 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces). More details are available on https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#rpc-http-host

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 10:31:34 GMT):<br/>
We have all remote apis disabled and if enabled, then only available for localhost by default to prevent users to mistakenly open their nodes to the world.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 10:32:21 GMT):<br/>
The only connection which is on by default is p2p, as otherwise you can't join any network.

Hello @vaxou if you make the call to check on the # of peers what do you get back? `curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_peerCount","params":[],"id":1}' <http-rpc-endpoint-ip>:8545`

Hi Guys, I have so sorry for the persistence. I have downloaded the latest version 1.3.1 release and tested scenario when I deploy a private contract between TWO participants.(node 1, node 2). For that I did the following steps: 
1. deployed a public contract
2. deployed a private contract between two nodes. That private contract is able to read a variable of the public conttract.
3. After that tested the functionality when node 1 access the private contract and reads the variable of the public contract.
4. In the same way tested the functionality when node 2 also access the same private shared contract and performs a call to read a variable of the public smart contract.
5. Up to this point all works well; but after that whole nodes in the network, other than Node 1 and Node 2,  throws an error  and are rejected. So at the end only node 1 and node 2 remains live in the network.
6. If I try to delete the database of some of the rejected nodes and start again that node, then it is still rejected being not able to join. 
Here you can see the screenshot of  one of the fallen rejected nodes:

hi @eum602 - wanted to confirm a couple of things so we can understand your scenario a bit better and recreate.  

1. Initially you have 4 nodes running.  Are they all connected and creating/importing blocks before the crash? 

2. The error message and disconnection occur on nodes 3 & 4? But 1 & 2 continue normally? 

3. Then you delete the databases for 3 & 4 and attempt to reconnect but they won't reconnect? 
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 23:02:51 GMT):<br/>
1. yes, they are connected and sharing blocks,  three are validators and one is regular
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 23:03:05 GMT):<br/>
2. yes

Hi, I'm experiencing problems with setting up Alethio Lite Explorer with your IBFT2. It returns "exited with code 3" before even getting to reading the config file, it seems. How do I troubleshoot this? Unable to find anything online
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 07:06:12 GMT):<br/>
I've noticed you are using PoW for most of your documentation online. Is IBFT2 kind of in beta or bleeding edge?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 08:06:28 GMT):<br/>
Can you tell me what software returns code 3? Are you using Alethio Docker images for the explorer? Would you mind sharing your configuration files and command lines used?
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 08:11:24 GMT):<br/>
* Software: ethereum-lite-explorer started with `npm start`
* Tried with docker image too, but I couldn't connect to that either. The container only outputted "Now running" without any errors or troubleshooting info. However, I'm guessing the container is for PoW, not IBFT2?
* I don't mind at all. I have console logged a couple of the variables in the failing file: https://pastebin.com/r596BmdW

Using the `besu-quickstart` with `-c ibft` (this is undocumented by the way), only sets up one validator. Doesn't a ibft2 chain need at least 4 validators? Console: https://pastebin.com/7gpuWXQm
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:08:31 GMT):<br/>
Hi @obernardovieira , for security reasons, Besu doesn't provide account management. You have to create accounts in a third party secure wallet like Metamask or any wallet you trust, or use our proxy signer EthSigner (https://docs.ethsigner.pegasys.tech). More about Besu account management can be found on https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Interact/APIs/API/#account-management
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:14:03 GMT):<br/>
You can add validators manually after the first run using RPC: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/IBFT/#adding-a-validator
The option is not documented, but I like that you read the script, because we are working on a new tool and focusing our efforts on it. So feel free to use it, it works well and you should also see a list of validators that's not displayed wen you use the default PoW quickstart. Make your RPC call on this validator to add another one, then run your request on both validators to add a third one and finally you can run the addition request on only 2 on 3 of the validators to add a 4th one as we require only majority (> 50% of the validators)
</p>
<p><strong>obernardovieira</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:16:49 GMT):<br/>
Hi,
thank you. I'll have a look.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:23:34 GMT):<br/>
Looking at your files it seems to be an issue that you should directly discuss with Alethio. They have a Discord chat for that and I'm sure they would be glad to help you: https://discord.gg/FJRzDY
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:30:11 GMT):<br/>
We are planning on moving moving some tutorials to PoA, quickstart for instance as you noticed has Clique and IBFT2 capabilities. But we already have IBFT2 and Clique specific tutorials, so we wanted to keep it simple on the basic howtos and quickstart for now as PoW is easier to setup for new users. PoA is well established and working, but we have to admit that if you are really new to Ethereum and running a node, PoW is maybe the smart way to start as it matches what people can see running on mainnet. As Besu is a mainnet capable client, it's the way we chose to make them approach our software.

I wish to connect from a different machine
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:17:44 GMT):<br/>
i.e. what is the dynamic docker port mapping for port 30303 on the bootnode?
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:44:29 GMT):<br/>
Maybe I could just change the command that starts the bootnode with `-p 30303:30303`?
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:44:38 GMT):<br/>
Unsure where that is though…
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:44:42 GMT):<br/>
It's not exposed in the docker quickstart. This quickstart network is aimed at being self contained demo/quickstart/fast overview of Besu ecosystem.
So the 30303 port is only reachable inside of the quickstart docker compose network. We only expose endpoint outside of the Docker network for RPC and web tools like the explorer or Grafana. They are all available trough a reverse proxy (nginx), here on the dynamically allocated port 32770 on your example. It allows you to run miltiple quickstarts in parallel if you want.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:46:50 GMT):<br/>
You can technically do that but the issue is that you will only be able to connect to the bootnode, and not to all the other nodes on the network. Bootnodes are only a venue for discovery, but then nodes are expected to communicate directly, it's P2P. So if your other nodes 30303 ports are not exposed to the outside, they won;t be able to communicate with the nodes outside of your docker network.
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:46:53 GMT):<br/>
How are the 5 nodes able to connect to each other without having access to the 30303 port?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:47:13 GMT):<br/>
they have, but only inside the Docker network.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:47:24 GMT):<br/>
It's like an isolated network.
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:47:41 GMT):<br/>
oh wow, I still have a lot to learn about docker I guess
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:48:08 GMT):<br/>
It's a very rich subject I admit
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:50:23 GMT):<br/>
So what you're saying is that I have to set it all up manually to be able to connect another node to the network?
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:50:33 GMT):<br/>
No quick fix with the docker containers?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:50:45 GMT):<br/>
What you could do is having your new node in a Docker container too and make it connect to the existing network. Then it will have access to the inside of the network : https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_connect/
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:51:57 GMT):<br/>
If your new node is in a docker container, using docker network connect will help https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_connect/
If it's not in a docker container, it's going to be far more complicated.
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:52:42 GMT):<br/>
Can the docker containers can be in a virtual network across the internet e.g. the network I now have running on the azure node, and my local machine?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:54:39 GMT):<br/>
No, it has to be on the same docker engine I gess, at least if you are just using Docker/Docker compose/quickstart. Otherwise there's other ways to do with tools like Kubernetes, but that's another story.
What would you like to achieve exactly, if you allow me to go back to your initial need?
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:57:31 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your time and interest Nicolas! I want to have one node in one location (but i can be 4+ nodes in that first location since IBFT2 needs it) and then I want another node in another location. That's what I'm trying to achieve: a network across the internet with at least two locations
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:58:52 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 14:00:34 GMT):<br/>
I think that you exceeded the quickstart capabilities here. What you try to achieve is already things we do with other companies usually using Kubernetes and some cloud (AWS/Azure). We could help you create this structure at Pegasys if you like. Would you like to be contacted by our team?

When I'm initiating two deploy scripts targeting the same node, blabla:8545, with rpc http requests, one proceeds and one is blocked. Does besu put requests in a non asynchoqious queue?

Q2: We moved our software from a PoA parity. Besu seems much slower. Is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 13:51:17 GMT):<br/>
blocked how?  The RPC fails to continue?  The contract doesn't deploy until the next block? I'm not aware of any synchronization locks that would block one RPC ove the other, they are both fed into a multi-threaded queue run by vertx.

Hello @madelinemurray  @antonydenyer , I have tested the functionality to read a variable of a public smart contract from  a  private smart contract, now it works!. Here you can see how when node 1 and node 2 participate in a private smart contract by which they access a public smart contract(the response is as expected), also when node 3 try to access the private smart contract, to read a public SC, then it is not able to perform that action. Nodes do not crash anymore and any node is able to join without issues.

<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 17:25:42 GMT):<br/>
One of the deploy scripts complete, while the other just waits for response. When the first completes, the second continues
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 17:25:59 GMT):<br/>
What RPCs are they calling?
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 17:25:59 GMT):<br/>
the other deploy script, that is
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 17:26:11 GMT):<br/>
json rpc
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 17:26:16 GMT):<br/>
Or what methonds?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 17:26:24 GMT):<br/>
which methods
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 17:27:20 GMT):<br/>
It's a combination of deploy contracts and interactions with them (send_rawtx)
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 17:27:38 GMT):<br/>
Though, I'm not writing the raw tx directly. It's a script in ethers.js
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 17:30:23 GMT):<br/>
So to confirm, you don't see this behavior on geth or parity right?
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:09:14 GMT):<br/>
Correct
</p>
<p><strong>ramvi</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:09:25 GMT):<br/>
Well, only tested with parity and ganach. Not geth
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:11:44 GMT):<br/>
I'll need to know which apis are being called.  If there was a sync block I would expect more of an interleave rather than an all of 1 then all of 2 type situation, unless there is only one real working RPC call.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:12:20 GMT):<br/>
Can you do a run where you turn on logging to debug (`--logging=DEBUG`) and then tell us what RPCs are called (grep JsonRpcHttpService <your besu log>)?

Hi.
In 'Configuring a Network for Private Transactions' example,
the count of IBFT Node is 3.

http://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Privacy/Configuring-Privacy/

I heard that it is recommended to be 3n+1 node in IBFT.
Is it okay that the the count of the node is 3?

Hello everyone, I wonder if is there a way to call the list of validators, in an IBTF2 network,  from a smart contract. I appeciate any response. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 19:45:34 GMT):<br/>
hi @pcmola - the network will function but you're correct, 4 validators are needed for the network to be Byzantine fault tolerant. 

I'm adding the following note to the tutorial: 
This tutorial configures a private network using IBFT 2.0 for educational purposes only. IBFT 2.0 requires 4 validators to be Byzantine fault tolerant.

@pcmola - sorry about the delay on responding to this one.  When you start nodes 2, 3, and 4, do you see the `loaded key` line in the log file?  It's the 4th line displayed: 
`2019-10-23 05:51:58.586+10:00 | main | INFO  | KeyPairUtil | Loaded key 0x21ff... from ....` 

Or do you see a line indicating a new key was generated?  

`2019-10-23 05:54:17.384+10:00 | main | INFO  | KeyPairUtil | Generated new key 0xeba... and stored it to ...`

hi @yunho.chung - sorry about the delay in reply.  What versions of Besu and Orion are you using? 
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 22:01:36 GMT):<br/>
Hi @pcmola, as @madelinemurray, we'd recommend you have a minimum of 4 validators in an IBFT2 network - however, any number above that is secure - though performance degrades as you approach ~20 validators. I personally, wouldn't recommend going above 20 - though have no specific metrics to back that up.

I have the following question, If a private transaction (off chain, using Orion) is submited, the transaction with the private transaction hash is added to the block everything goes as expected and nodes with the precompiled contract fetch the actual transaction from Orion and the Private Transaction Processor Excecutes it. What would happen if the transaction execution fails in one (or several) of the nodes of the Privacy Group?, but not in all of them, some sucessfully execute the private trx and update their private state.
</p>
<p><strong>raullaprida</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 02:31:37 GMT):<br/>
I can't just sync my private state with one of the other nodes that belong to the privacy group
</p>
<p><strong>raullaprida</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 02:32:54 GMT):<br/>
I suppose a manual solution is asking all of them and compare the state,  and hoping they are not colluding against me.

<p><strong>raullaprida</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 02:32:54 GMT):<br/>

I suppose a possible solution is trying re-processing the proposed block, or quickly retrying the execution of the private tx, or perhaps asking the private state to all of them (the privacy group) and compare them before applying that state,  hoping they are not colluding against me ( cumbersome solution)

The processing of a private transaction starts from a privacy transaction marker (PTM) that exists in the public chain. The PTM is a transaction sent to the privacy precompile, that will process the corresponding private transaction in the nodes that are part of the privacy group id.

In the case of the private transaction processing failing in some of the nodes, the processing of the PTM (a tx in the public chain) will also fail, causing the nodes to end up with a different public state, therefore creating a fork.

However, you should never get to a point where your private transactions are failing for some of the nodes. The usual reason for this to happen is caused by Orion unavailability. Unfortunately, our current implementation expects that Orion nodes are highly available.

I hope this answer your question!

HI @pcmola, I've analysed your log files above, and it appears the NodeKeys being used by nodes 2-4 do not align with the validators specified in the ExtraData of the genesis file. That may indicate a failure in our documentation (which I'll go through next) - but I think the simplest way to get you up and running is to replace the "extraData" value in each of your nodes' genesis file with the following:
0xf87ea00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f854945d301767ae21d29200661a24d9318d57885316fe94479b3fd753f6d6abf3ca90fb8c958589f1ac76769490412f52131219dc9cbb6bb4086d9fb581415163949ad9392bced25294981a323f167c45e97eba2aba808400000000c0

This will ensure that each of your existing node-keys corresponds to a validator in the network.
</p>

Which in turn should mean that blocks will get mined at a steady rate.

Thank you!, 
Another question, @antonydenyer or @iikirilov,  if I may, What kind of public state data is the precompiled contract that calls the private transaction processor actually storing after a successful execution? 
Also, is the only one validating the actual private transaction the node submitting it? or in the first stage, when Orion sends the tx to the other orion nodes, then those nodes actually validate the tx before the tx hash is sent back to the actual submitter (and then a block).
Thanks!!

Just a comment that I upgraded my OS X to Catalina and re-installed xcode and now the gradle build is running fine.  I also had to re-brew the java11 install but so far 362 tests completed.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 18:46:09 GMT):<br/>
Raul, I suggest you to take a look at this diagram that contains the private transaction processing flow: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Private-Transaction-Processing/

Basically, first the node distribute the payload to other participants (other Orion nodes), then Besu will validate and process the transaction (on the private state). If successful, it will create the PTM that will be added to the public chain. When another node sees the PTM, it will try to process the tx.

Things happen in this order:
1. nodeA will distribute the transaction payload to nodeB
2. nodeA will validate and execute the transaction. If successful, a privacy transaction marker will be created.
3. Upon seeing the PTM in the public chain, nodeB will start processing the tx.

If when nnodeA was validating and processing the tx it failed, the node wouldn't have created the PTM.
</p>
<p><strong>raullaprida</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 18:50:22 GMT):<br/>
right that's what I understood, I wanted to know if the scenario where node maliciously tries to send an invalid private transaction was covered, by pre-validating the actual trx before the hash gets into a block
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 18:50:58 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 19:50:36 GMT):<br/>
Sure can.  There's a few different options depending on what you want to do.  If you install Besu - https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Install-Binaries/, 
this doc describes the CLI options needed for different scenarios:

@pcmola It appears the contract you're deploying (or at least the truffle migrations part thereof) requires more gas (6,721,975) than the Ethereum block is allowed to contain (4,700,000). As a first attempt, I'd suggest changing "gasLimit" in each of your genesis files to 0x6ACFC0 (7,000,000) - you will need to delete your existing data (again) unfortunately.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 02:50:31 GMT):<br/>
Alternatly you could run with `--target-gas-limit=7000000` and wait for the block gas limit to rise.  Should take ~ 500 blocks.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 02:51:05 GMT):<br/>
About 2 hours for 15 second blocks.

Hello! One question. Let's say that we have a consortium (enterprise) blockchain network with Hyperledger Besu (Pantheon). Does it make sense to set up additionaly distributed data storage (ipfs or swarm) network across nodes which already run Pantheon clients fot the data storage purposes? Or it is better to increase the maximum block gas limit and then store data to blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 06:29:56 GMT):<br/>
The ethereum world state isn't optimised for large blobs of data, but it scales pretty well to having lots of reasonably small data items. So if you're doing a lot of work with files like images, I'd generally assume something like ifs or swarm would be worth the effort.  Really the only way to tell is to do some tests with storing the data in the Ethereum world state and see if it works well enough for your specific use cases.  If you find you need to raise the block gas limit to extremely high values to store the amount of data you need that would also be a sign that ipfs/swarm would be worthwhile.
</p>
<p><strong>podgostar</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:10:42 GMT):<br/>
As you say.. depends on the use-case.. we will do the research about this. Thank you for your opinion!
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:12:46 GMT):<br/>
You could cause a lot of trouble by sending (via orion) different private transactions to different nodes then creating a marker transaction manually. Each node would then have a different private state. 

A solution to this would be to include some kind of zk proof of the transaction that could be stored on the public chain. 

At the moment it's not on the roadmap for the next 6 months but that's not to say it couldn't be added after that if enough people want it. 

Near term we're looking at POW compatibility and on private chain privacy group management.

</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:23:40 GMT):<br/>
Currently, everyone's orion instance in the privacy group needs to be up for transactions to be submitted.  We are looking at ways of improving the situation (like you said call for help etc).

admin_ RPCs are not standardized.  But some are shared.  we currently have `admin_addPeer`, `admin_nodeInfo` and `admin_peers` which are shared,  we also have `admin_removePeer` and `admin_changeLogLevel` are ones we add and that are unique to us.

try `web.eth.getBalance('d0c4128ac194ccf505469f5ef2ff0cac99939f76')`.  web.eth.account is for the wallet services that Besu doesn't support.  It only would access accounts stored on the node you are connecting to.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 14:27:55 GMT):<br/>
All clients support the wallet add.  Under the cover it uses `eth_sendRawTransaction` instead of `eth_sendTransation` which depends on wallet functionality.  Not all clients support the `eth_personal` series of RPCs or wallet functionality.  For a benchmarking send raw is the common API.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 14:50:28 GMT):<br/>
The rpc is `eth_sendRawTransaction` It's web3.js that decides if it calls the raw or the wallet variant basedon whether or not it has the private key.  web3.js will sign the transaciton if it can.
</p>
<p><strong>SamuelDare</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 15:00:18 GMT):<br/>
thats further down the line for me and understand transaction signing. I just need to be able to call the accounts on the node first and blocked right now if i dont have access to `web3.eth.accounts`

Just for the record, seed accounts are not necessarily required for clique and ibft. You can operate a network without any ETH fine so long as min gas price is zero. In that case you don’t have to pay for gas so don’t need ETH.

</p>
<p><strong>GregTheGreek</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 19:02:08 GMT):<br/>
So when syncing with ETC (ETC and ETH use the same network id) - when the DAO fork happens Besu aggressively rejects blocks and it reallllly slows down the sync time. Not sure if theres something we can mitigate by also checking the chain id?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 19:03:55 GMT):<br/>
Let me dig, there may be multiple places we do dao checking.  We als validate peers with `DaoForkPeerValidator` but you wouldn't have peers if that was what the problem was.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 19:04:46 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking ETC support will want the inverse of `DaoForkPeerValidator` to ensure it gets ETC peers.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 19:06:05 GMT):<br/>
I bet it's org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.mainnet.MainnetBlockHeaderValidator#createDaoValidator causing the rejection.  You can put a breakpoint and see how it's getting introduced.

Hi I'm wondering if anyone has ever experienced truffle tests timing out when running against the clique consensus. I'm walking through the simple quickstart tutorial ( https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Quickstarts/Private-Network-Quickstart/ ). Everything works when using the default run.sh, and the truffle tests pass in seconds. However when I try `run.sh -c clique` the truffle tests time out:  `"before all" hook: prepare suite: Error: Timeout of 120000ms exceeded.` 
Is there anything else I need to do to get clique working? (Note the migrations work, just not the tests). My repo is here: https://github.com/jsaur/besu-playground
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 21:26:47 GMT):<br/>
So this indicates to me that a ClassicPeerValidator should be written.  Either validating the hashes right after the DAO fork or validating the absence of DAO markers.
</p>
<p><strong>GregTheGreek</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 21:28:02 GMT):<br/>
hmm - interesting ok
</p>
<p><strong>GregTheGreek</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 21:28:18 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense to me
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 13:53:07 GMT):<br/>
Ok I've discovered two things: (1) The timeout only occurs with solidity based truffle tests, javascript tests don't time out (2) If I lower the clique 'blockperiodseconds' from the default of 15 to 5 or 1, then both solidity and javascript tests pass. My guess is that there is something in the before all hook in the solidity tests that's making multiple blockchain calls, and when the block period is 15s it takes more the 120s to complete them all. Setting a lower block period allows all these tasks to complete. Since tests will be running against a test network, I'll just lower the block period to 1 s.

If the truffle tests are waiting for confirmation 15s blocks are a big problem.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:38:34 GMT):<br/>
You can either lower the blocktime on clique, but it may not be what you want, or lower the number of confirmations required for the tx to be validated. Using web3.js this can be done using the following property: `web3.transactionConfirmationBlocks = 1;`.
We have an example here line 25: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Transactions/#5-send-ether
</p>
<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:40:36 GMT):<br/>
whats the cause of the delay?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:43:41 GMT):<br/>
The cause is that Truffle tests are using web3.js library to connect and by default transactions requires too many validations to be validated. So number of validations x the blocktime makes it exceed the timeout. I had that before, I'm trying to find how I solved it and I tell you... I hope I will recover the change to make.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:48:53 GMT):<br/>
I think it's not the validations on this one, i had another issue too... can you provide your truffle-config.js file where you define the truffle-hdwallet-provider for Besu?

Can you try to see if using q provider qs indicated in truffle-config.js from our tutorial https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Quickstarts/Private-Network-Quickstart/#truffle-pet-shop-tutorial helps? The key is to create a new instance of PrivateKeyProvider for each connection.
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 15:14:46 GMT):<br/>
Here's my truffle-config.js, I believe mine is the same as the one in that tutorial: https://github.com/jsaur/besu-playground/blob/master/pet-shop/truffle-config.js
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 15:19:30 GMT):<br/>
Yes it is. Humm... I will have to dig that.
Can you give use more info on your setup? Besu version, Truffle version, OS and version?
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 15:33:16 GMT):<br/>
I have a simple repo that's just going through quickstart tutorial (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Quickstarts/Private-Network-Quickstart/ ), here's the commit where the test is failing: https://github.com/jsaur/besu-playground/commit/91fb96d2609b93c975cbb1f154b02cf94e638b35 (future commits then have changed the block period). Besu is running in docker containers so it's whatever version is in the quickstart repo. Truffle v5.0.41 is running on my Mac OS 10.14.6, but I can also put that in a docker container to make reproducing even easier.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 16:14:24 GMT):<br/>
I will have a look with that first and tell you if I need more.
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:16:59 GMT):<br/>
I was going to put it into a docker container anyways, here it is, if it's useful: https://github.com/jsaur/besu-playground/tree/test-timeout
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 11:44:42 GMT):<br/>
I had a look at your repos, but I don't understand why you run two docker compose in your readme? and link them on the same network. What do you do with the first tab one?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:21:26 GMT):<br/>
It also seems that your node truffle image misses truffle/hdwallet-provider package
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:24:01 GMT):<br/>
Question 1: I didn't want to change the besu-quickstart docker compose files too much, but wanted the pet-shop docker container to be able to connect to the besu nodes. The easiest way I could think of was to create a new docker-compose for pet-shop and have it on the same network.
2) I believe it's included here: https://github.com/jsaur/besu-playground/blob/test-timeout/pet-shop/package.json#L22 unless you're referring to something else?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:38:58 GMT):<br/>
I'm still looking at your issues of course.
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:44:06 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, also this isn't urgent, since I found a workaround by setting the blockperiodseconds to 1 (which also makes all around development faster).
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:31:45 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but it should work so I have to digg ;)
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:47:08 GMT):<br/>
I knew I met this issue before... so you may have this succeed: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/47698/405 Because even if you reduce the blocktime, at some point even a 1sec will be too long and will trigger the timeout  (if you have more than 120 test tx, on per block, it will reach it). So the solution is to add the mocha section in your truffle config as explained in the StackExchange answer.

hi.
I'm software engineer in japan.
Mr.Masa and Mr.Tom introduced me to here.
now, I'm trying to create private chain in aws by using ECS.
i was able to create three besu node in ecs, but i cannot connect them to each other.
Could anyone cooperate with me?

<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:58:34 GMT):<br/>
Hi @syuta-sugawara , I'm sure we can help. 
What other details can you give us to better understand where the problem is? 
What error are you getting? 
Did you setup your security groups correctly- with the correct open ports?

Hello, I am updating some nodes that are on pantheon 1.2.0 to besu 1.2.5, in this process I have observed that nodes cannot communicate between both versions. Is  it necessary to update all nodes to new version?
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 19:54:18 GMT):<br/>
I have just observed that only one besu node is connecting to pantheon version, but whole ibft consensus has stopped.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 19:57:05 GMT):<br/>
can you update to latest version since you are updating?
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 19:58:22 GMT):<br/>
why are they not connecting well?, is it necessary to update whole network?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 20:37:33 GMT):<br/>
We would need more details about your setup to tell, would you like to switch to PM?

For the record @abdelhamidbakhta , @eum602 seems to experience https://pegasys1.atlassian.net/browse/PAN-3260 but on Google Cloud, except that the admin_addPeer doesn't seem to work. Many things to confirm and he will try a few things on his side, but it may give you new informations on this issue.

In geth clique, under some circumstances (e. g. fast block times, lagging network) a deadlock can happen, where the signers stop signing and infinitely wait for each other. See https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/18402#issuecomment-548704288 — did someone observed this with Besu Clique too?

This is a problem with the Clique protocol itself so does apply to all clients. However, it becomes much more likely when there are a lot of out of turn blocks being produced. That in turn tends to happen if signers are either misbehaving (Geth and Besu both behave well in this regard) or if the time required to propagate blocks across the network is close to the block period time.  The one key difference between Geth and Besu which may help this happen less on Besu is that when there are two blocks with equal difficulty Geth will pick one randomly whereas Besu will stick with the first block received. That doesn't eliminate the issue but does mean that if a couple of signers have slower network connectivity and are producing out of turn blocks as a result, the other nodes are likely to have recieved the in-turn blocks first and will stick with them making it more likely the network will continue.  It's only a pretty minor difference though.

Hello, based on the "Private Network Quickstart" installation, I use the Metamask application to create a new account on the system. by checking on the ethstats-light, I see the created account but when I execute a transfer between this new account and one of the three accounts created during the installation, the transaction is "waiting" and seems frozen. I'm suspecting that this is a problem of key that BESU doesn't have when Metamask creates the account. Could you please help me?

i saw this tutorial.

what private key should i use in this line?
const privateKey = "<account-private-key>";

is this private-key  written in genesis.json ?

The IP address is not part of the host whitelist , the `--host-whitelist` option.  By default it is 127.0.0.1 (a more secure default).  You can set it to `*` to accept any connection or to the specific host names you are accessing it by.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 21:03:37 GMT):<br/>
One option is to do a squash on top of the chain head and then force push that single commit, with the DCO.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 21:04:03 GMT):<br/>
DCO re-writes work best for single commits.

First, be aware that all the keys we provide in our tutorials are test keys, do not use them for other purpose than tests.

Then, if you imported miner account key in metamask, no issue, you should see the account balance increase in Metamask as blocks are mined and rewards sent to this account. If you don't see the account balance inclrease, it may be a sign that the mining process is not working well. I suggest that you do as you did, restarting the quickstart in this case.

Gradle doesn't support Java 13 (yet).Besu runs fine on Java 13. It just doesn’t currently build on Java 13 because gradle doesn’t support it.

You could revert to Java11 (LTS version).
Alternatively, you can run Besu without building it, by using our binaries here https://bintray.com/hyperledger-org/besu-repo/besu/_latestVersion#files

@RealDeanZhao 

I'm not sure exactly how much overlap there is, because I don't know maker in detail, but we are currently working with the Ethereum Foundation to help them integrate Besu into a tool that acts somewhat like maker. 

https://github.com/ethereum/grid
Its a GUI desktop tool to handle config and deployment of ethereum networks using different clients.

They will be present in our November 26th Contributor call to give updates on the Besu integration.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 14:38:00 GMT):<br/>
The extra quoting for `host-whitelist` and `cors-origin` look to be the problem.
```
"command": ["besu",
"--data-path=data",
"--genesis-file=../genesis.json",
"--p2p-host=0.0.0.0",
"--p2p-port=30303",
"--rpc-http-enabled",
"--rpc-http-api=ETH,NET,IBFT",
"--host-whitelist=*",
"--rpc-http-cors-origins=all",
"--rpc-http-host=0.0.0.0",
"--rpc-http-port=8545",
"--min-gas-price=0"] ,
```
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 15:12:25 GMT):<br/>
The problem comes in the following scenario: I have an ibft2 network which is under onchain permissioning.
At the beggining all works well but if for some reason the network stops validating blocks(eg. some validators >1/3 n;n=#total_validators;go offline) then when trying to start  the network again by starting the offline validators then THE NETWORK DOES NOT START VALIDATING BLOCKS.
The way I found to start the network is by restarting validators WITHOUT:
```
--permissions-accounts-contract-enabled
--permissions-accounts-contract-address=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000008888
--permissions-nodes-contract-enabled
--permissions-nodes-contract-address=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000009999
``` 

Then the network started without permissioning.

Finally I procceded restarting, gradually in order to not to loose connection between validators. But this time each node was started with the permissioning flags.

I consider that if the network fails, then the validators should be able to start again with onchain permissioning without any extra step.

Hello,
Im curious about how besu fetches blocks from the network when specifying a network like Rinkeby but i cant seem to find in which portion of the project that happens...
Any help is welcomed

<p><strong>GregTheGreek</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 18:11:04 GMT):<br/>
hey all -- sorry for the delay on the ETC stuff. We had no idea you needed to --signoff. Its causing some headaches but I think we've got it all resolved now
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 18:13:43 GMT):<br/>
It works the same on all networks except that for each of them we have a different genesis file that indicates the required chain id and state. But we also have a predefined list of bootnodes. So when you use the `--network=rinkeby` CLI option, it loads this genesis and bootnodes and connects to the nodes to retrieve blocks using p2p as for any other network. One place you could start having a look to see how it differs is  /besu/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/cli/config/EthNetworkConfig.java
</p>
<p><strong>rachidchami</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 18:29:30 GMT):<br/>
I checked the code over there and i found the part when a new *EthNetworkConfig* gets created but after what i have no clue what happens after neither where do these parameters get parsed.
I guess ill just have to read the code more.
Thank you for your help

Whats the difference between `--signoff` and signing your commits ? 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 21:17:05 GMT):<br/>
`--signoff` auto-generates the signoff based on your git config. As far as I know it's the exact same comment you can hand write.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 21:17:45 GMT):<br/>
signed commits use actual cryptography to generate a cryptographic signautre.  The DCO process doesn't care about these cryptographic signatures.

Hi. Is it possible to use Besu as public consortium interchain?. I want to build a permissioned network where selected nodes can read/write/transact, but also have a token which can be public. This also means that public nodes must be able to read and broadcast transactions to the network.

Hi! My name is Mohamed and I am one of the cofounders of Blok-Z. I was invited here by Faisal from the PegaSys team. Nice to meet you all!

I've been going through the Besu documentation and the following section made we wonder:

"We do not recommend putting bootnodes behind a load balancer. Put more bootnodes on the network itself."
*See*: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Deploy/Bootnodes/

What is the rationale behind the recommendation? Is it due to:
1. Issues arising from requests to the bootnode appearing to originate from the load balancer instead of from peers.
2. Or the added hassle to collect request logs from both bootnodes as well as the load balancer

Or some other reason altogether?

Thanks!

Hello everyone, I'm using web3j with Besu protocol (https://github.com/web3j/web3j/blob/master/besu/src/main/java/org/web3j/protocol/besu/Besu.java). I can make a private transaction but I can't get the result of a call in the contract. I'm using this to load the contract: "contract.load(address ..., Besu ..., BesuPrivateTransactionManager ..., BesuPrivacyGasProvider ...)" and for call "contract.myfunction(param).send()" but nothing returns.
</p>
<p><strong>camilo5972</strong> (Sun, 10 Nov 2019 17:32:01 GMT):<br/>
or if someone has examples of how to use web3j-besu for interaction with smart contracts it would be very helpful. In a context of private transactions.

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 10 Nov 2019 20:52:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi @mojo Mainly 1. This is because the node's enode is tied to the IP of the bootnode itself so this doesn't quite work when behind a load balancer. For redundancy what we'd recommend is multiple bootnodes and keeping their IP's & keys static so that should they fail for some reason, automation can recover them with the same enode. Logs are fine as is - where possible we'd recommend using a log collation tool to make life easier - eg: ELK, Sumo, Fluentd etc

</p>
<p><strong>mojo</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 11:17:20 GMT):<br/>
Ahh that makes a lot of sense! So if either the public key, IP or port changes then the bootnode's enode will be different. Therefore, nodes won't be able to connect to that bootnode on startup, right?

Thanks a lot for the explanation and suggestions!

Hyperledger Besu is an enterprise-focused Ethereum client. It is designed with permissioning and privacy features out of the gate. It is also written in Java, popularly used in enterprise software, which means that companies will be more willing to try Besu out and contribute. 

One other important distinction between other clients such as Geth and Quorum is licensing. Besu is under the Apache 2.0 license while Geth and Quorum fall under GPL. GPL forces derivative work to be open-sourced. This is a big obstacle for most businesses that want to extend Ethereum clients using their own proprietary software.

These are just some of the differences that I know which make Besu a compelling Ethereum client option for enterprise.

Hyperledger Besu is an open source Ethereum client developed under the Apache 2.0 license and written in Java. It can be run on the Ethereum public network or on private permissioned networks, as well as test networks such as Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Görli. Hyperledger Besu includes several consensus algorithms including PoW, PoA, and IBFT, and has comprehensive permissioning schemes designed specifically for uses in a consortium environment.

Hyperledger Besu is an enterprise-focused Ethereum client. It is designed with permissioning and privacy features out of the gate. It is also written in Java, popularly used in enterprise software, which means that companies will be more willing to try Besu out and contribute.

One other important distinction between other clients such as Geth and Quorum is licensing. Besu is under the Apache 2.0 license while Geth and Quorum fall under GPL. GPL forces derivative work to be open-sourced. This is a big obstacle for most businesses that want to extend Ethereum clients using their own proprietary software.

These are just some of the differences that I know which make Besu a compelling Ethereum client option for enterprise.

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 23:00:02 GMT):<br/>
I would strongly recommend against opening the JSON-RPC to any internet traffic.  Most likely there are bots spamming it in an attempt to steal funds from any unlocked accounts (besu doesn't include a wallet to avoid this problem but that won't stop them trying).  Or they may just be spamming it as a DOS attempt to cause trouble.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 23:18:56 GMT):<br/>
In fact I have tested that closing the rpc decreases the cpu resource usage. But I would like to know why this error is appearing and why it is consuming so much cpu?

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 23:20:43 GMT):<br/>
Most likely it's using a lot of CPU because someone is executing a lot of requests - probably as fast as they can send them and potentially asking Besu to perform complex tasks like via calls to eth_call.  The error indicates that they send the request and disconnect before receiving the response - we should reduce the log level it's printed at.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 23:21:44 GMT):<br/>
It looks very much like someone is performing a deliberate DOS attack on the node.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 00:41:05 GMT):<br/>
I can confirm that even on a testnet that snoppers will start port scanning IPs of nodes that are connected and making calls on the RPC designed to attack lax security.

Hi @NicolasMassart  thank you for the reply. And sorry for the late reply. Let me remulate the question since the last one was a little unclear. I would like to build a consortium chain run by selected participants and with a native token. On top of that I want to deploy a collateral debt position contract for a payment token that can only be used inside the network. 
</p>
<p><strong>MathiasGlintborg</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 04:31:18 GMT):<br/>

i created raw transaction like this.
const rawTx = {

gasPrice: this.web3.utils.toHex(0),
gasLimit: this.web3.utils.toHex(126165),

when i tried to send transaction, i got this error.
Error: Returned error: Invalid params
how can i solve this?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 09:44:34 GMT):<br/>
If it's listed on crypto exchange, does it mean available on mainnet? So you need a nodes with a link to mainnet where your public token will be and a private chain with your private token and contract?

hi, should i use web3.js-eea for sending transaction to besu nodes?
what's the difference between web3.js-eea and web3.js when we send transaction to besu nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 09:50:56 GMT):<br/>
Hi, web3.js-eea is only if you need to use Besu privacy features https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Overview/
Otherwise, the regular web3.js is fine (for instance if interacting with public networks like mainnet or public test nets).

i'd like to send transaction from server side by using node js.
should i use this command when starting besu?
--permissions-accounts-config-file-enabled
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 10:06:41 GMT):<br/>
It's not related to server side (by the way, server side or client side works the same, you call a JSON-RPC API). The `--permissions-accounts-config-file-enabled` option enables the use of a local configuration file to set the account whitelist: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Limit-Access/Local-Permissioning/#permissions-configuration-file
</p>

which should i use?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 03:50:40 GMT):<br/>
The use of upper and lower case letters doesn't affect the actual resulting address so both are referring to the same account.  Truffle is capitalising some letters as a form of checksumming to help detect mistyped addresses.  It's common for wallets, including metamask, to verify this checksum and alert the user they may have entered the address incorrectly, but clients like Besu will treat both addresses as the same.

Hi, consortium performance. Our smart contracts are quite complex and gas heavy, and some statistics on how that translates into how long a given smart contract function actually takes to execute would be super useful.

5 ports right now, only one is "required".  All via CLI or a config .toml.  Only P2P/Discovery is opened by default.
30303 - P2P/Discovery (tcp and udp)  - `--p2p-port`

8546 - Websockets APIs (tcp, optional) - `--rpc-ws-port`

9545 - metrics (prometheus format, tcp, optional) `--metrics-port`

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 12:00:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes you can start with one validator and  add other validators. The important thing is that you have to vote the new validator (make the addValidator call) on enough validators to reach the consensus. If you have only one node to start with, the consensus (51%) is reached by voting only on this node. Then to add a third node, you have to vote on node 1 and node 2. To ad a 4th node, vote on at least on 2 of the 3 validators nodes, and so on.

Besu does not provide account management, on purpose for security reasons. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Account-Management/

Status of the project seems to be that it's unmaintained but code can probably still be used. It would just require a fork and new maintainers if you want to keep it alive.

They negotiate per-session symmetric keys.  It would require the same level of maniulation that watching a SSL connection live would require.  If you turn on trace debugging we do spit out a lot of the P2P messages, but it's not in a common format and theres also a bunch of EVM traceing too.

Hello everyone, I am using orion and Besu, I have troubles when I try to create a group with createPrivacyGroup:
```
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "priv_findPrivacyGroup",
    "params": [
        ["6v46IAyxnLmuiVNNMykdwlgLyDFDOy8HJSl66eSpwRc=", "2t0IA54d2SaezQVGDfGV9juGMxlQl6OIccVwUgXVOTg="]
    ],
    "id": 1
}```
The group is only created on the node that was involved in the rpc url, but not on the other node.
If I deploy on nodes that are on localhost then all works well, the problem appears when I try to do the same on nodes that are on cloud VM. On VM I have opened the nodeport; the client port only listens on localhost because each orion node is on the same VM with the BESU node.
I would like to receive some suggests about hot to deal with this issue. Thanks!

Hi, could you confirm if your Orion nodes are connected to each other? One way that you could test this is sending a payload using /send and trying to receive it in another node using /receive.

Also, double check your Orion config to ensure that you have configured the nodeurl with an reachable endpoint, as this is the url that Orion will advertise.

It would help if you could share your Orion config file (for the local nodes and the nodes running on cloudVM).

Your problem seems to be related to network config. This is a common issue when using Docker or VMs. Take a look at this repo (https://github.com/lucassaldanha/besu-three-nodes-example). It is a docker config but it might help you to see the required config options.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 17 Nov 2019 21:26:52 GMT):<br/>
I believe you need to update your nodeurl property to something that is reachable by the other nodes.
Unless you are running all nodes locally, this nodeurl won't work.

hello.
sorry so suddenly.

I used "ethereumjs-tx": "^2.1.1" and "web3": "^1.2.1" for sending send a signed transaction to besu, however those don't work,
so i changed those versions like this.
"ethereumjs-tx": "^1.3.7",
"web3": "^1.0.0-beta.55"
these worked.

I use besu version v1.3.2.
I'd like to use newer versions. how can I do that?

@NicolasMassart initially it will be issued on Ethereum with ERC-20 and listed on mainstream crypto exchanges. We are currently designing our own blockchain, and yes, once that one runs on MainNet we will migrate from Ethereum to that one. We are currently exploring different blockchain frameworks that accommodate our requirements. We want to build a consortium network with known node participants, the native and public traded token, a CDP contract similar to DAI, and payment tokens that the CDP will create. It's only the native token that will be listed on exchanges.

hi.
I'd like to confirm this node status.
i deployed besu node on aws. then now I'm watching log.
i created private network with three nodes by using ibft.
does this log show that this node work as a peering node?

Hi @syuta-sugawara The lines containing "IbftRound" imply the node producing this log file is acting as a validator in the network and appears to be receiving the expected numbers of prepare/commit messages.
If you require further information, you can turn on DEBUG (or maybe TRACE) logging, which will show you all of the reception/transmission of each prepare/commit messages (but will also produce _a lot_ of noise)

hi. how to stop besu by using any command?
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Mon, 18 Nov 2019 08:14:45 GMT):<br/>
Hi @syuta-sugawara , if you're running besu with a docker container, you stop it with: `docker stop <container-name>`
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Run-Docker-Image/#stopping-besu-and-cleaning-up-resources

If you ran it in your terminal, you can stop it by interrpting/terminating the process with `CTRL+C` or equivalent.

hi,i created free gas private network with besu. now i cannot send transaction by using web3js. i created raw transaction like this
var txObject = {
nonce: web3.utils.numberToHex(txnCount),
gasPrice: web3.utils.numberToHex(1000),
gasLimit: web3.utils.numberToHex(21000),
to: addressTo,
value: web3.utils.numberToHex(web3.utils.toWei(valueInEther.toString(), 'ether'))
};
when i tried to send transaction, i got this error.
Error: Returned error: Invalid params
how can i solve this?
and thank you

Another question for enode URL do you use an aws ec2 private IP or public IP?
</p>
<p><strong>EdJoJob</strong> (Mon, 18 Nov 2019 20:06:44 GMT):<br/>
the genesis file only specifies the first block in the network, and the network hardforks.  If you are using a Proof of Authority network, that first block will need to include the `extradata` which specifies the validator nodes.  Have a look at https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-Private-Clique-Network/ or https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-IBFT-Network/ which has the generation steps
</p>
<p><strong>EdJoJob</strong> (Mon, 18 Nov 2019 20:08:49 GMT):<br/>
The IP in the enode URL needs to be the IP by which the node would normally be accessible by other nodes in the network.  If all nodes are in EC2, then the Private IP can work, but if you are joining to a wider network, or wanting to work with any node outside EC2, then you need to use the Public IP.

hi.
we use nodejs.
we'd like to send a singed transaction by using below codes.

    const data = contractInstance
      .deploy({ data: contractBytecode, arguments: args })
      .encodeABI();
    const to = null;
    const rawTx = await this.getRawTx(
      to,
      value,
      data,
      pendingTxCount,
      accountAddress,
      gasLimit,
    );

however,
we got these error
Error: Transaction has been reverted by the EVM:↵{↵  "blockHash": "0x6bc7f94edb8ff43cb40ac439d134d4c37700f5c4db51fb10298ac92778215589",↵  "blockNumber": 34599,↵  "contractAddress": "0x42699A7612A82f1d9C36148af9C77354759b210b",↵  "cumulativeGasUsed": 1996831,↵  "from": "0xfe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73",↵  "gasUsed": 1996831,↵  "logs": [],↵  "logsBloom": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",↵  "status": false,↵  "to": null,↵  "transactionHash": "0xf6ebec42c12a9745e63eba2f1ab561d947ab4f74260129ecc0ef40bc7a868990",↵  "transactionIndex": 0↵}"


could any one help us?

actually sending transaction with above codes works in ethreum public and test net.

Hi
I'm trying to deploy ERC1400 contract below to besu by truffle, but I can not because of the error, "The contract code couldn't be stored, please check your gas limit..".
(I can deoly it to ganache)
https://github.com/ConsenSys/ERC1400/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC1400ERC20.sol

I can deploy ERC20 contract by Openzeppelin to besu.
Are there any limitation of contract size to deploy?
</p>
<p><strong>AkihiroTanaka</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 04:59:52 GMT):<br/>

hello.
sorry, this is the second time for me to ask this question.

I used "ethereumjs-tx": "^2.1.1" and "web3": "^1.2.1" for sending send a signed transaction to besu, however those don't work,
so i changed those versions like this.
"ethereumjs-tx": "^1.3.7",
"web3": "^1.0.0-beta.55"
these worked.

I use besu version v1.3.2.
I'd like to use newer versions. how can I do that?

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 13:45:08 GMT):<br/>
Hi, it may not be related but there's at least one issue in your truffle config because the provider should be a closure instead of a new instance. See https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Quickstarts/Private-Network-Quickstart/#truffle-pet-shop-tutorial
As shown in the sample, your provider should be `provider: () => new PrivateKeyProvider(privateKey, "<YOUR HTTP RPC NODE ENDPOINT>"),` in order to prevent connection limits. The closure creates a new connection each time. It's an issue especially when running tests in truffle as they create a lot of connections to run parallel tests, but it may have some consequences here too. Give it at least a try and even if it does not solve this specific issue, know that it's the preferred way to instantiate the provider anyway.

Hi, it may not be related but there's at least one issue in your truffle config because the provider should be a function instead of a new instance. See https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Quickstarts/Private-Network-Quickstart/#truffle-pet-shop-tutorial
As shown in the sample, your provider should be `provider: () => new PrivateKeyProvider(privateKey, "<YOUR HTTP RPC NODE ENDPOINT>"),` in order to prevent connection limits. The function reference here creates a new connection each time. It's an issue especially when running tests in truffle as they create a lot of connections to run parallel tests, but it may have some consequences here too. Give it at least a try and even if it does not solve this specific issue, know that it's the preferred way to instantiate the provider anyway.

how to get the node address of a validator
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:29:29 GMT):<br/>
The first parameter "7c87...7c4c" is not an address, it looks like a public or private key. Addresses are 20 bytes or 40 hex numbers long.
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:30:53 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, i tried to use /opt/besu/bin/besu public-key export-address to get the correct address just now. 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:30:58 GMT):<br/>
On the node itself this script should work - https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-Private-Clique-Network/#2-get-address-for-node-1
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:31:29 GMT):<br/>
Why not make this as a default step when starting a besu node? The terminal only print the enode on the screen.

Has anyone setup a network on EC2 and does anyone have documentation they can share on that process? Our team is currently stuck on trying to do this. We are not to sure how to start and leave a node running (if there is a command to do that) and we also have validators defaulting to the default enode address and not the one specified

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:03:05 GMT):<br/>
If you are in docker I would recommend `--p2p-host=<external-ip> and `--p2p-interface=127.0.0.1` as CLI parameters to make discovery bi-directional.  Right now you will only find host you connect to, there will be no inbound connections.

</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 20:36:59 GMT):<br/>
great! That changed the output! So to connect the other validators would I specify the enodes ip?
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 20:37:18 GMT):<br/>
replacing the 0.0.0.0 with the ip ?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 21:52:12 GMT):<br/>
If you want to be explicit about your IP replace 0.0.0.0 with the IP.  If you want to advertise what the networking stack advertisis as your external address, use 0.0.0.0  But for AWS IIRC you will need the actual external address.  I think we got some magic scripts to extract it in our setup from AWS calls.

<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 05:36:33 GMT):<br/>
Hi @RealDeanZhao, When dealing with IBFT2, there 2 ways to be considered "in the network". The first, is standard Ethereum peering - i.e. are all the nodes in the network communicating using standard Ethereum protocols (i.e. discovering and sharing blocks etc). The second way it needs to be considered is "now that my node is part of the network, how do I make it a validator (i.e. one of the authorised mining nodes)".
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 05:38:29 GMT):<br/>
A java int, 2^31-1, so 2 Billion.  In practice there are other rules to keep this from mattering, like the "all but 1/64th" rule on CALL operations.
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 05:39:03 GMT):<br/>
So there's a few things to work out first:
1. What validators are specified in your Genesis file (encoded in the extra data)
2. Are your nodes connected at a network level?
3. Are blocks being mined (can be determined using the Json RPC documented here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#eth_blocknumber)

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 05:42:18 GMT):<br/>
Seems accurate, it's hard to tell without runnning it.  However you have no ether allocations so your nodes will have to run with `--min-gas-price=0` and you won't be able to use gas to limit transactions.  I would add some so you at least have the option of turning it on later.

and confirming 10.244.200.77 is the IP of the host?
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:21:26 GMT):<br/>
(i.e. its not on a docker network, it is literally the IP address of your mac)
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:22:40 GMT):<br/>
yes, it's the ip of my mac
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:24:19 GMT):<br/>
My suspicion is that may not work - you may be required to construct a "docker network" for the two containers to be able to communicate...
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:27:23 GMT):<br/>
it's a lan ip of my mac. I will try to ping the ip inside the container.

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:38:28 GMT):<br/>
Hi @RealDeanZhao you'd need to bind this to your host network 
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:38:53 GMT):<br/>
so stop the first node and add `--net=host` as an option to every container 
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:39:17 GMT):<br/>
that will bind them to your host interface and you can use 10.244.200.77
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:42:16 GMT):<br/>
start node1 like so: `docker run -p 7555:8545  -p 7556:8545 -p 30313:30313  --net=host -v $PWD/lib/besu:/var/lib/besu  -v $PWD/besu-data:/besu-data  -v $PWD/../genesis.json:/genesis.json hyperledger:besu.........`
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:42:16 GMT):<br/>
start node1 like so: `docker run -p 7555:8545  -p 7556:8546 -p 30313:30313  --net=host -v $PWD/lib/besu:/var/lib/besu  -v $PWD/besu-data:/besu-data  -v $PWD/../genesis.json:/genesis.json hyperledger:besu.........`
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:42:52 GMT):<br/>
the easier alternative to this is using a docker-compose file and starting one up at a time where you can see whats happening
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:47:06 GMT):<br/>
I used docker-compose to start the network successfully. Now I want to use docker to start nodes on different machines.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:47:45 GMT):<br/>
could you explain different machines please?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:48:27 GMT):<br/>
you have n machines and you're trying to start besu on each to form the network?
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:48:54 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's what i mean
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:49:17 GMT):<br/>
i don't want to install besu binary on every machine
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:49:44 GMT):<br/>
right, so besu via docker on each machine?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:50:22 GMT):<br/>
if so this makes things a lot simpler
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:50:33 GMT):<br/>
I haven't tried yet. I tried to start the besu docker on my local machine with exposing different port for different node.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:51:07 GMT):<br/>
ok so we have 2 setups to examine:
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:51:30 GMT):<br/>
1. the use case of docker on local machine exposing different ports 
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:53:01 GMT):<br/>
so this setup requires you to bind each container to the host network interface. When you fire up each container add `--net=host` and the appropriate port maps and that should work. 
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:53:29 GMT):<br/>
An alternative is to setup a docker network and set each container to use that network.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:53:56 GMT):<br/>
2. The distributed setup with n machines is simpler
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:54:32 GMT):<br/>
But if you use docker you will have to bind to the host network otherwise there wont be any comms across machines. 
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:54:46 GMT):<br/>
So start each container up like so:
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:55:46 GMT):<br/>
`docker run -p 8545:8545  -p 8546:8546 -p 30303:30303  --net=host -v $PWD/lib/besu:/var/lib/besu  -v $PWD/besu-data:/besu-data  -v $PWD/../genesis.json:/genesis.json hyperledger:besu .... `
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:55:46 GMT):<br/>
```docker run -p 8545:8545  -p 8546:8546 -p 30303:30303  --net=host -v $PWD/lib/besu:/var/lib/besu  -v $PWD/besu-data:/besu-data  -v $PWD/../genesis.json:/genesis.json hyperledger:besu .... ```
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:58:30 GMT):<br/>
and set the `  --p2p-port=30303` for all of the containers 
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:59:44 GMT):<br/>
Also I think there is a typo in the command to start containers up port `7556 should bind to 8546` I think?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 07:00:51 GMT):<br/>
Does that sound about right for what you're attempting to do?

start your second node with that 
</p>

you may need to check the data paths so node2 has a differnt directory to node1

@joshuafernandes I only use the first node to generate the extra data. Why the second node can join successfully even i dont propose it to be a validator.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 07:41:40 GMT):<br/>
lost me 
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 07:41:41 GMT):<br/>
In this situation, the first node is the bootnode and validator node but the second node is the only rpc node not a validator node?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 07:42:17 GMT):<br/>
any node can join the network once you have the first (bootnode) up, however only certain nodes (validators) can create blocks
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 07:42:42 GMT):<br/>
in the extra data you specify which they are so it knows what to expect
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 07:43:24 GMT):<br/>
and that config generally lives in the genesis file when you get the rest of the network nodes up, after that you vote validators in /out
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 07:43:45 GMT):<br/>
I proposed the second node to be a validator, but the vote is still pending.

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 07:47:15 GMT):<br/>
right i see, from what i can see the second node has joined as a normal node ie it cant validate - once the first node accepts it (second) can act as a validtor

hi
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 12:15:15 GMT):<br/>
I've got a question regarding private transactions. Is there a way to create a private transaction that can be accessed only by the members of the transaction? i.e. if I transfer some ERC20 to another address then only me and the other address would be able to view the details of the transaction
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 12:15:45 GMT):<br/>
I've read the docs and I can find these of restrictions at the orion nodes level
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 12:36:55 GMT):<br/>
That's exactly what private tx are made for IMO.
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 13:03:36 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks. Can you please confirm if my understanding of the privacy feature is correct? Imaging the following scenario.

- We have two privacy groups (Node1, Node2) and (Node 1, Node 3)

- We have the following account whitelisting on each node

Node 1 Whitelist = [AccountA, AccountB]
Node 2 Whitelist = [AccountB]
Node 3 whitelist = [AccountC]

Imagine AccountA sends 10 ERC20 tokens to AccountB via Node 1. Then 

1) The balance of AccountA on Node 1 and Node 2 will be 10.
2) The balance of AccountA on Node 3 will 0 because it rejected the transaction

</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 13:04:08 GMT):<br/>
is my understanding accurate?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 13:11:01 GMT):<br/>
Let me ask some help on that, to be sure ;)
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 13:41:38 GMT):<br/>
thanks mate :)
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:30:40 GMT):<br/>
Slightly different. The transaction isn't rejected it just doesn't exist on Node 3.  
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:33:52 GMT):<br/>
oh ok. So basically Node 3 will receive the transaction but it will simply ignore it 
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:35:08 GMT):<br/>
Sort of, it will receive the marker transaction but will never have the private payload of. In this sense the privacy model is 'restricted' as in the data payload is only set to a restricted set of parties. 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:46:41 GMT):<br/>
I think I'm getting it now. So the `privateFor` will decide who Node 1 (or more accurately it's orion node) will send the full private transaction to. I assume the marker transaction contains the minimum data possible for the private transaction
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:47:04 GMT):<br/>
exactly. 
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:50:44 GMT):<br/>
fantastic! Thank you guys this was very helpful
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:51:17 GMT):<br/>
one last thing, which I know might sound silly but I'll ask it anyway :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: 
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:51:31 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:52:15 GMT):<br/>
is there any way when sending a transaction decide which other addresses will be able to read it. Basically privacy at the account level rather than node level
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:52:38 GMT):<br/>
Do you mean ethereum address? 
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:53:39 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:57:11 GMT):<br/>
Each privacy group has it's own state root. Which means that only people inside that group will be able to read that state. If you have deployed a contract to group1 it will not exist in group2 (or more accurately it will be empty). 

Perhaps a use case might make it clearer what you are trying to achieve? 
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:00:47 GMT):<br/>
from what I understood, privacy groups are formed of Orion public addresses rather that individual Ethereum address. 
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:08:27 GMT):<br/>
Imagine Node 1, Node 2 and Node 3 being controlled by three distinct organisations. We can apply privacy groups for the organizations, as we pretty much discussed above. However, what if within the same organisation I would like to hide the transactions amongst different departments each of which is connected and sending transaction to the node via the JSON-RPC API. 
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:09:13 GMT):<br/>
I would like to apologise beforehand if the example sounds a bit weird :laughing:

</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:35:41 GMT):<br/>
Basically you need to do something else to encrypt the payload. You'd need  to look at zkproofs. Or you could do something at the application. 
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:37:14 GMT):<br/>
but no, there's nothing out of the box that I know about
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:38:28 GMT):<br/>
Or have each department have its own Orion node
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:43:30 GMT):<br/>
yes guys this is pretty much what I thought as well. I was looking into the aztec protocol to support such ZK scenario. Also the solution with separate Orion nodes is quite viable

Hi guys! I want to learn more in depth how Besu works, so that I can collaborate. But I only get this general architecture of the implementation: http://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/ArchitectureOverview/
For instance, what's the role of `Account` and `DefaultEVMAccount` or `StateTrieAccountValue` ? I know they are part of different stages of a transaction execution, but it's difficult to have a clear picture of the implementation.
Do you guys have any diagram with more detail that can help?
Thanks

Hi Carlos, I'm glad to know you want to help and contribute. 
AFAIK, there isn't a more in-depth architecture diagram. 
Now that you've mentioned it though, it might make sense for us to spend some time and make one, or possibly a video walkthrough of our code base.
In the meanwhile, `Account` and `StateTrieAccountValue` are implementations of core ethereum concepts that you can find in `besu/ethereum/core`
I'm not sure what `DefaultEVMAccount` is though.

Hi, I just setup my first 4-nodes IBFT2 test network.  I'm able to publish new contract and invoke transactions calling public methods.
My problem comes when trying to retrieve generated contract event/logs.  If a call a method than triggers and event and I'm "fast enough" to retrieve the logs, I can see them for a while.

A moment later the log looks to "hide for ever". The contract state is modified as expected, that warrants that the TX has not been rolled back, but no hint about how to retrieve the "hidden" logs. Any idea? (I'm using web3j that limits to setup a filter and call eth_getFilterChanges periodically )

Looks like if the network were always in "fast-sync" mode, even when I force "--sync-mode=FULL". (I can see a generated data/fastsync directory in the bootstrap node).

The problem persists when using docker-compose example from https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-quickstart

If I replace the besu network by a local ganache-cli things works as expected and I can retrieve "old" events. 

Any idea?

Hi! Could you confirm what is the command that you are using to start the nodes? If using fast sync, could you try adding `--pruning-enabled=false` to the start command (or the config file).

The thread block is likely unrelated to the bootnode being down and could be a noisy confiuration in Besu.  However we would need more of the log to be sure.  Do you have more of the stack trace available?

</p>
<p><strong>syuta-sugawara</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 01:54:28 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 09:57:33 GMT):<br/>
The default poll time for Web3J is quite long - something like 15 seconds from memory...
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 09:58:26 GMT):<br/>
There's a version of `Web3j.build` which allows you to specify the polling interval so you can make it shorter.
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 09:58:40 GMT):<br/>
How can I set the poll time?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 09:59:32 GMT):<br/>
I think messages crossed - the `Web3j.build` which takes three arguments will let you set poll time.
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 10:00:14 GMT):<br/>
Got it, i will try.

After reading web3j code, I found the solution that we need to load the contract with the custom transaction manager ``` final TransactionManager txManager = new RawTransactionManager(this.web3j,
                this.credentials, -1L, 10, 1000L);```

Reminder that the bi-weekly Besu Contributor call is going to be held in 10 minutes: https://consensys.zoom.us/j/725448960
Agenda can be found here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/2019-11-26+Besu+Contributor+Call
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 20:47:28 GMT):<br/>
Besu does not store or propogate transactions that cannot be immediatly committed.  I can't say for sure what other clients do in this regard as I haven't become familiar with those sections of code.  It is concievable that the tx would stay in the mem pool until some other tx funds it, but our miner logic does not support that currently.  This may be worth posting a jira issue to jira.hyperledger.org so we don't forget about it but I cannot promise any timely delivery of a change.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 20:59:11 GMT):<br/>
I suspect our implementation of `eth_call` is just being too strict here.  It is very accurately saying what would happen if you submitted that as a transaction but since it's intended as a simulation is probably should skip the balance checks and jump straight into EVM execution.

Raising a ticket would be very useful so we can ensure we're compatible with other clients.
</p>
<p><strong>helderjnpinto</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 10:49:15 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I think `eth_call` and maybe `eth_estimategas` probably do not need balance verification, beacause is simulation mode "read operation".

Is there a planned release date for the next point release?
1.3.5 contained ETC Atlantis support, so works on ETC mainline.
But this next point release would also include ETC Agharta support.

Targeting 15 Jan 2020.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 01 Dec 2019 15:13:12 GMT):<br/>
Like all other ethereum mainnet clients you will need a SSD with 250-500GB free.
To do this directly on windows:
* Download Java 11 or later
* add it to your PATH
* Download the latest version of the besu zip (1.3.5) from here - https://bintray.com/beta/#/hyperledger-org/besu-repo/besu?tab=files
* Extract the zip to your SSD 
* inside the extracted directory run `bin/besu --sync-mode=FAST`
* Downloading all 400 million state nodes will take a couple of days, and then you will be synced to the current block of the blockchain.
It may be easier to run it in docker.

Wherever in the `database` directory of wherever '--data-path' points to, which defaults to the directory you extracted toe tar.gz to.  If you run `--help` the default locaiton of `--data-path` will be listed.  It is likely easiest to just point `--data-path` to wherever your ECS mount is.

hi.
I created private network with besu by using IBFT 2.0.
when i use ibft 2.0, should i set 4 nodes?
now our private network includes only 3 nodes.

my client required us to use only 3 nodes.
</p>

Yes,

<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Tue, 03 Dec 2019 10:06:50 GMT):<br/>
This is a requirement on behalf of the actual _consensus mechanism_.

<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Tue, 03 Dec 2019 10:07:12 GMT):<br/>
The network won't be able to produce finality without 4+ nodes.

Just to clarify, the network can reach consensus with even 1 node, but can not handle any faulty or malicious nodes unless there are at least 4 validators (at which point one node can be faulty without breaking the network).

Hello,  I have a doubt, where are the events emited, by the private smart contracts, stored?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 20:07:09 GMT):<br/>
Events emitted from private contracts generate logs that can be retrieved from the private transaction receipt that originated the event. You can get the receipt of a private tx using priv_getTransactionReceipt method (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#priv_gettransactionreceipt)

hi. 
i have a quesion.
now I'm trying to create private network with three nodes.
but I cannot.

i think enode url's id is not correct.

i thouht enode url is like this.
enode://<id>@<host:port>
id is public key  excluding the initial 0x.

my bootnode's  public key is 0x0ac3d4e8b81a5650cd61fcd62bb27bc2d34a6fe8141de51be35731dd0dba289bcfc623f5a236365e825e61eeb5700fe2997472c5821c6582c9c230c031871661.
so i started other node with this command , --bootnodes=enode://0ac3d4e8b81a5650cd61fcd62bb27bc2d34a6fe8141de51be35731dd0dba289bcfc623f5a236365e825e61eeb5700fe2997472c5821c6582c9c230c031871661

Hi! Have you set the p2p-host and p2p-port properties? These are the properties that you can use to specify your externally reachable address and port.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 04:26:46 GMT):<br/>
Try setting p2p-host to your public IP address and p2p-port to the port that is open (default is 30303)
</p>
<p><strong>syuta-sugawara</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 04:27:07 GMT):<br/>

Dear Besu folks, I’m just started to research/explore this system.
Might I ask some noob questions that mostly based on the architecture of the other dlt systems I know.

1. Do “Orion-based” transactions are off-chain or on-chain… or can be both?
2. Is there any best-practice guidelines of implementing “oracles” with Besu?
3. As I correctly understood, it is recommended (by the philosophy of IBFT2.0) to force client (apps) to send Tx to several nodes?

Thanks

1. Orion based TX are off-chain but have markers added to the public chain. 
2. Not that I know of, lets see if anyone else wants to pitch in with more info on that. But Oracles and clients are very different beasts
3. the client will take care of propagation for you. can you link to what you mean by that philosophy?
</p>
<p><strong>kamposter</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 17:11:50 GMT):<br/>
1. Would be super if you can add some details about this process.
3. Based on Besu IBFT2.0 white paper, look 1.2 (page 2 - our contribution). So, I made assumption that Besu going to recommend to sent TX proposals to several nodes simultaneously. (like in Fabric).

The paper analyses the IBFT2 protocol without making any assumption on how the network layer is implemented. We just assume that there is a point in time after which the transmission latency is bounded.
This is is to make the protocol as generic as possible and not dependent on a specific implementation.

However, Beau as all (or most) Ethereum clients, implements the network layer via gossiping in which case if you send your tx to an honest nodes, then this node will propagate the transaction to all other nodes.

Having said this, a very strong adversary may be able to mount an eclipse attack on an honest node, so sending the tx to more than one node increases the possibility that the transaction will be  eventually received by all honest nodes.

In conclusion, in most scenario sending a tx to only one node (if you know that that node is honest) will suffice, but if you are in an environment with high risk of attack I would suggest sending the tx to more than one  node. This applies not only to IBFT2, but to all protocols running on top of a gossiping protocol.

Hi, I've setup a 4 node ibft network using docker on one machine. The network is working but sometimes some of the nodes restarts. How can i see the log of the node in the container?
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:45:06 GMT):<br/>
Does besu write the logs to a file?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:51:00 GMT):<br/>
You can use `docker logs <container-id>` to view the logs.  For example `docker logs 0f80af3ea54f`
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:51:31 GMT):<br/>
I can only see the latest log, how can i see the logs when the node stopped?

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:52:19 GMT):<br/>
If the whole docker container stopped then you'd need to use `docker container ls -a` to find the stopped container ID and the `docker logs`
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:54:03 GMT):<br/>
I ran the container using --restart=always. 
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:54:58 GMT):<br/>
hmm, that's beyond my docker expertise I'm afraid.
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:55:48 GMT):<br/>
the container will restart when it stops.  How can i configure the node to write the log to a file?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:56:39 GMT):<br/>
Besu always outputs logs to stdout and you can then redirect that however you need.  I'm very surprised that docker loses the logs when it restarts a container.
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:59:40 GMT):<br/>
the log is not lost. I can only find one warning message:
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:59:47 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:00:33 GMT):<br/>
There are no logs for ERROR.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:01:45 GMT):<br/>
`docker ps -a` gives you all the containers that ran (including stopped/failed etc)
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:02:04 GMT):<br/>
you can then do `docker logs <container_id>`
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:02:31 GMT):<br/>
That warning suggests that either besu was under heavy load (probably lots of JSON-RPC requests) or potentially that it was running low on memory which was significantly impacting performance.

If it was tight on memory it may have been suddenly killed by the system out of memory killer - you'd have to check it's logs (whereever your OS puts them) to determine if that's what happened or not.

The lack of any logs does sound a lot like something external very abruptly killed Besu or the container.

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:03:16 GMT):<br/>
`docker ps -a` gives you all the containers that ran (including stopped/failed etc)

</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:03:16 GMT):<br/>
`docker ps -a` gives you all the containers that ran (including stopped/failed etc) and you get an indication of when it ran & stopped via the timestamps
you can then do `docker logs <container_id>`
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:04:09 GMT):<br/>
you can alternatively mount a volume and a log file and write to your local file system like so: https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-quickstart/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L13
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:05:28 GMT):<br/>
specify an appender and pass that in to besu, and then mount a volume to that path (line18) and you should see log files that persist
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:05:47 GMT):<br/>
I will try that

@NicolasMassart You mentioned something of this sort recently.  Does this problem ring a bell?
@RealDeanZhao what are your hardware specs on that machine?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 21:19:48 GMT):<br/>
Yes we had something similar and it was related to a log query that was too huge and making the system fail badly. @shemnon worked on a PR to fix that by having a distinct indexing of logs, that should be shipped in next release. @RealDeanZhao what tools do you have that make queries on your node? We experienced the issue with Eventeum specifically as the chain was big enough for the initial log retrieval to lock the system. But any other tool could behave like that as the issue is that during first start it requested logs for the whole database. So if it's only a few hundred thousand blocs it's ok, but as it get over multiple millions, it started to be hard to keep up with the requests. Now with the log index it should be fine.

Hello, I've a question around the statement:
"Caution
If a receiving Orion is available when the private transaction is distributed but is unavailable when the privacy marker transaction is processed, the private transaction is not executed by the receiving Besu node. The private states in the Besu nodes are then inconsistent."
coming from the documentation : https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Overview/
In Quorum, the private transaction is not distributed if the node recipient is not avialable, and I'm wondering why BESU is not doing the same ?
</p>

<p><strong>adrien_del</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 14:59:08 GMT):<br/>
seems to contradict the above statement as well ?

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 15:04:54 GMT):<br/>
@madelinemurray ?
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:22:39 GMT):<br/>
There's a period of time between when the transaction is submitted and when it is processed. Say Alice submits a private transaction with Bob and Charlie as recipients. If they are all online the marker transaction will end up on chain. When Bobs besu node sees that marker transaction, some time later, he will need to go and fetch the private payload for that transaction from Orion. If Orion is down at that point in time Bobs besu node will think it doesn't have access to it and will not process it. Consequently it will not update it's local private world state for that privacy group.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:23:12 GMT):<br/>
We're looking at changing it so that Bobs besu node will stop processing transactions if the enclave is down.
</p>
<p><strong>adrien_del</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:37:28 GMT):<br/>
ok I understand, so this is in the roadmap of BESU? do we have an ETA ?
</p>
<p><strong>adrien_del</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:37:48 GMT):<br/>
because for now, if I want my private states to stay synchronized, I better use Quorum? 
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:38:22 GMT):<br/>
it's the same problem in Quorum 
</p>
<p><strong>adrien_del</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:38:42 GMT):<br/>
ah ok, I didn't know 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:39:08 GMT):<br/>
I think they handle it better, but if the enclave is down you have problems
</p>
<p><strong>adrien_del</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:41:41 GMT):<br/>
but in reality, it shouldn't be complicated to say that when the enclave is back up again, you execute the private transaction that is anchored on chain (the famous merker) 
</p>
<p><strong>adrien_del</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:42:11 GMT):<br/>
so the node can't really lie and say he didn't receive it 
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:43:04 GMT):<br/>
it's this guy https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/ethereum/core/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/ethereum/mainnet/precompiles/privacy/PrivacyPrecompiledContract.java#L96
</p>
<p><strong>adrien_del</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:43:07 GMT):<br/>
as long as the enclave is not back up again, you don't trust this node

we need to only catch things like 4xx from the enclave

I was following ethernodes.org to check Istanbul network synchronisation. I saw Besu on the list trying to sync, but I can't find it anymore on the list. Does anybody know why it was removed? Any compatibility issue with Istanbul reported? Thanks!

Hi @juancc , this was due to the 1.3.7 consensus issue fix released we released on Friday (https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases). 
We'll publish more information on this in some hours.

Hello!! I have a pantheon node with 1.1.1 in a private network running quite a lot, is it safe to upgrade to latest?
</p>
<p><strong>MatiasGallardo</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 12:44:17 GMT):<br/>
how would you recommend to do the upgrade?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 19:06:30 GMT):<br/>
Yes it's safe and recommended. Stop your node, make a backup of the database forlder, the node key and the genesis file. Update to Besu latest version (currently 1.3.7) and run your node again.
Depending on the command line parameters you used, some options may have changed.
Can you paste your command line here for me to tell you if you have to change anything?

yes it looks safe, nothing in conflict with the new version for what I can see. But of course, make a test on a non critical node prior to updating all your network.

Hi all, using BESU permissioning:  Can I limit a subset of addresses to be the only ones able to deploy smart contracts? Thx!
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 20 Dec 2019 10:08:50 GMT):<br/>
Not for the moment. The onchain permission rules are about an account being able to send a tx or not. It would require a finer grained system that can handle regular tx and smart contract creation tx. You can have a look at https://github.com/PegaSysEng/permissioning-smart-contracts/ for more details on what the permissions smart contracts do.

Hi, I have a question regarding the besu-quickstart. There are two docker-compose files: one for a PoA network, and one for a privacy PoW network. I tried playing with the --genesis-file flag and the volumes. I get to the point where the chain is up but the nodes are not producing blocks. My question is: Is it possible to get a PoA (clique or ibft2) working with privacy enabled? Thanks!

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 22 Dec 2019 19:44:17 GMT):<br/>
CLI flag `--target-gas-limit=` and it will require a node restart on each node you apply it to in the validator set.

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 22 Dec 2019 21:30:11 GMT):<br/>
Hello @marlow Privacy for PoA works in much the same manner. I'd recommend taking the existing poa compose file and making sure it you can get blocks being created, then add the orion nodes to it (tie them to three besu nodes of your choice) with 
      ```       "--privacy-enabled=true",
      "--privacy-url=http://orion1:8888",
      "--privacy-public-key-file=/config/orion/orion.pub"] ```

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 22 Dec 2019 21:31:00 GMT):<br/>
And mount one extra volume to each of those containers with: ```       - ./config/orion/networkFiles/orion1/nodeKey.pub:/config/orion/orion.pub```

Hi, im facing a problem when creating my own besu private network using the besu docker image
Its runs perfectly but It get stuck trying to connect to more nodes and do not start creating blocks (idk why)
any idea? I am sure the extradata field of genesis is right, derived from only one account, which is accesible for the node. I am using IBT btw

</p>
<p><strong>mikiasda</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 09:23:06 GMT):<br/>
Suspicious thing: my node address is 0xcc... and the eth.coinbase points to 0xfff could be this right? Or the eth.coinbase should be equal to the validator account?

Hi @b1001 , Keep in mind that this is the Hyperledger Besu chat and not a Pegasys chat, even though there are several Pegasys members (including me) that spend time on here.
Having said that, Besu's scalability benefits  really depend on what solution we're talking about. For example, Besu tooling makes it scalable regarding deployment (with integrated tools for this), monitoring (like graphana and prometheus), and infrastructure (ie multi-tenancy).

Correct. It's a full Ethereum client. We do, however, have some very interesting R&D projects having to do with sidechains ATM.

<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Mon, 23 Dec 2019 09:48:00 GMT):<br/>
I don't think there is a recommended generic setting. I've seen networks as low as 2 seconds that work just fine.

Thanks for the response @joshuafernandes ! I started with the poa compose file and just included the orion nodes in the file. At this point the chain is producing blocks. But when I add the volume and edit the nodes to enable privacy then it stops producing blocks.

Hello, i am looking for more details on https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-52
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Tue, 24 Dec 2019 07:19:41 GMT):<br/>
how to sign the transaciton with EthereumJS for the ibft network?
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Tue, 24 Dec 2019 07:20:03 GMT):<br/>
The transaction signature generated by EthereumJS is different with web3js.
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Tue, 24 Dec 2019 07:33:50 GMT):<br/>
I find the solution, I need to specify the ethereumjs-common options for the transaction: `const customCommon = Common.forCustomChain(
  "mainnet",
  {
    chainId: 6174
  },
  "istanbul"
);
 `
</p>
<p><strong>mikiasda</strong> (Tue, 24 Dec 2019 09:13:14 GMT):<br/>
it does not work the sign method from web3?
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Tue, 24 Dec 2019 09:13:59 GMT):<br/>
web3js works because web3js will automatically help get the chain id from the network.
</p>
<p><strong>mikiasda</strong> (Tue, 24 Dec 2019 09:15:04 GMT):<br/>
I am running the network using docker-compose. A question, the coinbase accounts should be equal to the validator account? 
</p>
<p><strong>mikiasda</strong> (Tue, 24 Dec 2019 09:15:13 GMT):<br/>
oh, nice
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Tue, 24 Dec 2019 09:16:26 GMT):<br/>
That's great information, we might consider adding it to the documentation.

</p>
<p><strong>mikiasda</strong> (Tue, 24 Dec 2019 18:43:39 GMT):<br/>
The latter was the problem. Both should be equal. If not there is a problem with the nodekey... Could be a great idea to add tip on the doc about this. "If you want to validate if everything is correct, you should check both validator address and eth.coinbase are equal"

Hi, I want to know when I use this configuration(--bootnodes=enode://<publicKeyBootnode1>@<ipBootnode1>:30303,<publicKeyBootnode2>@<ipBootnode2>:30303) how synchronization is done with the other nodes (which bootnodes will be supported) and when I use web3.js how can I connect to one of the providers (if one bootnodes is faulty).

Hi @Radhi , bootndes will help you discover other peers. Once they are discovered and added to the peer discovery table, they will persist (so long as no restarts happen). Synchronisation is then done by all nodes in the network, not only bootnodes. 
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 26 Dec 2019 08:42:56 GMT):<br/>
If one bootnode is faulty, you will still have the fallback for _peer discovery_. However, AFAIK, the web3js provider will depend on it being accesible.

@mikiasda I have tried the tutorial with the latest version of Besu (1.3.8) and the snapshot version of Orion (1.5.0-SNAPSHOT) and everything seems to be working fine. Maybe you missed something when following the tutorial? I have uploaded my setup here so you can take a look! I hope it helps!

@adityasingh177 - sorry about the delay in reply.  Did you see the additional comments from Tim on https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-52? 

Basically the API method does the same thing as the `--target-gas-limit` option but you can change the target gas limit while Besu is running using the API method.  The CLI option doc is here: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#target-gas-limit 

This is similar to the relationship between the `--logging`CLI option and `admin_changeLogLevel` API method. 

https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#logging
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#admin_changeloglevel

Does that give you enough information or do you have something more specific you wanted to know? 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 21:42:11 GMT):<br/>
@adityasingh177 - this doc describes how privacy works in Besu:

Hello. Does besu have a config option to contribute to EthStats.net directly or do I need to also figure out the Alethio app? I can't tell from the documentation if that's required just to contribute to the main site.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 01 Jan 2020 02:53:39 GMT):<br/>
For ethstats net we use the standard script form https://github.com/cubedro/eth-net-intelligence-api.  

For ethstats.io we use the ethestats cli (https://github.com/Alethio/ethstats-cli) and it looks to be a fairly simple setup just get this running via your favorite method - 
```
node \
    ethstats-cli/bin/ethstats-cli.js \
    --net "mainnet" \
    --register \
        --node-name "<node name>" \
        --account-email "<account email>"
```

Hi! I'm looking for any documentation (or perhaps someone here can answer my questions) regarding timestamps in Besu + IBFT2.
As far as I can tell, IBFT2 doesn't make any modifications to how timestamps are checked compared to the mainnet consensus algo, is this true?
If that is the case, then do the usual "pool.ntp.org +/- 10s" rule get checked?  In the case of a IBFT2 network, what do validators reject a block proposed block that doesn't adhere to this rule? Thanks!

If the error you are getting is the one cited by @marlow, then you have to first sign the transaction with Ethsigner or another signing software.

  Yea, there are actually two jars with rocksdb in the name, we had to rename them because of maven collisions so instead of picking one to just be rocksdb we did it to both.  There are a couple of others that this happend to as well irrc.

@ShaileshGhanekar Hmm, haven't seen that one before. I can point you to the `eth_call` docs https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#eth_call where the `Missing "to" field in call arguments` is probably  coming from. Don't know if it is of use for you, otherwise someone else from the Besu team can help you better than I can!

Hi @coenie . I got the following answer from the team: 

> IBFT2 has an allowable clock drift of 1 second, so if a block is proposed 1+ seconds ahead than your node system clock, it will reject it.

<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 08 Jan 2020 13:19:02 GMT):<br/>
> To my knowledge it's not possible, however using the usual Ether/gas mechanism and having a contract that can mint tokens if you send it some Ether and send you Ether if you send it tokens might do the trick depending on the need.

Thanks for that! Do you know if this this documented anywhere?

Some more questions about this, what happens if the validator nodes' system clocks are more than 1s apart? What happens if a validator node sets their system clock to 1h in the future and then submit a block with a timestamp 1h in the future? Do the other validators reject that block?

You can do this right now on any evm based blockchain including mainnnet ethereum.

The gist of it is segregating the transactions from the broadcast and having some tokens paid for the gas they consume in tokens.

The standard is not approved just yet but openzeppeling has a popular implementation for the solidity side:
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/741/commits/67ca9e7a4249184e642ac097b41be08a958fd302

And 


</p>
<p><strong>E.alcazar</strong> (Wed, 08 Jan 2020 16:27:45 GMT):<br/>
Here you have another example implementation which works in the same way but doesn´t require your users to use gas at all
https://gsn.openzeppelin.com/

Also, if you still want to keep track of a token for your users, if you are running a private POA network the easiest solution would be to rename ether to whatever name you want and force a control of the emission and fees

Hello everyone, I have an IBFT2 network with onchain permissioning,  the network works well if the bootnode is also a validator. BUT if I restart the network  and all validator points to a boonode that is not a validator then the network never starts validating blocks. I wonder if it is the designed behaviour or there is something else I am missing? . Please help me clarify this. Thanks.

Hi @eum602 , how many nodes you have in your network? Keep in mind that if you use your bootnode as validator it's added in the consensus and if you don't reach majority then it'll stop creating blocks. For example: 2 validator + 1 bootnode/validator = 3 validators. If you remove the bootnode, then the other 2 don't reach majority and it gets stuck. I hope that helps! :thumbsup:

<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 08 Jan 2020 17:14:27 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 08 Jan 2020 17:17:52 GMT):<br/>
I think that the problem is not related with the number of validators in the network, because this behavior only appears when I have onchain on my nodes.

Good morning/afternoon/evening all, my team and I are working on a proof of concept on besu, where we are doing transfering of assets between contracts in different privacy groups. 
Now we want to be able to search through the past events on a private contract, like you can in normal Web3. I know you can get the events from the private transaction receipt that originated the event. But is there a way of getting all the past events from a private contract and filter through them, like https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-eth.html#getpastlogs ?

Hello everyone! I found a bug in the user nonce calculation, it can get transactions stuck in Besu and not in Geth or Parity.
I have several tests, and a tool to reproduce the bug, how should I proceed?
</p>
<p><strong>E.alcazar</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 14:35:11 GMT):<br/>
Also, question about the sync process.
1. I´m trying to sync the mainnet, and I´m topping up 16gb of memory, is memory the bottleneck? it´s around 10 times slower than Geth´s full sync
2. About Besu´s fast sync mode, how does it work? is it like Geth´s fast sync, Parity´s wrap sync, a light node sync? or something else?
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 14:43:47 GMT):<br/>
Please raise an issue on the Jira board: jira.hyperledger.org/projects/BESU/issues
Although, FYI, nonce calculation on Besu is done differently than on Geth or Parity.
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 14:47:39 GMT):<br/>
1 is definitely related to 2. Geth uses fast-sync by default whereas Besu doens't. So it shouldn't be 10 times slower with the same flags, I recommend using that flag.

Besu's fast sync is similar to geth's where the chain state is downloaded and then process and verify it. 
</p>
<p><strong>E.alcazar</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 14:52:03 GMT):<br/>
So the result of running Besu with fast flag is still a full node with all history info cool!
I didn´t test fast sync Besu vs fast sync Geth.
But in full sync Besu vs full sync Geth, Besu is around 10 times slower bottlenecked by memory (16gb) where as Geth is bottlenecked by CPU

My experiences profiling the sync is that 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 15:08:58 GMT):<br/>
My experience in profiling the sync is that the native database is the bottleneck for Besu.  The most CPU time is locked up in there, single threaded.  Besu does grow to full memory size to accomidate the DB cached but even in higher memory systems the DB is the biggest limiter.

<p><strong>E.alcazar</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 15:59:21 GMT):<br/>
In full sync limit is the DB as well? I understand why this would be the case in fast sync due to the state discovery process. Disk usage is at around 20%, maybe I´m reading the disk usage wrong.
Then adding more memory/swap shouldn´t increase sync speed too much right?
Thanks!!

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 16:02:24 GMT):<br/>
RocksDB has lower performance writing large data as opposed to the go based leveldb impl geth has.  There was some specific tweaking in leveldb-go to address this in Geth's most recent update.

Do I have to enable permissioning for all the nodes or doing it just for validators is enough?....please share your thoughts.

It depends on what behaviour you want to happen on the network. If you want to ensure all those nodes communicate only with each other and not anyone else, you will need to setup permissioning on each of them.

If your nodes are gonna share the same set of permissions, I'd recommend using onchain permissioning.

Hey @eum602 . To clarify, the validators are not peering with the bootnode? If you look up the peers of the bootnode, do you see any that are connected to it?

Looking at your configuration, the add_nodes_to_whitelist.sh only adds 4 nodes, are these the 4 validators? How are you adding the bootnode to the whitelist? Also noticed in add_node_as_peer.sh that node3 is not peering with node4

Hello @arash009. Let me answer your questions:
1. The validators peers with the bootnode, so at the end I can see that the bootnode has connection with the four validators (Node-1,Node-2,Node-3 and Node-4). Neverthless each validator only peers with the bootnode.

2. I am not using add_nodes_to_whitelist.sh script. I am only using permissioning through the smart contracts.

3. The bootnode is added to the permissioning through the Dapp (where I have the four validators and the bootnode).

4. add_node_as_peer.sh. I am not using this script.

Finally, what I would like to know is if you have tested that communication in onchain permissioning is possible through a Bootnode that is not a validator. 

I have tested that when a bootnode is also a validator then all works well.
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 02:00:32 GMT):<br/>
I see, so the validators are peered with the bootnode but not with each other, is that right? We have specific rules in the permissioning logic that allows nodes still to connect to the bootnode if they are not in sync to recieve the latest chain data, so there might be something in there... But we had definately previously tested onchain permissioning in an IBFT2.0 network without any issues
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 02:01:25 GMT):<br/>
Let us try and replicate the issue
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 02:37:24 GMT):<br/>
so the validators are peered with the bootnode but not with each other, is that right?  ==> yes.

Thanks a lot @arash009 
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Fri, 10 Jan 2020 03:21:40 GMT):<br/>
We think we have an idea of whats going on in the setup, let me try and explain:
If you are starting your network fresh with the bootnode NOT being a validator, and only nodes 1-4 as validators, we have specific rules that allows nodes to talk to bootnodes as they are not aware of the permissioning rules. When you then try to add a node to the whitelist contracts, those blocks must be mined through the 2/3 of the validators accepting the blocks, because those validators arent on the whitelist, they cant talk to each other and therefore the whitelist never updated. So there are two ways around this that I can think of:
1. Start the network with permissioning disabled, but the contracts still deployed. Add the nodes 1-4 to the whitelist (with permissioning disabled they will peer and validate the blocks). Then bring down all the nodes, turn permissioning on, and bring them back on.
2. Start the network with permissioning on, with the Bootnode ALSO as a validator. Update the whitelist to include all the nodes, then use the IBFT remove validator APIs to remove the bootnode.

That message is returned when you are not syncing which can mean that either you haven´t started, you have stopped or you are done.

Try getBlock, if you see something else than 0x0 you are probably done syncing

Try getPeers, if you don´t see any you probably have connectivity issues and haven´t started

If you think the syncing has stopped half way through share the logs so we can take a look!

Thanks to replying, I use this command "besu  --data-path=/home/dev/Documents/besu-rinkeby/data  --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=ETH,NET,EEA,ADMIN".
I want to get my balance when the sycing fisihed. I was deploy contract and send private transation with test account on chainId 2018, now i want to use my account in rinkeby.
@E.alcazar  I tried getBlock and i got 0x0. With getPeers i got 0x0. I just start 1 node but when i start my privacy network with other node connected with my bootnode i can see the number of nodes conected.

You are not getting any peers.  You are listening on 127.0.0.1.  Are you in docker?  If so set `--p2p-host` to the external IP address and `--p2p-interface=0.0.0.0`, if not in a container set `--p2p-host=0.0.0.0` or the actual IP of your machine.

Based on your hostname I gather you are running inside of VirtualBox.  Running in VirtualBox is not something we typically expect.  

Networking appears to be the issue and there are many ways to do it in VirtualBox that I am not conversant in.

`--p2p-host` should be the IP address that external clients can send inbound messages to your VirtualBox instance.  in this case set `--p2p-interface=0.0.0.0` as well.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 20:17:52 GMT):<br/>
A good way to debug permissioning is enabling TRACE log level for `org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.permissioning`. If the nodes aren't connecting due to permissioning, you should see some messages about it in the logs.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 20:19:32 GMT):<br/>
Also, it might be worth double checking that the enode URL of each node matches the permissioning rules stored in the contracts (nodeID, IP, port).
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:33:48 GMT):<br/>
Hello Lucas, I have checked that the bootnode works without permissioning(allowing communication between validators) ==> the configuration is ok. Also checked that the bootnode is in the smart contract.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:35:15 GMT):<br/>
I think you can simply reproduce this by using the example in the besu docs but adding a new node (not validator) as a bootnode. 
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:38:22 GMT):<br/>
Have you tried the trace logs to check the permissioning rule that is blocking the node connection?
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:40:50 GMT):<br/>
yes, bootnode shares other validators enode to some validator but for some reason those are rejected.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:41:06 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:42:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm asking about the log trace messages. It would be helpful if you could share the logs showing the permissioning rules rejecting the connection.

You can enable TRACE log level for org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.permissioning (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Monitor/Logging/#advanced-custom-logging)
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:44:45 GMT):<br/>
I simply used this, when starting the node: --logging=ALL
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:45:11 GMT):<br/>
That works. But it will generate too much logging that is not related to the problem.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:45:20 GMT):<br/>
Anyway, can you share the log?
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:45:37 GMT):<br/>
ok, I will
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:45:40 GMT):<br/>

*How to Monitor Performance for Multiple Nodes?*
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 05:35:46 GMT):<br/>
I am using Hyperledger Besu for my research. I was able to start a network of around 10 nodes on a single computer. I am running some application on the network.

I was interested to measure the performance of the network using different metrics such as:

Transaction latency
Transaction Throughtput
Disk, memory and CPU usage
What is the best way to do that?
Is there a tool to do that? 
If not, is it possible to insert my own code inside Besu project to monitor these metrics? If yes, where exactly?
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 06:54:42 GMT):<br/>
@atoulme I had a quick look at where the warnings were coming from and they seemed to be related to packages which Besu was dependent on, so this is probably something I would have to chase all the way up the chain.

It reminds me of warnings-as-errors discipline which I was trying to get going on the FIFA team at EA.   That was not helped at all by the fact that the system headers which Microsoft were shipping themselves did not compile with -W4 or -Wall.

Might be the case here, eh?   That the "broken windows" of ignoring Gradle warnings (because there are always noisy gradle warnings) means everybody always ignores gradle warnings.

Hi, Is there a recommended way to deploy a privacy enabled private network with 5 nodes? I'm currently running into stability issues with the orion nodes. Currently I try to host the besu-quickstart in a Digital Ocean droplet. It is running fine for like 6-7 hours. After that time i'm getting back errors from the orion nodes: `{“jsonrpc”:“2.0",“id”:1,“error”:{“code”:-50100,“message”:“Error communicating with enclave”}}` and `NODE_PUSHING_TO_PEER`

The recommended deployment for production is running each service in its own instance. Here you can find the system requirements for Besu: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/System-Requirements/

@lucassaldanha Using a Ubuntu 18.04, 6vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 320GB Disk dropplet on Digital Ocean. Saw that it was recommended to deploy each service seperate. My current setup isn't as it is running all nodes (besu-quickstart with 5 nodes) on the same dropplet(instance). Which probably can be the reason for the stability issues I guess.
</p>
<p><strong>marlow</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 20:15:06 GMT):<br/>
Guess a switch to kubernetes will be a better option, as it will deploy seperate services. I could try to use something like Kompose to generate k8s files from the `./docker-compose_privacy` and try to make a privacy enabled config for kubernetes?

<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 00:58:36 GMT):<br/>
@faraggi Also i found caliper a bit inflexible. It doesn't even allow you to run different transactions depending on your application.  I was wondering if i can add some code inside Besu project itself. I believe that is more flexible than using caliper. I am already running Besu source code on Intellij. But i couldn't easily figure out where i should insert my code. Can you help on that? Just a hint

 I am proposing to the Capital Markets SIG (CMSIG) to workshop a simple Token using TTF (Token Taxonomy Framework) towards implementation in Besu.

The CMSIG  is the ideal venue for this, since we have a mix of participants, both business and technical (including attorneys, traders, developers.)-we may be able to attract more since we are completely open. The actual effort can be housed in Hyperledger labs.

Would be good to know whether there are any comparable initiatives out there.
We can rapidly bootstrap a basic token definition and make plans for a BESU implementation.

<p><strong>hmijail</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 23:40:58 GMT):<br/>
@Jemal , if you say what kind of code you want to add or are looking for we can try guiding you. Unfortunately there is no real documentation about the architecture of Besu, but there are a few talks recorded about it which might be a good starting point: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2iGGbbKzS2hYwcZ9xBS-6A/videos 

</p>
<p><strong>hmijail</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 23:48:45 GMT):<br/>
Also, regarding running 10 nodes on a single computer: there is a facility to run Besu as a thread, which should help you with the overhead of the JVMs. The acceptance tests use this by setting  the system property acctests.runBesuAsProcess
</p>
<p><strong>hmijail</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 23:50:01 GMT):<br/>
though I hope you are careful about any measurements taken in such environment, threaded or not :)
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:06:15 GMT):<br/>
Hi hmijal. 
Thank you very much. That was an important info. Can you explain more about "acctests.runBesuAsProcess"?
The code i wanted to add is:
1. *For transaction latency*: I want to track the total time it takes for a transaction from the time it is submitted to the network by a client until it is commited to the Blockchain. I want to calculate the average latency for the network at different load.
2. *For throughtput:* i want to monitor the number of transactions commited to the network per second
3. Third, i want to measure the average resource consumption (Memory, Cpu, or Disk) by nodes
</p>
<p><strong>hmijail</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:22:01 GMT):<br/>
Are you sure you could trust latency or throughput measurements taken for 10 nodes in a single computer?
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:24:35 GMT):<br/>
Why did you ask that? Are you afraid that the latency will be low compared to the real network latency?
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:26:10 GMT):<br/>
because of low propagation time
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:26:10 GMT):<br/>
i mean because of fast propagation time
</p>
<p><strong>hmijail</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:26:42 GMT):<br/>
I would guess that your measurements will be skewed/dominated by the multitasking capabilities of your OS... 
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:27:26 GMT):<br/>
I see
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:30:46 GMT):<br/>
I got it. Thanks. Currently, I this is the only resource i have. So what do you suggest me? If not to avoid at least to reduce the effect?
</p>
<p><strong>hmijail</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:33:06 GMT):<br/>
use as few nodes as possible. Ensure that there are more CPUs than nodes, and that virtual memory is not used. If you wanted to be as realistic as possible, inject some delay in the network connections with some network capability in your OS.

<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:43:58 GMT):<br/>
One last question: How can i inject some delay in the network connections ? Do you mean adding some delay in Besu nodes communication? 
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:43:58 GMT):<br/>
@hmijail Thank you very much. I will check it. I am glad that there are people like you out there who are dedicated to help other people
</p>
<p><strong>hmijail</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:57:17 GMT):<br/>
I would do it at the OS level, so it depends on your OS... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/130354/how-do-i-simulate-a-low-bandwidth-high-latency-environment
</p>
<p><strong>hmijail</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 01:03:08 GMT):<br/>
(and while we're talking about this: when checking the CPU vs node numbers, ensure that the nodes run on full cores, not "hardware thread" ones (HyperThreading, etc))

Hi guys.  It's a question about the Besu 1.4 version.  Do you know anything about Advanced key managemet?  I want to know what features they provide and how they differ from EthSigner.
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 02:59:46 GMT):<br/>
Hi @jinnyeon This around additional capabilities that we are building into Ethsigner. Ethsigner now supports the ability to have multiple keys used both locally as well as with external vaults and signers. We are also building in TLS capabilities for more security which will be included with the 1.4 release.
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 03:22:27 GMT):<br/>
You may also want to use some of our metrics APIs to plug into Prometheus and Graphana for visuals. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Monitor/Metrics/
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 03:26:48 GMT):<br/>
@arash009 Thanks. Does Prometheus support monitoring things like transaction accepted time or commited time?
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 03:33:16 GMT):<br/>
No, unfortunately not. Its more around the hardware performance (CPU, Disk usage), but also chain syncronization and block production, but not tx throughput
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 03:36:18 GMT):<br/>
I see. So I am running 10 nodes on one PC. If i use Prometheus to monitor CPU, Disk usage).., does it give me the result for each node separately or just the average for all nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>jinnyeon</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 04:32:54 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the reply.
In addition to the question, EthSigner seems to have an advantage in keeping keys secure. However, when recovering after losing a key, Ripple uses a regular key pair and Bitcoin's Hierarchical Deterministic Key. Is there a similar function in Besu?
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 08:34:16 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 23:09:15 GMT):<br/>
You should get the results of each individual node as each node will produce its own metrics. If you want it averaged you have to collate all of that data and average them seperately.

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 23:23:29 GMT):<br/>
If you have one Prometheus instance pulling in the metrics from all the different besu instances, the query language it provides makes it incredibly easy to aggregate and analyse the data in many ways.  Grafana will make it even easier to create dashboards to visualise the metrics across all the instances.  We provide a Grafana dashboard as a starting point at https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10273

> Do you know if this this documented anywhere?

No, this specific behavior isn't documented.

> what happens if the validator nodes' system clocks are more than 1s apart?

There will be sync problems between the validator nodes. Whichever node is ahead will always have his blocks rejected.

> What happens if a validator node sets their system clock to 1h in the future and then submit a block with a timestamp 1h in the future? Do the other validators reject that block?

if a validator is 1h in the future, the other validators will reject any blocks it proposes - however IT will think that all blocks from the other validators are fine. Thus, we will hit a round-change every 4th block (when the future-validator is proposing)

What were you trying to do before each of the two steps?  What tools?  What commands?  We need to know what you did to cause the error not just the error.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 19 Jan 2020 06:18:40 GMT):<br/>
Is websockets enabled?  (CLI flag `--rpc-ws-enabled`)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 19 Jan 2020 06:20:46 GMT):<br/>
Were you using the CLI command `besu operator generate-blockchain-config` and was the `--to` directory empty?  The 'to' directory must be empty.
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Sun, 19 Jan 2020 13:10:36 GMT):<br/>
I'm following a document of Besu, where I'm creating a private network using IBFT 2.0 (POA) but here nodes are running perfectly. I'm following documentation through out and following the commands given in the document. I didn't enabled websockets as it is not in the command. I didn't check --to directory. When I'm trying to deploying my contract on my IBFT-Network , I get this error.

Hello,
Besu is fully compatible with public mainnet. That doesn't mean all of Besu's additional features (and other projects like Orion) work on mainnet.
The private transactions you are referring to above are not supported by public mainnet. 

However, research has been done on public private transactions using ZK proofs, and others. These are currently available but do not rely on Orion.
You can find lots of info on this on google.
</p>
<p><strong>jorikito</strong> (Mon, 20 Jan 2020 12:39:33 GMT):<br/>
Hey guys, hope you're doing well. I had a quick question; am I correct in saying that signing private transactions to the orion nodes using Metamask is not yet implemented? And how would you say is the best way to make users sign their private transactions from, say, a mobile app?

Thanks in advance
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Mon, 20 Jan 2020 12:52:57 GMT):<br/>
Can we use public accounts(like main net nodes) in our private network??
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Mon, 20 Jan 2020 12:59:54 GMT):<br/>
Can you expand on the question. I'm pretty sure you might be mixing up some terminology...

</p>
<p><strong>jorikito</strong> (Mon, 20 Jan 2020 13:05:39 GMT):<br/>
With public accounts don't you mean addresses?
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Mon, 20 Jan 2020 13:15:01 GMT):<br/>
Hi @jorikito , in order to send a transaction on to the orion network, you have to publish it with payload and other data in the data field. Metmask's current version doens't allow that. So no.
Also, orion has its own gitter channel, which you're welcome to use: https://gitter.im/PegaSysEng/orion
</p>
<p><strong>jorikito</strong> (Mon, 20 Jan 2020 13:17:42 GMT):<br/>
I see, thanks for your quick response. Thanks for the link, I didn't realize there were seperate channels!

You could sign a transaction in MM. But you would need to send the private data (in)directly to orion first (through besu).

Hi jorikito , in order to send a transaction on to the orion network, you have to publish it with payload and other data in the data field. Metmask's current *UI* version doens't allow that. 

However, you could use metamask to sign the TX, and then use the signed TX and call `eea_sendRawTransaction` to send to Orion and Besu.

I haven't done this and don't know of anyone who has, but if you succeed, please let me know! 

Also, orion has its own gitter channel, which you're welcome to use: https://gitter.im/PegaSysEng/orion
</p>
<p><strong>jorikito</strong> (Mon, 20 Jan 2020 15:10:38 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 04:21:11 GMT):<br/>
I'm using besu-1.3.8 for creating private network
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 04:22:38 GMT):<br/>
If we can't maintain privacy over mainnet then why we use Besu?? 
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:00:58 GMT):<br/>
There are plenty of use cases to use privacy on consortium or private networks. This is available to be used in our current stable release.

The support for private transactions on Mainnet is under development.

If you want to understand a bit more about private transactions, I suggest that you read our docs (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/Private-Transaction-Processing/).

About the timeout error, could you please post the error so we can take a look and try to help you?

I've raised a bug https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-181 for this issue. The workaround is what you have already done which is to make sure your bootnode is also a validator.

Sotty guys, my bad. It's clearly written in the docs

> To obtain an authentication token, make a request to the /login endpoint with your username and password. Specify the HTTP port or the WS port to obtain a token to authenticate over HTTP or WS respectively. A different token is required for HTTP and WS.

The changelog has all the details - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md - but the only breaking change would be if you had comments in your genesis.json file.  Any IDE would complain about it so the odds it hits users is low.  The fix is to remove the comments.

Mostly it's new feature adds, such as Istanbul fork support, ETC support, and some plugin APIs opened up.  All are opt in.

K8s is outside of my expertese.  But CLI wise the only changes have been additions, so I would expect current helm charts to just work.

I will update the appVersion in the chart.yaml. We currently set the values, overrides in the values.yml or as overrides in the cli based on frequency of updates eg: keys are static but versions of Besu or the like change

In the examples in the repo we use tag `develop`so that people get the newest available to test things out, I'd suggest locking that to a fixed version such as `1.3.8` and upwards if you would like to use the `1.4.0 betas`

It depends on your needs and deployment model. The quickstart uses a development network, you can either change the configuration provided to connect to an appropriate network or start from scratch. 
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 23:31:25 GMT):<br/>
Can you provide more details please? With On-chain account permissioning, you can create rules for what accounts are allowed to transact on the network. Have all the accounts been added to the whitelist? Are the nodes peered with one another?
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Wed, 29 Jan 2020 04:28:19 GMT):<br/>
Yes, all the accounts are on white list and peered with one another.

</p>
<p><strong>jorikito</strong> (Wed, 29 Jan 2020 13:50:55 GMT):<br/>
If I understand correctly, one user needs to have a besu/web3 node and an Orion node. Private transactions are sent and stored between orion nodes, targeting orion public addresses, or a privacy group generated with those addresses. You can still make a transaction between normal web3 addresses, you just have to send the transaction with the EEAClient targeting orion public keys

Hi, I need some help. I'm trying to set up privacy enabled network along with account permissioning.
According to the documentation, in this case I have to specify privacy marker transactions signing key and also add it in accounts whitelist.
But, if I understand it correctly, accounts whitelist is just the list of account addresses so how can I add signing key (private key) in there? Or am I missing something?
Thanks in advance.

That is a bit strange because the gas price is configured to be 0 (min-gas-price=0)

Hi guys, I have been digging into the logs and I came across something interesting. I gave created a Clique network and I added "gasLimit": "0x1fffffffffffff" to the genesis file. 

Now looking into the logs I founds the following lines:

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:27:43 GMT):<br/>
Intrinsic Gas Cost comes from the size of the transaction.  21,000 just for being a transaction, and 16 gas per non-zero byte in the TX (and 4 per zero byte)  This TX looks to be on the order of 16kb.

Hello everyone, I have a node that is behind a NAT, is it possible to make it work in a p2p besu network?.
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:51:03 GMT):<br/>
shouldn't that be calculated by the `eth_estimateGas`. The problem I has with some transaction is that I would add gas limit based on the result of the eth_estimateGas, but the tx would fail because of insufficient gas
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:53:15 GMT):<br/>
That can be added to the calculation for sure, post a jira at https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/BESU so we don't forget.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:54:24 GMT):<br/>
The other issue is the 63/64the rule is not factored intot he gas limit.  Any transaction that does a CALL or DELEGATECALL generally needs a higher gas limit than is actaully consumed.  It's a network-wide DOS policy.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:54:55 GMT):<br/>
One common approach I've seen in most DAPPs is to take the estimate and add 10%
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:55:41 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the explanation.
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:56:25 GMT):<br/>
with regards to the calculation; how should I to perform it? Do I need to serialize the signed transaction and then check it's size?
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:56:41 GMT):<br/>
is there a suggested way I could do that in my application?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:57:16 GMT):<br/>
Yep.  then multiply it by 16 and add 21K.  The real intrinsic TX will be lower because of zero bytes, but it likely isn't worth walking the array searching.
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:57:32 GMT):<br/>
good point
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:57:41 GMT):<br/>
cheers mate; I''' give it a go
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:59:37 GMT):<br/>
I have tried the UPNP method that is in the documentation but the node is not working, when the node only imports all the data but after that the node keeps waiting for peers.
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 16:00:31 GMT):<br/>
sorry actually what said earlier won't work; I can't serialize the tx because the gas limit is part of the tx params. I guess I need to calculate it earlier
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 16:01:03 GMT):<br/>
Try the 10% fudge, I think the all but 1/64th rule is what's getting you.
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 16:01:54 GMT):<br/>
thanks @shemnon I will try that out

Hi all, I'm trying to deploy a contract using besu and I'm getting `Transaction has been reverted by the EVM` errors.  I'm following example create_contract_raw_transaction.js from https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Develop-Dapps/Use-web3js/.  It works when I use the bytecode in the example script, however when I use other bytecode I get the error.  It seems any contract that has the calldatacopy op code is causing deployment to fail.  I've been trying with the remix ballot.sol example.  
Here is the output when trying to deploy into goerli testnet:

this part of doc badly need improvements, it's really a confusing for new ones.

do you have a firewall that could prevent the node from working?

Many potential usecase. MANY more are being invented everyday.

This isn't the best forum to ask that question. You can surely find better information on https://ethereum.org/ or other websites.

This chat if for Besu- your previous questions were perfectly in line with what we are capable of answering here.

<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Fri, 31 Jan 2020 11:21:30 GMT):<br/>

We did some tests internally, and it works so this might be coming from your end. @matkt 's question is obvs very pertinent 
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Fri, 31 Jan 2020 18:40:38 GMT):<br/>
@faraggi I don know why I cannot comment on the original thread, but related to the NAT question, let me explain the following : Basically, I have a node "n" whose outgoing traffic is through a NAT (lets say public IP "A"), on the other hand incoming traffic is been received on another IP (lets say  public IP "B" where it is listening on port 30303(tcp/udp)). 

I have noticed that the node "n" connects to other public nodes in the network in order pull blocks. Once the node has syncronized with the network the node loose ESTABLISHED connections with other nodes.

What I think is that other nodes tries to connect to node "n" by using the IP "B" in the 30303 port (since it is the IP where the node "n" established request to other nodes). But because this IP "B" is not listening on port 30303 then other nodes cannot make request to node "n".

I tried to configure p2p-host="ip A" , with that the node "n" is still able to synchronize but after that connections to other nodes are broken.

So, based on that, I would like to know if it is mandatory that IP "A" = IP "B" in order to establish  p2p connections?.
And also will it work if I make the port forwarding from the external IP to the internal where the node resides?

hey folks, just checking - is this the proper way to run ethstats with besu? https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Deploy/Lite-Network-Monitor/ is there a lighter way without running a sidecar alongside besu?
</p>

not right now. There was a reuest earlier for integrated estatas reporting but whoever requested it never opened up a jira bug.

The stuck node and datagram error may be unrelated.  Initially it smells like a peer starvation issue, and the datagram send issue feels like something the netwking stack is rejecting, maybe because of firewall?

Can you turn on the ADMIN endpoints (`--rpc-http-api=ADMIN`) and see if you ahve peers by sending a admin_peers call?  (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#admin_peers)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 03 Feb 2020 06:00:11 GMT):<br/>
you can manually add peers - here's a good list that gets updated regularly - https://gist.github.com/rfikki/a2ccdc1a31ff24884106da7b9e6a7453

Plasma should be supported, o long as its a compatible with standard protocol level ethereum, Besu should support it.

I'm facing a weird issue with authentication; I can successfully login and get the access token but I can't use for an json-rpc call. It simply says `Signature verification failed`. In the past I had a similar issue but that was due to getting an access token from the http server and trying to use it in the ws server. However this time I'm using the http server in both cases. 

```

<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 12:57:11 GMT):<br/>
Thats a long answer, privacy is not binary I/O. Its a spectrum that goes from fully public to completely private. 
So yes, there are other ways to do Privacy on Etherum.

two questions in there.

>with zero gas fee, do I have to make the users of my app to use a wallet?

'wallets' might still be used to handle transaction handling, depending on how your dapp is setup.

 
>How can I convert my dapp into app?

Not sure what you mean by this. The difference between a dapp and an app is the decentralization part. Lets loosely say that if it uses web3 tech, its a dapp.

Hi everyone , i am looking for some scaling solutions using hyperledger besu 
</p>
<p><strong>adityasingh177</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 16:41:49 GMT):<br/>
Which can be applied using besu 
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 16:58:24 GMT):<br/>
Really depends on what you're looking for. For example, if what you want is to get better TPS, you should know that private networks can go higher than what's available in mainnet.
If you want scalability in terms of deployment solutions and infrastructure on top of Besu, Orchestrate and tools like it do a great job.
If you want protocol level scaling using Besu, any of the solutions out there will work with Besu because, if its supported by the protocol, Besu can handle it.
</p>
<p><strong>adityasingh177</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 16:59:18 GMT):<br/>
In the same context , what is the block time achieved in besu ?
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 17:28:43 GMT):<br/>
Similarly, blocktimes in mainnet are defined by the eth network (~15 seconds per block).
However, in permissioned networks, this can be tweaked in the genesis file
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/IBFT/#block-time
with the `blockperiodseconds` variable.

Some live, production networks that are using Besu have chosen 2 second block times.

Note though that having such a small block time isn't necessary for many projects.

Hi All! I've been testing out Besu/Orion, specifically around the privacy features and I had a general question about a scenario I was playing with. 
I was envisaging a scenario of minting a token with a new private smart contract, to a defined privacy group - but then having private transactions with this token with a smaller subset of participants having visibility than the broader privacy group.
I understand that Orion (by design) doesn't allow making private transactions to a subset of the original privacy group, so would the general advice be to use Besu + something like AZTEC due to its ZKP features for this kind of use case? Or would the Cross privacy group communication features that are in the roadmap provide a way to tackle this with Orion in the future?
</p>
<p><strong>niliakis</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 07:41:24 GMT):<br/>
By saying dapp into app, I meant tha for the users it would be like an app, without interacting with a wallet. Can I handle the transactions for them in the background, somehow?
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 08:19:32 GMT):<br/>
Sure, thats doable. Appliciations can  have server-running code that do the business logic and sign the TXs.

The 'decentralized' aspect of it is arguable, but I personally think it still is valuable, depending on the implementation.

In these cases, its important to note that the users won't be using their own private keys to sign transactions.

I have deployed  a CLIQUE network (5 node in total) on my kubernetes cluster and I've noticed an interesting thing; at some random times all five node restart. DIging into the logs of each node (before they restarted) and I can see the following lines

Ok, the reason it failed with `OOMKilled` which based on https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/out-of-resource/#node-oom-behavior is due to memory limit contraint
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 19:07:30 GMT):<br/>
I used this deployment https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-kubernetes/tree/master/kubectl/private-network-clique/deployments and it sets the limit to 

```
limits:
  cpu: 500m
   memory: 512Mi
```

I assume the issue is with my Digital Ocean node, but it would be nice to see if anyone else had that issue before

<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 19:11:38 GMT):<br/>
it looks fine to me; the validators consume reasonable amount of memory; so probably some other processes (irrelevant to besu) are draining the memory

We list 4G as the mimimum.  This behavior isn't suprising when they are trying to work with 5% of that.  I think for smaller chains that less memory is needed, but that number is based on enterprise stability needs.

<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 19:22:54 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 19:23:25 GMT):<br/>
each JVM may need up to 4GiB.  You may be fine with 1GiB or less but stability and TPS will suffer.
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 19:24:47 GMT):<br/>
that makes sense; do you happen to have some stats from existing users that could suggest what limits would be good enough for a production deployment?

The multi-tenancy feature being released in Besu 1.4 is specific to private transactions. It will allow a single Besu and Orion to be handle private transactions for many users in a secure way.

Hey guys, i have a problem with besu + orion ? i'm following this https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-kubernetes/tree/master/kubectl/private-network-ibft-and-orion and step 5 is not clear! what updates should i do ? in which file ? ps : i found the orion1.conf to orion4.conf sections in the configmap/configmap.yaml and not in configmap/orion-configmap.yaml is that ok ? @shemnon  @faraggi :)

Unfortunately, we don't have that data now, but there are several different groups working on getting more user data and we'll possibly update the docs with approximate data in the future.
No specific dates or timelines, so I'd recommend increasing the MEM until the network seems stable. :/

Hi! Does Besu allow me to change max.transaction size / gas limit per transaction? What are the default values?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 12:36:16 GMT):<br/>
`--target-gas-limit` CLI flag sets it.  There is a issue to add it to RPC (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-52), but I'm not sure how much work has been done on it.

Hi, friends!

We are experiencing some problems with the Orion installation. When using the pegasysEng/orion:1.5.0-SNAPSHOT container, with docker-compose, when orion can't connect to another node specified in the othernodes flag in the configuration file, the process increases memory consumption until it throws with a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError error, even with logging turned off. 

In the documentation we see you recommend we must place Orion and Besu in separate instances, but when the process throws there's plenty of memory left. We suspect there may be a memory leak somewhere. Nevertheless, we would like to know the recommended memory needed to run Orion.

Thanks in advance!

Hello @raedbensaid ! Your right, that's a small mistake in the readme, and I agree with you that step 5 is not very clear!

<p><strong>marlow</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:42:33 GMT):<br/>
In `configmap/configmap.yaml` are the configs of the orion nodes orion1.conf-orion4.conf. What I think `suit to your requirements` means in this context is that you can update the secret keys of the orion nodes located in secrets/orion-keys.secret.yaml. So you can have your own set of public-private keys instead of the keys in the given example

@marlow  thank you for the explanation. I moved the section of the orion nodes into configmap/orion-configmap.yaml and i modified their public / private keys and the validators keys as well. But still not working i only have 2 validators working ( pod created )! shoud i change anything in the configmap file ? maybe the path of the keys' files ?

@raedbensaid If you are in the `private-network-ibft-and-orion` folder and just run `./deploy.sh`. That will automatically start a working example in kubernetes for you. You don't have to change anything

<p><strong>antoniosngular</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 23:17:09 GMT):<br/>
No, in this moment we are running Besu + Orion in the same instance

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sat, 08 Feb 2020 22:08:22 GMT):<br/>
OK.  The reason we recommend separate instances for Besu and Orion is that if they're in the same instance, Besu and Orion fight for the same resources and Orion ends up missing out. 

To keep them in the same instance and avoid this, you'll need to configure the JVM to prevent this resouce conflict. We recommend running them in seperate instances to avoid this.

Hi Guys. I am trying to run Besu using Ethash consensus protocol. I have question regarding difficulty setting in the genesis file, As you can see on the snapshot below, it mentions difficulty in two places. "Fixed Difficulty:1000" and "Difficulty: 0X10000". What I understand is that if i set fixed difficulty to 1000, then the difficulty will always be 1000. So why do i need to to set  "0x10000" again?

Hi all, we have been receiving some feedback over the past little while around ease of use of Jira vs Github for raising issues. The community response points to Github being a more familiar tool, as well as general access being already available, making it a lower barrier to entry to log issues, view progress of work, and engage with other contributors to the project. Based on this, we are considering switching the repository of Besu tickets from Jira to Github. Are there other considerations or other feedback that we should think about? This topic will also be tabled at the next few Besu contributor calls for discussion as well.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 02:14:04 GMT):<br/>
The "difficulty" field specifies the difficulty of the genesis block.  When using fixed difficulty I think it has to be the same, but if you were using "real" ethash the difficulty would gradually adjust with each block to keep block times roughly consistent as available hash power changes.  In that case you'd want to ensure the initial difficulty is set to something reasonable for the amount of hash power you have - too high and you won't be able to mine new blocks, too low and it may take too long to adjust to a sensible value for that amount of hash power.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 02:22:44 GMT):<br/>
I would advise against fixed difficulty in anything other than a test environment.  Simply remove that line and difficulty will float as a function of time between blocks.  Constant hash will eventually find an equlibrium.  But try and get that first difficulty correct, eventaully can be a long time if set too low or too high.
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 02:25:09 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @shemnon and @ajsutton yes i am using it in test environment. So if i use both fields together, does it mean that the "Fixed difficulty" will overwrite the "difficulty" field.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 02:26:11 GMT):<br/>
I suspect the genesis block will always get the "difficulty" value and all created blocks will get the "fixed difficulty" value.  Since we never validate the genesis block that should work out fine even if the two values are different.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 02:26:13 GMT):<br/>
Fixed difficulty will trump.

I'd recommend following this setup https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-quickstart/blob/master/docker-compose_privacy_poa.yml 
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 10:57:05 GMT):<br/>
It similar to the k8s variant but a little easier to follow given its all in one place, node1 -> orion1 , node2->orion2 and node3->orion3

Hi guys! The best way to get help with Orion is to use its Gitter channel (https://gitter.im/PegaSysEng/orion).

All Orion specific questions should be asked over there! :)

Hello, I'm working on the Solang Solidity compiler (see https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang ), and I'm trying to see if there are ways of Solang support Besu. Solang already has support for ewasm, but as far as I can tell Besu has no support for ewasm. Are there any plans for ewasm or any other form of webassembly?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 22:58:00 GMT):<br/>
Besu doesn't support eWasm and eWasm is not in any roadmaps of any of the contributors that I am aware of (ConsenSys, Web3 Labs, and ETC Cooperative).  Besu aligns tightly with mainnet ethereum and the EEA standards, neither of which have specified eWasm, so that may be motivating it.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:00:25 GMT):<br/>
Does solang output EVM?  Or is the Burrow support coming from their experimental eWasm work?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:09:20 GMT):<br/>
The burrow support is coming from their experimental ewasm support.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:10:48 GMT):<br/>
There is an wip evm backend for llvm, so support for evm could be done through that.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:12:22 GMT):<br/>
My worry with the llvm evm backend is that as soon as mainnet supports ewasm, evm support will have been a wasted effort. 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:28:14 GMT):<br/>
I don't think eWasm will make the Eth 1.x chain.  It's currently a top candidate for Eth 2 Phase 2, but that is out of scope for Besu, which is a 1.x clain client.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:29:19 GMT):<br/>
eWasm has been "on the verge" for years already, their current focus in mainnet is as an alternative for precompiles not for deployed contracts.  There's funding and politics involved in that focus too.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:29:58 GMT):<br/>
"Stateless EVM" is also a phase 2 candidate.  There is a good chance there will be multiple phase 2 VMs.

All besu node was down suddenly.
How do i fix it?
This is my besu version.

How much memory is allocated for each node?
</p>
<p><strong>AkihiroTanaka</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 13:45:14 GMT):<br/>
16GB.
I'm using a t2.xlarge instance on EC2 per node
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 13:45:43 GMT):<br/>
So not memory.  What's the RPC load like?  are you querying large amounts of logs?
</p>
<p><strong>AkihiroTanaka</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 13:54:43 GMT):<br/>
There were no RPC load because I just created and keep it for few weeks.
It looks many log is queried but I'm using ecs on ec2 and cloudwatch logs.
</p>

Hi guys :)
I am currently setting up a Clique network. I saw that Parity does not include the standard Ethereum builtin contracts by default, like ecrecover, sha256, ripemd160 & identity, and that you have to configure those in the genesis file. How is it in Besu? I haven't found any information regarding this.
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 10:25:35 GMT):<br/>
:thumbsup: We're taking a look at them now, thanks for your feedback!
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 10:48:46 GMT):<br/>
These predefined parameters are needed for those testnets. The allocations you see in the Besu clique genesis file are the Rinkeby allocations. https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/config/src/main/resources/rinkeby.json

If you wanted to create brand new POA network, you could exchange those for your valiadator node's keys and respective allocations. 
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 10:49:03 GMT):<br/>
Let me know if that helps cause I'm not 100% I understood the questin
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 10:49:03 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jacekv</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 10:53:55 GMT):<br/>
But are those fields required? 

If I understand it correct and do not provide the ecrecover contract, I won't be able to use it in smart contracts. Is it the same in Besu?
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 11:34:54 GMT):<br/>
Yes, if you want to deploy the network  with those contract, you'll have to include them in the genesis file. 

Similarly, allocations are needed if you want ETH to be present because it is a POA network, therefore Eth doesn't get mined. Your network will have 0 eth forever unless you allocate it initially.

Although I'd like to get someone else's take on it as well just to make sure.

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 22:22:25 GMT):<br/>
You do not have to include precompiled contracts like ecrecover in the Besu genesis file.  They are provided automatically based on the milestone version used by the chain (which is configured in the genesis file).

You can optionally include contracts in the genesis file by specifying their EVM code but those are not precompiles, just normal Ethereum contracts which are included in the genesis state.  Precompile contracts like ecrecover are run in native code and provided by the client software itself.

Hi guys, i am trying to compare the performance of Blockchain consensus protocols for some kind of application. I was able to test PoW and PoA (Clique and IBFT). But I want to test my application on Proof of Stake also. Does besu support Proof of Stake? If not, is it possible to plug in Proof of Stake protocol into Besu?

no worries @faraggi, that makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 11:40:42 GMT):<br/>
I'm looking into the Grafana chart for my CLIQUE network (5 nodes) and as you can see in the attached screenshots, there are some spikes from time to time and I wonder what might be the cause. The TPS is very low at the moment so there are not really too many transaction that are processed. I'm actually quite confident that when the spikes appear there are no transaction at all. Is it some internal work that the nodes perform occasionally?

this is the cpu usage. My assumption is that this is caused by the GC, but it would be nice for someone to share his wisdom with me :)

yes I think there is not option to disable empty blocks the way you can do it in Tendermint for example. So the block height  will keep increasing, which is ok
</p>
<p><strong>adityasingh177</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:03:22 GMT):<br/>
What is the purpose of creating empty blocks ?
</p>
<p><strong>adityasingh177</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:03:52 GMT):<br/>
I saw some other blockchain , the blocks are created only when the transaction is submitted
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:05:08 GMT):<br/>
probably so that you can have a notion of time to some extent
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:05:10 GMT):<br/>
I confirm that creating block in a continuous way is made on purpose to enable the protocol do detect when some issues happen. Otherwise you would not be able to know if the network is stuck of if it's just because no tx was sent.
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:05:11 GMT):<br/>
I don't know really
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:05:32 GMT):<br/>
This is working the same way with IBFT2
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:06:02 GMT):<br/>
so it works as a  liveness check for the other peers
</p>
<p><strong>adityasingh177</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:06:19 GMT):<br/>
ok Thanks @NicolasMassart 
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:07:04 GMT):<br/>
@NicolasMassart isn't there a `/liveness`  endpoint that does a similar job?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:09:01 GMT):<br/>
Yes but the RPC liveness endpoint is there to help you monitor the nodes at an infrastructure level (kubernetes for instance could wait for nodes to be available or things like that) but the continuous blocks creation is made to ensure the network liveness at protocol level.
</p>
<p><strong>adityasingh177</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:09:01 GMT):<br/>
For liveness , aint gossip messages not enough @NicolasMassart @ppoliani

it's more than liveness. It's a timestamp showing that effectively during that timeframe the chain came to a consensus that no transactions were present.

<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 14:47:08 GMT):<br/>
I tried to setup a faucet in the genesis file of a permissionned network using the following command : 
`solcjs --optimize --bin -o exampleexample contracts/FaucetProxy.sol contracts/Faucet.sol  contracts/interfaces/Ownable.sol  contracts/interfaces/Context.sol contracts/permissionning/Admin.sol contracts/permissionning/AdminList.sol contracts/permissionning/AdminProxy.sol`
I added it in the genesis file and launched the network.
The thing is, every call to that contract is wrong. For example, I have  a getter `faucet()` that should return the address of the faucet, and a method `setFaucet(addr)` to set it.
Even after calling the `setFaucet` method, the `faucet` call return the wrong address.
I saw that the permissioned contracts uses storage addresses, something my contract do not. Is my problem due to that?
Is there any good documentation about it somewhere?
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 14:49:10 GMT):<br/>
From the [pegasys/permissionning-smart-contracts](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/permissioning-smart-contracts) folder, we have that:
```
contract Ingress {
    // Contract keys
    bytes32 public RULES_CONTRACT = 0x72756c6573000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000; // "rules"
    bytes32 public ADMIN_CONTRACT = 0x61646d696e697374726174696f6e000000000000000000000000000000000000; // "administration"

```
How these addresses have been chosen? Should I setup my contract to have a storage the same way?
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 16:01:14 GMT):<br/>
HI! Can we see your smart contract code?
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 16:01:39 GMT):<br/>
Hi, hmm not really, it would be our production code.
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 16:02:42 GMT):<br/>
Not really, it would be our production code
Could I indicate you on how it works?
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 16:03:52 GMT):<br/>
I guess that could maybe work
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 16:07:53 GMT):<br/>
it is a proxy ; only the owner can set the faucet address.
faucet_address is undefined at the start
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 16:09:59 GMT):<br/>
then the proxy would redirect any call to the faucet
</p>
<p><strong>akuanti</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 17:07:42 GMT):<br/>
Those aren't addresses, they are keys for the contract registry. For example, if you hex encode "rules", you get `0x72756c6573`, which is then being padded to 32 bytes.
</p>
<p><strong>akuanti</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 17:08:10 GMT):<br/>
What exactly are you trying to accomplish? Does your faucet work properly on a network without permissioning?

Hello. I'm testing *uPort's IdentityManager* smart contract on Besu. When I run this contract in Geth, it works normally but not in Besu. I want to know why there is a difference in the result of the same smart contract.

Can you elaborate on what the failures you are seeing?
</p>
<p><strong>jinnyeon</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 05:36:56 GMT):<br/>
When executing 'forwardTo' function of uPort IdentityManager.sol, transaction failed with 'false Transaction mined but execution failed' message.
I think the following part doesn't work.
```
// copied from GnosisSafe
    // https://github.com/gnosis/gnosis-safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol
    function executeCall (address to, uint256 value, bytes data) internal returns (bool success) {
        assembly {
            success: = call (gas, to, value, add (data, 0x20), mload (data), 0, 0)
        }
    }

```  

In addition, I wrote a smart contract that simply sends ether to Besu, and send (), transfer (), and call () all fail to send ether. Can you see the cause?

```
pragma solidity 0.4.15;

contract Sender {
  function send(address _receiver) payable {
    //_receiver.send(msg.value);
    //_receiver.transfer(msg.value);
    _receiver.call.gas(203124).value(msg.value)();
  }
}
```

So by "sends ether to Besu" I assume you mean a node running besu.  Is this on mainnet or a testnet or on a custom network?  Also, what are the outputs of the JSON-RPC calls posting?  Are you specifying gas or replying on eth_estimateGas?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 05:42:15 GMT):<br/>
If this is in a named blockchain can you point me at a failing transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>jinnyeon</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 06:16:46 GMT):<br/>
The test environment consists of the Besu node in Kaleido and is the PoA algorithm.

Correcting 'sends other to Besu' means sending Ether between accounts using smart contacts.

JSON/RPC output will check again and let you know because it was tested through Remix's Injected Web3 (Metamask).

<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:38:37 GMT):<br/>
My faucet and the proxy are tested and work properly.
In the permissionning contracts example, two of the contracts are defined in the genesis file.
I would like to deploy the faucet proxy via the genesis file to have it have some ethers.
```
"0x...55": {
  "comment": "my faucet proxy",
  "code": "....",
  "balance" : "0x100000000000000..."
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:39:34 GMT):<br/>
I would like to set it like that to avoid having an account with most of the ethers of the network. 
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:40:35 GMT):<br/>
The thing is, when using remix to test it after deployment on my network, the faucetProxy contract does not work as it should.  
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:42:01 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if it is because of my contract missing a storage like the [permissioning contracts defined in the genesis file](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/master/genesis.json#L38) or if the way I compiled the bytecode is wrong 
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:43:01 GMT):<br/>
(`solcjs --optimize --bin -o bytecodes [list of contracts]`)
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:44:50 GMT):<br/>
or any other error I did not think about. 
I don't know why it did not work ; pegasys gave an example on how to define a contract at genesis, but there is no documentation about it. So I don't know what went wrong ; if there's any constraints or anything

It seems to be related to the estimate_gas issue.
When I debug the transaction, it seems that there is not enough gas. Is there a solution?

If you get at the gas estimate multiply it by 1.1 for a 10% boost.

Hello, I'm new to blockchain technology and I'm trying to develop a voting system using Hyperledger (after a lot of pros and cons between it and Ethereum). Actually, I looked over and I found Besu and Fabric projects. My request would be to use the PoA consensus algorithm  which looks available in Besu, but I don't want to use actually an Ethereum network due to the gas cost and the wallet prerequisites. So, is there any option in order to use another consensus algorithm in Hyperledger Fabric than the current one (ordering) ?

You can set the gas cost to zero and that would result in gas simply being used to ensure the smart contract will halt.  Thus you don't need to manage ether between wallets and IIRC any account (wethere it existed or not) can call any contract.  (if not we should consider removing the barriers).

You can find different consensus algos that are compatible with besu here: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/IBFT/

And this is the doc for creating a free gas network: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/FreeGas/

Hello. I am using besu v1.3.8 and I am running a private network on my personal local pc. I want to send a transaction using web3.js. However, running the example `create_value_raw_transaction.js` in the link https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Develop-Dapps/Use-web3js/ returns `Error: Returned error: Invalid params`. What is the cause?

It looks like rocksdb missing a write, or Amazon's file store being flakey.  I've had success shutting down besu and restarting the AWS node when I've seen it.  Restarting the AWS node is essential because it forces Amazon's backing file system to sync.

Relative to a *voting system*, per sé; no specific reasons to build on any specific platform.
However, the main differences between HLF and HLBesu are:

- Besu will be able to TX with eth mainnet, and private networks
- Java v/s Go
- Solidty (and more) vs chaincode
- privacy solutions are completely different

and more...

again, it may be the same sync issue.  Otherwise the node became corrupt because of file system issues.  RocksDB is rough on file systems.

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 07:37:11 GMT):<br/>
It's whatever bytes the contract output with the log event. It can be anything, but if you used solidity to output the log, it will use solidity's data format and most web3 libraries should be able to parse it into a more usable form for you if you provide the contract ABI.

Hello everyone, I would like to share some thoughts about interactions with the besu node.
In a scenario where If for some reason the besu node does not totally synchronize (but almost at the head of the chain), I am able to:
* Read database
* execute transactions.

But I am not able to listen events.

As I see this is the normal behavior under that context, but wouldn't be better to guarantee that even when the synchronization fails the node is still able to listen events?

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 20:10:39 GMT):<br/>
What events are you talking about? If you are talking about event emitted by Solidity (that become logs in the tx receipt), your node will generate them as it processes the incoming blocks. If it is out-of-sync, you won't get the events for transactions that have been included in blocks that your node hasn't received yet.

There are two errors.  First, the headers to download being sent by the peer don't connecct durring fast sync.  We have error logic convering that.  But the error logic does not hande the case where the chekpoint range includes the chain head, so we get an unexpected error.  Corner case of a corner case.

Based on the code base I do not expect 1.4.0 that is being reelased today to make a difference.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 16:36:06 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon let me give some context.
* The node is under IBFT2.0.
* Network: Under nat environemt and node is hosted into a subnetwork where the node is hosted in a machine that uses virtualization(eg. virtualbox or similar)
* Lets assume my node is "A". 

Then as I understand when some other peers send message block headers to the node "A" then for some reason there is no fast synchronization with those peers (maybe connection is broken for some reason?):
* Besu handle errors related to fast sync during block headers transmission that aren't the chain head.
* But the errors are shown because the handler does not cover the case when the chain head arrives and fast sync fails.

In Practice, I have observed that the node "A" is capable of:
* serve queries made by users through RPC api methods (eg. read and change the state)
* Users are NOT able to listen events because the node is not always 100% synchronized.


The problem persists because the node is continoulsy trying to reach the chain head.

<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 16:43:14 GMT):<br/>
please @shemnon  can you give some ideas what is happening. Thanks!!
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:09:54 GMT):<br/>
You may want to up the `--max-peers`  (default is 25) or set each peer to reserve a peer for an "adjacent" peer or set of peers using the `static-nodes.json` facility.  You can actually use `static-peers.json` to set up a fixed topoligy too.  Each peer would need to have the other peer in the static peers list to ensure connection.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:18:32 GMT):<br/>
thanks a lot @shemnon , I have a clue, according to the attached image the node disconnects for almost all the peers; please can you tell me why it is happening? 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:19:43 GMT):<br/>
All the other peers are connected to each other with no available connections.  They've formed a tight clique.  That's why upping max peers would help and why setting static nodes would ensure at least some connection if that tight clique forms.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:21:47 GMT):<br/>
Not every node can be connected with each other if the max nodes is less than the total nodes, and when those numbers are close a clique is more likely to form.  Especially if the clique has not had node members go off line.  
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:22:35 GMT):<br/>
try bringing down some of the non-validator nodes and see if this node can re-connect after 5 min.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:23:01 GMT):<br/>
If I may ask, how many total besu nodes are in your network? 
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:23:17 GMT):<br/>
I have near 30 nodes
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:24:09 GMT):<br/>
yep, that is consistant with my expectations.  The other 29 have a tight pool of nodes and there is no place for this node to connect.  Upping `--max-peers` to 30 on all nodes should help.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:25:02 GMT):<br/>
so maybe I may increase that number as minimum on all bootnodes?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:25:08 GMT):<br/>

excellent @shemnon  let me try it. I'll come back soon
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:03:13 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon  fortunately now I do not see TOO_MANY_PEERS anymore, neverthless I see a message mentioning that: "Rejecting connection because local node is not ready" , can you let me know what issues can be happening in my local node? thanks

Our team is currently working on removing the fallback from fast sync to full sync (https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/427). Because this is a change in how defaults work, we were hoping to have it for the 1.4 release, but would still need ~1 day of work to get it done and test it properly.

At the same time, it’s not a “feature” that people used per say as much as a good idea that turned out to be inconvenient when used in the wild. No one "relies" on this. That would be an argument to not push back the release and just have the change in 1.4.1.
Thoughts? Not too sure what the right call is here.

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:31:05 GMT):<br/>
If a fast-sync is failing due to peer starvation, it'll drop back to full-sync automatically so the only way to try fast-sync again will be to realise this has happened, stop the sync, delete the database, and start again.  Is that right? 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:31:57 GMT):<br/>
So if someone starts syncing using a named network and the default fast sync fails, it could be hours before they realise? 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:33:03 GMT):<br/>
And then the original bug that promted this change is more likely to occur and that will stop the full sync as well.  So they'd have to delete the database and restart the full sync? 
</p>
<p><strong>mbaxter</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:37:14 GMT):<br/>
FWIW - I'd characterize this change as a bug fix - we're trying to properly handle previously unhandled errors
</p>
<p><strong>mbaxter</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:38:57 GMT):<br/>
> And then the original bug that promted this change

What's the original bug?
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:40:49 GMT):<br/>
Pruning failing and causing a MerkleTrieExcpetion.  Hang on - I'll find the actual bug. 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:41:40 GMT):<br/>
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-160
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:42:46 GMT):<br/>
That bug was discovered by the switch from full to fast sync, but isn't really "caused" by it. It's an issue with pruning only. 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:43:02 GMT):<br/>
So users are more likely to encounter it with the current fallback.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:43:28 GMT):<br/>
The bug can occur with full sync but its much less likely to - is that right Tim? 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:46:05 GMT):<br/>
The bug is most likely when full sync is running with pruning
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:46:45 GMT):<br/>
Full Sync + Pruning is an odd configuration, *but* Fast Sync + Pruning is recommended. Therefore, due to the fallback, users are likelier to end up with that configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:52:46 GMT):<br/>
So this really affects users syncing to named networks (mainnet, Ropsten, etc).  If we don't change the default behaviour, a portion of them are likely to: 
1) Fall back to full sync if peer starvartion causes fast sync to fail 
2)Hit the pruning bug because now they're using full sync and pruning. 

Do we have any feeling about how likely each of 1 and 2 are? ie, very likely, might happen, unlikely

And in both cases, the solution is to delete the database and start again? 
</p>

> Do we have any feeling about how likely each of 1 and 2 are? ie, very likely, might happen, unlikely

(1) Likely. My personal experience is ~50% of the time on a laptop. 
(2) Not sure. 

> And in both cases, the solution is to delete the database and start again?

Yes

<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:55:55 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like its not whether or not this is a bug that needs to be fixed, its if release should be delays because of it. To me as long as we have communicated the bug, we can go ahead with release and advise what to do now, and when it will be fixed.
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:57:14 GMT):<br/>
The nuance is that the fallback wasn't really a "bug" at first but a feature. Just turned out to be a bad one :-) 
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:58:29 GMT):<br/>
And we cant make it fall back to fast sync AND switch off pruning?
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:59:19 GMT):<br/>
We don't want to fall back to full sync period.
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:59:35 GMT):<br/>
There isn't really a good use case for that. It's better to spend days searching for peers than switch back to full sync
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:01:15 GMT):<br/>
Got it. My thoughts are go ahead with release (as there are a bunch of other features that users are waiting for) and we communicate this one have it fixed in the next point release.
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:06:03 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense to me :+1: 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:07:09 GMT):<br/>
Pruning is disabled by default isn't it? 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:07:46 GMT):<br/>
I'll update the changelog to make this clear. 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:07:54 GMT):<br/>
> Pruning is disabled by default isn't it?

Yes
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:08:18 GMT):<br/>
We will only enable it by default with fast sync once both the fallback is gone and the bug linked above is fixed :+1: 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:08:19 GMT):<br/>
But not in named networks? 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:09:16 GMT):<br/>
Not the default there either. We held off merging it because of the two issues above.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:09:16 GMT):<br/>
Ignore that - it's enabled for named networks because they start on fast sync 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:09:24 GMT):<br/>
Wait what?
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:09:39 GMT):<br/>
> Full Sync + Pruning is an odd configuration, but Fast Sync + Pruning is recommended. Therefore, due to the fallback, users are likelier to end up with that configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:10:21 GMT):<br/>
So if you start with `besu`, don't you end up with fast-sync and pruning enabled by default? 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:10:41 GMT):<br/>
No: there is an open PR pending for that to be ture. We held off merging it due to these issues https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/384
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:11:15 GMT):<br/>
But fast sync + pruning is what we tell (told) people to use prior to finding these bugs
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:11:15 GMT):<br/>
OK - that's actually better.  So you'll only hit the 2) if you've deliberately enabled pruning 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:11:24 GMT):<br/>
Yes 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:11:50 GMT):<br/>
... unless fast-sync enables pruning by default. 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:11:52 GMT):<br/>
Should I put a known bug tag into the command line reference doc as well as the changelog in that case? 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:12:37 GMT):<br/>
Ok, as I understand it, fast-sync *does* enable pruning. Sorry, my bad.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:13:29 GMT):<br/>
OK - so we should be recommended that users explicitly disable pruning when syncing to a named network then? 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:13:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm double checking with @rai 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:14:23 GMT):<br/>
Ok, confirmed that:
1. Fast Sync is *not* the default on named networks
2. Fast Sync *does* enable pruning
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:14:51 GMT):<br/>
So, yes, we should recommend *not* using pruning for now, and hence if people use fast sync, they should disable pruning.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:15:01 GMT):<br/>
OK - so if you explicitly enable fast sync, then you should explicity disable pruning 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:15:06 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:15:31 GMT):<br/>
And just generally be aware that defaulting to full sync is probably not the behaviour you want. 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:15:51 GMT):<br/>
Yep, and that should be fixed by 1.4.1
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:16:13 GMT):<br/>
Is the pruning bug likely to be fixed by 1.4.1 as well? 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:16:55 GMT):<br/>
@rai :-D ?
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:17:14 GMT):<br/>
1.4.1 is in 2 weeks right?
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:17:17 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:17:17 GMT):<br/>
Yep 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:17:25 GMT):<br/>
worst case we can un-default pruning with fast sync
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:17:30 GMT):<br/>
I am really really hoping so
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:17:30 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:18:08 GMT):<br/>
OK - so defaults will definitely be sorted and pruning bug hopefully 
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:18:53 GMT):<br/>
yes :-)

Hello guys! I have a question regarding Besu private transaction performance test. I have been wondering if there is any official tool to test Besu private transaction TPS and latency. I have found Caliper for Ethereum but not for Besu private transaction. Thank you a lot for your help in advance :grinning: 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 02:08:08 GMT):<br/>
Not yet but we have this work on our roadmap.  Have you got specific requirements around private transaction TPS? 
</p>
<p><strong>Bobur</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 02:17:10 GMT):<br/>
@madelinemurray thank u for the prompt reply. Currently we do not have specific requirements as it may differ based on business model. I have been wondering if you can share internal TPS result if you have done any?
</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 10:59:25 GMT):<br/>
Hi.
I understood that BESU Private Network can be used as a channel of fabric by grouping nodes.

How do I add a node to a group?
There seems to be no function to add nodes to the group.

has additional questions in the question content of Kobilov Boburjon.
Are there performance test results internal when trading based on groups of nodes based on IBFT 2.0 consensus?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:20:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi Benjamin, the functionality to add nodes to a privacy group is currently under development. Atm, your only option is to create a new privacy group with the new member.

Hi, Julien from EatTheBlocks youtube channel here (Blockchain dev tutorial). I am preparing a series of videos tutorials on Besu
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:05:24 GMT):<br/>
I went through the quickstart tutorial to setup a private network (with docker), and also another tutorial to setup a private network but using the `besu` cli directly
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:05:36 GMT):<br/>
In the first tutorial, there is a mention of mining nodes, but not in the second
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:06:17 GMT):<br/>
do we always need mining nodes, or there are some consensus protocols that dont require it?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:22:11 GMT):<br/>
There should always be at least one block producing nodes.  This is determined in a PoA by the extra data in each block, with the genesis block having the initial set of miners.  If a node sees that it's key matches the set of allowed producers it should mine automatically.
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:38:00 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:38:07 GMT):<br/>
who determine this extra data for each block?
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:40:09 GMT):<br/>
let's take this from the beginning of the process
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:40:28 GMT):<br/>
so I start my network, with the configuration for the genesis block, which include the set of miners
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:41:01 GMT):<br/>
next, I sent a transaction to the network... 
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:41:10 GMT):<br/>
one of the node is going to pick up the tx
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:41:16 GMT):<br/>
and mine if it has the correct signature
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:41:28 GMT):<br/>
how about for the next transaction in the next block
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:42:31 GMT):<br/>
So in a PoA network we typically call the nodes creating blocks "Validators" rather than miners.  As you note, the genesis block defines the initial set of validators.  Which validator proposes the next block depends on the particular form of PoA you're using but roughly they take it in turns.
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:43:50 GMT):<br/>
oh
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:43:55 GMT):<br/>
Blocks are created in most PoA systems whether there are transactions or not.  Typically there's a block period setting which defines how often they are produced.
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:44:05 GMT):<br/>
so... when a validator create a block, he also pick the next valdiator?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:44:40 GMT):<br/>
No, the PoA algorithm sets rules about who proposes the next block.  The rules vary in subtle ways.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:45:15 GMT):<br/>
The set of validators is normally unchanged from block to block, but there's typically a system where validators can vote to add or remove validators.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:45:50 GMT):<br/>
When enough validators have produced a block voting for the change the new validator is added in (or removed if that's what the vote is for)
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:46:10 GMT):<br/>
I see
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:46:43 GMT):<br/>
so from the point of the view of a user, the logic is a bit different depending on whether you setup a POA private network of POW private network
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:46:59 GMT):<br/>
with POW, you specify the miners (validators) in the genesis file
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:47:06 GMT):<br/>
*with POA
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:47:22 GMT):<br/>
but then you start each node normally, without the "mining" flag
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:47:43 GMT):<br/>
and with POW, you dont specify the miners in the config file
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:47:54 GMT):<br/>
but instead you need to start each node with the "mining" flag 
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:48:07 GMT):<br/>
(I am ignoring permissioning here)
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:48:18 GMT):<br/>
Yes.

1. It keeps producing new blocks, even when I don't send transactions => is it actually running a local development Blockchain or maybe there is a mistake in my command and it tries to sync some network?
2. when I stop and restart it, and resumes the Blockchain where it last stopped, even though I configured a data-path in tmp. I thought this would be destroyed by the OS (MacOS) automatically... I certainly lack of Linux skills here... any tip to avoid having to destroy this data folder between 2 runs of besu?

1. Yes, the dev servers for demo are configured to mine by default
2. IIRC /tmp takes days or a reboot to clear on Mac.  I have a directory ~/besu/dev that I keep a persistent chain on when I develop.

@shemnon thanks for your support, the checkpoint.range error was appearing because the npt server was not correctly configured causing rejection of arriving block headers.

@jklepatch Besu continues mining blocks even if there are no transactions.  That's because a block reward is paid for every block mined regardless of whether it contains transactions.  In dev mode it would be reasonable to provide an option to only create blocks when there are transactions to save CPU but besu doesn't currently have such an option.

@ajsutton What abount a PoA gas free network?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 03:17:42 GMT):<br/>
This answer was specifically about the PoW miner.  Clique doesn't pay any block reward and IBFT2 is usually configured with no block reward (though I believe it's a config option). For both Clique and IBFT, the consensus protocol requires creating blocks at fixed intervals to keep things working so there is no option to skip creating empty blocks.

it seems like both allow to control which nodes are allowed to participate 
(on-chain or local config file for permissioning vs on-chain configuration for IBFT tutorial)
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 11:58:31 GMT):<br/>

and also, why do we need to explicitly add nodes as peers with clique? is it because with this consensus mechanism there is no native method for node discovery with a bootnode?

It's not on our roadmap currently.  It's got some non-trivial friction: some hash functions and signatures have different lengths which impacts the wire protocol in unexpected ways.  It also impacts off chain tooling such as wallets, metamask, and integration libraries.

Hi all!
I have some trouble creating an IBFT network.
I followed [this tutorial](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-IBFT-Network/), my peers are connected to each other and use the correct private key at setup.
But no blocks are produced and I don't know why; I tried to re-create the rlp encoding in cas that was faulty but with no result. I tried back with besu1.3 but with no success.
Any idea of what I could have done wrong?
My process is:
- generate the genesis and keys from a template using `besu operator generate-blockchain-config`
- move this data where the besu containers load it
- deploy with `docker-compose up` and then connect the nodes via RPC
From the grafana dashboard I can see that they are connected but the first block has trouble being issued: 
```
2020-03-02 16:28:38.033+00:00 | pool-10-thread-1 | DEBUG | IbftBlockHeightManager | Round has expired, creating PreparedCertificate and notifying peers. round=ConsensusRoundIdentifier{Sequence=1, Round=4}

```

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 16:36:50 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 16:39:03 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 16:55:12 GMT):<br/>
I have another question though, how do I specify my block time to be fixed to 5 seconds ?
my current configuration is : 
```
"ibft2" : {
      "blockperiodseconds" : 5,
      "epochlength" : 30000,
      "requesttimeoutseconds" : 10
    }
```
But it seems to lock at around 6.3s. 
I have 4 validators for BFT and network is localhost.
Would setting `"requesttimeoutseconds" : 5` do the trick?

Hi guys! Just wanted to share the plugin we have been working on: Exflo "A plugin for the Besu enterprise-grade Ethereum client with the aim of making it easier to extract chain data into a variety of different data stores and processing pipelines.". For now we support only Postgres and Kafka. It's Apache 2.0 Licensed (and is an alpha release as we know some obvious things we need to improve). Feel free to take a look!

IBFT2 has finality, Clique is supported by other ethereum clients.  Those are the two most relevant differences.
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 21:19:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi @ArvsIndrarys, Unfortunately, the blocktime is hard/impossible to have 100% fixed in a distributed system. Having said that, I'm surprised you're seeing such significant difference on localhost.
The blockperiodseconds is the number of seconds since the last block's import that the next block creation process will start (i.e. create the block, share with validators and create signatures) - this block creation process can take a little time, but I'm surprised its taking 1.3 seconds - are you CPU limited?
Changing reqeusttimeoutseconds is not going to help your situation - this field is used to define the maximum duration (in seconds) of the first-block-creation process at each block-height - if this timeout expires, the block-creation process is restarted, but with a double-duration timeout and a new proposer (repeat ad infinitum)

whats the advantage of permissioning vs just setting up a private network ?
</p>
<p><strong>jklepatch</strong> (Tue, 03 Mar 2020 04:44:56 GMT):<br/>
In a private network we already can choose which node will be allowed in the network

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 03 Mar 2020 05:14:24 GMT):<br/>
Permissioning is really useful when the rules of which nodes can join net network are dynamic. Also, you can use permissioning to specify accounts that can affect the world state (potentially, different permission levels for different accounts).
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 03 Mar 2020 05:15:24 GMT):<br/>
Also, using onchain permissioning mean that the rules are controlled by smart contracts, allowing a variety of use cases (e.g. a consortium network in which member should vote to allow a new member to join the network). Stuff like that.

Hi! I have some trouble connecting my nodes via the `static-nodes.json`file method.
My nodes do connect to each other via the `admin_addPeer` RPC command but I got `Node is not permitted to connect` problems via the file.
[Here are more detailed logs](https://gist.github.com/ArvsIndrarys/26b52ff93a07d6095eb3b1b7bfa87d69).

If you use local permissioning and have nodes in your whitelist, do you then need to explicitly add the nodes as peers, or should this happen automatically?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 06 Mar 2020 16:46:41 GMT):<br/>
If you have a bootnode where your node can find these whitelisted nodes by himself it should work automatically
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 06 Mar 2020 16:47:14 GMT):<br/>
Note that the bootnode have to be whitelisted too.

Hi guys, i am trying to measure transaction latency for a specific app for different consensus algorithms (IBFT, Clique PoA and PoW). For that,  i need to know the confirmation time of a transaction.  For IBFT, I know that a transaction is considered final once added to a block. But not sure for the other two. When can i say a transaction is confirmed for Clique PoA and PoW? Any idea?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 01:00:29 GMT):<br/>
Neither Clique nor PoW provide guarnateed transaction finality, only probabilistic finality. So you basically have to choose how many blocks you want to wait to get to the level of risk you're prepared to accept.  That number will be affected by what's at risk and things like the network hashrate (for PoW) or how much you trust validators in Clique.
</p>
<p><strong>Jemal</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 01:05:22 GMT):<br/>
@ajsutton Thank you bro. So, is there a rule like the minimum/maximum number of blocks to wait to get some level of guarantee. Also do you know if there is any documentation that explains these things in detail?.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 05:44:42 GMT):<br/>
I'm not aware of anything definitive. Most people just go with something fairly arbitrary like 6 blocks from what I can tell.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 05:45:09 GMT):<br/>
Although Eth2 went with follow 1024 blocks behind the eth1 chain PoW chain to be *really* sure there were no re-orgs.

Is 'trace_replayBlockTransactions` the only tracing command you support?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 18:33:01 GMT):<br/>
Right now.  We are in the process of adding others.  Specifically, what commands do you want?
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRush2</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 18:40:10 GMT):<br/>
In order of increasing importance.
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRush2</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 18:40:12 GMT):<br/>
1) We use `trace_get` as a lightweight way to tell how many traces a transaction has. For the Fall 2016 dDos attacks, we use this to 'skip over' these traces (at the user's discretion). Almost all of the 2016 dDos attack transactions have 10s of thousands of 'traces'. It's a huge performance killer.
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRush2</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 18:41:32 GMT):<br/>
2) We use `trace_transaction` but only in a limited way when we know the exact transaction and we want the 'raw' trace data we're querying (not the case in our primary usage).
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRush2</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 18:43:56 GMT):<br/>
3) We use `trace_block` to do our 'extraction of appearances'. This is the primary use of traces. We spin through every block, call `trace_block` and run through the entirety of that data to extract addresses. (We use other RPC data such as receipts to get contract creations and deletions.)
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRush2</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 18:45:51 GMT):<br/>
We only really look at the 'trace' types -- we don't use `vmTrace` or `stateDiff` (yet).
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRush2</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 18:47:53 GMT):<br/>
If I had to choose, I would choose `trace_block`.

`trace_block` and `trace_transaction` are on the ConsenSys todo list.  Most of the other contributors are focused on Eth Classic support and EEA features so I wouldn't expect it from them.  `trace_get` is not on our roadmap although the difficult work appears to be done for that.

hi Besu community, Jason here from Whiteblock.io. we are working on contributing support for PoW mining via keccak256 (https://etccooperative.org/etc-coop-support-switch-to-keccak256/), and we are looking for information on which requirements we should focus on passing(e.g. unit tests and integration tests).  on a high level, we are trying to add a run time flag (or.ghyperledger.besu.cli) and making changes to (org.hyperledger.besu.etehreum.blockcreation and ethereum.mainnet). we would appreciate any pointers!
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 02:46:02 GMT):<br/>
And I am happy to help in any way I can with this ^^

ChainSafe (mainly Edward Mack) are doing ongoing work for ETC hard forks as they come.
Whiteblock are doing the first "extra" work here, looking at mining support.

@timbeiko helped with the triage on various mining TODOs.   This is the first step.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 04:07:19 GMT):<br/>
Don't do a runtime flag.  This should be configured via the genesis file, like ethash, ibft, and clique are configured.  org.hyperledger.besu.config.JsonGenesisConfigOptions#getConsensusEngine is a place to start.  Some of the classes that you are modeling will be (mistakenly) named "EthHash" instead of "Ethash"  Pretty much every "EthHash" class will need a "Keccak256Pow" equivilant.  Stylewise I would prefer "pow" in the class names.  Keccak also has non-Proof-of-Work uses whereas Ethash is almost exclusively PoW, so the rider isn't needed.

Hi !! I am trying to set up an off-chain private network using the instructions written in the official documentation: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Permissioning/Create-Permissioned-Network/

Unfortunately I could not make it work. I booted up the 3 nodes, whitelisted the enodes and added the peers to each of the nodes following step by step the documentation but connectivity across peers do not work.  I am using latest stable version : `besu/v1.4.0/linux-x86_64/oracle-java-13`. Can anyone gimme a hand with it?

Hi is there any informations about the amount of tx/s (or tps) supported by besu?
I saw in the JIRA these issues/epics : 
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-22
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-15

but is there somewhere the results? 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 05:13:42 GMT):<br/>
Depending on infrastruture and network topology, we've seen up to 400 TPS supported by Besu.

Hi @ggarri did you complete all the steps in the tutorial? Can you validate that the `permissions_config.toml` file in each of the nodes directories contains the 3 enode IDs matching the 3 nodes that you started up
</p>
<p><strong>ggarri</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 07:38:21 GMT):<br/>
Hi! Yes to both, completed the tutorial and validated the permissions file to verify enodes are whitelisted

Hi on upgrade to besu 1.4.0 i noticed that even with rpc auth disabled (rpc-http-authentication-enabled=false) if I include rpc-http-authentication-credentials-file=/path/to/file I get a 401 error when accessing the JSON RPC endpoint {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":null,"error":{"code":-40100,"message":"Unauthorized"}} (This is different behaviour from Besu 1.3) shouldn't the flag take precedence? If i comment out the cerdential file setting in the config all works as expected...

Hello, I'm using a fork of the besu repo in GitLab, right now I'm trying to configure CI/CD on GitLab but the docker build step is taking a lot of time. Looking at your circleci config I don't quite understand how it's being done, looks like you are building the code with gradlew and then moving those compiled files to the docker, is that right? Can someone explain this to me? thanks in advance

Hi, I'm using Besu 1.3.8, and I've noticed if two transactions are sent at the same time with the same nonce, the second transaction doesn't get the "Nonce too low" error but it hangs until it gets unauthorized after the auth token expires and the error I get is "Failed to check for transaction receipt".
If the second one gets sent after the first one has finished mining, it returns the "Nonce too low" error immediately.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 13:58:09 GMT):<br/>
I believe this is how all ethereum clients will treat it.  We need to be able to replace mempry pool transactions on occasion.  i.e. transactions not mined.  Once case I had to deal with was when I set the gas price to zero and no miner would mine it but it had propagated to all the miner nodes.  If it always replied "nonce too low" we would never be able to replace memory pool transactions.

The first step from ```./gradlew --no-daemon --parallel clean spotlessCheck compileJava compileTestJava assemble``` does the build and has a lot of compiled files

The first step from ```./gradlew --no-daemon --parallel clean spotlessCheck compileJava compileTestJava assemble``` does the build and has a lot of compiled files which we save to a workspace and mount for the next test runs to speed things up
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:10:06 GMT):<br/>
we save those to a workspace so the next steps of unittests (`build`), int tests (`integrationTest`) and so on are faster
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:10:06 GMT):<br/>
this makes the next steps of unittests (`build`), int tests (`integrationTest`) and so on are faster
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:10:38 GMT):<br/>
the longest of the tests are the acceptance and reference tests
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:17:57 GMT):<br/>
From memory (this could well have changed now) I believe the equivalent on gitlab would be `artifacts` (for the workspace) paired with `dependencies` to pass things across stages

Im running a Besu node on Kaleido (1.0.24). Running IBFT.

Debugged a transactions for hours now. Im useing budiler and remix to debug in different ways. Bascially, i deploy som contracts, run some transactions. Then there is one function that im trying to run but fails on Besu. But it does not fail in javascriptVM. 

 reason: 'transaction failed',

I believe i've identified an edge case related to private state migration, seems if the Besu node can't detect schema version i.e. version = 0. Besu still starts and private database migration wont run
</p>
<p><strong>magooster</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 08:16:55 GMT):<br/>
Migration only runs if schema version is 1 and migration flag is set, otherwise node wont start... (PrivateStrorageMigrationService.java)
</p>
<p><strong>magooster</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 08:20:59 GMT):<br/>
The node i'm testing dates back to pantheon 1.1 and there's no DATABASE_METADATA.json in the database directory.
</p>
<p><strong>magooster</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 08:31:57 GMT):<br/>
Actually might be that the database is  deemed to be empty...

Hi, are there any plans to support subscribing to private contract events out of the box?

const privateEventsClient = new PrivateEventClient(web3ws, web3priv, ORION_PUBLIC_KEY)

privateEventsClient.on('privateContractDeployed', async (txReceipt) => {
  const address = txReceipt.contractAddress

  // this uses the from/to instead of privacygroups, but they are interchangeable
  const privacyGroup = [...txReceipt.privateFor, txReceipt.privateFrom]

  // get abi&bytecode from somewhere
  const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address, { bytecode: bytecode })
  contract.options.privacyGroup = privacyGroup.sort()

  privateEventsClient.on('logs', (log) => {
    if (contract._address.toLowerCase() !== log.address.toLowerCase()) return

    const output = contract._decodeEventABI.call({
      name: 'ALLEVENTS',
      jsonInterface: contract._jsonInterface
    }, log)

    output.privacyGroup = contract.options.privacyGroup

    // Event output similar to public events
    console.log(output)
  })
})

```

But It would be great if it will work similar to how public events work, only that it will also return the privacyGroup
```
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address, { bytecode: bytecode })
contract.events.event().on('data', async({ event, returnValues, privacyGroup }) => {
  // DoSomething
})
```

For anybody that is interested, you can simulate this behaviour (nastily) by replacing the subscription on the contract.events[key] with a function returning an new EventEmitter(). Then instead of console logging the output, you can bind emit the output on that new EventEmitter. However, this doesn't seem like a good idea long term
```
privateEventsClient.on('privateContractDeployed', async (txReceipt) => {
  ...
  Object.keys(contract.events).forEach(key => {
    const ee = new EventEmitter()
    ee.topics = contract.events[key]().options.params.topics
    contract.events[key] = function () { return ee }
  })

  web3privateEvents.on('logs', (log) => {
    ...
    const events = Object.values(contract.events).filter(event => event().topics.includes(output.signature))
    events.forEach(event => event().emit('data', output))
  })
```

Hi, are there any plans to support subscribing to private contract events?

Currently, I have something like this to listen to private events (added comments where code is missing)

``` 
import Web3 from 'web3'
import EEAClient from 'web3-eea'

import EventEmitter from 'events'

const ORION_PUBLIC_KEY = 'key'

const web3 = new Web3(BESU_RPC_URL)
const web3ws = new Web3(BESU_WS_URL)
const web3priv = new EEAClient(new Web3(BESU_RPC_URL), 2018)

class PrivateEventClient extends EventEmitter {
  constructor (web3ws, web3priv, orionPublicKey) {
    super()

    const pendingTxs = web3ws.eth.subscribe('pendingTransactions')
    pendingTxs.on('data', async (txHash) => {
      const txReceipt = await web3priv.priv.getTransactionReceipt(
        txHash,
        orionPublicKey
      )

      // We are only interested in private tx
      if (!txReceipt) return

      if (txReceipt.contractAddress) {
        this.emit('privateContractDeployed', txReceipt)
        return
      }

      txReceipt.logs.forEach(log => {
        this.emit('logs', log)
      })
    })
  }
}

const privateEventsClient = new PrivateEventClient(web3ws, web3priv, ORION_PUBLIC_KEY)

privateEventsClient.on('privateContractDeployed', async (txReceipt) => {
  const address = txReceipt.contractAddress

  // this uses the from/to instead of privacygroups, but they are interchangeable
  const privacyGroup = [...txReceipt.privateFor, txReceipt.privateFrom]

  // get abi&bytecode from somewhere
  const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address, { bytecode: bytecode })
  contract.options.privacyGroup = privacyGroup.sort()

  privateEventsClient.on('logs', (log) => {
    if (contract._address.toLowerCase() !== log.address.toLowerCase()) return

    const output = contract._decodeEventABI.call({

Hi,

We have been running besu on and we are uising Username and Password Authentication. When connecting using web3's websocket provider the connection is ok initially but is dropped after a while(before the token expitres). I have not been able to find anything on the documentation regarding dropping connections.
My question is whether this is something that besu does intentionally or if it is related with something else. If yes, can I disabled it?

Hello folks! I hope everyone is doing well.
I have a few questions regarding the Orion node. If anyone can provide some insights about it, you would make my day!
1. What is the reason of running Orion node in a separate instance instead of inside Besu node?.
2. When running an Orion node in a separate instance, wont there be any performance issues like lower TPS or any unexpected failure in Orion node etc?
3. Does it have to be a separate Orion node for each Besu node?
4. Is it really safe to use Orion for private transaction?
Thank you a lot for ur answers in advance! Wish HLB community the best!

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 03:30:17 GMT):<br/>
@Bobur here are a few answers to your questions. I hope they can help!
1. Mostly due to the origin of the project and the use cases that required the data encrypted at rest to be into "special" servers and things like that (mostly compliance). We are exploring options to, in the future, allow Orion to run as a plugin of Besu. So the user will have both options available.
2. For production environments, Orion must be highly available (from 1.5.0) - (https://docs.orion.pegasys.tech/en/latest/HowTo/High-Availability/). For most use cases, the overhead of encrypting/decrypting private txs doesn't impact the TPS of the network.
3. This is recommended. If you want to run it in the same instance, you'll need to ensure that both JVMs are properly configure to share the host resources nicely.
4. Safety is a really broad concept. What are your concerns around using Orion for private txs?

Adding this functionality is planned for 1.5 - the Jira issue for tracking is https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-79 

We're in the progress of migrating our Jira issues to GitHub issues but will include a link on the Jira issue when that happens.

Thanks, to me it looks like in Besu 1.4 private tx related items are being written to the data/database whereas in Besu 1.3.x looks like it wrote to data/database/private. 
</p>

1. I believe this is for RAM reasons. Having multiple RocksDB instances is going to use a ton of extra RAM due to all its caches etc.
2. There _might_ be lower TPS, but I don't think that'll be the bottleneck really.
3. its recommended because of (1)
4. Pretty subjective question, and depends on too many factors to answer objectively. What do you mean by 'safe'?

hi guys

<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Sun, 15 Mar 2020 11:42:20 GMT):<br/>
I'm switching from Besu v1.3.8 to v 1.4.1 and I noticed that it doesn't work straightaway. It looks like there is the addition of `KubernetesNatManager` which tries to locate the cluster's config file at `~/.kube/config`
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Sun, 15 Mar 2020 11:43:28 GMT):<br/>
I had to update `--nat-method=MANUAL` to make it work. Is there any reason why we should use `KubernetesNatManager ` when running in k8s cluster? It looks like setting it to manual works perfectly fine
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Sun, 15 Mar 2020 14:32:41 GMT):<br/>
It looks like `--nat-method=MANUAL` doesn't work anymore.  Peers cannot find each other `No sync target, wait for peers.`
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Sun, 15 Mar 2020 15:11:10 GMT):<br/>
I can see `Waiting for new peer connection. 2 peers currently connected.` but no blocks are mined.
</p>
<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Sun, 15 Mar 2020 16:42:11 GMT):<br/>
by default Besu will try to automatically detect exposed ports and IP when running in Kunernetes.  the difference with the manual mode where it is necessary to put manually all the ports and IP.  to be able to make besu work properly in a kube you must add in your deployment script an environment variable KUBE_CONFIG_PATH: "/ path / to / kube-config"  and add your port forwarding rules when you define your service

Hi @NikosFotiadis We dont think there is anything that drops the connection after inactivity, so probably needs some further investigation. Can you provide some more details? How long does the connection stay before being dropped out? Are you connecting directly to the Besu node or through a firewall/reverse proxy connection? And what version of the products are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Sun, 15 Mar 2020 23:23:52 GMT):<br/>
Also note that we have multi-tenancy support for Orion now. So you can run a single instance of Orion/Besu for multiple users - if that is a consideration.

Hi! You can deploy a contract in a privacy group and interact with it through a node that is a participant in the privacy group.

Hi guys! Thank you all for answers and efforts to improve HLB
I have a few questions regarding Besu.
1. When Node1 deploys a contract with "privateFor=Node2 orion public key" field, is the transaction stored in Node3 rocksdb database as well?
2. How can i see rocksdb .sst files contents? I tried sst_dump tool and keylord gui but it is not showing the result that I wanted
Thank u in advance

Not able to get events using web3py -
```

print("Connection established : ", w3.isConnected())

contractDetails   = json.load(open("build/contracts/Contract.json"))
contract = w3.eth.contract(address = contract_address, abi = contractDetails.get('abi'))

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 08:48:45 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Bobur a private transaction is only shared between participants of the transaction. In your example, node3 won't have the private transaction.
About exploring RocksDB data. You might try something like this (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Administration-and-Data-Access-Tool)
</p>

Besu didn't like the set of parameters you sent in for a specific RPC call.  What was the RPC call you were executing when this error occured?  i.e. what web3js api were you calling? That is not present in stack trace you posted.

A quick question; can I start the a CLIQUE network without the Orion nodes and then at some point in the future make it a permissioned network?
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 17:55:56 GMT):<br/>
Just some clarification first: are you looking to implement permissioning or privacy in the future?
Orion = Privacy, and prefers having IBFT2, not clique
Permissioning needs a specific genesis file from the get-go
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 18:13:00 GMT):<br/>
sorry @faraggi my bad. I meant the privacy feature
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 18:54:24 GMT):<br/>
In that case, although privacy-enabled networks can use CLIQUE, transaction finality is preferred.
Check the 'important' highlight here: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Overview/

To answer your question; yes, you can spin up the network with the corresponding config and then spin up the orion nodes themselves.
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 18:55:01 GMT):<br/>
cheers mate; good to know
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 20:30:28 GMT):<br/>
Update with more details.

Scenario 1:
if you have privacy enabled without orion/with orion but it's down the node will try and process the incoming private transaction and will fail to do so and get stuck until orion is back up.
Scenario 2:
if you start a node without privacy but process a transaction that happens to be a private marker the node will do nothing interesting.

Is besu's fast sync comparable to geth and parity's? Does it validate all transactions and can it be considered a full node?
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 03:02:53 GMT):<br/>
Hi, must the private transaction send by the orion node? Is it possible for a person to send a private transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 03:06:43 GMT):<br/>
Besu's fast sync is the same as Geth's (parity only supports warp sync which has a similar result but different approach to syncing).  Fast sync does not process transactions prior to the "pivot block" (the block which the world state is downloaded for).  The historical block and transaction receipt data is however downloaded so when fast sync completes you have a full node.  World state prior to the pivot block is not available so it is not an archive node.
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 03:09:07 GMT):<br/>
Can the data up to the pivot block be trusted then?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 03:09:29 GMT):<br/>
As in can we be sure that nobody tampered with it?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 03:09:37 GMT):<br/>
Are the hashes verified?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 03:21:22 GMT):<br/>
It depends what you mean by "trusted".  For example, even if you did a full sync and processed every transaction, it's possible to be the victim of an eclipse attack where your peers feed you valid blocks which are not actually the canonical chain.  You can spot that easily if you verify the final block hash you reach with some other source to confirm you have reached consensus.

With fast sync, the chain of block hashes are fully verified which includes the hash of the state root.  It also includes the transaction hashes.  It does not check the proof of work solution for every block (to speed up importing it only checks a random sample of blocks) and it does not process transactions so can't verify that the new world state is the correct result from applying the transactions in the block.

You can however trust that the world state you downloaded is the correct state for the block because the state root hash matches.  You know that the ancestor blocks (and the transactions they contain) of the pivot block are correct because each block includes the hash of the parent.

But, just as with full sync, you can't know for sure that the block hash of the pivot block is correct.  Besu will confirm that multiple peers agree with that same block hash but it's impossible to fully prevent eclipse attacks.

Bottom line, however you sync, if you verify the pivot block hash with other sources you trust then you can be 100% confident that the entire chain and world state is correct.

I don't think we can support s390x, the rocksdb jni lib doesn't have Z series support, only Linux 32/64 (intel/amd), linux aarch64 (arm) linux ppc64le (power8), windows (intel), and mac (intel).  We use the library as-is and that is all the native libs it comes with.

That is a significant departure from the tutorial.  This appears to be an issue in how web3.js is being used rather than an issue with besu.

What does `java -version` give you?  Is it possible you have an older version installed and that's what Besu is trying to use?

IIRC if it's in your path or libpath it should load.

There are also two ways, setting `BESU_OPTS=-Djava.library.path=<path_to_library_directory>` or adding the library path to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (I'm assuming you are running linux from the error)

Are you using EthSigner? If so, which version?  And IBFT 2.0?  We've got a couple of known issues we're curently looking at that might be related:

Hello @tezansahu , few options available depending on your network and what polices are allowed : 
- change them to be nodeport's and then access them via a broweser or an ssh tunnel
- deploy an ingress controller & corresponding rules and then access it via browser if possible or via an ssh tunnel. We've got an example setup here https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-kubernetes/tree/master/helm/ingress

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 20:18:26 GMT):<br/>
hi @tezansahu - there's two ways to solve this - either convert the services declared to be node port if that satisfies company polices etc, or preferably deploy the ingress controller as well that ties which has grafana rules already setup. Details here - https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-kubernetes/tree/master/helm/ingress

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 20:24:18 GMT):<br/>
The Besu privacy implementation uses off-chain privacy so only the participants in the transaction receive the private transaction.  Orion is the private transaction manager so a Orion node is required for each Besu node participating in private transations.  

This blog post explains a bit more about how it works - https://pegasys.tech/privacy-in-hyperledger-besu-how-it-works-and-why-your-enterprise-should-care/

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 20:42:56 GMT):<br/>
hi @coenie  - depending on infrastruture and network topology, we've seen up to 400 TPS supported by Besu.

There are also some detailed benchmarks being worked on and that information will be released as soon as we have it.

Would love to have you run your thoughts by us. 
</p>
<p><strong>coenie</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 20:44:28 GMT):<br/>
okay awesome, looking forward to that!
Do you know if that was 400 TPS for EIP20 transfers, or something else?
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sun, 22 Mar 2020 20:48:27 GMT):<br/>
It was ether transfers on an IBFT network.

this is something seen under some test frameworks, where the client connection closes before a response can be committed.  This can be ignored.  I think we can stop sending it but it's not highest priority right now.

Thanks for your answer.
This is the output of `java -version`:
java version "1.8.0_241"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_241-b07)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.241-b07, mixed mode, sharing)

I have Java 8 installed, the latest version. But Besu asks for Java 11.

I guess they mean JDK, not Java. But I have JDK 13 installed as well.
</p>
<p><strong>julez</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 09:08:42 GMT):<br/>
fixed it, I had to manually overwrite the JAVA_HOME variable to the path where JDK is installed.

But now I am running into the next error after using `gradlew build`: `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.codehaus.groovy.vmplugin.v7.Java7`

It seems to be a known issue, but I haven't found a way around it yet.

Hell everyone, We've been talking to the team behind Ethereum on ARM / ethraspbian (https://github.com/diglos/userpatches) in order to have it support Besu.
https://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM/status/1242002111396745216

Does any one have any experience and/or feedback on this. 
We know 32bits and RAM to be major bottle necks to this project.
What else should we be considering?
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 17:12:54 GMT):<br/>
@faraggi I have been deeply down this rabbit hole myself:

https://doublethink.co/2015/12/31/a-tale-of-two-abis/

https://doublethink.co/2015/11/30/first-working-ethereum-c-cross-builds/

https://github.com/doublethinkco/cpp-ethereum-cross

I do not know whether it is really going to be worth putting too much effort into supporting 32-bit devices anymore, to be honest.
RAM obviously an issue, but storage and need for SSDs even more of a constraint.

What should be the ideal time for Smart Contract Invocation on Besu 3 node clique network with difficulty of '0x1' in genesis file? For me it is taking 14 sec for each transaction which I think is quite high.
</p>
<p><strong>cjhare</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 06:55:43 GMT):<br/>
> difficulty of '0x1' in genesis file

The Clique consensus mechanism does not use `difficulty` field in the genesis config.


For Clique network, that `config`object supports a `clique` child object, which can defines the time between blocks being produced e.g.
```
  "config": {
...
    "clique": {
      "blockperiodseconds": 15,
      "epochlength": 30000
    }
  },
```

`blockperiodseconds` is rough time between blocks, which I believe may default to 15 seconds

Ah, you have mindful when measuring performance of PoA mechanisms, as they exhibit different behaviours to PoWs
</p>
<p><strong>cjhare</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:17:50 GMT):<br/>
With Clique, a block is produced at fixed intervals, irrespective of throughput ...by which I mean, if you submit a transaction just after a block is produced, your transaction will take ~14 secs (as that is when the next block is produced).

Under a Pow mechanism with an extremely low difficulty, it would be pretty much instantly processed

This is an example call we use to make transactions:

      privateFrom: process.env.ORION_PUBLIC_KEY,
      privacyGroupId,
      privateKey: process.env.ORION_PRIVATE_KEY,

you need to keep a shared counter.   If this is against multiple processes it becomes problematic.  An alternative is to use a separate account per process.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 17:29:40 GMT):<br/>
You mean block time?  There are no APIs for that and it can vary based on mining algorithm.  Ethash targets 15s and is not tunable IIRC, it is also not guessable as it is probabalistic.  Clique and IBFT2 can be tuned in the genesis.json file to privide a different block time.  `blockperiodseconds` in the `clique` or `ibft2` object of the genesis.json

Hi @magooster. May I ask what are you using to create the signed tx? EthSigner, Web3j, Websjs-eea?

Also, have you checked if all previous txs have been processed successfully? I'm thinking that If there was a invalid tx in hte batch of txs, the account nonce wouldn't be incremented for that tx, so the following txs that you sent would need to take that into account (e.g. if tx 28 failed, the next tx shouldn't have nonce 29, it should be 28 "again").

PrivateTransactionValidator  has a check for matching account and transaction nonce...
</p>
<p><strong>magooster</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 22:21:38 GMT):<br/>
Given that all requests are processed using executeBlocking and hence a worker thread - how is account nonce synchronised across them?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 22:45:43 GMT):<br/>
The account nonce validation happens in two different places. One is when accepting a tx via JSON-RPC (adding the tx to the pool). The other place is when tx are processed included in a block (during mining). The check done at the JSON-RPC layer is done against the latest nonce value for the account. This is a read-only validation, it won't affect the account nonce.

The only place that the account nonce is affected is when the transaction is being processed and added to a block. And we have all the necessary arrangements to ensure thread safety at that point.

What version of Besu are you using? I wonder if your case might've been solved by https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/557

I was using a snapshot based off 1.4.2 but might not have that fix, let me rebuild and check. Looks exactly like the issue however.
</p>
<p><strong>magooster</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 08:35:15 GMT):<br/>
Whilst the fix allows multiple private txs to be sent 'concurrently' - this then manifests in a problem with the privacy marker transaction (when using a fixed signing key)
</p>
<p><strong>magooster</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 08:36:10 GMT):<br/>
All relates to the privacy marker transaction nonce
</p>
<p><strong>magooster</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 08:37:08 GMT):<br/>
which ultimately determines order of transactions
</p>
<p><strong>magooster</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 08:38:09 GMT):<br/>
can get duplicate nonces or even out of order with respect to private transaction nonce.
</p>
<p><strong>magooster</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 08:38:40 GMT):<br/>
Easy to replicate just fire two private transactions in quick succession...

A very common way to create complex queries involving ethereum events in dapps is compose in three steps: (1) to read all events, (2) to store them in a database and (3) to query the database itself making the necessary joins. I am wondering if it is possible to have a better solution using Hyperledger besu node #besu. I do not want to maintain a separate database to this.

Right now I am rewiring the code so PendingTransactions is going to be available to the EthProtocolManager. Do you think TransactionPool should be used instead?

Hello everyone. 
I am trying to create a besu private network using IBFT2 on AWS VPC. I follow this tutorial  https://pegasys.tech/setting-up-hyperledger-besu-in-aws/  
I have 2 instances on private subnets and 2 others on public subnets. One of my private instances is the bootnode. 
I run it using this command  for bootnode 
`besu-1.3.6/bin/besu --data-path=data --genesis-file=./genesis.json --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=IBFT --rpc-http-host=0.0.0.0 --host-whitelist="*" --rpc-http-cors-origins="all"  --metrics-enabled --metrics-host=0.0.0.0 --metrics-port=9545 --p2p-host=< Private ip> & `     
then I run this command on each instance
` besu-1.3.6/bin/besu  --data-path=data --genesis-file=./genesis.json --node-private-key-file=/opt/besu/keys/key   --bootnodes=enode://<bootnode Public Key>@<bootnode Private IP>:30303 --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-host=0.0.0.0 --host-whitelist="*" --rpc-http-api=ETH,NET,IBFT  --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" --metrics-enabled --metrics-host=0.0.0.0 --metrics-port=9545 --p2p-host=<node private ip> &` 

Once all of them run they can't find other peers I don't Know why and It keep giving me this message forever.

Not terribly familiar with that code, but I think TransactionPool should be used instead.  PendingTransactions looks to be optimized for block production whereas TransactionPool is more optimized for the P2P side of the processing.  So for Eth/65 TransactionPool is likely what you really need.
</p>
<p><strong>magooster</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 16:15:02 GMT):<br/>
Isn't this due to the way web3.eea.sendRawTransaction generates the tx nonce
</p>
<p><strong>magooster</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 16:16:03 GMT):<br/>
It use web3.priv.getTransactionCount, so if you send mulitple transactions in succession they will use the same nonce

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 18:47:11 GMT):<br/>
My assumption was that web3js-eea was keeping a local cache of the nonce. So after sending the first tx, it would stop asking for the next nonce and using the next "expected" nonce. I'll check with the web3js-eea team if this is the case.

<p><strong>antonispoulakis</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 18:55:10 GMT):<br/>
Hi guys,
We're using Besu(version 1.4.1) with gas price = 0 and there is a strange behaviour regarding gas limit. We are using estimateGasPrice from web3 to decide the gas limit for the transactions but still, some transactions occasionally run out of gas. To get around that we were multiplying the estimated gas by 1.1 which was fine for some time until transactions started reverting again due to gas. We started multiplying by 2 but some transactions will still run out of gas.
Could there be any particular reason why this happens? Is there a side effect on setting the gas limit to a really high value?
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 19:20:05 GMT):<br/>
I have now understood that I can read Besu info about nodes: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/ethereum/api/src/main/resources/schema.graphqls. Are the events of smart contracts included in the "logs"? Are there any detailed documentation?
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 19:29:49 GMT):<br/>
For example, how should I interpret the data, that is encoded as bytes? For example, is it a concatenation of the name and the args of the event?

No the web3.eea.sendRawTransaction - calls web3.priv.getTransactionCount for each request to get the nonce (you can override in the options supplied to the web3.eea.sendRawTransaction request.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 21:58:39 GMT):<br/>
Thanks! I'm gonna follow up with them.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 21:59:03 GMT):<br/>
But you are right. In this scenario, one would need to keep track of the nonces instead of relying on the getTxCount responses.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 21:59:48 GMT):<br/>
I believe if could keep some kind of local cache of the nonce in the library, it would make this easier for this use case of sending multiple txs in sequence.

Are there any example with TCP 8545, and UDP 30303? 

Other question, to enable peer discovery, is it only necessary 30303 UDP port open for inbound connections? Or also TCP?

I've just seen this example of ingress "https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-kubernetes/blob/master/helm/ingress/ingress-rules-besu.yaml", but only works for the RPC calls and monitoring dashboards.. Are there any example with TCP 8545, and UDP 30303? 

Other question, to enable peer discovery, is it only necessary 30303 UDP port open for inbound connections? Or also TCP? Because when I try to create a ingress or loadbalancer service with both protocols appears the next error: 

"Error: release besu failed: Service "besu-validator1" is invalid: spec.ports: Invalid value: []core.ServicePort{core.ServicePort{Name:"json-rpc", Protocol:"TCP", Port:8545, TargetPort:intstr.IntOrString{Type:1, IntVal:0, StrVal:"json-rpc"}, NodePort:0}, core.ServicePort{Name:"ws", Protocol:"TCP", Port:8546, TargetPort:intstr.IntOrString{Type:1, IntVal:0, StrVal:"ws"}, NodePort:0}, core.ServicePort{Name:"graphql", Protocol:"TCP", Port:8547, TargetPort:intstr.IntOrString{Type:1, IntVal:0, StrVal:"graphql"}, NodePort:0}, core.ServicePort{Name:"rlpx", Protocol:"TCP", Port:30303, TargetPort:intstr.IntOrString{Type:1, IntVal:0, StrVal:"rlpx"}, NodePort:0}, core.ServicePort{Name:"discovery", Protocol:"UDP", Port:30303, TargetPort:intstr.IntOrString{Type:1, IntVal:0, StrVal:"discovery"}, NodePort:0}}: cannot create an external load balancer with mix protocols"

Thanks in advance

@dbdagr8 I believe we use HyperLedger Caliper for some of the load testing, but @shemnon might be able to shed further light on that (or provide the correct information) :relaxed:

Hi Suzana, the easiest way would be using a library like web3js or web3j. They will take care of decoding the data. If you want to do it yourself, I've found some articles online that can help (e.g. https://codeburst.io/deep-dive-into-ethereum-logs-a8d2047c7371).

Hi, does Besu support private transactions on mainnet, and if it does, how does that work?  Does each participant run an Orion node to handle the privacy?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Mar 2020 05:09:06 GMT):<br/>
Besu does not support Restricted Private Transactions (per the EEA spec, the kind that use orion) on Mainnet or public Testnet networks.  Besu does support Unrestricted Private transactions done via smart contracts, such as those using the AZTEC protocol.

Just to clarify. We have added in 1.4.0 experimental support to restricted private transactions on networks with non-finality (e.g. PoW - Mainnet).

The basic mechanism is that only participants of a private transaction will receive the private transaction payload in Orion and the PMT (privacy marker transaction) will be part of the public chain as any other public transaction.

Hi. If i were to setup a dapp on a public ethereum  network using Besu I assume that this would be PoW but programmable in Java? But how would i create a dapp in a private ethereum network using PoA and could transactions on a private network connect to the public ethereum network? I.e. if there is a token created on a private Besu network could it be transferred to the public Ethereum network?


</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 30 Mar 2020 19:37:00 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is that you are referring to private networks as a network with private txs. In this context, private transactions are only visible by participants of a privacy group. There is no way to transfer tokens from a privacy group to the public network (at least not in a way that makes sense). :)

For an IBFt2 based network is it possible to change the blockperiod after the chain has been up for a while (Can I just update genesis on each validator node)
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Mon, 30 Mar 2020 21:04:21 GMT):<br/>
@magooster at the moment, the answer is no, but its not quite that simple.
If you increased the period in the genesis file (say from 2 --> 5), blocks which were created with <5 second interval would appear to be invalid to nodes newly syncing the chain.
If you reduced the period (in all genesis files on the network) - I _suspect_ it would work, but it seems a little haphazard.
Finally - IBFT2 supports an additional section in its genesis file called "transitions" - its designed to allow a network to replace the network's validators at a given block-height - i.e. it allows the IBFT2 protocol to be 'forked' at a given block. At the moment, "transitions" do not support changing the block-period, but it could be updated to provide such a capability.

<p><strong>lshim</strong> (Tue, 31 Mar 2020 01:51:31 GMT):<br/>
But, Besu uses Java and can run on a public Ethereum network as well?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 31 Mar 2020 01:51:44 GMT):<br/>
Correct.
</p>
<p><strong>lshim</strong> (Tue, 31 Mar 2020 02:02:57 GMT):<br/>
so with public network - advantage is to code in Java; with a private network - advantage is scalability using PoA? But, then why not just use Hyperledger Fabri instead for private network?

Hi! I believe you are mixing a few concepts. I have replied to your message in the Besu mail list. In the future, it would be good if you could stick to one channel for your questions to avoid duplication.

Hi! I am trying to deploy Besu on Kubernetes. I followed the steps mentioned here: https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-kubernetes/tree/master/kubectl/ibft2-with-privacy
Now, I know the ClusterIP of the besu-node. I am unable to connect to the node usinh HTTP Provider of Web3py. Can someone help?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 22:36:17 GMT):<br/>
Hello @tezansahu could you give us a little more info on your setup please? Where is this deployed and where are you connecting to the cluster-ip from (i.e within the cluster/ locally/ host)? 
</p>
<p><strong>tezansahu</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 02:30:11 GMT):<br/>
Ok...so I have deployed besu-node on an AWS EC2 instance with kubernetes running on it. Since I have used kubectl, I have a ClusterIP for this node. Now, I tried to deploy another microservice which used web3py & kubernetes python SDK (to dynamically discover the ClusterIP of the besu-node). The ClusterIP is being discovered properly...but when I try w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("http://" + besu_node_ip + ":8545"), from withiin the microservice, it does not connect to Besu. Moreover, I can still send raw JSON RPC requests from the microservice to the same besu_node_ip successfully, but can't connect using web3py.

Please let me know if there is a way out in using web3py...or I have to go ahead with simple JSON RPC requests.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 03:53:34 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for that. Is this via minikube or  similar? From what you describe this doesn't appear to be an issue relating to connecting to the node ie if you can still send reqs to it and it responds, the connection is fine.

You probably need to raise this issue on the web3py forums. I would suggest two things to get a little more info: 
1. log the value of 'besu_node_ip' so you know what it is being resolved to
2. If this microservice is in the same namespace, you can use the env var directly i.e os.environ['BESU_NODE_SERVICE_HOST']. If you ssh into your pod and run `env` you should see the service hosts available there
</p>
<p><strong>tezansahu</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 03:55:11 GMT):<br/>
No...not by minikube
</p>
<p><strong>tezansahu</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 03:55:31 GMT):<br/>
Yeah...I tried logginf the value...and it shows the correct value
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 03:56:52 GMT):<br/>
:thumbsup: I'd suggest raising this with web3py then as the next step. There appears to be no reason why you can't connect to the node becuase its fine with normal reqs
</p>
<p><strong>tezansahu</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 04:10:41 GMT):<br/>
Ok

There is a project doing Benchmarking for Besu and other Hyperldger projects. Check out https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/caliper
I don't believe they have official results out yet.
What kind of performance data are you looking for and how precise does it need to be?

Hi faraggi, thank you for your answer.

To be honest, any information related to transactions per seconds (TPS) in a Besu network would be great.

But if you ask me, the ideal would be to know, for a IBFT network, how many private transactions per second (with Orion) can the network process, given that each transaction has, at leats, 3 participants.

Hi @nikolas could you be more specific about what client you are using to connect via websockets to Besu? A link to the website and the version being used would help! :)
</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 21:51:08 GMT):<br/>
I am using github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient
</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 21:51:40 GMT):<br/>
i try to go the same way it would work with a geth client, but i get an "invalid request" response.
</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 21:52:18 GMT):<br/>
so what I tried now is, I implemented my own websocket client and it works
</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 21:52:41 GMT):<br/>
but... well... don't wanna do that really
</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 21:53:58 GMT):<br/>
FYI in am on v1.9.12 on the go eht client. and seems it is not compatible
</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 21:54:24 GMT):<br/>
...or I am am missing something ridiculous! :D
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 21:56:14 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure if this client is meant to work with any Ethereum client (or if it is focused on Geth). Unfortunately, the API specs aren't set on stone and some implementations may differ.

I'd recommend you trying out Web3js (javascript) or Web3j (java) that are implementations that I know try to be compatible with as many Ethereum clients are possible.

Feel free to open a GitHub issue for this and we'll try to take a look at it.
</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 21:56:53 GMT):<br/>
u mean open a ticket on besu or the client side?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 22:00:43 GMT):<br/>
On Besu side. 

However, I gotta say that in terms of priorities, we focus on ensuring compatibility with libraries that are targeted to a variety of Ethereum clients (e.g. Web3js and Web3j).

If this is a bug on our side, we'll be more than happy to fix it. However, if this is just a implementation divergence, we might not prioritize it as much).

Out of curiosity, have you tried using this geth client with Other Ethereum client implementations (e.g. Parity or Nethermind)?
</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 22:05:33 GMT):<br/>
...well since the rest of the thing is implemented on golang, I would like to make it work and not to implement another stand-alone service in java or js just to be able to make event subscriptions. I ll try to dig deeper and gather as much info as I can to report.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 22:05:49 GMT):<br/>

When doing performance measurements on an ethereum network you need to make sure the gas limit can support the desired TPS. If I am understanding you right the blockchain is gas limited and transactions are not getting cleared from the mem pool or are never getting added.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 16:07:08 GMT):<br/>
For performance tests we use absurdly high values like 400 Million gas for 2 second blocks.  At that level the performance test is to see what the constraints of the block validators are.

Hello everyone, I have a question about deploying hyperledger besu for production. I am planning to use ibft2 consensus algorithm what is the best way to deploy on an AWS instance?
I am familiar with besu-sample-networks. Is it a good idea to use it on deployments? If not what I should modify to make it better? Or what alternatives are available for now?
</p>
<p><strong>yehia67</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:34:35 GMT):<br/>
It is a live production network. The project will have a mobile app available on play store for everyone. So I need my blockchain to be stable and scalable(as much as I can). I had already created an instance on AWS and used this docker container
https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-sample-networks
Unfortunately, It wasn't stable it work for some time then stop. I think it doesn't work because the container creates only one bootnode and three other nodes. If I modified the container to create two bootnodes and six other nodes will it be a good solution? If not what are the possible alternatives?

</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 13:07:21 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking the issue here is the network not being synced yet. Was that the case? 

</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 13:12:03 GMT):<br/>
TO send concurrent transactions with same account, it needs to pre-determine nonces. All TXs can lay in the TX pool until minded. 

The nonce is pretty much ingrained all over in the besu architecture. I don't think this will be possible. 

</p>
<p><strong>hmijail</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 13:13:36 GMT):<br/>
this is while modifying Besu for Eth1.x experiments. No idea how to get this during normal usage.
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 13:18:40 GMT):<br/>
Thats a tricky question. Way too many unknowns in order to answer your question thoroughly.
The main one being; what do you mean by "production"?  companies, and users accessing the network? on a live production network?
The deployment options will depend on what you're accustomed to and know how to use already.

Besu has ansible, kubernetes and docker files to help with deployment.
Otherwise, you can simply install or build Besu on your instances and deploy 'manually'.

Making it better really depends on what you mean by that.
If you elaborate a bit, I can provide advice.
Take all advice of this type with a grain of salt.

</p>
<p><strong>yehia67</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 13:37:52 GMT):<br/>
@faraggi  do you think besu-sample-networks is a good solution generally or I should use something else?
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 13:43:17 GMT):<br/>
Those are great sample networks. Use  them as examples, but make your own production networks and configs. 

One simple example of why using these 'as is' in prod are the private keys are publicly available in the repo.

That part of the sync process can take a few minutes. Sometimes feels like forever. Let it run for at least 5min.
If it still doesn't sync, it must come form the network config and how you've setup your infra
Is each of those terminal windows a different node? are they all hosted on the same local computer?

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:18:00 GMT):<br/>
hey folks, the default docker image for besu doesn't have a healthcheck. I see there is a /readiness endpoint that could be used for this. Is it appropriate to rely on it for a healthcheck?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:18:17 GMT):<br/>
Is there interest in having curl installed in the image by default to run health checks?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:23:30 GMT):<br/>
Would the `/liveness` endpoint suffice?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:24:43 GMT):<br/>
I mean, both work for me
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:24:45 GMT):<br/>
liveness responds if the JVM is operable and vertx is servinf.  readyness returns true only when in sync.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:25:10 GMT):<br/>
in sync and has peers I should say.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:25:11 GMT):<br/>
I see, so `/liveness` sounds better
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:25:16 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:25:29 GMT):<br/>
So the issue is that curl is not installed on the official Dockerfile
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:25:37 GMT):<br/>
health check endpoints run as CMD in docker
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:26:05 GMT):<br/>
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:26:22 GMT):<br/>
so 1. Is it ok to change the Dockerfile to install curl?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:26:38 GMT):<br/>
2. Is it ok to add a HEALTHCHECK instruction to the official Dockerfile?

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:20:38 GMT):<br/>
is `/liveness` working even if --rpc-http-enabled is not specified?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:20:42 GMT):<br/>
I'll check the code.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:21:01 GMT):<br/>
I just added an example to the splunk ethereum connector leveraging Besu: https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-ethereum/tree/master/examples/besu
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:21:28 GMT):<br/>
A simple one-node scenario. Splunk takes all the log, block, metrics data and ingests it.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:21:43 GMT):<br/>
I'd expect `/liveness` to be disabled if the HTTP APIs are disabled.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:22:20 GMT):<br/>
hmm I'm seeing this too.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:23:02 GMT):<br/>
@ajsutton should `/liveness` be enabled even if JSON-RPC HTTP APIs are disabled?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:23:58 GMT):<br/>
after all, it's not a JSONRPC endpoint.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:24:08 GMT):<br/>
Yeah the idea is that the HTTP port is closed by default.  And usually there's no real point in checking a HTTP endpoint is alive if nothing else is listening there.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:24:36 GMT):<br/>
This makes for an interesting use case though...
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:26:34 GMT):<br/>
If you don't have HTTP enabled though, what does liveness mean? You could check that the P2P port is open maybe.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:34:22 GMT):<br/>
sigh
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:34:53 GMT):<br/>
let me see the logic for liveness
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:35:57 GMT):<br/>
I see, there is no logic. The P2P port is not the safest option as it can be overridden.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:37:58 GMT):<br/>
interesting. So either you commit to have `/liveness` always served, on a separate fixed port from JSON-RPC, only on localhost, or need to use a different approach.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:38:52 GMT):<br/>
One option would be to have a separate `--enabled-liveness` check which is defaulted to on in docker via an env var in the docker file (and it could only listen on locahost I think).
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:39:08 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:39:23 GMT):<br/>
not a huge endeavor
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:39:38 GMT):<br/>
and we should keep liveness on JSON-RPC anyway
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:39:45 GMT):<br/>
Just need to remember that for most people having `/liveness` be part of JSON-RPC is really useful.  If `/liveness` works then JSON-RPC works.  We don't want to lose that by always moving it to it's own server.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:39:57 GMT):<br/>
so mount the health service in both places
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:39:59 GMT):<br/>
sure thing
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 01:40:19 GMT):<br/>
this is a perfect problem to look at 20 minutes away from dinner
</p>

:besu: We just released a new version of Besu, 1.4.3 :besu: 

It now supports the eth/65 protocol and exposes re-orgs and transaction revert reasons via our Plugin API. You can get it here: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/1.4.3
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 22:18:20 GMT):<br/>
For PoA systems like Clique and IBFT, besu will automatically mine whenever it is one of the validators.  Basically whether you're a block creator or not is built into the protocol whereas with PoW it's an optional extra duty .
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 22:57:03 GMT):<br/>
does it always do that?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:37:05 GMT):<br/>
Yes I think so. In the data directory. It deletes the file when it shuts down normally. 
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:38:01 GMT):<br/>
So checking if the process is running and that file is written would be a pretty good liveness Check actually.  It’s very careful to ensure the file is only written after all the ports are open since that’s what our acceptance tests depend on.

an additional config key that gives a path where to write the file, and the file acts as a PID file. May be useful for linux services too.

This is more of a vertx problem than a besu problem, because we use vertx.  10k open sockets is a very big number, representing 1/3 of the possible available ports.
It can be tuned - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58361727/multiple-concurrent-connections-with-vertx

Are you opening up 10k connections just to benchmark?  Architecture wise we would recommend multiple RPC nodes in that case or connecting via websockets.

Hello guys,
the German government is supporting open-source projects similar to the summer of code from google. For that, I would like to work on Hyperledger. The start will be July. I need a mentor and an idea for content I can contribute to the open-source project. I'm an experienced fullstack dev, worked with Etherum and have a knowledge of other Blockchains. Is there anyone that can help me find a topic I could work on? Highly appreciate you help

@faraggi thanks for the reply. Yes I am doing that for bench marking purpose. The network size is actually round 20-60 nodes. But all of the nodes and client apps are running on one ubuntu Virtual machine with 16 CPU cores and 120 GB RAM. I start to receive socket time out and "transaction receive was not generated after 600 seconds for transaction" once the number of open sockets reaches around 2000. You mentioned  connecting via websockets. Do websockets allow more connection than than HttP?

@faraggi thanks for the reply. Yes I am doing that for bench marking purpose. The network size is actually round 20-60 nodes. i believe that is enough number to open up to 10k sockets at a time. But all of the nodes and client app are running on one ubuntu Virtual machine with 16 CPU cores and 120 GB RAM. I start to receive socket time out exception once the number of open sockets reaches around 2000. I am using Web3j API to connect to the nodes. Below is how i create the sockets. You mentioned  connecting via websockets. Do websockets allow more connection than than HttP?                                                                                                                                                                     Web3j socket=Web3j.build(new HttpService("http://localhost:8545),1000, Async.defaultExecutorService() );

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:35:59 GMT):<br/>
Websockets allow the connection to stay open, so the overhead of opening and closing goes down and the calls can be multiplexed.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:38:23 GMT):<br/>
For the socket handling 16 cores between 20-60 nodes could be the root of the problem.  120gb memory is enough for 30 nodes (4gb each) per our recommended setup but a 16 core machine should be topping out at 8 nodes.

Hi Bobur!

I don't know if there are plans to support Swarm in the near future. I'll let someone else answer this one.

About IPC files, I'm assuming you are asking about using IPC to interact with JSON-RPC API. At the moment Besu only supports JSON-RPC through HTTP. It doesn't have IPC support yet.

Hi guys,
We have been using hyperledger/besu:1.4.2 for some time now and I have noticed that sending a transaction with lower nonce does not return the error I was expecting. Instead I don't get an error at all. It seems like there is not response at all. I have looked at the logs while sending the transaction but I did not find anything that seemed related. Any idea why this would happed or is I should be looking for something specific in the logs?

I have deployed the `besu-kubernetes` on minikube with a setup of 1 Node service and 4 validators (as default config) which is working fine. Now I want to run another node as a validator on my local terminal and connect to the minikube cluster. So to achieve that I have exposed the TCP service`besu-validator1` as defined in https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/nginx_tcp_udp_ingress/ After following all the steps if I do telnet on tcp port 30303 I get below message as `Connection closed by foreign host.` after ~15sec

I have deployed the `besu-kubernetes` on minikube with a setup of 1 Node service and 4 validators (as default config) which is working fine. Now I want to run another node as a validator on my local terminal and connect to the minikube cluster. So to achieve that I have exposed the TCP service`besu-validator1` as defined in https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/nginx_tcp_udp_ingress/ After following all the steps if I do telnet on tcp port 30303 I get below message as `Connection closed by foreign host.` after ~15sec
`~telnet $(minikube ip) 30303

Hi, I have a question about Truffle test with Besu.

I already deployed contracts using `truffle migrate`.
It worked well. 
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Develop-Dapps/Truffle/ https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/FreeGas/ 

After that, I ran the test (`truffle test`), and got the following error messages.

 # Truffle
```Error: Transaction has been reverted by the EVM.  ```

# Besu

Hello everyone, If I have a private Blockchain using  BESU and IBFT2 consensus algorithm. Composed of 8 nodes 2 of them are bootnodes. How many transaction could they make per day approximately?
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 10:25:31 GMT):<br/>
@abdelhamidbakhta I've been experiencing this issue as well. Having worked with other Ethereum based clients, the expected behaviour is:

1. If the nonce is lower than the current nonce, this is a violation of the Ethereum protocol rules so you should get an instant error with the following message (ususally): 

`nonce too low`

2. If the nonce is the same and the transaction has not yet been included in a block the error is 

`replacement transaction underpriced` 

3. Now is the transaction nonce is higher than the current account nonce then it results in a nonce gap and the transaction is stack in the tx pool.

I would expect to get error 1 or 2 if one tries to send a two transactions concurrently. 
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 11:38:03 GMT):<br/>
To give a bit more background, following  is the two tx that I sent:

```
{ nonce: '0x15c8',
  gasPrice: '0x0',
  gasLimit: '0x24ada',
  to: '0xDA35f4cb13a6ea0144469b23C0fE2F025bD4663B',
  value: '0x0',
  data: '0x0'
}

{ nonce: '0x15c8',
  gasPrice: '0x0',
  gasLimit: '0x24ada',
  to: '0xDA35f4cb13a6ea0144469b23C0fE2F025bD4663B',
  value: '0x0'
  data:'0x0' 
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 11:38:27 GMT):<br/>
I do get a response for the first one but not the second one
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 11:39:18 GMT):<br/>
I checked the besu tx pool as well and it's empty

```
{
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "id" : 1729,
  "result" : [ ]
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 11:39:18 GMT):<br/>
I checked the besu tx pool as well and it's empty

```
{
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",

}
```
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 11:39:59 GMT):<br/>
The expected behaviour is to receive `replacement transaction underpriced`  error
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 11:40:54 GMT):<br/>
I wonder id the fact that I use a fee free network causes this behaviour
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 11:41:42 GMT):<br/>
as you can see `gasPrice` is 0 so I wonder if that's make besu believe that it's not an underpriced transaction. I'm just geussing here
</p>
<p><strong>niliakis</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 11:44:51 GMT):<br/>
Hii,
Cound it possible to setup a private network with privacy enabled, but not all besu nodes are connected to an orion node? Also, could it possible to deploy a  contract seen by all and just make private transaction to that contract?
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 11:58:39 GMT):<br/>
Digging a bit into the raw http request I can see that the response I get is 400 which is currently omitted by the web4 http provider I use 
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 11:59:15 GMT):<br/>
I don't think a 400 bad request with an empty text is a very helpful response. There is not much information to know how to deal with the error
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 12:41:20 GMT):<br/>
This will depend on your network topology, transaction types and contents and more. 
We have third party benchmarking coming up soon.
Just as an approximate number; in general, 100-300TPS will be attained normally without much trouble.
</p>
<p><strong>faraggi</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 12:45:14 GMT):<br/>
1) Yes, this is possible. 2) nope
but just in case: @lucassaldanha @StefanPingel 
</p>
<p><strong>pinges</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 13:06:47 GMT):<br/>
The answer to the first question is definitely yes. Nodes without an Orion would not be able to make or receive private transactions.
I'm not sure I understand the second question. If you need a contract that can be seen by all nodes, even nodes without an Orion, then this needs to be in the public chain. All nodes can make public transactions to a public contract, but this. You cannot make private transactions to a public contract. 
One thing that is possible is to read from the public world state when executing a private transaction, but the public state cannot be changed by private transactions.
Let me know if I misunderstood your question.

I've been experimenting with the IBFT voting rpc endpoints but i'm hitting some weird things. I have a network with 4 validators and 1 non validator. I add 4 nodes, non validation. they join my network and sync up, blocks are still being mined. I now run, in one go (so semi concurrent and at the same time), on all existing validators the ibft_proposevalidatorvote with the 4 new nodes and all mining stops. Do nodes need to be restarted to change their mining status? Or am I missing something else?

Hello Faraggi! Thanks for your suggestion . I will start doing now. As I didn't have great experience in open source contribution thats why its abit difficult to me. But I will definitely try.

@roderik When a node is voted in as a validator, it immediately becomes part of the "validation pool" - so no, a restart is required.

To turn a node into a validator, >=50% of the existing validators must have “cast a vote” for the new node. A validator casts a vote by producing a block with a “Endore Node-X” in the block-header’s extra data. A block can only contain a single vote.

Thus, if you have 4 validators, at least 2 blocks must be produced before a new node becomes part of the validator-pool (i.e. 2 votes must exist on the chain). Therefore, there is always a lag between injecting your vote via the Json RPC, and a new validator joining the pool. 
So - assuming you submitted all 4 “in-votes” to all 4 validators, it would be ~10 blocks before all of the validators are part of the validation-pool.

Last piece of background - IBFT2 requires ceil(2n/3) validators to come together (aka communicate a la PBFT) to produce a block. Thus, if you’re validator pool has 8 in it, 6 of them must communicate in order for the chain to progress.
So what can go wrong? 
* The vote contained the wrong Ethereum address - thus the validator pool is now larger, but the required node is effectively not running/communicating
 * IBFT requires all validators to have at least 1 direct link to another validator, otherwise it cannot route IBFT2 packets to the other validators (it uses a gossip network).  

With all that in mind, my advice is: 
1. If you can, trace back over your chain to determine where votes were cast, and who is now in the Validator pool - are these the numbers you expected? Do they line up with the nodes you started? 2. Turn on Trace logging on all nodes, and see what other comms problems you can glean 3. Use your validator nodes as boot nodes, this guarantees Validator communications will be successful.

@trent.mohay Potentially the validator connection is an issue, my groups of 4 validators are only connected to their bootnode and to any bootnodes previously deployed. so the first set (active validators) are only connected to each other and their bootnode, the second set gets deployed and connect to each other, their bootnode and the bootnode of the first set. Looking at peers i see that the first set has 4 peers, the second set 5, the first bootnode 9, the second bootnode 5. So my two sets of 4 nodes are only connected over their bootnode.

Why does the "besu-sample-networks" code does not have a passwords line in the orion.conf file ? And then, how can we generate new nodekeys to create additional nodes to the deployment, without using a passwordFile 
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Sat, 18 Apr 2020 23:46:21 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately, unless each validator can directly connect to another validator, its effectively "orphaned" - every node in the network will know that it is a validator, however it will be unable to participate in the block creation process as it can send
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Sat, 18 Apr 2020 23:46:21 GMT):<br/>
IBFT2 has a "sidechannel" for protocol specific packets (Propose, Prepare, Commit) which are used to propose and agree upon a block. To minimise network traffic, these packets are only sent to other validators. Validators are responsible for forwarding received IBFT2 packets to other connected validators (gossip network), this means that not all validators need to be connected to all other validators - only one.
Unfortunately, unless each validator has a least 1 connection to another validator, its effectively "orphaned" - every node in the network will know that it is a validator (as this information is stored in the blockheader), however the node will be unable to participate in the block creation process - too many orphans and you halt the network.
I don't have a good answer for how to handle you k8s cluster, but, at the moment, the issue above is a hard-requirement for an IBFT2 network.

When Besu starts in UPNP mode, it tries to detect the external IP address. In my case it is failing because of a double router situation: it finds the IP after the second router. 
For this case, other P2P applications provide an option so the user can override the external IP to be announced; but I don't see such an option in Besu. 
Is the external IP important in this case? Or do other nodes just piggyback on the connection that my Besu starts?

Orion doesn't _need_ a password to be run. You can generate the pub/priv keys without a password and run it without specifying that in the config file.
I don't recommend doing this for production networks.
To generate the password-less keys, just hit enter when asking for a password when running `orion -g nodeKeys`
</p>

noted, thank you. My goal is to use the besu-sample-networks repo and modify it in order to create a couple of additional multi tenant nodes. I assume that I can just follow the tutorials on setting up a multitenant node, and I generate all the tenant keys like you indicated above, and no passwordFile ?

Hi guys, I am trying to implement an application that requires multiple parties to sign a transaction offline before sending it to the Blockchain. Does besu support multi signature transaction ?

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 17:56:09 GMT):<br/>
that would happen before besu sees the transaction. Look for ethsigner.

@atoulme Thank you. I had a look at EthSigner. But could not be sure if it provides what i am looking for. When i saied mutisignature transaction, I was referring to a transaction that is signed by multiple independent private keys belonging to different public keys.  Does EthSigner supports that or it only allows signing a transaction using multiple private keys that belong to the same public key (address)?

Hello @rohitgupta027 from what you've described, your loadbalancer provides a route from your external node (lets call this 'ext') to your validator/bootnode (lets call this 'vb'). So when you start 'ext' you specify 'vb' as the bootnode and that works
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 21:55:57 GMT):<br/>
After that, 'vb' sends a list of peers [v2, v3, v4, n1, n2.....] which 'ext' must try and connect to 
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 21:57:17 GMT):<br/>
How does your current setup route those? i.e 'ext' will see the ip addresses of [v2, v3....] but has no knowledge of how to connect to them 
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 21:58:15 GMT):<br/>
you would have to look at it, but one thing for sure, you would want the transaction to be signed prior to having it being sent to besu
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 21:59:13 GMT):<br/>
Hence the suggestion of the vpn in the k8s issue, where 'ext' knows how to route to 'bv' but also [v1, v2, n1 ....] basically any nodes you create in the future. Hope this helps

Hi, everyone, I have a network now,
The configuration is as follows:
PC1: validator1 ~ validator4, PC2: node, PC3: node.

Now, I want to convert PC2 node to validator through ibft voting.
I did use `ibft_proposeValidatorVote` on validator1 ~ validator4,
And using `ibft_getValidatorsByBlockNumber` to query, I have seen PC2 node's validator address.
But, when I check the log of validator1 ~ validator4, the PC2 node does not rotate blocks
The message is as follows:
`pool-10-thread-1 | INFO | MessageValidator | Invalid Proposal message, block did not pass validation.`
I'm sure all four of my validators have voted.
Am I missing something?

Hello @joshuafernandes It does help to understand why it is not working. Based on what you mentioned above can you recommend any solution, the ones which I see are below
1. If I expose all the peers [v2,v3,v4,n1,n2....] IP to public ip then 'ext' knows how to connect to public IP
2. Right now k8n limitation is that you cannot expose a service with mix-protocol - UDP & TCP in our case. Thats why I have enabled the loadbalancer to UDP port where peer discovery is working but for listening TCP still not working.  Not sure if you have experienced something similar.
3. For private permission network, is k8n not an ideal candidate as VPN to k8n is not an ideal solution.

Not sure if thats a good idea but we can have a short call/Skype as well.

Hello @rohitgupta027 @arunog I think you've got a couple of options based on what you're trying to do:
1. on k8s this could work but you will likely need an ingress for each node and the nodes use public interfaces - I think nginx does one that does tcp & udp? You get all the k8s benefits of management, storage via PVC's, design patterns etc  but you've got this little bit more of management to do

1. on k8s this could work but you will likely need an ingress for each node and the nodes use public interfaces - I think nginx does one that does tcp & udp? You get all the k8s benefits of management, storage via PVC's, design patterns etc  but you've got this little bit more of management to do
2. run independant nodes also on public interfaces 

You cant get around the fact that 'ext' still needs to talk to [vb, v1,v2,....n] and if they're all private nothing will work. So the way forward is to make them all public and apply permissioning to them

Hello @arunog, haven't seen your message so apologise for that - the ingresses can be modified to suit your needs. ie you can add/change ports as required . The repo has examples only intended for users to customise to their needs. For discovery you need 30303 TCP & UDP. The initial p2p phase of discovery and finding peers is done via UDP, connecting to them for syncing is done via TCP. As with this problem to get nodes exposed to the public you have to expose both and probably require the same approach of an ingress per node - am not sure what your requirements are per say though so cant say for sure

Hello @joshuafernandes  Thanks for you message. The point I am trying to press here is that there is no issue of exposing TCP and UDP on loadbalancer (ngnix) but k8n doesn't allow to create service for mix protocol. As you mentioned to @arunog  as well that UDP is used for peer discovery and then TCP is used for syncing. 

Also there is no command line arguments for besu to point TCP and UDP on different ports/IP. As per enode specification `enode://<key>@Ip:Port?discport=udpPort` besu doesn't allow to add discport on bootnodes command line.

Nodes cannot exposed to public for both ports because of the limitation of k8n not allow mix protocol.

Nodes cannot exposed to public for both ports because of the limitation of k8n not allow mix protocol.

@rohitgupta027 Are you trying to setup and IBFT of Clique network?

Also 

>  I have expose the UDP service from cluster but currently TCP and UDP is not supported by kubernetes

This is nit quite right. K8s does support TCP and UDP. You can do wither with a NodePort service or even Ingress itself.

Also can you share the instructions you followed to setup the network? Are you sure your genesis file is correct e.g. have you made sure that things like `extraData` are set properly
</p>
<p><strong>rohitgupta027</strong> (Wed, 22 Apr 2020 12:00:58 GMT):<br/>
@ppoliani I am trying to setup IBFT network. Yes I am using the same genesis file to connect 'ext' with 'cluster nodes'. `extra data` is specified as mentioned in besu documentations.

k8n github open issue link (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75831), also I have with me Microsoft support team as well they also mentioned that creating loadbalancer with TCP & UDP is not an issue but k8n will not let create a service.

Setup instruction:
1. Install `besu-kubernetes` on Azure with 4 validators and 1 node service 
2. Create nginx ingress controller for 1 bootnode(validator1)  UDP port (as combined with TCP gives error that cannot create mix protocol)
3. Create another nginx ingress for TCP port (validator1)
4. From my local machine start besu node with the configuration similar to cluster - with that the peers discovery works with UDP as TCP is on another public IP. There is no way to specify different ip's & ports for TCP and UDP connection.
4. As
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Wed, 22 Apr 2020 12:14:52 GMT):<br/>
> Create nginx ingress controller for 1 bootnode(validator1) 

Can you share a bit more information about this. Do you mean an k8s `Ingress` object? if so what is the service it's pointing to? Is it a LoadBalancer or ClusterIP service.

Could you share the manifest files so we can have a look?

Also do the intra-cluster peers discover each other? 

Do you run a local Besu validator and if so has it been added to the list of validators for your netwrok?

Hello @joshuafernandes @ppoliani, Issue is fixed with the help of @arunog  

We only need ingress on UDP port after that we need to use `admin_addPeer` API to add external node enode address  
as a Peer.  
</p>
<p><strong>ppoliani</strong> (Wed, 22 Apr 2020 15:28:53 GMT):<br/>
yes I was assuming that as well that's why I asked if you've added the peer to the list of validators

And change addressFrom, addressTo and privKey. The error is:

I try with ganache and the trasaction works fine. Any idea?

I am thinking about running my own mainnet Besu node, to be able to run arbitrary queries, possibly modifying Besu to customize the data that is returned. 
I would have to either buy an external big fast drive for the DB (and suffer the laptop fan whine), or get some cloud VM - of which I have no experience.
Does anyone know of some guide or cost estimation?

Mainnet ETH for online VMs will cost you about $50/m+
A 1TB SSD for a laptop is about $150- not sure if external is fast enough- depends on the transfer interface.

Hi, I deployed Besu on K8S (on an AWS EC2 instance) using kubectl following the instructions mentioned here: https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-kubernetes/tree/master/kubectl/ibft2.
Now, the issue I am facing is that in case the EC2 volume is shut down (NOT terminated) & restarted, all information about previously deployed contracts, including the data stored in the smart contracts, etc. is lost. Given that AWS (or any server for that matter) has its downtimes, how should I tackle this issue when going into production?

<p><strong>niliakis</strong> (Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:06:21 GMT):<br/>
As far I know events and logs aren't implemented for now in private transactions , then why in the eventEmitter example inside the getPrivateTransactionReceipt function it is trying to read result.logs[0].data)?

1.4.4 was cut this week.

Thanks @atoulme for the info. What would you say is the latest stable release given that 1.4.4 is not yet stable ? Can't find this info 
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:46:44 GMT):<br/>
it's undergoing testing right now.

<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Sun, 26 Apr 2020 09:32:00 GMT):<br/>
The most likely cause is that the transactions had a very large gas limit.  A transaction can only be included in a block if it's gas *limit* plus the sum of gas *used* for transactions already in the block is less than the block gas limit.  The comparison is done before the transaction is ever executed so the transaction may be excluded because of a large gas limit even if it would only have used a small amount of gas when it runs.

```final RawTransaction rtx = RawTransaction.createTransaction(
                txCount,
                BigInteger.ZERO,

                contractAddress,
                encoded
        );``` I will try reduce the gaslimit.

What issues are you seeing when adding nodes from another cluster - I would have thought that the process would be the same more and you'd have to use the right endpoint ip of the joining node?

:mega: We just released a new version of Besu, 1.4.4 :mega: 

1.4.4 includes logs and filters for private contracts, EIP-2315, Splunk logging integration, and optional native library encryption.

We've disabled `eth/65` support by default and performed additional testing on 1.4.4 to ensure the issues with 1.4.3 are no longer occurring.

Changes and known issues are listed in the Changelong - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

Hello everyone! I would like to test a project using Private Transactions on a public network (Rinkeby for example, or Ropsten). I started a full node (VM on GCP, Docker image version 1.4) but the sync is very long and I can't enable FastSync or Pruning (because of Private Transactions). Is there a dump (for use with `besu import` for example) available somewhere that would allow me to speed up the sync?
</p>

Also for your information, I published a plugin for the Alethio Lite block explorer that supports a Hyperledger Besu node with authentication enabled on JSON-RPC endpoints.  This plugin manages the authentication on the web3 provider from the block explorer. See https://github.com/adetante/explorer-besu-plugin

Hey guys, new to Besu here and I have 4 questions. It says Besu is a client for an Ethereum network. 
1. Is it just like Mist? 
2. Do I have to be running an Ethereum network for Besu to connect to?
3. Does Besu create an Ethereum network from within?
4. In the architecture page on the wiki, There are many components, does Besu englobe them all or just Dapp/Wallet item?

hello Peter, not sure what the intent of the contribution is. I think it might be best to have this out of the repository into your own.

I also see a couple of efforts on this type of configuration:

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 01 May 2020 01:55:46 GMT):<br/>
@atoulme Thanks for the reply! I'm happy to host it in my own repository, but I will also need to publish it on DockerHub. Is this okay with the Besu team? I just want to make sure there's no issues with it afterwards if I go down that route.

<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Fri, 01 May 2020 03:16:41 GMT):<br/>
Hi @antoinedz unfortunately not. Using the import function you would still need to process the blocks, so speed gain wouldnt been too dramatic. Hopefully if you running this on a testnet though the sync should be faster compared to Mainnet.
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Fri, 01 May 2020 03:25:10 GMT):<br/>
Hi @lepar . I will try and answer your questions:
1. No. Mist communicated with an ethereum client such as go-ethereum (geth). You can use Mist to communicate with Besu intead of go-ethereum.
2. Besu allows you to connect to an ethereum network.
3. You can use Besu to join an existing ethereum network such as mainnet, or establish your own private ethereum network.
4. All the components listed are what make up Besu. A Dapp/Wallet connects to Besu as its ethereum client to connect to the network.
Please refer to the besu documentation for extensive information on various concepts: https://besu.hyperledger.org/
</p>
<p><strong>lepar</strong> (Sat, 02 May 2020 18:27:39 GMT):<br/>
@arash009 Hey man, thanks for the reply. 
I'm still a little confused but some things we cleared. 
So a Dapp/Wallet connects to Besu. 
Something that I'm still confused. Besu can create an Ethereum network OR connect it to an existing one, is that i?

Hello there! A question on privacy group: as far as I understand, once created no further participants can be added. Right? So basically, it is not possible to let another party join later and sync the the existing private state?

Should Install truffle and clone the project repository inside minikube(after minikube ssh) to deploy the contract?

<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Mon, 04 May 2020 02:21:49 GMT):<br/>
Correct. An Ethereum client is what makes up the network. You can either start your own, or join an existing one using Besu.
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Mon, 04 May 2020 02:24:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes that is correct for all versions up to Besu v1.4. From v1.4 however, Besu supports onchain privacy groups using smart contracts. Using this new functionality you can add/remove members from an existing group. Please note that this is still early access and under further development: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups/

Hello guys! Thank u all the support! 
I have little question regarding  "multi-tenancy"
So, I ran besu network with "privacy enabled" and "multi-tenancy-enabled" with Orion node as well. Everything seems working fine and mining new blocks. So I used jwt.io to generate token with privacyPublicKey=OrionPublic. The issue is that when i call to node with Bearer Authorization through Postman, the following error is coming.
``` {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -40100,
    "message": "Unauthorized"
  }
}

Thanks for the answer @arash009 - unchain privacy groups sounds nice.. so with this feature, if I later add someone to the group, he will be able to sync all the private state of that privacy group?

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Mon, 04 May 2020 21:17:18 GMT):<br/>
@ivicaa - yes that's right.  When a new member is added to the privacy group, all previous transactions in the group are pushed to the new member and sync'd so the new member has the private state of the group. 
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Mon, 04 May 2020 22:07:52 GMT):<br/>
If one more question is allowed: how heavy- or light-weighted are such onchain/offchain privacy groups? From hyperledger fabric state channels, we know that we can run into some combinatorial explosion. Can we run with Besu into same issues? Let's say, we have a network of N=100 banks, which can potentially have a connection to each other via nostro/vostro account. Would it be feasible to mange the vostro/nostro accounts with privacy groups?
</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 03:21:50 GMT):<br/>
HI Bobur, 
There could a few reasons why you are getting an unauthorized error. If you are creating the JWT yourself then you must specify the corresponding public key to Besu using public key key file option either for rpc https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#rpc-http-authentication-jwt-public-key-file or websockets https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#rpc-ws-authentication-jwt-public-key-file.
It could also be that your permissions in the JWT aren't correct. If the permissions aren't included then it defaults not allowing any RPC access. What are JWT claims do you have in your token? You must have permissions, exp and privacyPublicKey claims in the token you create https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/APIs/Authentication/#2-create-the-jwt 
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 03:28:30 GMT):<br/>
More questions are definitely allowed :-) 

There's two variables to consider:
1. Number of members in a group (when sending a tx it must be distributed to all members of the group)
2. Number of transactions in a group (when a new member is added to a group, all existing transactions in the group are pushed to the new member)

So, 100 banks where each one has a private group with each other should be fine. 

It is probably better having 4950 privacy groups each with 2 members than having one privacy group with 100 members.  
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 05:35:03 GMT):<br/>
As far as I understand, private transactions are distributed via orion. Do orion nodes of the same privacy group need a direct point-to-point connection to each other or can private messages be relayed via other orion nodes not directly participating in the private transactions?

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:00:47 GMT):<br/>
Hi @ivicaa atm they need a point-to-point connection to each other.

We can't really have non-participants relaying the messages 'cause that would break some of the EEA requirements around privacy.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:01:31 GMT):<br/>
We could relay the msg between participants to reduce the load on the sender node (e.g. when you have a privacy group id with 100's of participans). But this is something that we haven't implemented.
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:03:14 GMT):<br/>
I see. Could the whisper protocol solve the problem of relaying? AFAIK that's the way EY baseline protocol for instance is targeting. 
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:05:31 GMT):<br/>
Maybe. We have looked at a few options, but we'd like to have more users to get a feeling of the different requirements that might show up before committing to one approach.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:06:03 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:09:00 GMT):<br/>
I was asking this, because our current PoA network in finledger for instance is not designed in a way that every bank in the network has a direct connection to every other, so it could get difficult for us to install an orion network without having to redesign our topology.
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:09:37 GMT):<br/>
I know it's a very special case, and actually the redesign of the topology is feasible, however, just wanted to collect the infos on the possibilities.

<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:10:27 GMT):<br/>
Anyway, the orion node would have to be able to work in the DMZ
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:10:59 GMT):<br/>
Interesting, we'd love if you could provide more details on that.
The Besu nodes won't need to be connected to each other, only the Orion nodes. I'm not sure if this makes any difference for you or not.

<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:27:50 GMT):<br/>
if you're interested in it... the diagram shows the current setup.. so to be able to have point to point connection the orion node would have to go to DMZ too..
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:28:39 GMT):<br/>
but it's not typical at least for us to also hold sensitive data in DMZ too.. not sure what everything orion node is storing.

</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:31:48 GMT):<br/>
I am guessing now, but I think, an orion node has to go to intranet too, but than it needs some kind of a relay component in the DMZ, to make it accesible for point to point connection from the partner banks.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:15:04 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I think the way to go could be something like putting a proxy component in the DMZ relaying requests to the Orion instance. And also relaying requests from the Orion node to other Orion nodes through the same proxy.

All Orion comms can be secured using TLS so the data should be safe in transit. And this could also benefit by using certificates to validate Orion requests from trusted parties (assuming you know before hand the Orion nodes in the network).

As for the data, Orion also supports external relational db (Postgres or Oracle). So the data can live inside your intranet, it doesn't need to be exposed.




</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:15:52 GMT):<br/>
This is a really interesting use case. If you decide to use Besu/Orion for it I'd be super keen to hear more about your progress.
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:22:32 GMT):<br/>
currently, we're in production with geth+clique. At the time that we started with the project there was no besu yet and also no professional enterprise-grade node provider.. however, with besu the gap is closing now. Good job so far!

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:26:15 GMT):<br/>
This is how I see that we could use Orion in your setup. I forgot to add the lines to represent Orion <-> Besu comm.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:26:27 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for bringing up this use case for us
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:26:45 GMT):<br/>
yep.. that's what I was also thinking of!
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:27:28 GMT):<br/>
for orion proxy.. is there something that could be used already, or would this be soem new component to be built?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:28:29 GMT):<br/>
Orion has to be highly available. In our recommended production setup we have an example of using HAProxy as a LB in front of Orion. I guess this could be used to achieve this.
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:28:34 GMT):<br/>
it's also good that we have no connections going out of DMZ to some internal database.
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:28:50 GMT):<br/>
ah ok.. so the protocol is plain https?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:29:02 GMT):<br/>
Yep
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:29:04 GMT):<br/>
https://docs.orion.pegasys.tech/en/stable/HowTo/High-Availability/
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:29:08 GMT):<br/>
in that case it should not be a problem to setup a reverse proxy
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:29:24 GMT):<br/>
Correct!
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:29:46 GMT):<br/>
and how's the besu node communicating with orion node? also https?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:29:57 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:30:30 GMT):<br/>
although, if they are both in the same "safe zone", it could be just http
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:30:32 GMT):<br/>
so.. i would have to have a connection from my api node to orion... sealer and relayer do not need it I guess
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:31:40 GMT):<br/>
Only nodes that are "members" can see the content of private txs. If your API node is the only one that needs access to the private txs than this would be enough.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:32:18 GMT):<br/>
One option would be setting up more than one node with the same Orion key, so they are all "1 participant" from the network point of view
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:32:46 GMT):<br/>
ah I see.. so it's depending on the node key
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:33:01 GMT):<br/>
Not the Ethereum node key
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:33:05 GMT):<br/>
The Orion key :D
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:33:14 GMT):<br/>
(we have too many keys in Ethereum haha)
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:33:34 GMT):<br/>
I see.. is this key held externaly to the node?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:33:35 GMT):<br/>
Participants for private txs are identified by their Orion public key
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:33:57 GMT):<br/>
The private key is owned by the Orion node
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:35:59 GMT):<br/>
there is one more point than troubling me... our api server component uses rpc/ws to access the node.. for security reasons that node holds no keys in our setup... not sure if it has to be like that with besu too.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:36:40 GMT):<br/>
wgt private txs, the API node only needs the Orion public key.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:37:29 GMT):<br/>
Whenever it needs to access a private tx, it will request it from Orion.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:37:44 GMT):<br/>
So Orion is the one that keeps the key
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:38:24 GMT):<br/>
but the node has to authenticate somehow at the orion node, right? 
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:39:27 GMT):<br/>
In most setups, only one Besu node has access to the Orion node. So there is no need for authentication. You can sort out everything with network access rules.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:40:07 GMT):<br/>
It is worth mentioning that Orion has separate endpoints for the Orion <-> Orion and for the Orion <-> Besu comms
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:40:31 GMT):<br/>
So you can apply very specific rules around what nodes can read data from Orion
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 22:42:20 GMT):<br/>
I see.. will think about this in our context.. in any case thank you very much for the discussion! It was enlightening for me.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 23:16:18 GMT):<br/>
No worries! Thanks!

Hello guys!
 I get this error in besu logs:
 ``` vertx-blocked-thread-checker | WARN  | BlockedThreadChecker | Thread Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-4,5,main]=Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-4,5,main] has been blocked for 98011 ms, time limit is 60000 ms

Could anybody provide any insight? thanks


</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 17:37:20 GMT):<br/>
do you see any more logs around this? This simply indicates a request you made against besu took longer than 60 seconds.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 17:54:46 GMT):<br/>
What RPCs were you calling?
</p>
<p><strong>niliakis</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 19:55:43 GMT):<br/>
I first encoutered this when I called a function of a private smart contract, but I still get this hours after.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 20:13:42 GMT):<br/>
@niliakis please open a bug report with as much detail as you can allow, and with a reproduction case if possible.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 20:14:08 GMT):<br/>
We might need to do a bit of instrumentation on our end to determine when threads block for a long time.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 20:14:56 GMT):<br/>
Recently I was introduced to opentelemetry.io which takes from openTracing, which allows tracing of applications. Would that be an interesting instrumentation path to look at?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:32:47 GMT):<br/>
@niliakis also we've recently published some documentation on how to capture a Java Flight Recorder dump - you might try collecting one of those and adding it to your bug report

https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Troubleshoot/Java-Flight-Recording/
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:33:25 GMT):<br/>
I've actually seen the same error myself recently, but it was due to an OutOfMemoryException that I had missed further up in the logs

Hello Team, completely new to Besu and still exploring ethereum and token concepts. 
Wanted to check if it is possible to transfer non-fungible tokens/assets (ERC721 standards may be ?) between two entities in a private transaction using Besu ?
Any reference implementations/documentation would be really helpful. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>niliakis</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 10:50:26 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the support guys! I'll try both of them and update! Could the error be because the transaction remained in the tx pool,  besu was trying to proceed it and always exeeded time limit?

Hi Team, I'm would like to generate the Account and Node Ingress contracts code to put inside my genesis instead of just copying it from the example genesis file. Is there some documentation on how to do it properly? I think I can play around with truffle for doing it but maybe you already have an script or something to solve this
</p>
<p><strong>niliakis</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 15:01:01 GMT):<br/>
I think there is an ERC20 example in the web3js-eea library
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 15:56:48 GMT):<br/>
Private transactions support the whole spectrum of Ethereum, so you can transfer anything, including ERC721 based tokens.
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 18:28:14 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the inputs. Are there any samples available which explains end-to-end process like : development of application and smart contract, running a private besu network, deploying the contract on the network and doing some private transaction between the nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 18:28:34 GMT):<br/>
these are orthogonal topics
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 18:28:56 GMT):<br/>
development of application and smart contract are probably best explained with Truffle.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 18:29:38 GMT):<br/>
Running a private besu network, probably good resources from PegaSys on that. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Examples/Private-Network-Example/

<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 18:39:03 GMT):<br/>
hanks for sharing the links. To get started on Besu, I just want to demonstrate transferring of an asset between 2 participants (participant 1 of Node 1 and participant 2 or Node 2) in a network of 3 Nodes. This asset transfer should be done in a private transaction between participant 1 and 2 so that participant 3 (of Node-3) is not able to view the transaction. 
So to achieve this, what should be the approach/tools required? I am guessing, I would be using Truffle for application development, solidity for smart contracts and a private besu network (free gas network ?) for running the 3 nodes with an appropriate consensus algorithm (may be IBFT2.0?).
Wanted to confirm if my understanding is correct ? Do I need some other tools for doing this ?

You can start with one of our sample networks. There is a specific one for private txs

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 20:42:30 GMT):<br/>
Be aware that in your example, not only node 3 won't be able to see the private tx but it won't be able to see anything related to the contract or the tokens.

From node3 point of view, the contract doesn't exist.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 20:43:14 GMT):<br/>
btw with 3 nodes, you might want to use clique consensus, ibft has a min requirement of 4, right Lucas?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 20:43:54 GMT):<br/>
I belive you can have 3 validator and it should be fine with ibft.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 20:56:14 GMT):<br/>
If you don't wanna use the genesis to have the contracts since the beggining of history, you can take this approach:
1. Start your network with permissioning off

2. Deploy your implementation of smart contract. They must implement the interfaces as specified by the EEA spec (https://entethalliance.github.io/client-spec/spec.html#sec-permissioning-smart-contract)

3. Stop Besu and update the config with the correct account and node permissioning contract addresses (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#permissions-accounts-contract-address and https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#permissions-nodes-contract-address).

4. Update the config to enable onchain permissioning for nodes and account (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#permissions-accounts-contract-enabled and https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#permissions-nodes-contract-enabled)

5. This should do the trick!

I recommend that you implement your permissioning smart contracts using a proxy approach so you are able to upgrade the contract in the future of the chain. Take a look on how we did it in the reference implementation (https://github.com/PegaSysEng/permissioning-smart-contracts/tree/master/contracts).

Let me know how it goes!
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 21:02:36 GMT):<br/>
Hello Lucas, thank you for your time. I want to have the contracts since the beggining, but I don't want to c&p the code from the sample genesis but to generate it myself
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 21:05:24 GMT):<br/>
The code in the genesis file is the compiled contract. All you need is to compile your contracts and change the code section for the contract accordingly.

Bear in mind that the storage section of the allocation is dependent on your implementation so you'll need to ensure you set it accordingly.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 21:06:18 GMT):<br/>
One way to find the "right" storage config for the contract is using Remix do deploy the contract, andwith the debug tx tool, check the final storage memory layout.

I was referring this : https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-sample-networks#basic-4-node-network-with-privacy-orion-node-sets-the-block-explorer-and-prometheus--grafana

As per my understanding, 4 validator nodes are minimum requirement to run IBFT consensus and apart from this we would need 3 Orion nodes to have private transaction between the participants. 
Is it correct ?
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 07:09:57 GMT):<br/>
Also wanted to check if we can use Truffle for dapp development as I read somewhere that it does not support EEA private transactions at the moment.  Can we use web3js-eea library as an alternate for that purpose?
@faraggi @joshuafernandes 
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 22:20:38 GMT):<br/>
Hello @HLFPOC  I'll have to check re truffle & EEA tx support. By all means please use the web3js-eea libs. As a follow on to the ./run-privacy.sh in the sample-networks repo, we've also got a tutorial using web3js here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Examples/Privacy-Example/ and a video link in the main readme of the sample networks
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Sat, 09 May 2020 17:22:51 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for sharing it @joshuafernandes . Will go through the links. Can you please validate the network configurations also? I need to simulate private transactions between 3 participants (belonging to 3 different organizations) so I am planning to run 4 validator nodes (for IBFT) and 3 Orion nodes (each for 1 entity for private txns) as part of besu network. Is it correct way of doing or am I missing something here ?

Hello @HLFPOC that should be fine. The typical use case for multiple organisations is the validators in one pool so to speak with a set of besu & orion nodes per organisation. This keeps separation of concerns clear and what a few consortiums generally follow. However there is no strict rule and each network is different so there are quite a few configs you can use based on your requirements. Hope that helps

Hi all. I've found an edge case that the FlatTraceGenerator doesn't handle. I want to put together a test case to demonstrate it before raising the issue. I'm trying to figure out how the test blocks are generated for the rpc tests so I can add an extra one to the test data export. Can someone point me in the right direction?

Hi guys, I was trying to make a deployment code that deploys a contract using its ABI, I did it easily before on testnets using web3js, or using truffle ".new()" function, Although, these ways doesn't seem to work with besu, I need to know a proper way please.

Hi, is there an option to set the coinbase address when using ibft2, other than the validator node's address?

Hi, is there an option to set the coinbase address when using ibft2, other than the validator node's address? - that is, for non zero gas priced networks
</p>
<p><strong>coenie</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 09:46:43 GMT):<br/>
Is there perhaps a design related reason for ignoring the coinbase address specified on the command line?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 09:52:45 GMT):<br/>
@coenie The coinbase header in IBFT2 and Clique got repurposed as part of the voting mechanism to add and remove validators and the standard says that the transaction fees and block rewards go to the block producer (recovered from the block signature).  There's no way to specify a different coinbase address.
</p>
<p><strong>coenie</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 10:19:57 GMT):<br/>
okay thanks for that!
</p>
<p><strong>coenie</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 10:30:13 GMT):<br/>
@ajsutton might it be possible to use the EXTRA_VANITY space inside the extraData to include an address to which the fees should go?
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 10:42:26 GMT):<br/>
It would be possible to shove more stuff into the extra data field but it would be a consensus affecting change - the rewards going to a different account would change the state root so all clients would have to support the change. At that point, you could pretty much put the value anywhere you like.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 10:43:07 GMT):<br/>
So basically, it's possible to modify IBFT2 and Clique to support custom beneficiaries, but that's not how they work today so you'd basically be creating an IBFT3 or Clique2.
</p>
<p><strong>coenie</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 11:01:30 GMT):<br/>
okay thanks for that.
</p>
<p><strong>coenie</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 11:02:11 GMT):<br/>
On a separate, but related node, can validators use something like ethsigner (or an HSM) instead of needing key files?

</p>
<p><strong>coenie</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 11:07:14 GMT):<br/>
So to send the fees to an address, is it not simply the first (or special) transaction? or that only with ethash? If not, does every node need to get the address from the signature of the block and give that address the fees?

Hi All. I have a naive question, but I hope I can get some clarity here. When I propose a new Validator to my IBFT2.0 validator pool, i can do this by sending a proposeNewValidator RPC call. What I'm struggling to understand is are the security measures. anyone can send the `curl` call...
</p>
<p><strong>krzyhoo</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 13:13:13 GMT):<br/>
I've been trying to find some more infos on that in the docs, but it is very sparse
</p>
<p><strong>krzyhoo</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 13:13:45 GMT):<br/>
I'd love to better understand this process. The voting is not so intuitive to me....
</p>
<p><strong>bmg</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 13:17:08 GMT):<br/>
There's a few ways you can lock down the rpc:: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/APIs/Authentication/
</p>
<p><strong>krzyhoo</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 13:18:38 GMT):<br/>
OK, clear on that, but does it mean that to vote, I need to send rpc calls to each node acting as validator?
</p>
<p><strong>krzyhoo</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 13:18:47 GMT):<br/>
I'm not clear on this one
</p>
<p><strong>krzyhoo</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 13:20:17 GMT):<br/>
so assumung I have 4 validators running in my test environment on the same machine: `192.168.88.10:8545`, `192.168.88.10:8546`, `192.168.88.10:8547`, `192.168.88.10:8548`, do I need to send an RPC call to each of those endpoints?
</p>
<p><strong>bmg</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 13:20:47 GMT):<br/>
As I understand it a majority is required before a new validator is approved, so yes, you need to propose the new validator within a given number of blocks (epoch) on all the validators.

<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 22:02:57 GMT):<br/>
Hi @krzyhoo, I'll take a look at the code (its been a while) - but I think the short answer is that a vote exist until the next epoch, not just until it has been actioned. Given the way voting works - voting for a node to be "out", even if they are already "out" doesn't have an affect on the system.
</p>
<p><strong>EdJoJob</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 00:31:06 GMT):<br/>
In addition the RPC for the validators may be on a firewalled network segment that only appropriately authenticated users would be able to access, as opposed to the P2P interface that the other nodes need access to
</p>
<p><strong>krzyhoo</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 10:53:49 GMT):<br/>
But that would mean that validators can't serve as endpoints for Metamask, for example, @trent.mohay 
</p>
<p><strong>krzyhoo</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 10:54:25 GMT):<br/>
unless this is exactly the desired good practice one should follow

Hi, we're having issues removing validators from our Besu network.

We have one party in the network running one validator and two edge nodes. When party two joins the network, also with one validator and two edge nodes, we call `ibft_proposeValidatorVote` (with parameter true) on the first validator node, which successfully makes the new node an actual validator.

However, when party two wants to leave the network and we do the exact reverse, things seem to go wrong.
We call `ibft_proposeValidatorVote` (with paramater false this time) on the first validator, but as soon as the nodes of party two go offline, the network seems to stop mining. 

Not sure what's happening here, or if we're missing a step in the process? Please let me know if you need more info.
</p>
<p><strong>whatasillyworld</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 13:09:14 GMT):<br/>
Could it be because the nodes are removed before the next block was mined in which they are no longer validators?
</p>
<p><strong>abdelhamidbakhta</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 15:46:46 GMT):<br/>

Hi. all. I've question.

"https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups/" 

 >> Onchain privacy groups are not supported with multi-tenancy.

Is it because the function has not been developed yet? Or is it not possible to develop in the future because the concept is different?
</p>
<p><strong>pinges</strong> (Fri, 15 May 2020 05:39:34 GMT):<br/>
Hi Benjamin, Onchain privacy groups are a new feature that is not production ready yet. One of the limitations of this new feature is that it is not supported with multi-tenancy. The work to support onchain privacy with multi-tenancy is in our backlog.

<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Fri, 15 May 2020 06:18:29 GMT):<br/>
Hey @whatasillyworld, When voting a validator in/out, you need to have >50% voting in the same direction - thus, in a validator-pool of 2, you must get both nodes to vote one validator out (yes, you can vote yourself out).
This may not be ideal - however, for a production system to be byzantine fault tolerant, you need at least 4 validators; so we're dealing with a bit of a corner case here.
Sorry if it's caused heart-ache, and praying it hasn't cost you too much time.
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Fri, 15 May 2020 06:24:22 GMT):<br/>
Hey @krzyhoo, _personally_ I'd probably not expose my validator RPC port to the world. I would suggest you may be able to use the Besu RPC permissioning (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/APIs/Authentication/) to only allow access to the IBFT RPC API group to a select set of logins ... however, I haven't used Metamask <-> PermissionedBesu, so can't comment as to how/if that may operate.

It's a configuration option that can be specified in the genesis file.  Default is 24k.  Changing it makes the contract incompatible with mainnet, but if private chains are your only target that would be fine.  https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/config/src/main/resources/dev.json#L12

Hello everyone, I have checked orion documentation and found interesting high availability configuration. Lets assume I configure two orion nodes, in such scenario. Is it possible to use the same orion private keys in both orion nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 21 May 2020 23:22:58 GMT):<br/>
Hi @eum602 ! You are correct. You should configure both nodes with the same key. I'll check that our documentation makes this clear.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 21 May 2020 23:23:38 GMT):<br/>
And they should both advertise the load balancer address (not their internal addresses)
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Thu, 21 May 2020 23:24:04 GMT):<br/>
excellent @lucassaldanha , thats great!!, I makes orion much more suitable for production.

If there's specific questions you'd like answered that aren't answered in the documentation (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/) or are answered, but you couldn't easily find the answer, we'd love to here what they are. 

It's so far been a deliberate choice to update the docs in response to questions rather than create a FAQ but we can reassess that decision.

Hello, I am facing something strange, I am sycing a node, all was working well but now some errors are appearing. The info logs show it gets stuck at some block. Debug logs shows the following: 2020-05-24T03:40:00.717+0000 DEBUG Timed out while waiting for response from peer 0x3632c7f222fcb4af11...

This looks to be during a sync, and it looks like some number of the peers don't have the header or body you are requesting to download.  It retries only 5 times to prevent us from hammering a peer that doesn't have it.  Eventually it tries again after a longer timeout and usually asks another peer for the data.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 04:40:54 GMT):<br/>
Yes @shemnon , I am trying to sync, the node was working well, but I decided to re sync again and the error appeared; I have other nodes in the network which are working well. 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 04:41:40 GMT):<br/>
If the response doesn't come fast enough we also treat it like it is missing.  It looks like things recovered w/in 2 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 04:45:45 GMT):<br/>
Currently the node is stuck, any suggest how can I deal with this issue?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 04:47:40 GMT):<br/>
Is it always the same peer?  
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 04:48:37 GMT):<br/>
yes, it is the first case in the network.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 04:48:37 GMT):<br/>
yes, this is the first case in the network.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 04:49:34 GMT):<br/>
hmm... I don't think we have a way to block a peer.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 04:50:51 GMT):<br/>
This is very strange the node was sycing from block 0 and suddently it happened.

This is very strange the node was sycing from block 0 and suddenly it happened.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 04:53:50 GMT):<br/>
actually we do have a CLI - `--banned-node-ids` - add the node ID and it will not be allowed to connect.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 05:00:00 GMT):<br/>
Sorry @shemnon maybe I am not communnicating well my problem. I don't want to ban a node. What I am facing is a strange issue;  I have a new node in my network which needs to get in sync with my network.  I currently my network have 11 million blocks; for some reason during sycing process the node cannot continue sycing at it is sstuck at aproximately block number 9 million ~ .
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 05:00:35 GMT):<br/>
If it's the same node failing to help you sync you ban the node on your end until you are synced.  Then you un-ban it.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 05:06:09 GMT):<br/>
It's curious that none of the other nodes have 9704623.  If they won't share that header then you can't full sync.
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 05:06:45 GMT):<br/>
let me check on other nodes
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 05:08:15 GMT):<br/>
If I query on other nodes I can find that block.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 24 May 2020 05:09:23 GMT):<br/>
It's not a situation i've seen.  Not sure I can do a decent job supporting this by chat.

For the moment we use ethereumj to unit test our smart contract using org.ethereum.util.blockchain.StandaloneBlockchain.
Since ethereumj is EOL, we are looking for an alternative. Does Besu has something similar?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 25 May 2020 16:05:10 GMT):<br/>
Web3J uses Besu under the covers to do smart contract debugging and their embedded evm - https://docs.web3j.io/embedded_ethereum/ - That may be what you need.

None of IBFT1/2, EThash, and Clique have support for suppressing block production.  I believe that Aura has support, but that is not currently on our roadmap.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 25 May 2020 16:09:08 GMT):<br/>
We do have tree pruning as an option, https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Pruning/ - but prior to 1.4.5 there was a bug in duplicate contract storage.  We are waiting for longer burn-in tests before we mark that bug as resolved.

<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Mon, 25 May 2020 16:17:04 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon I could avoid the issue by totally copying another node's database into the node with issues. Then I restarted and now it is working. I know it is not the best approach but maybe it could help someone else.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 25 May 2020 16:18:01 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that is also good practice for keeping a node backup.

Hello, please can someone tell me how can I avoid private database migration?, I am upgrading to 1.4.x but now a database migration seems to be a must. I tried to make the migration process  but it didn't succeed; now I would like to know if there is a way to avoid that process even when it could imply losing my private transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 25 May 2020 23:09:58 GMT):<br/>
Hi! On a previous thread, we have asked your for some more info to help chase this migration issue.

Another alternative is deleting the node database before upgrading, and after the upgrade letting the node synchronise with the network again.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 25 May 2020 23:11:21 GMT):<br/>
If you want help with the migration, please send us the logs and versions that you are using so we can try to understand why migration isn't working for you.

thanks @lucassaldanha @madelinemurray  ,  I followed both approaches:
Let me recreate the environment:
* Orion 1.4.0 ; Besu 1.3.3
* Orion using the built-in database.

Steps:
First approach:
* I updated from orion 1.4.0 ==> 1.5.2
*                besu 1.3.3 ==> 1.4.4
* restarted the nodes indicating --privacy-enable-database-migration
* The process started and after ~24 hours the node self restarted again and repeating all the process again.
* I decided to abort that approach.

I didn't delete nothing. I don know why this apporach didn't succeed.

Thanks.  We're looking into this and the logs will be helpful. 

To avoid the migration, you can resync.  Resyncing is the option Lucas suggested above:

If you're upgrading from 1.3.3 and need your private transaction execution data, it will be necessary to resync:

Hi @mikiasda . There is curretly no support for something like this. Its something we are currently investigating to see if there are acceptable ways to approach this problem to create blocks only when required in an IBFT2.0 network. Can you share more about the particular usecase that is being problematic with the empty block generation?

Hi everyone, is there any way to implement timers that triggers transactions with BESU (ex : to trigger a funds transfer at a specific date) ? Or are we obliged to manage this off-chain ? Thanks a lot :)

<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 26 May 2020 15:33:05 GMT):<br/>
The trick is to get the pulse that will fire off the event.  There is no mechanism currently to do that without processing a transaction.  So the closest you could do is a smart contract that has logic where it stops the contract unless the blockchain timestamp is greater than the desired time, and fire TXes at it after that time.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 26 May 2020 15:34:50 GMT):<br/>
The risk is that the timestamp can drift and the time may not be accurate, there is no requirement that blocks get a NTP signed packet or anything like that.  Although they are mostly accurate as clients tend not to propagate blocks too far in the future.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 26 May 2020 15:35:13 GMT):<br/>
The second risk is that if blocks are too full getting that trigger tx executed may be delayed or expensive.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 26 May 2020 15:36:16 GMT):<br/>
If you are talking about a trigger hours or days or more away and being off by minutes to an hour late for the actual execution is acceptable then it can be done.

so we have a proof of concept for Keccak256 mining on Besu on a private network here: https://github.com/whiteblock/besu/commit/c431e613fa200c2b0cfe8505995a59b5a4dfd6dd
</p>
<p><strong>Yazanator</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 00:02:51 GMT):<br/>
based on this branch, what is needed in order for us to submit a PR for it to Hyperledger Besu?
</p>
<p><strong>Yazanator</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 00:02:59 GMT):<br/>
to test the mining, here's a container https://github.com/whiteblock/keccak-besu-testnet/
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 00:46:57 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 00:48:09 GMT):<br/>
As long as it is a feature that can be ignored by chains that don't care the real question is how well do the unit and acceptance tests exercise what is present.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 00:48:26 GMT):<br/>
And as long as it "feels like" the other features.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 00:49:11 GMT):<br/>
There may be other PRs worth following up with, but those depend on ecosystem support.  Namely stratum support and a native keccak library for CPU mining.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 00:49:22 GMT):<br/>
But that also depends on how far this goes with ETC.

thanks @shemnon i missed this. I was wondering if there was any PR that are a good reference for unit tests we can model on mining on Besu. That way we can apply any of the unit tests of Besu for Keccak256 mining. It's a feature that can be ignored by chains. Currently it's only to run in a private network while still being there.

I'm not familiar with Stratum, are there any links you can refer me to? For native library for keccak for cpu mining, i can look at any differences between both implementations.

Currently there's no plan for it being adopted in ETC as it's an ECIP in the draft stage, which is why we preferred to build a proof of concept on a private network to look at keccak256 mining more. I wanted to move it from Proof of Concept and contribute it back to Hyperledger Besu since I felt it was an important feature that the client can benefit from for all EVM networks.

hi @oussamachaabouni Besu doesn't support accounts management on purpose for security reasons. You can't make it sign your transaction.
As explained in https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Account-Management/ you will need to either sign the transaction yourself, or use a library like Web3.js to do it or send your transaction data to a signing proxy.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 05:06:53 GMT):<br/>
Hi! Using web3js sendTransaction method won't work because it depends on having access to a wallet that will do the tx signing on your behalf. You have two options:
1. Use web3js sendSignedTransaction method (https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-eth.html#sendsignedtransaction)
2. Use EthSigner to sign your transactions (then you can configure your we3js provider to EthSigner) - https://docs.ethsigner.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Tutorials/Start-EthSigner/
</p>
<p><strong>illuzzig</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:29:53 GMT):<br/>
you can find an example of smart contract interaction here https://github.com/illuzzig/besu-box/blob/master/client_script/signTransaction.js
</p>
<p><strong>illuzzig</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:31:07 GMT):<br/>
it was quite difficult to follow the doc. And I only use web3 to sign raw transaction (not ethsigner)

yeah thank for this work that help ... actually i have a question , my contract methods have 5 parameters,  so my question is that how can define in them in your example ?
</p>
<p><strong>illuzzig</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 13:29:49 GMT):<br/>
```
const from = address[0];
const to = address[1]
const amount = 10;
const rawTrans = await getContract().methods.sendCoin(to, amount);

const first_param = 15 //uint in solidity
const to = 'receiver'

```
</p>
<p><strong>illuzzig</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 13:29:49 GMT):<br/>
```
const from = address[0];
const to = address[1]
const amount = 10;
const rawTrans = await getContract().methods.sendCoin(to, amount);
```
</p>
<p><strong>illuzzig</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 13:29:49 GMT):<br/>
```
// transfer.js file
const from = address[0];
const to = address[1]
const amount = 10;
const rawTrans = await getContract().methods.sendCoin(to, amount);

```
</p>
<p><strong>illuzzig</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 13:31:38 GMT):<br/>
you can create another file in the client_script folder and call your method like sendCoin in my example
</p>
<p><strong>illuzzig</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 13:31:38 GMT):<br/>
you can create another file in the client_script folder and call your method like sendCoin in my example. sendCoin has 2 params (address - js string - and amount - int value)
</p>
<p><strong>illuzzig</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 13:36:30 GMT):<br/>
finally you need to call sendSignTransaction method, which accept rawtrans, from, to and amount. I pass 'to' and 'amount' only for web service request logging..

        await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(from, "pending")
      ),
    },
    privateKeys[0]
  );

```
</p>
<p><strong>illuzzig</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 13:39:09 GMT):<br/>
```
// and cal this method. you can find this in the service of my rest api

Hi guys! I have a question regarding Besu/Orion that I hope this is the right place to ask. Does each tenant (in multi-tenancy) and Orion node get a different Ethereum/Besu address or they all use the same? thanks a lot!
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 00:32:27 GMT):<br/>
Hi,

The identity for a member isn't defined by an Ethereum address. It is defined by the Orion public key. When you send a private transaction, you don't use the account to define what nodes should receive the tx, you use the Orion public key.

In the same way that on the public world state, every single Ethereum account exists, think about each privacy group as a complete independent instance of the world state, in each one of these instances, all Ethereum account exists (but they don't share anything with the other instances of the world state).
</p>
<p><strong>kuronosec</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 06:51:40 GMT):<br/>
Cool thanks :) Now, do the tenants of a Besu/Orion operator use the same Orion public key for private transactions? Or they can different ones?

:besu: *Release Information* :besu: 

As most of you know, the 1.5 release of Besu is just around the corner, so I wanted to reiterate the release schedule we have planned:

- *June 17 (AMER)/ 18 (AUS): Besu 1.5 RC*
- *July 14 (AMER) /15 (AUS): Besu 1.5 Release*

We'll have a 4 week RC cycle to allow for ample testing, bug fixes and complete mainnet fast syncs.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 07 Jun 2020 04:11:11 GMT):<br/>
Just to clarify. Is your question about using prunning with private transactions or in a private network (e.g. a consortium)?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 07 Jun 2020 04:12:03 GMT):<br/>
I'd recommend using web3j https://github.com/web3j/web3j
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 07 Jun 2020 04:13:04 GMT):<br/>
Each tenant should have their own Orion public key.

https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#priv_findprivacygroup
But using the privacy group id to find the group instead of the participants?
Otherwise, is there some way to know the participants a privacy group has knowing the group ID?
Thanks!

Hi,
The peer discovery service uses UDP protocol as mentioned here https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-kubernetes/blob/master/helmfile/ibft2/charts/besu-node/templates/node-service.yaml
We use ambassador in BAF (blockchain automation framework) for proxy which doesn't support UDP protocol. Is there a support for TCP protocol for the same or any other alternatives?

I'm still having trouble connecting nodes in two k8s clusters. I've only managed to connect them using a Docker node created on another VM as a bridge. I attached image explaining the diagram. `https://github.com/arunog/besu-kubernetes/blob/master/kubectl/ibft2-test/Multi-cluster.jpg`

I forked repo, and I created a new kubectl Ibft2 path `https://github.com/arunog/besu-kubernetes/tree/master/kubectl/ibft2-test` There are detailed all steps to reproduce it, and include all config files.

Both K8s clusters are AKS, and the nodes are exposed through Loadbalancers services. I'm using hyperledger/besu:latest image.
Another important point is that when the network starts, an error appears starting KubernetesNatManager:

I'm still having trouble connecting nodes in two k8s clusters. I've only managed to connect them using a Docker node created on another VM as a bridge. I attached image explaining the diagram. `https://github.com/arunog/besu-kubernetes/blob/master/kubectl/ibft2-test/Multi-cluster.jpg`

I forked repo, and I created a new kubectl Ibft2 path `https://github.com/arunog/besu-kubernetes/tree/master/kubectl/ibft2-test` There are detailed all steps to reproduce it, and include all config files.

Both K8s clusters are AKS, and the nodes are exposed through Loadbalancers services. I'm using hyperledger/besu:latest image.
Another important point is that when the network starts, an error appears starting KubernetesNatManager:

Hi @joshuafernandes @ppoliani , I'm still having trouble connecting nodes in two k8s clusters. I've only managed to connect them using a Docker node created on another VM as a bridge. I attached image explaining the diagram. `https://github.com/arunog/besu-kubernetes/blob/master/kubectl/ibft2-test/Multi-cluster.jpg`

I forked repo, and I created a new kubectl Ibft2 path `https://github.com/arunog/besu-kubernetes/tree/master/kubectl/ibft2-test` There are detailed all steps to reproduce it, and include all config files.

Both K8s clusters are AKS, and the nodes are exposed through Loadbalancers services. I'm using `hyperledger/besu:latest` image and `nat-method="KUBERNETES"`
Another important point is that when the network starts, an error appears starting KubernetesNatManager:
```

Hello @arunog From your diagram they are all on seperate VNets? And the docker one connects fine to the Bootnode? Its just the second cluster that isnt joining?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 22:32:39 GMT):<br/>
@matkt is our expert on the Nat manager - any idea whats happening here?
</p>
<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 22:39:23 GMT):<br/>
it's necessary to give permissions to besu so that it can retrieve the list of services via the Kubernetes API https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/
</p>
<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 22:39:41 GMT):<br/>
A simple solution is to call this command.

kubectl create clusterrolebinding myapp-view-binding --clusterrole=admin --serviceaccount=default:default

But this command should only be used in DEV and not in production. In production we need a finer management of permissions using Kubernetes Role-based access control

</p>
<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 22:45:06 GMT):<br/>
this will allow you to retrieve the IP/Port automatically via the Kubernetes API.  If the automatic detection fails this goes into none mode and Besu will take the default IP / Port or the one passed via the CLI (p2p-host, ..)
</p>
<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 22:55:47 GMT):<br/>
Besu will try to find a loadbalancer in order to retrieve the IP
</p>

Hi! Thanks for bringing our attention to this. It would be really helpful if you could run the same tests for 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 to help us pinpoint what exact version introduced this change.

In the meantime, I'll ask the team if they have a clue on what might be causing this.

Hi every one, we are having an issue getting all the events emitted by a Solidity Smart Contract, in a private chain which currently have 11856000 blocks. 
Our node works with Besu v1.3.6 

The problem is that the response time is too long, when we filter fromBlock: “0x0”. I dont know if there is any solution to this or something we can configure on our node.

We try to get these events with the help of web3js (v1.2.1) in a similar way to this:

let contract = web3.eth.Contract(myContract.abi, this.myContractAddressr)
contract.events.myEvent({ fromBlock: 0 }, callback);
https://github.com/TribalyteTechnologies/quorum-websockets-example/blob/master/eventListener.js

This works fine for us to get the events emitted after the subscription, but the previous events (from the block 0) are not listed. On others networks (Quorum, ganache) we get the performance expected, where all the previous events are listed.

We also try to get the expected response from inside the node with:

curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"method":"eth_getLogs","params":[{"fromBlock":"0x0","topics":["0x187688f6f8bbd0d48b66ed106a5d61d42f9b889d36a5bfe0ecdd056b139ebd8b"],"address":"0x92c1cce3d02fce1b813824f77046d597980285e3"}]}' localhost:4545

But we dont even get a response, with later versions of besu (v1.4.4) we get the expected result after 30 MINUTES.

Similar issues have been reported, the pegasys team raised a ticket and studied it. We want to know if it possible to reduce the response time.
Ticke and investigation: 
ticket: https://pegasys1.atlassian.net/browse/PAN-3219
issue: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-64
</p>
<p><strong>rdemera</strong> (Tue, 09 Jun 2020 13:44:46 GMT):<br/>
I think that this might be Related with the previous issue, when we wake like 20 subscriptions to events, all of them from block 0. Our node seems to freeze, it is still syncing , none of the logs show any error or something weird but if we we try to access to any of our contracts we don't get response.
We also try to test it with:
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_peerCount","params":[],"id":1}' localhost:4545
but the result is the same: no response
</p>
<p><strong>rdemera</strong> (Tue, 09 Jun 2020 13:57:37 GMT):<br/>
The node continues to synchronize blocks, but the rpc and websocket part does not allow any more connections.
</p>
<p><strong>abdelhamidbakhta</strong> (Tue, 09 Jun 2020 14:13:38 GMT):<br/>
@rdemera Can upgrade to at least 1.4.0 ? We introduced automatic logs blooms caching in https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/1.4.0-RC2. The cli option is --auto-logs-bloom-indexing-enabled which defaults to true

Hi @matkt @joshuafernandes, I've finally managed to connect the nodes in different k8s clusters. Just like you said, it's been necessary to create a service account with a cluster role with permissions to connect to the api. After this, several issues have emerged:
- It only works if service name contains "Besu"
- If there are several services in the same namespace and their name contains "Besu", choose one of them and it isn't always the correct one.
- If the external IP of the service is not assigned when starts the KubernetesNatManager, that is, it's still being created, the nat manager is disabled.

Is there any solution for these issues?? Thanks!!

A temporary solution would be to have only one service containing "Besu". I will quickly add a PR to allow configuring the name of the loadbalancer service

We are creating part of validator set in one the public permissioned network which is using Parity PoA Aura consensus at the moment. But now Parity is rebranded to Open Ethereum so we want to diversify the blockchain client among Validators. One of the potential client is Nethermind Besu so thought to check with community before I recommend Besu to them. Will open github issues. Thanks

I have two docker containers running besu in the same Linux.
One is a bootnode and the other is a regular node, running IBFT2 in the shared genesis file.
I have tried to run those 2 containers using the docker option --network host, but they are not syncing. What is the problem?
</p>
<p><strong>josenogueiradalmeida</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 17:23:57 GMT):<br/>
(i have also tried the option --bootnodes with <enode>@127.0.0.1, @localhost, @172.17.0.1 and 172.18.0.1

Are you passing you boonode enode address as CLI option to the second node ? See https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#bootnodes

Although they do not sync, the bootnode somehow notice other notice when they come up. The log message "No sync target, waiting for peers: " increments its number in the bootnode as soon as one node comes, but they do not import blocks.

I don't believe this is down to the network configuration, but more likely how your interacting with the deployed contracts. if your using web3j and a contract wrapper with the default tx manager, then you'll be waiting as the default polling interval is set for mainet (15 seconds). Take a look at web3J transaction managers, and transaction receipt processors (https://web3j.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smart_contracts.html?highlight=transaction%20managers#transaction-managers)

Another issue: When running in    In truffle develop BC or ganache BC, when we test and generate errors, the error message is properly returned . With Besu it is a generic not-enough gas error message.  even though we are running private Besu. @DannoFerrin or @magooster  what could be the problem.

How external nodes join in internal private besu network?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 12:27:01 GMT):<br/>
I think it depends on how you setup your private network. If you are following the tutorial on our docs (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-Private-Network/), to add a new node all you need to do is:
1. Ensure that the new node is using the same genesis file as the other nodes
2. Add at least one of the current nodes in your private network as a bootnode of the new node.

<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 23:46:47 GMT):<br/>
@rohitgupta027 the adminPeer APIs in Besu allow you to request Besu to create a connection to another node (and maintain it until restart). To add/remove validators in an IBFT or Clique network you'll need to use the ibft_proposeValidatorVote or Clique_propose API respectively.

@VipinB I used to be the maintainer of Ganache. The way Ganache works by default is that it runs the transaction immediately when it is submitted, and if the transaction didn't complete successfully (e.g. due to a `REVERT`), instead of returning a transaction hash and having your code fetch a receipt, Ganache just returns the error directly.

This was done to help people debug their smart contract logic, but real clients can't do this, because they have to wait to process the transaction until it has been mined into a block.

If you're running with `ganache-cli` there is a flag to make it behave more like a real client w.r.t. error handling. See the `--noVMErrorsOnRPCResponse` flag here: https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli

<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Mon, 15 Jun 2020 23:53:25 GMT):<br/>
There's also a setting for it in the Ganache UI, but I'm struggling to recall exactly where it was. It's been more than a year since I've looked at it closely

Regarding IBFT 2.0 performance, later versions of Besu make use of some native libraries to speed up common crypto operations. Unfortunately 1.4.2 didn't have that feature yet. I'd try again with 1.4.6.

@trent.mohay that's true I have used adminPeer API to connect external node with my besu cluster. But I have had this issue that external node connection breaks after pod restarts(its stateful) so you are suggesting to first use adminPeer API to make connection and use ibft_proposeValidatorVote(in my case) to make external node as validator

<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 16:56:10 GMT):<br/>
Hi We have just implemented a new experimental CLI option which allows you to change the name of the loadbalancer we want to use. For example you can call Besu with `--Xnat-kube-pod-name = besu-load-balancer` or you can add the environment variable in your besu deployment script. `BESU_XNAT_KUBE_POD_NAME:" besu-load-balancer "`. This functionality will be available in the next 1.5.0-RC but it is already available in the master if you want to test it.

@benjamincburns Thanks. The Transaction will be rejected by the smart contract due to an error. This error has to be bubbled back up to the client when running in besu. The actual solidity code in Besu is:

I think Besu has a facility for including revert strings in transaction receipts. that string that you've got in your `require` call is a revert string.

Does this mean that when it is not enabled, it will throw a generic out of gas error
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:28:49 GMT):<br/>
This is all a limitation of the ethereum protocol, though. It was the intent of the people who designed it that the primary output mechansim for any transaction to be a log/event... The transaction receipt was only intended to be metadata about the transaction. The revert string was explicitly not included in the design proposal because there was concern around it being used as a DoS attack vector. Because of this, I don't know if web3.js or web3j will handle that extra field.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:29:46 GMT):<br/>
revert-reason-enabled gobbles up significant amount of memory- Ok then we need to put out a log/event indicating failure then.

We will try with revert-reason-enabled since otherwise it will be asynchronous log/events sprayed all over the place. We took the require() pattern from openzeppelin

Besu can syncornize with the Etehreum Mainnet, Classic, and associated test nets.  It supports EThash PoW consensus, IBFT and IBFT2 consensus, and Clique consensus.  Burrow only supports Tendermint PoS consensus and has been used as a chaincode provider for Fabric and Sawtooth, relying on those DLTs for consensus.

Hi Everyone, I have some questions.

1) Can we create/run a new Ethereum network using Besu (production level) which would support private transactions also
2) Can we use private transactions functionality even when Besu is connected to the Mainnet of Ethereum

Hello all. Could someone clarify me please: I'm deploying a smart contract with Besu, in a private network, and I obtain the transaction hash. How can I obtain the contract address from the transaction hash?  When I call web3Eea.eth.getTransaction I obtain many fields indicating addresses (e.g., input, r,s,v, hash), but none of them correspond to the created contract. In particular, when I try to connect to the deployed smart contract, via web3.eth.Contract(jsonInterface, address),  the "povided address is invalid, the capitalization checksum test failed, or its an indrect IBAN address which can't be converted."

Try the `eth_getTransactionReceipt` method - https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#eth_gettransactionreceipt - the `contractAddress` field in the result should be what you are looking for - https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Objects/#transaction-receipt-object

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 14:51:23 GMT):<br/>
If the transaction successfully deployed a contract that field would not be null.  Could the contract creation have failed?  (out of gas?)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 14:58:26 GMT):<br/>
for ordinariy CREATE the address is the hash of the senders address and nonce, you could calculate it from those fields - https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/46960/46788

</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 19:10:00 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon Thanks for your help. greatly appreciated. I think I know what happens: eth_getTransactionReceipt returns the contractAddress as anull, because it is the Privacy marker transaction. I got the contractAddress from the private transaction, which you get through  priv_getTransactionReceipt
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 19:11:41 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense, knowing it was a private contract was the piece I missed.

@benjamincburns we ran with revert-reason-enabled on all nodes, when we looked at web3j implementation, we see generic gas error being thrown if receipt.status==0. No further error status is available in receipt. Also we tried another technique which is use the ethcall object after the failure.
</p>

Try getting a trace of the transaction - https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#trace_transaction
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 03:49:51 GMT):<br/>
Revert reasons are only recorded if the smart contract itself provides a revert reason.  If it is some other exceptional halt, such as out of gas, no revert reason is recorded.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 03:50:56 GMT):<br/>
The trace call has the same json structure as parity's trace call.
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 03:53:29 GMT):<br/>
Since it has the same structure as Parity's trace call, I think it will work with the Truffle debugger as well. That should let you step through the transaction in VS Code to see what it's behavior is
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 12:09:11 GMT):<br/>
Since the eThaler smart contract code produces the revert reason, it should be available. We will look at your suggestions. @shemnon @benjamincburns
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 12:09:11 GMT):<br/>
Since the eThaler smart contract code produces the revert reason, it should be available.  The main idea is how to get it to display at the user interface for the user who initiated the transaction, so that they can take corrective action. For example : 
		require( ( isPaused( tokenId ) == false ), "eThaler: Token is paused. Transfer is not permitted" );

We will look at trace. There are no problems getting error messages to display with Truffle/Ganache.   @shemnon @benjamincburns @magooster

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 12:09:11 GMT):<br/>

		require( ( isPaused( tokenId ) == false ), "eThaler: Token is paused. Transfer is not permitted" );
We need to be able to tell the user who initiated the transfer that it will not go through as the token is paused. It is not a debug situation. 

Is the pattern: do all checks before it hits the solidity code?

Still there can be revert reasons other than running out of gas. We need to be able to tell the user at the front end these reasons. Which is the rule of good UI design, instead of throwing and showing a fake reason like running out of gas (which is the behavior of the web3j interface at the moment).

There are no problems getting error messages to display with Trufflle.   @shemnon @benjamincburns @magooster

<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 18:05:12 GMT):<br/>
I understand your frustrations, @VipinB. Solidity and the EVM weren't really designed for this sort of exception-like error handling. Revert reasons were added quite late in their development, and since the two major mainnet clients don't expose them directly, I think the usual pattern is to add checks in client code for conditions that are known to cause a revert. Sadly this doesn't guarantee that you won't see a revert, as these conditions can change before you submit the transaction, but in the case when a revert occurs you can always check the state of the contract for that specific block to figure out why, and then display an error.

All of that said, you should be able to get this working with Besu without needing to do what I just described. Hopefully if you can get @shemnon a minimal code sample he can help sort it out.

Hello,

I setup my application as mentioned below:

- setup Besu POA network
- deploy a contract with few events triggered when its method is invoked
- smart contract is deployed using open zeppelin to make it upgradable
- configure and connect eventeum (https://github.com/ConsenSys/eventeum) to receive capture events triggered by the smart contract

Actual behaviour:

	* _Eventeum does not receive the smart contract events_

Expected behaviour:
	* _Eventeum should have received smart contract events from the besu node and processed it successfully._


*Additional note:*
The setup mentioned above works as expected when besu is replaced with ganache.  I did not check it with geth or other Ethereum client but I'm hoping the behaviour would be as expected.

I am deploying a default Besu node on a private network with the arguments: --min-gas-price=0. I deploy a contract, that has several variables in the storage, with predefined values. I obtain the newly contract address from the private transaction receipt. But when I am querying the storage with ``web3.eth.getStorageAt``, I obtain 0x0 for every index. Any hint of what's going on?

Hello,

In Hyperledger Besu, is it possible to send private transactions to public Smart Contracts in order to do a delegate call to private contract? For example, consider following scenario:

- In a network there is a *public Smart Contract A deployed*, which has a _forward_ method that do a _delegateCall_ to any address (given in args). 
- In the same network, there is also a *private Smart Contract B deployed*, which has a method _doSomething_.
- If a Dapp sends a private transaction to execute _forward_ function of SC A, passing as a parameter the address of contract B, would then the contract A do a delegateCall to contract B succesfully (only in the nodes listed in privateFor)?

Thank you very much in advance

hello guys, 
I followed this  https://github.com/raedbensaid/besu-kubernetes/tree/develop/kubectl/ibft2  and i have 2 problems : 
1-  besu nodes are statefulsets but without pvc and when i try to add the creation of  pvc in node-statefulset.yaml it doesn't work! 
2-   when using  <besu_NODE_SERVICE_HOST>:8545   i need to use statefulset name and not the ip adress of the pod because the ip can change! and it didn't work : i used  statefulset-name.service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local ( in this case it will be node-0.besu-node.besu.svc.cluster.local : 8545
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 06:27:35 GMT):<br/>
Hello @raedbensaid Can you share more info re your setup (local, cloud etc), how you are attempting to connect to the rpc service?
1. You'd have to share config re PVCs, I have used them without any trouble. Did you create a PV and then a PVC to use in each statefulset? 
2. Whats the error that you get connecting to the node service? To connect to the nodes from the outside it should go through a service which does have a constant IP and can have any number of pods behind it - effectively this is what we do when connecting to a DApp
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 09:00:46 GMT):<br/>
From our testing mainnet appears to be fine on 4 cores, the other public networks on 2 cores. Private networks we tend to test with 2 cores as well - though each private network varies with load and requirements. We'd recommend putting in monitoring and adjusting as required. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Get-Started/System-Requirements-Public/  and https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Monitor/Metrics/ have more details

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sat, 27 Jun 2020 10:20:43 GMT):<br/>
Hello @raedbensaid , re PVC's that is correct - the examples in there are generic and cloud agnostic - the use of PVC's are recommended but it is up to the user to pick the type. eg: in AWS you'd have to pick EBS or EFS as the PV and then the PVCs will work. On the main readme see the section titled 'data volumes'. Depending on cloud the user has to pick one from https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sat, 27 Jun 2020 10:24:25 GMT):<br/>
Is the connection to the node being made from outside the cluster or within? Other nodes will resolve it dircetly - i.e node -> node. If a Dapp/user is connecting to the network you should use the besu-node service and not directly connect to the statefulset.  The services maintain constant IP's not the pods. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/connect-applications-service/   For example, refer to the way bootnodes are specified
</p>

@magooster  forgot to tell you that changing the config for the polling frequency did help the response. It is much faster now.

hi @adovale - access between private and public states is described in the docs here - https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Groups/#access-between-states 

Public contracts cannot access private contracts.  So SC A cannot access SC B. 

Have you got a specific use case driving this approach?

Hi @madelinemurray , thank you for your answer and for the resource. I was thinking about maintainability of a use case. Consider the following scenario:

- In a network, there is 3 nodes, A,B,C.
- There is a private smart contract deployed, which contains the logic of a specific use case.
- A, B, C nodes send private tx to this contract, setting the privateFor to one or two of the other nodes. The important thing is that *the privateFor is NOT always the same*.(for example, A sends private tx with the privateFor listing only B, even that C has the contract deployed too).

If someday i want to add a new 4th node D, this node does not have the private contract deployed. So, if i want node D to interact with the other nodes trough this contract (send private tx to SC and set privateFor with any of the other nodes), i would have to redeploy it, update Dapps in nodes  A, B and C to use the new contract, for those to use the same SC as the new member.

I was thinking about deploying the contract in a privacy group and then adding new member to this. But this approach has to handicaps:

1. AFAIK, In a privacy group, all members share the private state. I only want them to share the contract business logic, and to send tx between them using the same contract interface, but the actual data processed in the contract can only be accessed to a subset of the privacy group, and in an ad hoc manner.
2. The privacy groups seem like a very new feature and i am not quite sure about its support and maintainability.

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 04:58:08 GMT):<br/>
1. If I'm understanding your use-case correctly, the same contract (ie, business logic) can be deployed in more than one privacy group.  The same contract business logic is available in each privacy group but the data is only available in the privacy group in which it was created/updated. 

eg, The example in the web3js-eea library shows deploying a contract to a privacy group:  https://github.com/PegaSysEng/web3js-eea/blob/master/example/onChainPrivacy/deployContractExample.js

`2. Flexible privacy groups (ie, privacy groups where you can add and remove members) have been available in Besu since 1.4.1 - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/1.4.1 

We have performance testing for privacy groups on our 1.6 roadmap - once this is completed we will finalise the interfaces and remove the early access tag.  

If you have specific requirements or questions around support, let us know.

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 11:17:08 GMT):<br/>
Hello @raedbensaid The process to deploy a contract to a node on k8s isnt much different to that of a node on a vm or the like. Could you give us more information on what the error is, logs etc? Could you confirm that the contract deploys on a local network (one of the examples in the sample-networks repo?) We've got a permissions example in there that deploys contracts and a DApp for reference. Basically you need  an account that you connect to the chain and use truffle for example to deploy to an RPC endpoint - this would again be the besu-node ClusterIp service endpoint from your endpoint.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 11:20:47 GMT):<br/>
The connection should work fine from inside there - pretty much anything in your VPC should be routable to that service IP. I've got a cluster up in Azure, if I get the chance tomorrow I'll deploy Besu there and a second VM and share screenshots of how I connect from VM to the RPC service

I have a n00b question.  What is the intended use of multi-tenancy?  Is it designed for SaaS providers to provide privacy for their customers (and allows the operator to do this at scale), or is it more designed for a single organization to provide their users (the tenants) with their own privacy groups?  I know that operators can see all data within all the tenants, so would that rule it out of being used as part of a SaaS offering?

When I send over many transactions back to back( using 1.4.2), few of them do not get mined at times. They tend to timeout after 120 seconds. I have a block period of 5 seconds. How do I work around this? I am not able to trace the transaction in the logs either. Any FAQs for debugging could help.

When I send over many transactions back to back( using 1.4.3), few of them do not get mined at times. They tend to timeout after 120 seconds. I have a block period of 5 seconds. How do I work around this? I am not able to trace the transaction in the logs either. Any FAQs for debugging could help.

When I tried the same on 1.4.6, I hit a bad request exception(400).

<p><strong>rranjan3</strong> (Sat, 04 Jul 2020 12:11:40 GMT):<br/>
This was probably happening because of same nonce in the transaction. I generate transactions from multiple places using the same key. I need to orchestrate this.

The main use is to reduce what is called "cost of ownership" (or something like that). Basically, the "classic" model in which each entity or participant run their own node has a drawback in terms of the cost. With multi-tenancy, you can leverage some of these costs. Of course not every use-case works well with multi-tenancy as it requires all tenants to trust infrastructure provider.

I am having some trouble on connecting two different machines in local network on my docker besu chain.
If I connect two containers on the same machine setting de bootnode addres with docker internal ip address it works fine.
But when I run an container in other machine and set my local ip on bootnode config on this new node the nodes doesn't communicate with each other and I keep receiveing "no sync target 0 peers currently connected" message on my docker logs. If I make a curl to my bootnode peer on the other machine node to the besu API like net_version for example I get the right result.
Am I missing some config or there is a way of I debug this connection to investigate the reason of not establishing the connection?

Hi! Support for private transactions on public networks is in early-access. If you get the latest versions of Besu and Orion you can try it out!
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 08 Jul 2020 01:39:29 GMT):<br/>
And you are correct, it only works between Besu nodes. :)

I think where to start depends on what you are planning to learn/work on.
In the way that I see it, Ethereum development has kinda 3 parts: Protocol, Infrstructure and Smart Contracts/Dapps.

1. Protocol is where you'll see all client (nodes) development, implementing the rules that all nodes in the network follow, etc. For example, Besu is an Ethereum client implementation.

2. The infrstructure is where all the deployment stuff is. Including the network topology and other related topics.

3. Smart Contract/Dapp Is the "use-case" side of Ethereum, where you will implement the business logic to do something that you need. This is where you'll see people talking about Solidity and Truffle, and Web3js, Remix, etc.

Usually, people start their journey on the Smart Contract/Dapp development side. I'd recommend that you check out Truffle project, they have got a bunch of tools and things that can help you (https://www.trufflesuite.com/)

Another good place to practice implementing smart contracts is Remix, an online IDE that runs a "mock" blockchain taht you can interact with (http://remix.ethereum.org/)
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 08 Jul 2020 21:17:35 GMT):<br/>
Of course, you can always run your own Besu node locally for development if you need to.  Check out this link for more info on how to spin up a small network (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-Private-Network/)

<p><strong>krzyhoo</strong> (Mon, 13 Jul 2020 15:03:47 GMT):<br/>
I was womndering if you have a quick answer for me.

When I query the number of peers using RPC, it yields 3, as below

```curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_peerCount","params":[],"id":53}' http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8545
{
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "id" : 53,
  "result" : "0x3"
}%```

But `journalctl` (I have configured Besu nodes as services) yields 5 peers for NON-BOOTNODES (I have 4 nodes, 2 bootnodes):

```Jul 13 15:03:12 ip-172-31-32-92.eu-central-1.compute.internal sh[35195]: 2020-07-13 15:03:12.024+00:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-0 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #1,726 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x39cd54e5ece4084dbee7b7ca97d243462090eb14102891293af109ba3bd564fc) in 0.000s. Peers: 5```

Any idea why?

I suppose that the public world state and the private world state are separated in different column families into Rocksdb database. is this true ?

In that case, Would it be possible to delete a private world state without affecting the public world state ?

Hello everyone, please I would like some help from you. Currently I have a set of orion nodes which are working using tls, I see an unexpected behavior in one of those nodes (Lets say Node-A) when sending the simple hello world mesage between orion nodes. Sometimes sending the message returns te encrypted payload response correctly, and sometimes returns the message {"error":"NodePushingToPeer"}. The problem is happening specifically in one orion node (Node-A) . Other nodes can send messages without issues; even sending messages to the Node-A. Please what would be some reasons for of this issue? thanks in advance!

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 18 Jul 2020 21:16:01 GMT):<br/>
Goerli is a fairly difficult network to find peers.  It is essential that remote peers are able to connect to your node rather than your node connecting to the remote peers.  

What flags are you using for remote access?  At a minimum you need to set `--p2p-host` to the external address of the EC2 box.  You also will want to reserve an address or reset this value whenever you restart the box as EC2 tends to not have sticky IP addresses unless explicitly reserved.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 18 Jul 2020 21:19:57 GMT):<br/>
Functionally no, there is no EVM or consensus impact.  However it will have an impact in EIP2124 calculations, which impact peering, if the chain does not start on a post-dao hard fork (such as `petersburgBlock` or `istanbulBlock` being explicitly set to zero)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 18 Jul 2020 21:21:13 GMT):<br/>
for a new private chain starting with `"istanbulBlock":0` will make this issue moot.

@lucassaldanha ^
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 22:47:57 GMT):<br/>
Besu doesn't have a similar permissioning model out of the box. However, our permissioning model follows the EEA spec, that defines an interface for node and account permissioning, allowing anyone to bring their own smart contracts to manage the nodes and accounts.

This is our reference implementation (https://github.com/PegaSysEng/permissioning-smart-contracts). You'll notice that the permissioning model that we have implemented here is quite simple (based on admin accounts).

However, by implementing your own version of these contracts, you could achieve the same model as Quorum.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 22:56:18 GMT):<br/>
Should be sorted now, this was becuase the data dir was mounted as a volume as the root user and in v1.5 of Besu we set a `besu` user
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 22:56:40 GMT):<br/>

Hi, I'm trying to setup a besu node in a private subnet on AWS. However, now besu refuses to start with the error msg "valid advertisement host required" What does that mean? Is it related to the peer discovery on port 30303? Or is that something else?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 27 Jul 2020 21:27:17 GMT):<br/>
Hi Chris! Could you provide the CLI option or config file that you are using so we can better help you?

More specifically, this message is related to the network interface that the node will use to listen for P2P conenctions (`--p2p-interface`). But without knowing the options that you are using I can't figure out what is wrong.

Here is the reference to the docs: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#p2p-interface
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 27 Jul 2020 21:28:10 GMT):<br/>
From a quick investigation on the code, this msg could mean that you have specified the --p2p-interface property with an invalid value.
</p>
<p><strong>chrisdotn</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 05:05:25 GMT):<br/>
Hi Lucas, thanks for the pointer, that solved it. Indeed my p2p-interface wasn't setup properly. I'm using the ansible role for starting and it tried to get the public IP of the node and set it. Of course, because I move to the private subnet, that didn't work anymore. Now, that's working as expected

Hi,
I am setting up a besu network with IBFT and orion for production, can you point the guide to generate `eth_accounts` to be kept in `alloc` section of my production network `ibftConfigFile.json`, Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>lakshyakumar</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 10:07:47 GMT):<br/>
can we use geth to generate the `eth_account`?

I set up the besu-quickstart subscription in Azure public cloud. I need to figure out how to generate accounts on an ubuntu VM, and how to run an ERC 20 smart contract in the environment. Right now I am unable to generate accounts. I cannot use metamask for this. someone plz advise

A quick question regarding the new onchain privacy groups
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups/

Can any (non participating node/user) discover every privacy group or can each node/user only find the privacy groups where they are a member?

Besu does not support account management directly. You will need to use an external service to create and manage accounts. Please refer to: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Account-Management/
</p>
<p><strong>YoussefAlaa</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 17:23:16 GMT):<br/>
Hello,  can i have a mobile application running a node for hyperledger-besu?, just for submitting transactions I do not need to be a mining node, any advices would be useful.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 17:59:16 GMT):<br/>
I am unaware of anyone who has set up a Besu node on a mobile device.  Block storage looks to be a critical issue.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 18:00:38 GMT):<br/>
Look into web3j.io - You don't need a full node to send and receive transactions.  with web3j you can create the TX on-device and use an external node (or service such as infura or bloq) to send the transacitons.
</p>
<p><strong>YoussefAlaa</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 18:20:21 GMT):<br/>
my usecase need to apply decentralization on mobile devices so I need them to be actual nodes, so are there any alternatives to besu which can achieve that?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 21:32:50 GMT):<br/>
Only the members of a privacy group are aware of its existence.

The smart contract that manages the privacy group lives inside the privacy group itself, so others don't have access to it.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 21:35:53 GMT):<br/>
For security reaosons, Besu doesn't provide key management. So you need to sign your transactions externally, using a wallet or EthSigner.

- https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Account-Management/
- https://docs.ethsigner.pegasys.tech/en/latest/
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Thu, 06 Aug 2020 06:13:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes there are. I recommend looking into some of the light ethereum clients specifically designed for mobile devices.

Hi Besu Experts, Please help me answer below questions?how to define Besu network's PKI? what's the certificate hierarchy, what's the trust chains leading to transaction signatories, what cryptographic mechanisms does Besu use for certification, digital signatures, and encryption?
</p>
<p><strong>Anjali9088</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 10:31:25 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone, Is there any restrictions in besu for contract size,amount of gas,number of transactions..etc?
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 18:41:26 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Anjali9088 :smile: I don't believe there are any on private networks. It will all be dependent on your block size, which you can set to be arbitrarily large. See this for an example: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/FreeGas/#1-set-the-block-size

On public networks, the limitations are set by the protocol and not Besu. The current block gas limit on mainnet is roughly 12.5 million gas and blocks happen every 13 seconds or so.
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Sun, 09 Aug 2020 20:44:28 GMT):<br/>
@YashShukla - not sure if you found the answers to these back when you asked but: 
1) Yes :-) 
2) Private transaction on PoW or Clique networks is currently an early access feature - https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Overview/#reorg-compatible-privacy
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 00:29:32 GMT):<br/>
Hi @poojagupta23 Besu supports standard Ethereum cryptography for transaction signature and validation. These can be extended further through use of permissioning to create restrictions in a private networks as required: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Permissioning/Permissioning-Overview/

Besu also supports TLS encryption for added security between network applications: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/TLS/

<p><strong>poojagupta23</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 06:38:52 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for responding. I have another question for clarification. When a transaction is received by a besu node in a permissioned network, it firstly goes through the ingress contract, then the account/node rule contract and finally through the application contract? or is it first received by the application contract which then sends it through the ingress contract?
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 06:57:53 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the current implementation of the permissioning smart contracts use a static ingress contract that does not change to then call out to specific node/account contracts that can be changed over time. These contracts then respond to specific methods to Besu that determines if a transaction or connection is allowed or not. You can refer to the EEA specification here for more information: https://entethalliance.github.io/client-spec/spec.html#sec-permissioning-smart-contract

Hi, so recently ive been creating a web app using besu clique consensua. Everything seems fine until when i try to connect  a host to the node remotely via rcp http, it wont let me connect and i am using metamask. I have set the rpc http host with my node's ip machine, is there any step i mightve missed?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:04:14 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps the host allowlist? `--host-allowlist="*"` - by default we only let in localhost and 127.0.0.1.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:04:26 GMT):<br/>
note that prior to 1.5.1 this was `--host-whitelist`
</p>
<p><strong>monafinfiquaro</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 22:49:38 GMT):<br/>
Thanks shemnon for the responds, unfortunately i also had that configured. The thing is, when i use the ip's machine on --rpc-http-host i cant connect from 127.0 0.1 on metamask and can only connect via the ip's machine ip on the node's but from outside it wont let me connect. If any helps, i use --permissions-nodes-config-file and --config-file when running the node.
</p>

Thank you shemnon for the responds, i am currently using besu version 1.4.0 and i cannot use the new host allowlist command. Does that mean the latest use of the besu is required?

</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 23:26:40 GMT):<br/>
If you are on 1.4.0 the command will be `--host-allowlist`. Use the `--help` command to get you the correct options that can be used.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 23:36:24 GMT):<br/>
The command for 1.4.0 is `--host-whitelist` - Also, the performance of 1.5.0 is vastly improved.
</p>
<p><strong>monafinfiquaro</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 23:37:02 GMT):<br/>
Thanks arash009, in besu 1.4.0 i use --host-whitelist and i still cant connect from remote connection. However i am trying on 1.5.0 and it allows me the use of --host-allowlist and --host-whitelist but it still wont accept connection outside local
</p>
<p><strong>monafinfiquaro</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 23:53:47 GMT):<br/>
--host-whitelist
</p>
<p><strong>monafinfiquaro</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 23:57:25 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible that by default, my port got blocked (i checked netstat -an the port 8545 is listening on 0.0.0.0 ) or there is some configuration before i can connect from remote in besu?
</p>
<p><strong>monafinfiquaro</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 23:57:25 GMT):<br/>
So a little update, i can connect with the same subnetwork but when i use different network (mobile hotspot) it wont connect to the node so i am not sure if besu requires any configuration for this

Does your network have a firewall?   If it's a residential network try `--nat-method=upnp` - which will ask the residential router to open up an external port.  The address will be different and based on your residential router's WAN interface.

Hi, Had a query related to migration of Besu/Orion combo from (1.2.5/1.4.0) to (1.5.0/1.6.0), when there are no private transactions. Was looking at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Critical+Issue+for+Privacy+Users which says there shouldn't be any issues if there are no private transaction. But besu nodes fails to startup after the upgrade and runs into org.rocksdb.RocksDBException: You have to open all column families. Column families not opened: �, �, �, �, �

Could you confirm the Besu and Orion versions that you are migrating from/to?

Also, if you could share the whole startup logs it can help us trace this problem.

</p>
<p><strong>bmg</strong> (Tue, 18 Aug 2020 08:18:37 GMT):<br/>
0 om means 0 ommers. Ommers is another term for uncles, this indicates there are no uncle blocks associated with the newly mined block.
</p>
<p><strong>bmg</strong> (Tue, 18 Aug 2020 08:20:22 GMT):<br/>
The pool and thread numbers indicate the thread being used to execute with and the thread pool to which it's associated. This is an internal implementation detail that isn't really that important
</p>
<p><strong>bmg</strong> (Tue, 18 Aug 2020 08:21:17 GMT):<br/>
The gas measurement indicates the amount of gas used by all the transactions within a block. I'm not sure what the % indicates though.

I want to send transation through web3.js and I use the besu-sample-networks. I use `curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1}' localhost:8545` to get the chainid is 0x7e2.
Then I use web3.js to get the data 'const Web3 = require('web3')
const web3 = new Web3('http://127.0.0.1:8545')
var Tx = require('ethereumjs-tx').Transaction
web3.eth.getBalance('0x627306090abaB3A6e1400e9345bC60c78a8BEf57', (err, wei) => { balance = web3.utils.fromWei(wei, 'ether')})

https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-kubernetes/tree/master/kubectl/ibft2-with-privacy

and in both the orion services are attached to besu nodes that aren't validators. Is there a reason for that? Would there be issues if I attach orion services to validating besu nodes?

<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Fri, 21 Aug 2020 01:54:39 GMT):<br/>
Hi. The general network topology recommended are that your validator nodes are seperate to your RPC nodes with user access that you submit transactions through, so the examples reflect that. However there is no reason why you cant have Orion working with a validator node instead.

you are probably hitting this: https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/middleware.html#geth-style-proof-of-authority - Where it says Geth it actually applies to all PoA consensus, Clique, IBFT, IBFT2, etc.

One question, Besu is an alternative to fabric EVM?
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:13:18 GMT):<br/>
Hi there! Thanks for the question! Because Besu is use case agnostic, you can build whatever blockchain application you want on top of Besu. A few live examples of use cases using Besu are LACChain, ZarX, Public Mint, and LiquidShare.

<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 17:18:46 GMT):<br/>
Yep, that's one of the primary use cases for Besu! Check out the documentation for it here: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-IBFT-Network/
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 17:21:04 GMT):<br/>
The Fabric EVM project relies on Burrow's modular EVM implementation, so I don't think it would be an easy project to port over to using Besu. Please reach out if its something you're interested in!

<p><strong>charyorde</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 18:22:23 GMT):<br/>
What's the easiest path to interoperability with Besu from Fabric, considering we're already vested in Fabric EVM.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 18:49:33 GMT):<br/>
One thing to look into is the EvmTool we are using for fuzz testing. It can calculate state transitions from a CLI interface.  While not directly portable to Burrow's interface I think there is room to create a stand alone EVM evaluator that can be made stateful across requests.

Hi Besu devs, I am a newbie to Besu and blockchain in general. A couple of questions/design suggestions I need your advice on:

We want to create a dapp on top of Besu with focus on privacy in the chain. Our system needs to have a UI, smart contracts that will be called from the UI, backend to generate signatures and a caching layer that caches the blockchain transactions.

Our initial version was built on top of Quorum (without privacy) and the caching layer loops through the transactions in the chain and caches it in a DB. Now we wnat to add privacy to the data in the chain.

1. Correct my understanding if I am wrong: I can call eea_sendRawTransaction to send the transaction payload and the group ID to besu, which stores it in Orion and distributes it to the orion nodes of the participants that are involved in the private transaction. 
2. For us, there are no participants or a consortium, but just different users in the system having different permissions. So for every combination of permission set I need to have, I should be creating a separate privacy group right?
3. If the above is true, I should also be deploying separate besu and orion nodes for each unique permission set I have (multiple users in our system can have the same permission set). I am ignoring multi-tenency because we need to use onchain privacy groups since group members will be modified over time
4. Now the crux: how do we make the caching system work? If the system reads the transactions in the chain, it only gets the marker transactions. So there is no way to get the private transaction from the marker? Or is there a way to read the private transactions from orion given the enclave key/private transaction hash? 
5. Another requirement is to add validations to the private transactions in the chain? Our existing solution validates it in the contract (which the UI will send the data to) and writes it to the chain if valid. But in besu privacy mode, we cannot add validations before we write to Orion. So this means we need to add the validation in the private transaction processor (I am assuming that it will be a smart contract in itself, but then I am not sure what is a precompiled contract then! Maybe we can add the validation in the precompiled contract and update the private world state only if the transaction is valid?)

Hi Besu devs, I am a newbie to Besu and blockchain in general. A couple of questions/design suggestions I need your advice on:

We want to create a dapp on top of Besu with focus on privacy in the chain. Our system needs to have a UI, smart contracts that will be called from the UI, backend to generate signatures and a caching layer that caches the blockchain transactions.

Our initial version was built on top of Quorum (without privacy) and the caching layer loops through the transactions in the chain and caches it in a DB. Now we want to add privacy to the data in the chain.

Hey so i was browsing the roadmap, https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Roadmap, which is a bit out of date.

I'm curious where the status of IBFT is right now? I saw this "Enhancing support for block rewards and transaction fees in gas-charged networks." as an upcoming feature, but wondering if it is already implemented?
</p>

Apart from the gas fee improvements IBFT is awaiting consensus from EEA as to what the next version should include.  The EEA BFT Task force hasn't released anything yet, their work is currently EEA members only access. (https://entethalliance.org/participate/working_groups/)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 29 Aug 2020 19:21:13 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is that the reward is not TX execution but block production related.  Currently miners get gas rewards but there is no block reward, and because it's BFT I don't think it's as simple as handing over a block reward to the block producer.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 29 Aug 2020 19:22:24 GMT):<br/>
There is a Besu Contributor Call on tuesday, but the contributors who focus on consensus tend to call in tot he APAC calls, which the next one is in 3 weeks.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 30 Aug 2020 22:08:53 GMT):<br/>
Hi, let me try to answer your questions :)
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 30 Aug 2020 22:20:45 GMT):<br/>
1. Correct, you specify the privacyGroupId and it will be distributed to the participant nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 30 Aug 2020 22:20:50 GMT):<br/>
2. What defines a user in your system? Besu privacy is based on the concept of participant nodes (identified by their Orion public key). So transactions are sent to a privacyGroup that represented a group of nodes that will have access to the private transaction.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 30 Aug 2020 22:20:55 GMT):<br/>
3. I'm not sure I understand this part of the question. Maybe if you share a bit more about what makes a user in your system and some use cases I might be able to help.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 30 Aug 2020 22:21:04 GMT):<br/>
4. You can read the private transaction from Orion using the payloadKey. However, you'd need to have some kind of protection layer to ensure that only participants allowed to read the transaction can call the api (maybe mapping your concept of users to Orion keys). Besu also exposes an api for reading private transactions, assuming the node is a participant (priv_getPrivateTransaction and priv_getTransactionReceipt). So your caching layer could use those apis. Just be aware that once the caching layer reads the information, it needs to ensure only the right participants have access to it.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 30 Aug 2020 22:21:15 GMT):<br/>
5. I'm not sure if I understood this part. You want to validate a private transaction based on what? If you have a smart contract that does the validation for you, you can deploy the contract in the privacy group and use the same logic. You'll need to deploy one validator contract per privacy group because there is no shared information between privacy groups.

Also, if you need some sort of global information for validation (that applies to all groups), you can have the information in a public smart contract, and your private validator contract can read that information (private contracts can read information from the public state).
</p>

Here are a few followup questions that I would be grateful if you could help:
1. Now if we have user-A with permissions to do actions 1,2 and 3 and user-B who can do actions 2,3 and 4 and there is an admin user who can do all the actions. I am clear that we need to create separate privacy groups for the two sets of permissions. Do we need to create separate besu and orion nodes for the 2 privacy groups?
2. We woud be using onchain privacy groups, so does that make a difference in the number of besu and orion nodes we need to spawn?
3. Reading the private transaction: I saw that in this besu API documentation: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#priv_getprivatetransaction, that I can only read the private transaction if I am a participant? So if I have an admin that is part of all privacy groups, I should be able to use the admin's secret key and read all the prvate transactions right?
4. Correct me if I am wrong if the workflow will work: the caching layer reads the marker transactions as the admin, get the privateTx hash and call either orion or besu to get the payload
5. On validation: there will be storage in the chain which caches the id and some metadata. This can be private. If the validator contract receives a payload with the same id, we check the metadata and accept or reject the transaction. So this means I can deploy a private contract, check the private world state and send it to orion only if valid?
6. If the above is correct, how do we call the validator contract from our system? I can see we have eea_sendrawtransaction to send the privateTx to orion, but here we have a private contract to be invoked, which has to validate and send it to orion if valid.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:01:32 GMT):<br/>
Here we go with the followup answers! :)
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:01:36 GMT):<br/>
1 and 2. Privacy groups members are identified by their Orion public key, it doesn't really matter the number of nodes in the network. Although in most use cases you might have a pair of Besu and Orion nodes per participant, it is possible to have multiple participants using the same node (with Multi-tenancy this is quite common). I remember that you mentioned that you aren't considering multi-tenancy because you want to use flexible privacy groups. However, depending on your timeline, you might be ok. We are planning to release support for multi-tenancy for flexible privacy groups in our 1.6 version (should be released in a month or so).
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:01:42 GMT):<br/>
3. Correct. This pattern is really common when there is a regulator or some entity that must have access to all the information. As long as you add the admin as part of every group created, the admin will be able to read the information from that privacy group.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:01:47 GMT):<br/>
4. Yep, this workflow is correct. You won't need to call Orion directly, I believe that prig_getPrivateTransaction will get the original private transaction from Orion for you. Once you read the PMT, you use the PMT hash to find the private transaction and the private transaction receipt from Besu.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:01:53 GMT):<br/>
5. Let me try to explaing my thinking here. There are two different concepts here. A valid transaction at the protocol level isn't the same as a valid transaction based on some business logic rules. Upon receiving a "protocol valid" private tx (e.g. correct RLP, signature, etc), the transaction will be sent to Orion. However, when the transaction is being executed, let's say you are calling a smart contract. This smart contract will do you business level validation and can fail processing the tx. This will mark the tx execution as failed. Any business level validation would need to be done via smart contracts.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:01:59 GMT):<br/>
6. Smart contracts can talk to each other. You can check solitidy docs on how to do it. Let's imagine the following scenario: a system that allow members of a privacy group to exchange tokens. You would have a private smart contract that has got the token exchange logic. A member of the group would send a tx to this contract to transfer tokens. When processing the transfer, the exchange contract can also read information from a public contract that has some business logic rules to check if the transfer is valid. This is what I think it would make business logic validation. I'm not sure if I'm being clear, let me know if it doesn't make any sense.
</p>
<p><strong>RamkumarVenkataraman</strong> (Tue, 01 Sep 2020 07:42:08 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @lucassaldanha for the help again :pray: Most of the things are clear except one small tiny bit (sorry for the newbie confusion):

It is clear now that the privateTx gets added to Orion and the smart contract validates it later during the processing phase. 

Correct me if I am wrong: In a system without privacy, we can call the smart contract from web3 and the contract does business validation. If it is all fine, then the transaction gets mined and written to the chain. If not, nothing gets written on the chain. So our caching layer reads only the valid transactions from the chain.

However, with privacy, both the privateTx and PMT get written before doing business validation. While procssing the transaction later, we can do validation in a smart contract. Now if it fails, the privateTx processing will fail but the PMT will already be there in the chain right? So when the caching layer reads the PMT and the privateTx from orion, it will not know if the business validation has failed? 

Now, how to ensure the caching layer only reads the valid privateTx? Or is there an API that given a PMT, we can find out if the smart contract execution failed?

</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 02 Sep 2020 02:22:26 GMT):<br/>
A PMT exists regardless of the status of the execution of the private tx. The goal with the PMT is to ensure all nodes will execute the Private TX at the same point. If the private tx is successful or not isn't defined by the PMT status, but by the private tx execution status.

To find out if a Private TX succeeded, you should use priv_getPrivateTransactionReceipt, passing as a parameter the hash of the PMT.

This API will retrieve the receipt of the execution of the private transaction associated with the PMT. And the receipt has got all the information re the private tx execution, including if it has failed or succeeded.

@GregTheGreek @shemnon just a clarification on this one. As per the roadmap, there has been some work done to date that includes support for block rewards to be specified when using an IBFT2 network. You can specify a reward amound and an address of where these rewards will go, however this cannot be currently adjusted once the network is up. See https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/IBFT/

Additional mechanism to support changing the reward amount and recipient are on the roadmap

Hi all,I'm looking for docker containers (or a compose file) to run some experiments locally.   I've just searched this channel to see if my question was already answered and found reference to multiple image sources. What's the canonical location for supported and properly versioned docker files in HL Besu?

Hi people. Is there a way to migrate an already existing (Parity AuRA) chain to besu and start using iBFT2 from now on? I know that besu does not support the AuRA consensus protocol but is there a way to disable validation for blocks which were created under AuRA so we could import them and then seal with iBFT2 onwards.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 16:36:44 GMT):<br/>
There is currently no way to disable block validation.  If we supported AuRa we could set a transition at a specific block to turn on IBFT.  We also currently only support some parameters at transition points.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 16:43:04 GMT):<br/>
I see two possibilities.  If the contracts don't rely on block numbers a custom transition software could be written to read the transactions from the old chain in raw form and re-post them to the IBFT chain.  You wouldn't be able to change chainID.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 16:44:10 GMT):<br/>
Assuming AuRa does all it's magic in extradata Besu code change could be to allow PoW mining at transition points and set a fixed difficulty of zero so all blocks validate.  But that is speculative and would require some code alterations inside Besu

Hi Contributors,
I follow the tutorials to set three private networks(Clique, IBFT and Ethash), I can use Metamask send transactions on Clique, however there are same errors that "rpc error with pay load{...} on IBFT and Ethash networks".
How can I use Metamask send transactions on IBFT and Ethash?

However, I can use Metamask to check the balance of account, so I think the rpc is enabled.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:22:19 GMT):<br/>
Are you changing the `extraData` for a network that is currently running?  That won't work.  You can connect to the validating nodes with a non validating node and the transactions sohuld propagate to the validators.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 15:23:55 GMT):<br/>
Is there any more data about what the rpc error is form metamask? (perhaps in some logs on the console?  Not deeply experienced with metamask so I am just guessing)  Is rpc up on those nodes?  are the correct RPC endpoints activated?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 01:26:10 GMT):<br/>
When changing the RPC provider that MetaMask is connecting to, you need to reset the account in MetaMask (this resets the account's tx nonce). I think the nonce being incorrect can cause this RPC error

No the extra`Data` is changed prior to the network setup, and I can see the list of validators using `ibft_getValidatorsByBlockNumber` api call to the member node.

Hello everyone, please guys I would like to receive some ideas what could be happening in the following issue I am facing: I have an IBFT network that is operating for many months (currennlty ~15Million blocks and Free-cost of-gas)  ultimately we are facing issues when trying to make transactions with some keys. What we have observed is the transactions are stuck in the Transaction pool. We have tested from many points (remix, nodejs and java) obtaining the same results. Can you please help me with some ideas what could be happening?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 01:06:30 GMT):<br/>
Is there a nonce gap?  Is the lowest nonce for the address in the tx pool one more than the nonce on the chain?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 01:07:45 GMT):<br/>
If it's zero gas, I assume that the next pending tx has zero gas cost and/or the account has sufficient "ether" . If the TX has a non-zero gascost it may be hard to dislodge it from the mempool.

Hello @shemnon , 
* I can confirm that I am using the latest nonce (or the pending consecutive).
* Also we do not send any ethers in the transaction.
* The transaction is validated but sometimes it takes too long to be processed or is discarded if the transaction pool reached ~600 pooled transactions.
* Also I have tested in two different nodes (with 1.4.1 and 1.5.1 version)

I observe an intermitent behavior, that is, sometimes the transaction is validated accordinlgy but sometimes the transaction gets stuck in the transaction pool for a long time (3 minutes, 7 minutes or 1 hour) thus applications throws errors because of timeout (We have configured a maximum of 80 seconds before throwing an error).

How full are the blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 18:52:04 GMT):<br/>
as a % of the gas limit
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 18:53:31 GMT):<br/>
Usually we have 60000 gas per block (at the current state) some peaks of 600 000 or 2Millions
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 18:54:03 GMT):<br/>
as a percentage it is less than 1%.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 21:41:40 GMT):<br/>
Its hard to diagnose why the validators wouldn't be putting transactions into the block.  Do you control a validator and can instrument it for debugging?  A tx pool reaching 600 and 1% block useage sounds like there are deeper problems with block production.

@shemnon thanks a lot for your support. I can confirm you that I had a gasLimit and nonce settup on each transaction in a way that transactions were stuck in the pool in favor of other lighter transactions. After setting an adequate amount of gasLimit and nonce (latest) I could send my transactions successfully.

wrong chainId means the chain id used to create the web3 provider does not match that in your genesis file (or you can also set it on the command line). From a quick look the multiNodeExamplePrivacyGroup uses chainId of 2018. (In deployContract.js you will see the line
`const web3 = new EEAClient(new Web3(besu.node1.url), 2018);`)
What command are you using to run the sample network? I've just run the example successfully with `./run-privacy.sh -c ibft2 -e`

Hi, I had a user feedback about the revert reason being only visible in log if TRACE level is activated. He argues that Ganache, used during the dev stage, shows more explicitly errors and the reason in the basic logs. Do you think of a simple way to ease the visibility of the revert reason in Besu without changing the logs to trace?

Can you clarify what you mean by move the data? Do you mean the transactions that you have executed on mainnet to a private network? You will need to re-execute those transactions on a private network that you are starting from scratch.

Hi, everyone! As I read the besu docu it is possible to define a port for RPC calls and also define authentication for all RPC calls. I would like to only limit the access to "ADMIN" and "PERM" rpcs. Either by defining a different port for both. So I can be sure that access is only locally for those RPC calls. Or by defining authentication only for those RPC calls. All other RPC calls should be available from outside by all users. Would this be possible?

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 21 Sep 2020 04:18:04 GMT):<br/>
I believe Besu does not provide a way to selectively protect different API methods. You either have all of them protected or not.

One thing that is possible is to have granular method permissions per user. So you could have a "admin" user that can access the ADMIN and PERM methods, and other users that can access other methods. The downside with this approach is that either you'll need to have a user for each one of your clients or they would need to share a specific user.

A second approach that could work would be exposing on the JSON-RPC API all the methods that you want to be publicly available, and perhaps using the WebSocket API to expose only the ADMIN and PERM methods. The JSON-RPC and the WebSocket servers have independent configurations, so you could have the latter only accepting local connections (and you can send JSON-RPC requests through WebSockets). The downside with this approach is that you'd need some kind of adapter that translates JSON-RPC calls to WebSocket calls.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 21 Sep 2020 04:19:30 GMT):<br/>
If you are running a private network, your transaction won't be visible in Etherscan.

However, if you are connecting to the Rinkeby network, you should be able to see your tx in Etherscan as soon as it is propagated to one of their nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 21 Sep 2020 04:20:41 GMT):<br/>
If you want to use some kind of block explorer to see your transactions in a private network, you can use something like this: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Examples/Private-Network-Example/#block-explorer

Hi guys

I have a question. Is there any way to obtain revertReason property when use privacy group? 

Currently,  Private transaction receipt object returned by priv_getTransactionReceipt 
does not contain revertReason property.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 21 Sep 2020 21:28:51 GMT):<br/>
Hi! If you have started your network on a different chainId, you'll need to delete the node db and start a new sync. You can't change the chainId of an existing network.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 21 Sep 2020 21:56:08 GMT):<br/>
I can't remember if we have that implemented already or not. I'll take a look at the code and get back to you on this.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 02:05:09 GMT):<br/>
Hi! I have just verified that we do include the revert reason for public and private transactions. However, only if Besu has the flag `revert-reason-enabled` set to true (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#revert-reason-enabled).
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 04:27:21 GMT):<br/>
I have delete all theen change the network id
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 04:28:01 GMT):<br/>
the issue is I can't see my transactions in rinkeby.etherscan
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 04:40:31 GMT):<br/>
But are your transactions being accepted by the node? Try enabling debug or trace log level on the node and see if you can get more details about the transactions that you are sending.
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 04:41:50 GMT):<br/>
okay, thanks. I will check it. Hopefully that will resolve my issue

It looks like the transaction is being sent with the wrong nonce. In your case I believe it is happening because Metamask has cached the nonce from when you were running your node in the other network. Try resetting the account in the advanced setting in Metamask

I think atm there isn't much I can do to help. From the logs it the txs are being sent with the wrong nonce, so they won't be distributed in the network and will never show up on etherscan.

Maybe try using a new account?

The node itself is free.  You can set up and run your own private chains (with a different consensus mechanism like clique).  However to post transactions on mainnet does require ethereum.  There are testnets (ropsten, rinkeby, goerly) where you can get free tokens.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 18:00:41 GMT):<br/>
Depends on the usecase.  For mainnet we recommend 4 cores, 16 GiB Memory, and an SSD.  For smaller chains it can run on as little as 1 core and 4GiB.  For chains other than mainnet this typically translates to a 't3.large' on AWS.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 18:00:53 GMT):<br/>
For mainnet, we recommend an i3.xlarge or larger

<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 04:35:25 GMT):<br/>
I run the node through command which is specified in the tutorial
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 04:35:34 GMT):<br/>
But this tutorial isn't about running a node on Rinkeby. To run a node on rinkeby, you'll need to change some of the config.

</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 04:36:03 GMT):<br/>
First and foremost, you'll need to start with the genesis file for Rinkeby :)
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 04:36:29 GMT):<br/>
(or just specify Rinkeby in the --network option)
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 04:36:38 GMT):<br/>
but I'm putting chainId=4 which is for rinkeby
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 04:37:08 GMT):<br/>
Can't add both genesis file as well --network sam time in command line
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 04:37:23 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, but the genesis file is what defines the "origin" of a network. If you aren't using a Rinkeby compatible genesis file, you won't be able to successfully be a part of the network
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 04:38:07 GMT):<br/>
okay, I will tried with --network instead of genesis file
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 05:16:08 GMT):<br/>
Do we still apply permissions in our network?
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 05:16:44 GMT):<br/>
By using --network=rinkeby instead of using genesis file?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 05:17:07 GMT):<br/>
Yep, as long as you set the permissioning config options
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 05:17:29 GMT):<br/>

It's not importing any block
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 05:21:19 GMT):<br/>
Probably because you have added the node permissioning option without setting a node permissioning file to specify the nodes that you want to trust.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 05:21:43 GMT):<br/>
Using permissioning in a public network can be tricky and is a quite advanced use case.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 05:22:11 GMT):<br/>
If you enable node permissioning but don't trust any nodes, it won't connect to any other nodes. Therefore, it can't receive blocks.
</p>
<p><strong>Amanullah68</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 05:23:16 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, most probably you are right. I will remove node-permissioning

for security
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 05:24:24 GMT):<br/>
Permissioning isn't really a security feature. For security I'd recommend using a firewall.

I'm just trying to create my own permissioned network so that only those account performed transactions which are white listed
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 05:39:32 GMT):<br/>
If all you need is account permissioning, you can just disable node permissioning.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 05:42:06 GMT):<br/>
but on a public network, anyone can send transactions. So even though your node won't accept transactions from accounts that aren't allowed, you will still import blocks with transaction from other accounts that have been propagated in the network.

I'm don't understand why you want to use account permissioning in a public network though. Could you clarify that for me?

> Do besu allow permissioning in public network?

Yes, Besu allow permissioning in public networks. But using permissioning in a public network is an advanced use case.

> Is Besu helpful for creating ethereum private network?

Yes, you can use Besu for creating a private network. As any other Ethereum client.

> How Besu is helpful for me in public network?

In a public network Besu will do the same as any other Ethereum client. Because this is how other clients can interop.

I have a suggestion though. It feels like you don't understand the concepts behind what you are using. Try watching some of our webinar that explain how permissioning works and maybe it will help you see if this is what you really need for your use case.

It is hard for us to help you more without having a clear view of what you want to achieve. :)

*Release notes & download link: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/1.5.5*

:star2: Highlights :star2: 
- The new version of the web3js-eea library (v0.10) supports the onchain privacy group management changes made in Besu v1.5.3
- Added debug_getBadBlocks JSON-RPC API to analyze and detect consensus flaws.
- Fixed a long-standing issue with getting logs. This will be helpful for people wanting to validate Eth2 deposit contracts off Goerli with Besu.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 22:39:51 GMT):<br/>
Not a web3.js expert, but my guess is you need to set chainId in the call to `signTransaction` - https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.4/web3-eth-accounts.html#id6

Hi what is more faster in transaction IBFT2.0 or Proof of work (ethash)?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 05:48:14 GMT):<br/>
Neither is strictly faster.  I don't recommend ethash outside cryptocurrency use.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 05:49:11 GMT):<br/>
IBFT2 has the advantage of more stable block times whereas ethash's blocks are on a poisson distribution (i.e. unpredictable).  ethash blocks will settle at around 13 seconds.  IBFT blocks can be configured for different block times.  We benchmark at 2 seconds.
</p>
<p><strong>pogchamp</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 07:03:31 GMT):<br/>
Hi what do you recommended specs for Proof of work in order to maintain the private network and the speed transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>nyshnt</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 07:08:51 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, i fixed it. Issue was with "ethereumjs-tx" for signing transaction, by default it takes main network with chainId 1. Changed chainId with "ethereumjs-common" package.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 13:45:22 GMT):<br/>
Again, I don't recommend Proof of Work for private networks.  The amount of hashpower to ensure security would rival mainnet.  

Use IBFT2 or Clique, you can keep the signing keys secure.  Also, those consensus mechanisms have options to reduce the block time whereas ethash really doesn't and will always settle on 13-15 seconds.

Hi is it possible to run private besu without miner? In document there are other consensus algorithm supported by besu in addition to POW.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 17:06:01 GMT):<br/>
Mostly yes.  The other algorithms (clique and IBFT) each require a validator instead of a miner.  Validator CPU load is much lower than miner CPU load.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 17:06:44 GMT):<br/>
Here's the docs section that goes in depth about those to algorithms: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Consensus-Protocols/Comparing-PoA/
</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 17:53:00 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good and thanks. between clique and IBFT2.0, the doc says clique does not have immediate finality and may generate forks. Does the clique algorithm converge at the end by merging to mainchain? Or it require manual merge. I did not find more detail in the doc. Other than that, clique algorithm seems more fault tolerant and easier to operate compared with IBFT2.0.
</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 18:35:58 GMT):<br/>
Also the besu doc says the private network is for testing and development purpose. Can private network also run as production permission based for business?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 18:50:56 GMT):<br/>
clique always converges to the chain with the most total difficulty.  Clique is easier at the expense of finality.  There is no manual merge for clique, the nodes figure it out automatically.

Hi people, I was researching the IBFT specification and found out that for creating of the new block 66% signatures required, but only 50% votes are enough to add/remove the validator. Which means that 50% (not 66%) of malicious validators is enough to compromise the blockchain, since they can remove non-malicious ones and reach 66% majority. Doesn't it make sense to increase the threshold for voting or am I missing something? Also I was very interested in plugins system, and thought they can be useful with automation of the aforementioned voting, but then I found out that only getter methods are implemented there. I would be happy to contribute and implement voting API for plugins, but I'm not sure that introducing setters there is not against some "conventions" of the plugging architecture. I would be thankful if somebody could shed some light on that.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 21:08:35 GMT):<br/>
i'll defer on the consensus question.  But I can talm about the plugins.  The risk is that any new API becomes a somewhat long-term support commitment.  Although admin tasks like adding/removing validators and adding/removing peers do seem reasonable.  

Because it's a LTS api I expect we will be fairly strict on the review and require it to be laser-focused.

Hi @VladLupashevskyi 
I'm one of the consensus developers, and I’ll try to answer the 50% vs 66% issue.
So, voting _could_ be changed to 66% to match block import, but I’m not sure it materially affects the security of the model.
IBFT is based on PBFT, and is designed such that a network will progress in a valid manner, provided < 1/3 of the validators operate as expected.
If more than 1/3 of the validators are compromised, no assurances can be made about the network - and all block creation _could_ cease. I.e. you’ve lost control of your network.
So, for a byzantine party to have sufficient control to vote in their own validators (i.e. > 50% validators) - the network has already failed its IBFT block creation requirement (that no more than 33% of validators are byzantine).
tl;dr: An IBFT network is only guaranteed to be valid if < 1/3 validators are byzantine - which is less than the 50% required to vote in new members.
</p>
<p><strong>VladLupashevskyi</strong> (Sat, 26 Sep 2020 12:55:42 GMT):<br/>
Hi @trent.mohay thank you very much for such a detailed answer :) Now I see that's obvious. Previously I messed up the 66% of non-malicious validators and 33% of malicious ones.

Hi Besu team,

On Orchestrate we manage private transactions using `priv_distributeRawTransaction` and `eth_sendRawTransaction` for the marking transaction. After `priv_distributeRawTransaction` has returned the `<enclave-key>`, we generate the marking transaction and we use `eth_estimateGas` to estimate the gas limit (we do not hard code the gas limit so we keep the execution of the marking transaction as close as possible to a regular public non-marking transaction and we are able adapt to upgrades of the privacy pre-compile), then we sign and send the marking transaction. 

Up to Besu `1.5.3` this flow is working perfectly fine and the marking transaction ends up being mined.  On Besu `1.5.4` & `1.5.5` we get an `Invalid params` error on `eth_estimateGas`.

Is this something I should open an issue for on Besu repo? Thanks a lot.

Below are some details:

- `eth_estimateGas` request:

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"method":"eth_estimateGas","params":[{"data":"<enclave-key>","from":"<marking-tx-sender-address>","to":"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000007e"}]}
```

- `eth_estimateGas` error response on Besu 1.5.5:

```
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 4,
    "error": {
        "code": -32602,
        "message": "Invalid params"
    }
}
```

Can you crank up the logging to debug?  That should give us the exception.

Actually, the jog4j config is what's hiding the stack trace.

Hi team! for permission based IBFT chain, what is the min number of nodes required to form a chain? Also is there React Native support of besu?  I mean integrating Besu into React Native mobile app with wallet and ability to do transaction (not include mining/validator and storage of the whole database).

As for react.js, that depends on the library you use to communicate with Besu.  I believe that web3.js is react friendly.

There have been no changes to the RPC call itself for all of 1 5.x, so some other change caused it.

Not too heavy, that depends on teh chain load.  t3.medium has worked, sometimes smaller.  2CPUs and 4GibBwould be the lower limit I think, but 8GiB is better.

Besu's permissioning behaviour is the same for public or private network. It will follow the configuration provided by the user.

Hey @coenie, when using IBFT2 with Besu, the timestamp in a block must not be more than 1 second ahead of the local node's system clock - this value is not current configurable.

Besu uses Orion as its Private Transaction Manager for the purpose of transfering the private payload. You can find more information here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Privacy/Configuring-Privacy/

GoQuorum is a seperate Go based client that has similar privacy offerings. Which to use depends on your use case and requirements.

Hi -- I'm running into a hard to figure out issue with Besu + Orion running in Kubernetes.

The setup I'm running with is 4 validators (IBFT, doubling as RPC, one as bootnode) + 4 orion nodes on AKS. On multiple deployment attempts so far, I've always had one validator node being unable to find the bootnode (and subsequently not connecting to the others). The faulty validator just gets stuck in a loop of peer searching and waiting for peers. The validator connects properly to its enclave, but any (private) transactions sent are never mined (because there's no peers connected?). Deleting the pod and having Kubernetes recreate it allows the validator to properly connect to the peers and function as expected. 

Could someone point me in the right direction to figure out why the validator never connects until the pod is recreated?

Here's an excerpt of the output that's repeatedly printed in the logs:

Hi -- I'm running into a hard to figure out issue with Besu + Orion running in Kubernetes.

The setup I'm running with is 4 validators (IBFT2, doubling as RPC, one as bootnode) + 4 orion nodes on AKS. On multiple deployment attempts so far, I've had at most one validator node being unable to find the bootnode (and subsequently not connecting to the others). The faulty validator just gets stuck in a loop of peer searching and waiting for peers. The validator connects properly to its enclave, but any (private) transactions sent are never mined (because there's no peers connected?). Deleting the pod and having Kubernetes recreate it allows the validator to properly connect to the peers and function as expected. 

Could someone point me in the right direction to figure out why sometimes on of the validators does not connect until the pod is recreated?

Here's an excerpt of the output that's repeatedly printed in the logs:

This address is what the ethereum account address of the node's private key would be. The node address is not always the coinbase address when mining.  There is a separate CLI flag for this.

Using chainId 4 means that you are trying to connect to the Rinkeby network. I believe Rinkeby uses POA Clique consensus, so you won't be able to successfully join the network with a node running IBFT.

we updated the default requesttimeoutseconds in the config from 4 to 10. this is for load testing the besu private setup. afterwards, we are getting this error : Replacement transaction underpriced. Any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 16:52:32 GMT):<br/>
You are sending a transaction with the same nonce, and it is already waiting in the memory pool.  Does this network use Ether or is it zero cost?  If it is not zero cost simply increas your gas cost by 10% and it will have priority over th eold transaction.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 16:53:46 GMT):<br/>
An alternative is that you are preparing a new transaction with an incomplete view of the memory pool and are picking the next nonce off of old data.  One approach I've used is to make sure that only one node emits transactions for each account, so it's recollection of the nonces is always up to date.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 06 Oct 2020 14:52:47 GMT):<br/>
I would stick with 8GiB for validators.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=PwkkfTMFvYk7MBcHy) that's not really a Besu question, but a HSM question.
2 options that are practical: use AWS KMS to encrypt symmetrically your keys. Or look at Unbound for a cloud HSM system. If you intend to use your HSM with a cloud solution, you need more thinking and prep, like VPN to your data center.
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 21:22:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi @EmcLab, 
There's a lot of pieces to the puzzle, but @atoulme's suggestion is a good place to start.
Having said that - there's a few things worth considering:
1. Besu doesn't natively support using HSM for the node key - you'll need to write (or get?) a plugin to let you do this.
2. The HSM and Besu node need to be geographically close together - ideally in the same data centre, otherwise the latency in the link means cryptographic operations are sufficiently slow that nodes don't connect, and blocks don't get mined.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 01:44:04 GMT):<br/>
your best bet then is to look at the `--rpc-http-authentication` series of options.  You can require standard http authentication or JWT authentication.  You can also turn on https via the `--rpc-http-tls` series flags and require client certificates.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 01:45:14 GMT):<br/>
It's also best to put machines accessing it in a subnet and firewall off access to the RPC ports using firewall rules.

:besu: :warning: *Besu 20.10.0-RC1 is out* :warning: :besu:

_This is the first release candidate towards our 20.10.0 so there may still be some rough edges. Stability issues have been observed on mainnet and are being worked on. If you want to try the latest and greatest, this has it, but please wait until 20.10.0 to update production nodes._

:star2: Highlights :star2: 
- Support added for the YOLOv2 ephemeral testnet
- Added a few debugging APIs: debug_standardTraceBlockToFile and debug_standardTraceBadBlockToFile
- Added --start-block and --end-block to the blocks import command
- Added support for multi-tenancy when using the early access feature of onchain privacy group management
- Fixed a longstanding eth/65 issue
- … and last but not least, as you’ve probably noticed, Besu is moving to CalVer! Here is a short explanation, and expect a proper blog post soon: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Proposal+-+CalVer+for+Besu+Releases

Building dependency tree...
Reading state information...
Package docker-ce is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or

I would recommend a different chainid.  It prevents replay across different chains, probably not an issue in private networks but if you run a testnet to try out contracts you want to make sure the chainIDs are different so you don't accidentally deploy dev work.
</p>
<p><strong>al0818</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 16:16:50 GMT):<br/>
is anynumber will do for chainID?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 16:18:28 GMT):<br/>
any would do. Pick a positive integer. 10 is used by quorum a bunch so stay out of that too.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 16:18:42 GMT):<br/>
It won't matter as you are going to run a permissioned private network.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 16:19:11 GMT):<br/>
It just will help you avoid confusing your dev stuff locally and your network. Give it something meaningful - it's its id.
</p>
<p><strong>al0818</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 16:19:36 GMT):<br/>
we use the chainID 2018 in IBFT2 setup, is that okay?

thanks atoulme
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 16:24:54 GMT):<br/>
again just an id you pick. 2018 is used by the dev network of besu when you play with it so it may be confusing down the road, is all.

Hey guys. I have a dev IBFT Besu network with 2 boot nodes and 3 worker nodes. When I remove one of the worker nodes for maintenance, the network seems to stall, with the boot nodes stating "Waiting for 1 peers to connect". How do I take a single node out for maintenance without bringing the network to a halt?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 17:01:57 GMT):<br/>
you can see all the genesis files of besu here: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/master/config/src/main/resources

Other than that, there is no hard and fast rule.

Hey, I'm currently running a permissioned IBFT Besu Network where membership is managed by a different application by modifying the local permissions file. When an account added a transaction to the blockchain and gets later removed from the accounts-allowlist i'm running into troubles when a new node likes to join the network and tries to sync with the other nodes. Then a block exists were a transaction is signed by this unallowed account. The result is a InvalidBlockException and the node can't connect to the network. It is possible to disable "--permissions-accounts-config-file-enabled", sync with the network, and restart again with "--permissions-accounts-config-file-enabled" enabled. But this is not very user friendly. Is there any suggestion to that issue? Thanks for you help. :)

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 19:54:35 GMT):<br/>
This is not the expected behaviour. 

Local account permissioning shouldn't be applied on block importing. If you take a look at the diagram at the bottom of this page https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Permissioning/Permissioning-Overview/, you'll see that we don't expect local permissioning to affect block import.

Would you please share the configuration options of you Besu node> And also what version you are using? Cheers!

Hi @MarkThompsonPH, 
When you say the network appears to stall - I'm assuming that means that no blocks are being produced.
For IBFT to continue to mine blocks, its important that each validator has at least 1 connection to another validator, such that all validators are connected to each other (even if its in a long chain). If a validator is left orphaned, i.e. connected to the network, but cannot see another validator, it will not be able to participate in consensus. In a large network, losing a single validator (either through orphaning or failure) may be ok, as there's still enough validators communicating to continue mining, but in a small network (eg 4 or 5 validators) losing a single validator may be sufficient to halt the network.
Best way to ensure propagation:
* Always have at least 6 validators (allowing for 1 validator to go offline at anytime)
* Make sure all validators connect to each other, either through initial bootnode setting, or by connecting them via the add_peer json rpc
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 21:53:51 GMT):<br/>
Can I rephrase some of that? In a network of 4 validators, you are able to lose 1 validator, and continue operating - with a network of 6 validators, you can actually lose 2 validators and continue. My apologies, the prior statements were made before coffee.

Hey Trent. That's for the help. We have network of 5 nodes, 2 of which are acting as boot nodes. The worker nodes all start up with the --bootnodes parameter set to include the enode URLs of the two bootnodes.

In this case, are the non-bootnodes validators?

When I shut down a single node, the bootnodes complained with 
```
nioEventLoopGroup-3-8 | INFO  | WaitForPeersTask | Waiting for 1 peers to connect
```.

I thought the network in this state would be able to lose one node without losing consensus.

I'm quite new to this system and don't yet know all of the characteristics. Even if I have two boot nodes, should I have at least 4  non-boot nodes?

Thanks again for your advice.

Hi Joshua,

I did try the npx command on both the Azure virtual machine that the quickstart tried to set up and on a local vm that was already loaded with node/npm/npx already loaded.

The Azure vm failed due to an npx not found error.

The local vm failed because it couldn't find ~/.npm/_npx/3221 Did I want to do a git clonefrom somewhere first?

The `npx quorum-dev-quickstart` is our new standard going forward (has been for a few weeks :) ). Its precursor is https://github.com/ConsenSys/besu-sample-networks (The azure setup has one of the examples here)  What version of nodejs do you have locally? I believe it needs 10+ to run

Hi all, I'm testing besu node on moder ETC testnet, and it looks like it's synced correctly, I see that it's in sync according to this: https://mordor.fork.fault.dev/, however I see that blockscout's explorer is ahead on a different block: https://blockscout.com/etc/mordor.  @shemnon it seems like it's syncing correctly, could it be that blockscout is using a different (non-correct) fork?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 19 Oct 2020 17:50:14 GMT):<br/>
Blockscout is using a buggy version of core-geth.

Hey, We are currently running an IBFT 2.0 Besu Network with 4 validators on 4 separate VMs. Our objectif right now is to run some benchmark testing to get the network performance results for executing a scenario which is : ERC20 transfert transaction with some additional data like id_transfert... 
Above 4000 transactions we are having issues with executing transactions : for example if 5000 txs are sent to the JSON-RPC HTTP provider, only about 4300 Txs are executed and confirmed in blocks the rest of transactions are lost... Any transactions that we sent above this limit are always lost and we can see that just those 4300 are added to Blocks... Is there a limit of the JSON-RPC HTTP? How to explain these results?? and how to resolve the issue ??
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 16:31:45 GMT):<br/>
have your transactions been committed to a block?  I don't think etherscan provides visibility into the mempool.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 16:33:01 GMT):<br/>
Are you adjusting the gas limit or the block time or the memory pool size?  It could be that the nodes memory pools are full because of low block bandwidth and the transactions are being dropped.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 19:21:27 GMT):<br/>
The initial max tx pool size (set by `--tx-pool-max-size`) is 4096.  So if a large amount of TXes were loaded in all at once the blockchain may get one or two blocks out with the TXes acounting for the 204 beyond the limit.  Alternatives are to (a) increase the tx pool max size or (b) dribble in new TXes at the same rate they are committed to the blockchain, after an initial load of a thousand or so.

Hi! How are you? I follow the example of create a besu network with docker from here: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/1.2.0/Tutorials/Private-Network-Quickstart/
It is working perfect. I have detected an issue, possible a configuration issue.
I could deploy contracts with 0 gas cost but when I try to exec transaction I received this message: Gas price below configured minimum gas price
I checked this https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/FreeGas/ and it is supposed to be OK configure but I don't understand where is the problem.

<p><strong>jonathansmirnoff</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 20:29:15 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:42:09 GMT):<br/>
Do you have the `--min-gas-price` flag set (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/FreeGas/#3-start-besu-with-a-minimum-gas-price-of-zero)?  This error should only occur in this case if the min gas price is greater than zero.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=mNt66Dc35gMDJmLbs) For the moment we are executing the scenario with loading Txs at once and see how besu is treating a large amount of TXes, the time needed for that and the number of blocks... For example when we loaded 3000 TXes at once, it took 8,63 s to be accepted (get the hash of all txes back) and transactions are splitted on 9 Blocks in respect for gas transaction and block gas limit.
Next experimentation scenarios for sure it will be adjusting metrics like you said.

The --data-path in a docker container would be the path _within_ the container.  so I would change to `-v /nodeetc/data:/data` and add to besu `--data-path=/data`.  On your host system the data would wind up in /nodeetc/data.

Full sync will take about 2 weeks, fast sync.  Fast sync ~6 hours on a i3.xlarge.  Not sure how that translates to your docker image.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 19:36:45 GMT):<br/>
You need 4 nodes minimum to produce blocks in IBFT2.  So yes, that's normal.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 19:37:52 GMT):<br/>
for ssh I would run it as a `nohup` process and pipe the log out to some other location.  `nohup <old command> &> ~/log.txt`

Hi, I am trying to run the 1.5.5 version of besu on kubernetes using the kubectl template from here: https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/kubectl/quorum-besu/clique
I'm using do-block-storage for the data-path.

When I deploy everything, I'm getting an error in the validator1 logs (shown below). The rpc-node and validator2 keep failing on the init stage due to a curl error.

I'm thinking maybe it has to do with the `config.toml` permissions config files, which I have left uncommented as I don't understand what they are / how to use/generate them.

Could you explain what `do-block-storage` for the data path is please? That needs to be a path on the local filesystem ie `/data` etc where you mount a PVC or the like. If you're on Digital Ocean, create a PV using the appropriate storageClass, then a PV claim and mount that to somewhere on the container eg: `/data`. That path is then what you'd specify for `data-dir`

Besu can be configured using cmd line or config file or env vars. In these examples we've gone with with the config file approach ie. config.toml. Details here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Using-Configuration-File/

<p><strong>antonispoulakis</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 09:46:52 GMT):<br/>
Hi @joshuafernandes. The `do-block-storage` is on Digital Ocean and we are mounting it as you said.

We had to run `chmod` on the data directory for the permissions to be fixed. So, it wasn't a configuration issue.

Thanks for the help!

Hi folks, is Oracle Java a requirement, or has Besu been tested with openjdk ?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:01:28 GMT):<br/>
Oracle Java is not a requirement.  Java 11+ is.  We have docker images for openjdk latest (15 right now), oracle jdk, and graalvm.  Oracle is just the default VM right now.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 31 Oct 2020 15:33:37 GMT):<br/>
What's rpc-http-host set to?  I'd recommend `0.0.0.0`, if you used the actual IP of the host you need to connect to <ip>:8545 and not localhost.  all zeros will listen on all addresses on the first IPv4 interface.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 31 Oct 2020 15:34:38 GMT):<br/>
Also, I'm assuming you aren't in a docker container or k8s, those have weird interactions with exposed ports.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 14:59:15 GMT):<br/>
If you are in docker or k8s besu should sniff it out automatically.  you can use `--nat-method=DOCKER` or `--nat-method=KUBERNETES` to help the auto detection as appropriate.  If you are behind a residential router `--nat-method=UPNP` will set up the port forwarding.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 15:03:16 GMT):<br/>
if you have to manually set up the port forwarding or firewall rules `--p2p-host=<ip>` will change the IP address that is advertised to peers, this should be the external address.  you will also need to set `--rpc-http-host` to be the IP address that your port forwarding will re-direct to (such as your nodes LAN address, not WAN address).  `0.0.0.0` is an easy shortcut to listen to all inbound addresses as it will also open up localhost and 127.0.0.1, but if you specify your lan address localhost won't worn.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 15:04:05 GMT):<br/>
If you have multiple network interfaces you will need to set `--p2p-interface` to the network interface you want the P2P to listen to.
</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 04:34:20 GMT):<br/>
I download the tar file and un-tar it. This probably is the manually setup. Yes, the node is behind a router and needs port forwarding.  Also shall reverse proxy (such as nginx) be used for security?

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 18:38:45 GMT):<br/>
It can also be extracted from the extra data, but there are a few JSON-RPC APIs that can do that automatically:

https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#ibft_getvalidatorsbyblockhash
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#ibft_getvalidatorsbyblocknumber
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#ibft_getsignermetrics

You will need to enable the IBFT APIs, ideally on a non-validating node.

Reverse proxy is a good security step.  We also have a means to turn on password verification, https client certs, and jwt, although I'd have to ask my teammates how those work.
</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 20:29:44 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for offering more details, especially jwt. I am using jwt in mobile app and it would be very interesting for me to setup jwt to allow mobile app to talk with besu node/validator. I am new to setup private besu network and is still in the process of learning. Any reading or post would be helpful.

How does one do it from extraData. Quorum ibft has proposer seal in extradata. But I don't see how could one recover form ibft2 block. Is order of seals somehow deterministic to get proposer seal in extradata
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 23:10:51 GMT):<br/>
Provided you haven't specified a mining beneficiary on the commandline, the coinbase of a block should be the proposers address
</p>
<p><strong>shantaraam</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 23:13:10 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. that matches my understanding. But want to confirm if that can't be extracted using extraData
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 23:14:48 GMT):<br/>
IBFT2 stores it in the coinbase only, not the extradata
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 23:17:51 GMT):<br/>
What do you need the proposer for? It normally wouldn't mean much outside of the IBFT block-creation process
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 23:20:04 GMT):<br/>
Apologies! The coinbase will always be the proposer's address, regardless of the mining-beneficiary on the cmdline.
</p>
<p><strong>shantaraam</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 23:27:37 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. Had a application logic to get proposer from quorum ibft. though same thing might work besu. Wanted to know  if it is as all possible to determine proposer from extradata.

Yes it might not mean much outside of consensus. but it is good to know it can be determined from a given block's data , independent of the history

Hi! Clique doesn't provide tx finality. IBFT2 does.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 20:11:34 GMT):<br/>
What problem are you talking about? The logs here seems to be fine :)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 06 Nov 2020 02:23:10 GMT):<br/>
I think it's the repeated block numbers that are coming from out of order signers, i.e. this is demonstrating a lack of finality.  This is a know weakness in Clique which is why we tend to recommend IBFT if you can get the minimum 4 validators.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 06 Nov 2020 02:23:52 GMT):<br/>
It also looks like the period is too low.  I wouldn't go below 2 (seconds).

Hi everybody,
I’ve noticed that getting logs on besu takes substantially more time than on other clients.
it takes around 20 seconds to get Transfer logs for one contract on the chain with 12M blocks and the same query on the same chain but with Parity takes 0,1 seconds.
The chain is almost empty.
Is there something which is missing in my configuration or is it an expected behaviour? I have transaction log bloom caching enabled and full sync mode.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 10 Nov 2020 15:02:54 GMT):<br/>
That matches our measuremet.  If I understand their arcitecture correctly Parity creates an index of thelogs, which is the only way it can asses 12M blocks in 100ms.  Currently we still walk a cached index of the block headers.

How can i solve this? Has anyone encountered this problem?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 13 Nov 2020 14:23:12 GMT):<br/>
are the genesis files the same?  Can you add --logging=DEBUG to the CLI? (it should add more colour as to why it was rejected)

<p><strong>feazzu</strong> (Fri, 13 Nov 2020 16:21:01 GMT):<br/>
yes, same genesis, and tried with  --logging=DEBUG and  --logging=TRACE, but it does not log nothing more. Invalid Headers at block#200 and error while downloading block #400 #600 #800 and then disconnect from peers.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 13 Nov 2020 17:10:58 GMT):<br/>

Hi Team, I have deployed a ETC Besu node. Node reached 7M after that the node sync became slow from last 7 days only 300k blocks synched and it is now at 7.3 M. Node is able to connect 2 to 3 peers. can you please let me know how to increase the peers connection?

No other mechanisms exist for peer discovery in ETC other than Devp2p discovery exist.
* you can manually add known peers via the `admin_addPeer`.  
* Make sure your node has a valid external address (set `--p2p-host` to your natted external adddress or use `--nat-method=upnp` if behind a residential gateway)

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 16 Nov 2020 19:06:35 GMT):<br/>
There are many nodes that won't accept external peer requests but will try to externally connect to yours, so it is essential you configure your node to broadcast a globally accessible enode address.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 16 Nov 2020 19:07:10 GMT):<br/>
Also, many peers disconnect full sync and fast sync nodes when they download too many blocks or exert too much bandwidth.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 16 Nov 2020 19:08:39 GMT):<br/>
If you set `--p2p-host` also set `--p2p-interface` with either 0.0.0.0 or the local IPv4 address of the network interface local to your lan (such as 192.168.1.10)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 16 Nov 2020 19:09:28 GMT):<br/>
if you only have one Network Card `0.0.0.0` is the easiest value for the interface as it will use the first enumerated network card.

Hey everyone! I'm trying to get started with hyperledger, already experienced in ethereum development. I see npx quorum-dev-quickstart is recommended for besu/quorum, but I don't know what next steps to take after starting a chain. Can I deploy and test smart contracts the same way using truffle and solidity? I also have heard I need to learn different messaging and event systems like kafka and rabbit md, don't know where to find tutorials for this.

Orion is the private transaction manager to enable private transactions (that is, transactions that are only visible to participants).  The overview doc on privacy is here: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Overview/

And a tutorial on setting up a network with privacy: 
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Privacy/Configuring-Privacy/

EthSigner is a transaction signer.  Besu doesn't support transaction signing inside the client - https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Account-Management/ 

If you've got specific questions about Orion and EthSigner, there's Orion and Ethsigner channels on the ConsenSys Discord (invite link - https://discord.com/invite/5U9Jwp7)

Re the differences between Geth and Besu. Like Geth, Besu runs on the Ethereum public networks.  Besu also has a number of enterprise features to ensure it meets the demands of enterprise solutions.  Permissioning, privacy, Apache 2 license, IBFT 2.0 consensus, and a plugin framework for extensibility are some of these.

Re peers - there's the following doc: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Find-and-Connect/Managing-Peers/
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Tue, 17 Nov 2020 03:27:18 GMT):<br/>
Besu has a plugin interface (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/Plugin-API-Interfaces/) and the event streaming plugin is open-source (https://doc.quorumplugins.consensys.net/en/latest/Concepts/Besu-Plugins/Event-Streams/)

Hi shemnon,
Thank you for the information, in Besu do we have file which stores the peers info? like peers.dat in parity. If exists can you let me know where it will sit, and can we modify it.

Hi shemnon,
Is there any possibility, on the peer information, which we can use by adding to our node?

If there was an ethereum classic version of https://ethernodes.org/ you could hand feed peers into the `admin_addPeer` APIs
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 17 Nov 2020 18:20:26 GMT):<br/>
we don't keep a peers.dat file.  It would make for a good feature request.

Hi
how to create a new account in besu - ./besu account new?
</p>
<p><strong>belmix</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 11:50:08 GMT):<br/>
If use --network=mordor 
what will be the default id
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 14:51:59 GMT):<br/>
Besu doesn't have wallet management features, by design (secure by default).
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 14:52:22 GMT):<br/>
you could use tools like metamask or ethsigner to access account RPCs (https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethsigner)

Hello - I tried the tutorial https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-IBFT-Network/ and got the IBFT network working.  Now I want to test deploying transactions and a contract to it.  The "Next Steps" in that tutorial linked to https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Examples/Private-Network-Example/#creating-a-transaction-using-metamask   which then asks me to create a new network with npx quorum-dev-quickstart   Is there any way to use the existing IBFT network to deploy a contract and test some transactions?

Hello, I'm currently testing permissioned and private networks with Orion, we are attempting to validate the transaction by using https://github.com/zmitton/eth-proof . It is returning an error `Error: BlockHash mismatch` . I have verified proofs on public test networks and it works as expected.  Does Besu support patricia merkle tree proofs?  Thanks!

How are you deploying contracts to Besu?  Using truffle?

<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 19:59:03 GMT):<br/>
@belmix - the network and chain IDs for modor are listed here: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/NetworkID-And-ChainID/
</p>
<p><strong>mharrison</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 20:01:31 GMT):<br/>
you need to sign the transaction with your private key using HDWalletProvider in truffle
</p>

OK thanks.  That is better now  with https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Develop-Dapps/Truffle/

synching besu to eth mainnet and every time I start it it seems to start synching from ~6%, even if I get close to 90% the previous run
Is that normal?

Hello everyone, I am reading the official documentation in order to stay updated with besu;  please I would like to understand how the process of removing and adding new validators, without involving the voting process, works. 
According to the documentation (here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/IBFT/#adding-and-removing-validators-without-voting) the scenario can be applied when the majority of validators are not working on the network. So I such case I assume that the network is halted and thus not producing blocks.
In that context, I wonder how the network will reach a future block, specified in the genesis, where new validators will take place and current inactive validators will be removed??

Hi guys, I just got a new ARM mac and try to install besu (binary distribution) there with rosetta 2 (installed brew already that way) but I get a message that I should habe JDK installed (which I have of course). Do you think thats an issue because its only compatible with the Intel Macs somehow or because something is wrong with JDK? Is this maybe something for the Apple Forum instead of here?
</p>
<p><strong>TillFruehauf</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:11:45 GMT):<br/>
" besu: Java 11+ is required for this software. "
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:21:40 GMT):<br/>
how did you install besu?  homebrew?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:21:50 GMT):<br/>
or extracting the zip somewhere?
</p>
<p><strong>TillFruehauf</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:32:15 GMT):<br/>
i didnt yet, I'm trying to
</p>
<p><strong>TillFruehauf</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:32:19 GMT):<br/>
with homebrew yes
</p>
<p><strong>TillFruehauf</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:36:30 GMT):<br/>
didnt yet install it but try to using homebrew.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 20:30:22 GMT):<br/>
So if you have rosetta i expect it should work.  To improve performance we should look into testing with ARM JDKs (builds are starting to show up) as well as building our native libraries to ARM.  Our crypto libraries have Java fallbacks but I think even via rosetta the native libs will be faster.

We don't depend on virtualization and from what I've read that's the only hard stop right now.  (For stuff like Docker)

:besu: *Besu 20.10.1 is out*  :besu:

:star2: Highlights :star2:
- Two new JSON RPC endpoints to get miner rewards data, `eth_getMinerDataByBlockHash` & `eth_getMinerDataByBlockNumber`
- A new JSON RPC endpoint to change the gas limit, miner_changeTargetGasLimit 
- The transaction pool now prioritizes transactions by gas prices
- EVMTool is now part of the binary distribution
- We now provide a new metric to track performance during block import: MegaGas/Seconds
- We have support for OpenTelemetry metrics
- We added support for qip714block config parameter in genesis file, paving the way towards permissioning interoperability between Besu and GoQuorum.

Hey @eum602, You're absolutely right, the transitions are used for making a step change in the validator list.
The main uses are:
1. Network has halted
2. Validator pool compromised, or
3. Planned network split
For the third option - we recommend setting a date in the future, and allowing the network to split when it reaches the transition block.
In the instance of a halted network (or recognised compromised validators), we'd recommend stopping the network, inserting a transition 1 block ahead of the current chain length, then restarting. Thus, the next block proposed would contain the validators specified in the transition, and the network would continue on.

Mainnet sync is very hard on I/O.  Is this an SSD or HDD?  mainnet may be too much four your hw setup.

It's SSD (1 TB).

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 22:00:39 GMT):<br/>
the error is a low level DB issue.  There's not much support we can offer, probably an issue with rocksdb.

<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 22:57:38 GMT):<br/>
Thanks a lot @trent.mohay , that is clear for me. Is it also possible for a regular node to declare it as a validator for the next block, change the networkId, start the network where it is the unique node in that netowork and then  join new participants in that forked chain?

Mordor is the testnet that forked ECIP-1099 aka the Thanos hardfork about a month ago.  I don't think miningcore has been updated to support the changes, as it doubles the epoch length and hence cuts the dag in half.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 23:37:25 GMT):<br/>
The last commit was in Dec of 2019, so it couldn't have the Thanos fork for ETC.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 23:46:51 GMT):<br/>
The miner is rejecting the data.  Besu wants Thanos blocks and the miner wants Pheonix blocks.  They will never agree until the miner code is updated.  It's a bit more subtle than just that one line.

What kind of collaboration did you have in mind?  Besu itself is an OSS project as part of Hyperledger, so it's not a strict company per say.  Our contributors work for ConsenSys, Splunk, and ChainSafe.

Hi! We've already officially partnered with Consensys (will be announced this week), but we would like to discuss the possible promotion options, for example, with the person responsible for the Hyperledger account on Twitter. Also, would like to know, is it possible for you to add our logo as a nodes provider to the Hyperledger website?

Thank you!

<p><strong>OliviaKenney</strong> (Tue, 24 Nov 2020 14:08:59 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 24 Nov 2020 14:14:24 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger and ConsenSys are two different entities, so ConsenSys partnerships are distinct from Hyperledger.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 16:21:50 GMT):<br/>
for ETC fast sync our last run on an i3.xlarge was 5 Hour(s) 56 Minute(s), for ETC full archival sync it was 5 Day(s) 8 Hour(s) 7 Minute(s)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 16:22:56 GMT):<br/>
Fast sync will only have state from the pivot block, so 6 hours or so.  In the neighborhood of 1600 blocks.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 29 Nov 2020 20:48:37 GMT):<br/>
What are you using to submit transactions to Besu? Is you Dapp using a wallet like Metamask?

Besu doesn't do account management, so any transaction sent to Besu must contain the correct nonce for that account.
</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Sun, 29 Nov 2020 20:51:55 GMT):<br/>
The dapp uses `etherjs` which is similar to `web3js`. A wallet is managed by the dapp. I just want to confirm that it is dapp's responsibility to manage the nonce for each and every transaction it submits.

Hi Shemnon,
I have a fast node for ETC with besu, till 10.3 million it is fast after that , it started checking the world nodes from last 24 hrs, 
2020-12-01 04:37:11.625+00:00 | EthScheduler-Services-7 (requestCompleteTask) | INFO  | CompleteTaskStep | Downloaded 60200000 world state nodes. At least 10131828 nodes remaining. Estimated World State completion: 85.59 %.
is this expected?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 05:12:14 GMT):<br/>
it sounds like your storage may be slow.
</p>
<p><strong>sankara 5</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 05:48:31 GMT):<br/>
i am using the SSD disk
</p>
<p><strong>sankara 5</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 05:48:31 GMT):<br/>
i am using the SSD disk, memory stats and cpu stats are also very low than configured, IO also good
</p>
<p><strong>sankara 5</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 12:52:55 GMT):<br/>
Hi Shemnon , can we get a snapshot of ETC, so that we can restore it and start the node? i am Looking for alternate options
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 15:05:22 GMT):<br/>
I don't think the disk being served through docker is fast enough.  I would try running the node on bare metal.
</p>
<p><strong>sankara 5</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 16:10:27 GMT):<br/>
My fast node is not working and i scrapped it and started again, it unable to connect to peers, while on the same server my full node is synching but slow.

@shemnon , when http://node-ip:8545 in browser, there is nothing returned. I verified that the node is ready and live. Shall besu node return something or error if there is anything?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:23:49 GMT):<br/>
no.  This is a json-rpc endpoint so json-rpc post payloads are expected.  This is expected.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:23:49 GMT):<br/>

@shemnon , tried to deploy in remix a contract (tested on ganache). As soon as I enter the address of end node with port 8545, it pops up an error: Not possible to connect to the Web3 provider. Make sure the provider is running, a connection is open (via IPC or RPC) or that the provider plugin is properly configured.
The end node is up and running, but the connection request failed. Not sure what is missing here.

You've set `--host-whitelist=*` and `--rpc-http-cors-origins=*` and `--rpc-http-host=0.0.0.0`?  I typically use postman to verify it's up and running (https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11610746/TVmHDead)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:18:42 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 05:01:53 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon , postman for get http://node-ip:8545 returns 500 internal server error. However browser and curl -v 'http://node-ip:8545' returns http 200. Does the return in postman indicate problem with besu node?
</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 05:03:47 GMT):<br/>

Hi all. What is the status of Besu? I see that Geth has overwhelming client market share so want to try something new. Is Besu being actively developed by Hyperledger? Or is it the case that these ETH1 nodes have been working in production for a long time and aside from a massive hidden bug will not require updating in advance of the full transition to Eth2? I see on ethernodes.org Besu hasnt had that much uptake and I am curious as to why..?

Hi @clowestab, 

Besu is still being actively developed, yes! The client is part of the Hyperledger Foundatation, and ConsenSys is the main maintainer, along with other independent maintainers and organizations, like Chainsafe.

>  Or is it the case that these ETH1 nodes have been working in production for a long time and aside from a massive hidden bug will not require updating in advance of the full transition to Eth2?

Re: this, there is no node that "won't require updating before Eth2". Ethereum often has network upgrades (the next one should be early Q1), which require users, at least on mainnet, to update their nodes. We also often ship new features, which you can only use via upgrades.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 16:28:30 GMT):<br/>
and then try with the node-ip variant

<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 16:29:28 GMT):<br/>
>  I see on ethernodes.org Besu hasnt had that much uptake and I am curious as to why..?

The main reason, in my experience, for people not switching, is relying on non-standard APIs from other clients, such as geth and parity. We're working on adding compatibility for those, such as the Parity tracing APIs (see: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#trace-methods)
</p>
<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 16:45:27 GMT):<br/>
Hey @cyrilnaves, 

It seems our docs are not fully up to date about this, sorry!

You need to set profiling via environment variables, e.g.:

`export BESU_OPTS=-XX:StartFlightRecording=disk=true,delay=15s,dumponexit=true, \
filename=/tmp/recording.jfr, maxsize=1024m,maxage=1d, \
settings=profile,path-to-gc-roots=true`

<p><strong>timbeiko</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 16:46:08 GMT):<br/>
This is assuming you are running it from a shell script.  Somehow BESU_OPTS needs to be set to the jfr flags. Docker compose has one way, systemctl has a different way.

Hi team, for IBFT2 private network, is it possible to run 4 nodes from 4 subdirectories on the same physical server to form a network? It seems possible based on the setup lesson by pegasys. If it possible, is it doable for production environment (other than single point failure which is obvious)?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 03:00:51 GMT):<br/>
That can work too.  The main reason for 4 nodes is that IBFT2 doesn't work with less than 4 has to do with the voting thresholds and the math behind the consensus.  Clique can run with as few as 1 nodes, but you lose finality and have to deal with orphan blocks.

</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 20:51:03 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 21:06:41 GMT):<br/>
Gas Limit should not exceed the block gas limit, this is an anti-abuse mechanism for smart contracts.  eth_estimateGas * 1.10 seems to be sufficient usually.
</p>

Even though IBFT can be set to a zero gas fee network it still uses gas to prevent runaway contracts.

- Added protocols section to admin_peers to provide info about peer health. #1582
- Added CLI option --goquorum-compatibility-enabled to enable GoQuorum compatibility mode. #1598. (This mode is incompatible with Mainnet)
- Fixed a longstanding issue with eth/65. It should now work on mainnet, and will likely be on by default starting from 20.10.3 :tada:

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=2c3XdJetZm44DQLDy) I set my p2p and rpc hosts 0.0.0.0, I used free credits of google cloud and create 4 nodes and uploaded genesis files each of them. I started nodes like in a local network but host adresses are 0.0.0.0. They are unable to discover each other, then i tried to replace 0.0.0.0's with external IP of bootnode but they are still not able to connect.

Hello, I'm trying to retrieve logs through Kibana. I'm using this repo from the documentation https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart with ELK enabled for monitoring/logs. In my case I have a contract that emits an event on creation. For now I use the json rpc, I create a filter with  `eth_newFilter` for this specific topic and retrieve logs with `eth_getFilterLogs`. It works very well but I didn't manage to make it work with Kibana. I'm not familiar with ELK so it would be really helpful if you have any guidance. Thanks

Is there private stat involved?  Is this a validator where the key need to be preserved?  A guide should be written but there are two main ways to do it (a) copy everything in the --data-path to the new node or (b) start up a new node in the new location and let it sync off the network.  For (b) you may need to start with a new node key while syncing then copy the key from the old location (${DATA_PATH}/key) to the new node and restart it once in sync.

Private state makes it more complicated and I should let the maintainers who deal with private state talk about that.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 07 Dec 2020 18:50:17 GMT):<br/>
p2p needs special handling, the effect of simply setting `--p2p-host` to 0.0.0.0 is that your enodes advertise that 0.0.0.0 is the host to connect to.  set `--p2p-interface=0.0.0.0` and `--p2p-host=<ip the machines can see>`. The `--p2p-host` value gets added directly to the enode as-is.  So if they can see each other via the internal 10.x.x.x network that is ok, or you may need the public address.  This may be a google cloud security issue as Im not sure how wide open they make their ports.

Ah ok, so you set up an RPC node by hand, which then communicated to the other nodes via devp2p?  Do you have any other info on how you set this up? Thanks @shemnon

Hi @EmcLab it looks like the extradata field in youir genesis file is incorrect. That string is an RLP encoded structure which includes the addresses of the nodes which must work together to mine the first block (this mechanism is then repeated for every block thereafter). I suspect the address in your extradata doesn't correspond to any of your running nodes - and thus, no blocks.
You'll need to work out the addresses of your validator nodes, and construct the correct extraData string to put into your Genesis file. 
Some/most of this is automated by the generate-blockchain-config subcommand of besu (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Subcommands/#generate-blockchain-config)

My ETC fast node , got stuck second time after reaching at 10.32M.and started checked the world state completion: 6.7% and is taking days here, can you please let me know the issue here
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 05:47:10 GMT):<br/>
Is this still being run on docker or in a k8s cluster?  Any of the public chains need to be run on bare metal.

@trent.mohay , I construct a 4 ndes IBFT2 network using the example provided on Besu doc and there are blocks generated. the extradata was copied from the doc example. There is a strange problem. My dapp can deploy contract to a ganache test net successfully. However when the contract was deployed to IBFT2 network on public internet, the dapp never received any reply from the node (no error at all). Do you know how it could happen? I am clueless about this node behavior.

The sample genesis file in the tutorial is only a sample - the extradata in it includes only a single validator - so, its very important that when you create a new genesis file you create a valid extradata field - which must include the addresses of the nodes which are going to be your validators - check step-3 of the tutorial - I think that's where the tutorial creates a valid ExtraData string
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 08:02:52 GMT):<br/>
it's _critical_ that the node keys used in the nodes which are validators have their corresponding addresses in the extraData, or else no blocks will be created
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 08:02:52 GMT):<br/>
I'm assuming you're looking at the configuration file shown under step-2?
If so - I'm also assuming you're looking at the private keys under the "alloc" section. If I've got this wrong, the rest of this won't make much sense :)
So - the config file is ALMOST identical to a genesis file, but without the extraData field.
In a genesis file (and config that specific config file) - the "alloc" section is the funded ACCOUNTS at the start of the network - and is _not_ related to the IBFT2 validators. We just happen to put the private-keys in that example so that you can sign transactions for the funded accounts (you would NEVER put this in a production genesis file)

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 18:13:19 GMT):<br/>
Two things: (a) parity is not compatible with the thanos hard fork.  you will never get to full sync on classic with that peer.  Are you running 20.10.2?  (b) make sure other nodes can connect to you remotely.  ensure that you are advertising the correct external IP and ports (--p2p-host --p2p-port) and that you are forwarding those external connections to your node.

Hi @trent.mohay , in the example in doc, the private key is included in the genesis seed file to generate genesis.json and keys. The doc says the private key is not needed in seed file. Can I remove the private keys all together in seed file before running the besu operator command?
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 22:23:55 GMT):<br/>
The genesis configuration file in step-2 contains the private keys in the "alloc" section, such that when playing on your network, you are able to access the funded accounts - these are NOT part of the
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 22:27:57 GMT):<br/>
So, I’m assuming you’re looking at the configuration file in step-2 of the IBFT2 tutorial?
If not, the rest of this won’t make sense :)
So - the configuration file is ALMOST identical to a genesis file, except its missing the extraData field.
The alloc section of the configuration file is the same as used in a normal genesis file - it represents the funded accounts which exist at network creation - they are NOT related to the IBFT2 consensus mechanism.
We typically include the account private-keys our tutorial/test genesis files such that users are able to easily sign transactions in a test environment. Private keys would NEVER appear in a production genesis file.
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 22:28:42 GMT):<br/>
So yes, you can indeed remove the private keys from the configuration file (and thus they will not appear in the generated genesis file either.
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 22:31:51 GMT):<br/>
The operator command is responsible for creating "n" (defined as 'count'. in the config file) keyPairs, creating an extraData string using those 'n' generated keyPairs, then generating a genesis file using the content of the config file plus the extraData string created.
At that stage, it is important that you run use each of the generated keys in one of your nodes - to ensure the node key/address corresponds with the genesis file used.

the keys in "alloc" are effectively 'people'. in the network who can trade eth, or call contracts.
The NODE KEY files represent unique identifiers of the actual Besu nodes (so more like infrastructures rather than bank-account details)

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 05:40:09 GMT):<br/>
We have the classic standard boot nodes built in - https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/ethereum/p2p/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/ethereum/p2p/config/DiscoveryConfiguration.java#L101.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 05:40:52 GMT):<br/>
Peer discovery on classic is always problematic.  If you don't have your discovery enode externally accessible to remote connections you will not be able to find good peers.

Hello, in besu how do you manage the release version? manually or gradlew calculates it based on path/minor/major?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 18:14:04 GMT):<br/>
We manage it manually.  Gradle reads the version from `gradle.properties` (https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/gradle.properties) and the build script does special things relating to the git version if it sees `SNAPSHOT` in the version.

No, we don't support pluggable encryption and the Ethereum 2.0 idea of "Account Abstraction" (EIP-2938) is still just a proposal as no clients have shipped an implementation and it hasn't been scheduled for a hard fork.

Hello! I'm pretty confused about Besu solution. If i want to deploy my own private network, without communcation with any Ethereum networks (main, tests), should I have any Ether in my account ?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 13:49:18 GMT):<br/>
Hi, no, you don't need "real" Ether, I mean the ones valuable on the mainnet.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 13:50:57 GMT):<br/>
However, if you rune your own network based on Besu, you will have the ability to decide of the cost of operations. Your private network transactions will require gas to run... but you can determine that you accept gas wit a price of zero.

</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Mon, 14 Dec 2020 13:57:02 GMT):<br/>
In a private network, and specifically if you require free transactions, you can't really have price incentives. So a PoA network would probably be the solution over a PoW.

I've one more question. I'm trying to develop a system for medical appointments using blockchain technology in order to offer immuability and transparency.
The paradigm will move from client frontend with metamask wallet to the backend server with a secured stored wallet. When the user try to make a new appointment the server should respond immediately with the appointment UUID and take care of storing the data on Besu private network and to the database for fast querying (+more useful info). How can I take care of rejected transactions with zero effort from user. It's a good option to have a mempool table in database with rejected transactions and retry to send them ?

How consensus is achieved in besu when using private transactions
</p>
<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 09:18:53 GMT):<br/>
You can look at the documentation that explains how a private transaction is processed
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Private-Transaction-Processing/
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 17:12:33 GMT):<br/>
If not a table of rejected transactions at least a table of pending txes not in a block yet.  It also depends on the tx rejection reason.  These may require operator intervention to fix the rejection reason (such as not enough ether if not set to zero gas allowed).  Simpler cases like duplicate nonces can be re-submitted with a new tx and nonce.  But be wary of simply auto-submitting rejections as it may fall in a loop of the fundamental rejection reason does not change.

@shemnon , for permissioning, is it possible to mix onchain account contract for account permissioning and local node permissionging  together at the same time?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 20:51:02 GMT):<br/>
To prevent access to the JSON-RPC endpoint, you can use a firewall to only allow connection from trusted sources and you can enable authentication/authorization to limit the access to a specific set of users (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Interact/APIs/Authentication/)
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 20:53:21 GMT):<br/>
Node permissioning and RPC auth are two distinct concepts. 

With node permissioning , you create a list of nodes that are allowed to connect to create a network.

With RPC auth, you create a list of users that can access your RPC endpoints (and limit what resources they have access to).
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 02:56:35 GMT):<br/>
For local permissioning, if you are updating the node or account list using the APIs, you shouldn't need to restart to pickup the new config.

For onchain, the changes to the rules are transactions that need to be included in a block and processed by your node before they are active in your node. They also don't require a restart.

You can use local and onchain permissioning at the same time. However, it is important to remember that they have some differences and there is no "precedence" between them. For example, if using local and onchain account permissioning, an account must be allowed both in the local config and in the permissioning contract for the rule to be effective.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 02:56:57 GMT):<br/>
I'd recommend using either local or onchain permissioning, not both at the same time.
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=cSLWxJBWbYDCfTqhB) There is a nginx reverse proxy running on the same node and pass http traffic to 127.0.0.1:8545. After stopping nginx server, the nodes are working fine.  Then restarting nginx reverse proxy didn't cause error.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 20:38:07 GMT):<br/>
What host are you connecting from?  The default is `--host-allowlist=localhost,127.0.0.1` so unless explicitly set it can only be access locally.  `*` opens it up to everything.

Hi, are you still experiencing issues with this? 

The documentation mentions the maximum retention period for pending transaction in the pool defaults to 13hrs.
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#tx-pool-retention-hours
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 23:13:18 GMT):<br/>
I've fixed this by stopping the cron job and restarting the nodes. Is it possible to use a random nonce string like hyperledger sawtooth for private networks in the future? Serial nonce is not good for concurrency and some backend services.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 23:40:14 GMT):<br/>
We haven't done performance testing to get stats of local vs onchain permissioning. I would think though that if you have thousands of accounts and the list of accounts is infrequently modified, local config might make more sense.
</p>
<p><strong>bgravenorst</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 00:02:41 GMT):<br/>
The Ethereum spec states how the nonce should be used. So while we "could" re-purpose it in a private network, we’ll be straying from what is recognised as the safe method of usage - i.e. it ensures transaction ordering in a distributed network.
</p>
<p><strong>CameronWeston</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 00:35:30 GMT):<br/>
This solved it ! Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 03:41:24 GMT):<br/>
Fisco BCOS (http://fisco-bcos.org/) does that, they are mostly ethereum with a few tweaks, one that the nonce field is re-implemented as an expiration field.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 03:42:32 GMT):<br/>
The concurrency and serialization problems extend beyond just the nonce.  Since Ethereum is account based and highly composable order of operations between different accounts calling the same contract still have concurrency implications.  Worse because you don't know the impact until you execute the contract.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 03:44:10 GMT):<br/>
The serialization within the block (i.e. all transactions are executed in order with strong happens-before semantics) will quickly eat up any concurrency gains that out of order nonces would provide once executed at mainnet scale.

I got besu synced to mainnet on a machine running Ubuntu with 48 GB RAM.  It's still hammering the SSD with 2000 reads/sec, and 100% disk IO time.  Is that normal?  By comparison, geth on the same machine was doing about 30 reads/sec and 3% disk IO time.

I'm not sure if I understood your question. Are you using your own authentication service to generate the JWT token? If you are, you need to specify the public key associated with the key that is signing the JWT tokens.

<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:17:05 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone, does anybody know, how often Besu synchronizes the transaction pool? I'm experiencing that transaction stay for long in transaction pool if the node has no connection to other nodes right after receiving the transaction. Moreover, I was wondering if its possible to not set the nonce of a transaction and let that be set by the Besu node and not on client site?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:23:30 GMT):<br/>
Can you post some logs (in trace mode would be nice) between the moment you send the tx and the moment you have zero peers on your node please?
For the nonce part, Besu doesn't automatically handle finding the correct one. Your TX has to be build with the correct nonce. Nonce management is part of some overlay usually.
</p>
<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:24:18 GMT):<br/>
Sure. Can do that.
</p>
<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:28:15 GMT):<br/>
But is there a reason why Besu can't do that? Other ethereum-software can do that right?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:34:46 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure, but I don't think so. Nodes provide a methods to count the number of tx from an account, but then if you generate two tx, before sending them the tx count will be the same and you will have to compute the nonce by yourself by giving txA a n+1 nonce and txB a n+2 nonce. That's why for instnace Consensys Orchestrate software provides a nonce service that's base on a shared  database that allows it to manage the tx and their nonces before they are included in the block and available on the chain. Otherwise your node would be almost always wrong. It can't know if you prepared tx and nid not send them yet. The first then may pass (not even sure as it will fail if the first to reach the node is not the one with n+1 nonce), and all others would have wrong nonces for sure.
</p>
<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:37:56 GMT):<br/>
Hm yes sounds reasonable. Thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:38:36 GMT):<br/>
I'm not an expert in other node software though so don't take this as the immutable truth ;)
</p>
<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:38:55 GMT):<br/>
Yeah sure. :)
</p>
<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:44:31 GMT):<br/>
For the other problem: Maybe I describe my szenario first. Actually, I'm running a permissioned network and I'm using the RPCs do add and remove nodes. The node I'm sending a transcation is not permissioned by the other nodes. So i think it is not able to distribute the transaction at that moment. So thats not surprising. But when I the other nodes give the node the permission. the Transaciton stays for long in the transaction pool. So i was wondering if its possible to speed this up.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:44:43 GMT):<br/>
I'm just pasting some links about nonces that are interesting:
- https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/nethereum-managing-nonces/
- https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/06transactions.asciidoc#keeping-track-of-nonces
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:47:44 GMT):<br/>
Interesting, what's "the Transaciton stays for long in the transaction pool." exactly? Do you see your node sync? My guess is that it has to keep up with the chain first before being able to broadcast the tx to others.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:51:17 GMT):<br/>
For the nonce, even Parity who had a method for next nonce seems to have issues and the advice is to [handle it on the dapp side](https://github.com/openethereum/parity-ethereum/issues/9768).
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:54:52 GMT):<br/>
Same for Metamask https://github.com/openethereum/parity-ethereum/issues/5014#issuecomment-390394287
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:56:14 GMT):<br/>
And there was something with Geth but that only solves the issue when you have tx originated fron only one node, which is not the case in network with multiple nodes that could send tx from the same address https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/2880
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:56:44 GMT):<br/>
I'm done about nonce, let's look at your broadcasting issue now ;)
</p>
<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:58:55 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure maybe 5 minutes to 30 minutes. But I didn't measured the exact time
</p>
<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:59:36 GMT):<br/>
It's just the one transaction. and the node is only shortly "unpermissioned" so it has nearly the same Blockchain state
</p>
<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:59:49 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the nonce links
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:00:36 GMT):<br/>
Hum, I guess it's more than what's needed for your node to get back in sync. How far behind the chain head is the node when your reconnect it by adding it back in the permissioning? What kind of permisioning do you use? File or onchain?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:01:31 GMT):<br/>
Ok, maybe something to do with permisionning then...
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:01:58 GMT):<br/>
Would you mind if I forward this to our permisionning experts?

(meaning you not have an answer right now)
</p>
<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:03:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm think 5-10 Blocks
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:03:18 GMT):<br/>
Maybe to speed up the debug, having your config and genesis files + command line used to start the nodes would help. Could you drop an archive by DM?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:03:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes 5-10 doesn't need 30 mins to sync, clearly...
</p>
<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:03:50 GMT):<br/>
really?
</p>
<p><strong>aaltenbernd</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:04:04 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:05:05 GMT):<br/>
I mean it's NOT normal that your node being 5 or 10 blocks behind takes so much time to propagate the tx as it clearly need only a few sec to sync 10 blocks

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:06:52 GMT):<br/>
Where?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 20 Dec 2020 20:24:37 GMT):<br/>
@aaltenbernd Is it possible that the newly added node hasn't been found by other nodes after you added it to the list of allowed nodes? Discovery might take a while to find new nodes, so it could be the reason for the delay.

Would you be able to try this again, but after you add the node to the allowlist, try calling admin_addPeer to "force" a connection between the new node and one of the nodes in the existing network?

Also, bear in mind that when using config-based permissioning, you need to update the allowlist in every node to get a consistent network (all nodes have to be updated with the new rules).

Hi guys, under ibft2 consensus algorithm, is it normal that the validators keep creating new blocks even when there are no transactions? Does besu has some setting to only create blocks when there are transactions? Otherwise, the blockchain may contain a lot of empty blocks.

hi! I am considering running a HL Besu node in order to integrate my application with Ethereum Classic. I have been using Parity for that, however it became deprecated after recent hard fork.
</p>
<p><strong>kss-espeo</strong> (Wed, 23 Dec 2020 13:35:29 GMT):<br/>
for now I would like to test JSON RPC API to make sure it has the functionalities I need. can you guys recommend some public node that I can use or a way to easily set up a node on my local machine without having to do a sync with the ledger? I don't care what ledger it connects to, I'm just after testing API.
</p>
<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Wed, 23 Dec 2020 13:53:46 GMT):<br/>
If you don't have a node you can look at the list of available APIs in the doc and see the postman list with available APIs https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/

@matkt yeah I already looked at these. now I want to actually hit some node. all the examples in documentation mention localhost. I don't want to sync a full node - that's why I'm after either a public one I can hit or a way to easily set up a node on my local machine without having to sync huge ledger
</p>
<p><strong>kss-espeo</strong> (Wed, 23 Dec 2020 14:18:28 GMT):<br/>
found some here: https://www.ethercluster.com/
</p>
<p><strong>kss-espeo</strong> (Wed, 23 Dec 2020 14:24:06 GMT):<br/>
however, it seems it has key methods I'm interested in (`trace_transaction` or `debug_traceTransaction`) disabled. I will keep looking for alternatives, however other suggestions are more than welcome

Hi team, I have an issue that if "Nonce too low" error happens in a specific node for an account, it will never get a correct pending nonce for that account even after the node is restarted. I have to send the transaction to another node to make a successful transaction.  Besu version is v20.10.2 and the transactions were sent by the abi generated code for golang.

<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 02:05:12 GMT):<br/>
Hey @Manzik did you get this resolved?
Short answer is - add "--miner-enabled" to the commandline, and the error goes away - i.e. its an artefact of Besu trying to handle multiple consensus mechanisms in a similar way.
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 02:06:42 GMT):<br/>
I.e. clique is by default enabled if you're a recognised signer/validator - but the commandline handling doesn't realise that the genesis file is configured for clique - so the commandline validation does its best to ensure consistency of the specified parameters - i.e. why would you specify a min-gas-price if you're not a miner?
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 02:07:56 GMT):<br/>
Ultimately, its a rough edge, where the work around is to force mining to be enabled (--miner-enabled)
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 02:10:53 GMT):<br/>
Hey @raychan11111, Ibft deliberately continues to produce blocks, even when no transactions are available - it ensures data continuity in the blockchain - i.e. we'd rather indicate that the blockchain is progressing and nothing is happening, rather than have a potentially halted blockchain.
Having said that, there is some R&D work coming through which is to investigate how IBFT could be updated too prevent empty blocks ... so ... watch this space?
</p>
<p><strong>raychan11111</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 02:55:11 GMT):<br/>
@trent.mohay Thanks for your reply. Do you mean that the hyperledger besu team is investigating on this empty blocks issue? I brought up this issue because our use case require high tps, so the block time would be small which will generate tons of empty blocks rapidly.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 04:00:35 GMT):<br/>
Could you achieve hight TPS by raising the block gas limit?  Block time is not the only lever to pull.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 04:11:58 GMT):<br/>
Fast syncing an ethereum classic node is very fast and relatively small.

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 17:19:57 GMT):<br/>
Never mind -- that's really weird . . . . it's the sudo which is preventing it from working.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 18:27:16 GMT):<br/>
A classic full sync takes about 6 days on an AWS i3.  For trace_* as long as the block has been fully processed, i.e. after the fast sync pivot, it will work.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 18:27:50 GMT):<br/>
So any block that comes in after a fast sync starts will be fully tracable.  Any block before that point requires an archive/full sync.

The contract reverted with a specified reason.  Running that through a hex to ascii web page (https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html) yields "Ãy  4Creation can be initiated only by the contract owner"

This is what the solidity `revert()` primitive produces.

java.nio.channels.UnsupportedAddressTypeException

also i added this two config variables to the node if i remove them the node will not start the synchronisation 
--remote-connections-limit-enabled=false 
--fast-sync-min-peers=1

It doens't seen enough do you have a list of up date peers that can we connect to for the synchro ?

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 16:47:12 GMT):<br/>
Looks like our IPv6 address support became broken, that's what the exceptions are complaining about.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 16:47:33 GMT):<br/>
As for peering, that is always difficult on test networks.  `--fast-sync-min-peers=1` is a common setting for my test nodes.

Ropsten is also tends to have large forks and netsplits.  Great for testing some scenarios bad for stable smart contract development.  Rinkeby and Goerli are better for contract development.

Probably a stupid question . . . .
I'm trying to get the Permissioning Dapp working

The instructions at https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Deploy/Production/#starting-a-production-permissioned-network say
To deploy the Permissioning Management Dapp for production:
1. Retrieve the most recent release (tarball or zip) from the projects release page.
2. Unpack the distribution into a directory available to your Web server.
3. In the root of the unpack directory, add a file called config.json replacing the placeholders shown below.
{
  "accountIngressAddress":  "<Address of the account ingress contract>",
  "nodeIngressAddress": "<Address of the node ingress contract>",
  "networkId": "<ID of your Ethereum network>"
}
4. On your Web server, host the contents of the directory as static files and direct root requests to index.html

It also specifically says 
** Follow the procedure as for Getting Started with Onchain Permissioning, but do not perform the steps using yarn to install, build, and start the development server. Instead, follow the procedure above to deploy the Permissioning Management Dapp to your Web server.**

Unfortunately, the only assets available for download on the project release page are labeled **source code** and they clearly don't have the necessary files for the above to work . . . . so I'm assuming that there should be Release assets as well . . . .

I also note that the **README.md** for *https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/tree/v2.0.0* says that 
**Note: The build process for the Dapp is currently not supported on Windows. Please use the provided distribution available at the projects release page if on Windows.**
which, again, leads me to believe that there should be one or two Release assets in addition to the Source code assets.

Am I mistaken?  If not, is there some way in which I can get my hands on such Release assets -or- do I need to set-up my Linux machine to build and create a functioning release?

using hyperledger/besu:latest will get the latest release quality release, 20.10.3 in this case.  hyperledger/besu:develop will get you the latest SNAPSHOT build.  SNAPSHOT builds are not recommended for production environments.

Im working with Besu on kubernetes. I seem to have everything working correctly on server side.

Able to connect via Metamask

Able to see my balance of ETH in the hyperledger permissioned network (clique)

When I go to send eth from one account to a random other account, I get stuck in pending transaction in metamask

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 18:13:36 GMT):<br/>
I guess a local network given your answer. If you restart your network but still use the same accounts to interact with it using metamask, you may have to reset the accounts in metamask when you start a new network.

Thanks for a prompt response.

Ive successfully tested hosting locally before, moving tokens with metamask following the tutorial for permissioned network.

This is besu permissioned network in the cloud.
Just going over it with my dev-ops person. I was looking at the accounts-allowlist, it seems he left it empty.

If my account is not in accounts-allowlist for a permissioned clique network, this would be the behavior we expect right? We are trying to fix that and see what happens.

When I'm using privacy (besu, orion) how does one do a call on a private contract that uses privateFor and privateFrom?  I tried using the public call rpc method but it returns null and priv_call seems to be only enabled for privacy groups.
</p>
<p><strong>mharrison</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 22:36:00 GMT):<br/>
Also when using privacy groups, it seems that more complex variables like `struct` doesn't return a tuple when doing a call, it just returned the first variable in the list.

When returning `<array>.length` it only returns 0 after pushing in a struct into an array.  Seems like something may be broken or I have it setup incorrectly. Does anyone have any insight into this? The web3-eea examples don't have any contracts using `struct`

@shemnon hi do you have a recommendation setup for production in Hyperledger Besu IBFT 2.0? because in our setup we have 4, t3 medium to run ibft 2 setup

hi guys, what is the BonsaiAccount class why this is implemented and differs from previou version?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 13:53:04 GMT):<br/>
Bonsai Tries is the new experimental data storage format.  BonsaiAccount is one of the implementing classes.  It's not ready for production use yet and is gated by a feature flag.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 13:54:49 GMT):<br/>
production setup depends on tps load.  starting with 4x t3.medium should be a good start.  The next move would be to an i3.medium or a t3.large.  It's hard to predict what will need upgrading first, the cpu or the i/o speed, but I'm guessing it will be the i.o speed and the t3->i3 and keeping data on the SSD would be the first scaling action.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 13:55:58 GMT):<br/>
I expect you should be on i3 boxes before t3.xlarge is a consideration.  But that depends on total usage levels and t3.med is as low as you would want to go for production.
</p>
<p><strong>Helder_jn_Pinto</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 14:00:44 GMT):<br/>
ok, so is a feature for scaling the performace of storage, right?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 14:36:57 GMT):<br/>
Yes.

<p><strong>mharrison</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 18:10:15 GMT):<br/>
So I know orion functionality will be merged into tessera, but after flattening the contract and removing the structs, I was able to retrieve the data I needed.  So I believe there is a bug with besu, orion, privacyGroups and solidity structs.  Should I report it on besu github, or does it matter at this point.  I imagine it may be an issue with besu's world state

<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 21:37:07 GMT):<br/>
Hey @al0818, Not sure I can offer perfect advice on this, but by and large, I'd run more than 4 validators, and less than 20 (that's the upper limit we've proven roughly works).
If you're running cloud based, I'd suggest using 4 geo/availability zones - just to make sure that if one zone goes down, my blockchain can continue (but maybe that's being a little over defensive).
Set your blocktime to be how often you'd like blocks to be produced, and set your requesttimeoutseconds to be maybe 5 seconds longer than that - this may need tuning once you've spun up your network (will be affected by geographic layout).
Not sure if there's other advice out there :) But good luck, and let us know how you go!
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 21:40:17 GMT):<br/>
Hey @EmcLab, That log snippet actually looks pretty good - the second last line shows a new block being imported at 303917 ...
When you say the "nodes stopped" - do you mean they stopped producing blocks, or the processes themselves stopped?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 21:42:47 GMT):<br/>
Please open a bug in Besu with as much information as possible. And if you have a sample contract with minimum functionality to exercise the bug it will be awesome!
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 21:46:21 GMT):<br/>
Even when a transaction is sent using privateFrom/privateFor, behind the scenes a privacy group is assigned to it.

To find out the privayGroupId that was created, you should use priv_findPrivacyGroup (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#priv_findprivacygroup).

You'll notice that there will be one privacy group with type LEGACY. This is the one that correspond to the privateFrom/privateFor tx. And then you can use this id for all priv calls that need a privacy group id.

Is Hyperledger Besu free to use for commercial?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 01:32:16 GMT):<br/>
Besu is Apache licensed.  You can do (almost) whatever you what you want with it.  There are members of Hyperledger that will offer you support contracts if you want or need them.  There are successful deployments with and without support contracts, YMMV.

<p><strong>huanniu</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 09:42:14 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 20:41:06 GMT):<br/>
This is done in preperation for Bonsai Tries.  Bonsai Tries will be storing world state by block hash rather than by world state root.  All calls need to provide both but the particular data storage layout will use only one of the parameters.

Fabric channels are more independent chains (with their own genesis) where only allowed users can transact. It's close to what we call state channels on Ethereum too.
Besu privacy groups are defined on your chain directly as smart contracts and private transaction data is stored in the private transaction manager, only a privacy marker is visible on the public chain. Who can participate is handled by the privacy group smart contract on your main chain and the privacy manager looks at the smart contract to decide if it can give you access to the private transaction data.

Hi, its possible to start one besu client IBFT  with previous blocks mined like 2000 and start all network and clients in block 1800
</p>
<p><strong>Helder_jn_Pinto</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 13:21:12 GMT):<br/>
My real question is, what we have as tools to fix a wrong block due an error of deploying different versions of the block processors.
</p>
<p><strong>Helder_jn_Pinto</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 13:24:00 GMT):<br/>
supposing if on block x after deploy 4 ibft validators with version 1 and 2 besu clients as public peers and bootnodes as version 2, the users only have access to public nodes ...
</p>
<p><strong>Helder_jn_Pinto</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 13:24:33 GMT):<br/>
when the transaction enter in public nodes its processed like needs becasuse is version 2
</p>
<p><strong>Helder_jn_Pinto</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 13:25:23 GMT):<br/>
but validators as version 1 mismatch  root state and disconnect
</p>
<p><strong>Helder_jn_Pinto</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 13:26:06 GMT):<br/>
in this case the solution is simple remove the database of 4 validators in version 1.
</p>
<p><strong>Helder_jn_Pinto</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 13:26:30 GMT):<br/>
update client version of validators to version 2 and sync with public nodes
</p>
<p><strong>Helder_jn_Pinto</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 13:27:59 GMT):<br/>
but if the case is inverse, public nodes as v1 and validators v2, we lost an transaction that fails in v1 and not in v2
</p>
<p><strong>Helder_jn_Pinto</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 13:29:04 GMT):<br/>
what is the procedure to fix this mistake on database
</p>
<p><strong>Helder_jn_Pinto</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 13:30:20 GMT):<br/>
how we rolback this transaction that fail in v1, implement hardfork with right transaction processor at block X?
</p>
<p><strong>KingAlawaka</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 18:56:21 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:15:59 GMT):<br/>
So . . . . I've got the Besu Quickstart up and running on Azure.  According to the Grafana dashboard, everything is functioning perfectly.
Now, I want to connect an outside node to it.
I've added  the following to validator1 (the bootnode) in docker-compose.yml
    ports:
      - 30303:30303
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:16:32 GMT):<br/>
I have opened port 30303 in the Azure networking the same way I opened the Grafana port
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:17:45 GMT):<br/>
I have an external node that can connect to the public Ethereum network but cannot connect to my Quickstart
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:18:07 GMT):<br/>
What am I likely doing wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:20:18 GMT):<br/>
Also, what is the best way to make the other peers visible?  Should I give them all externally accessible ports and have the bootnode list and connect via those instead of using the internal ports?
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:21:42 GMT):<br/>
Or can I just map their 30303s to something like 30304 and 30305 and 30306 and they will discover anything that connects to the bootnode?
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 22:56:52 GMT):<br/>
----------------------------------------
A few more details and something I just discovered:

My outside node's command line is 

bin/besu --bootnodes=enode://45f5f4a243fe851b025d622140f92d645bc04a0eb67589c4d6a21a5f9f367e600637d83546c3cbf9ccfa2fae072a1fa08e236d222b3262a685c15225540df2ee@20.44.99.125:30303 --data-path=besudata --genesis-file=ibft2Genesis.json --min-gas-price=0

If I change the hexadecimal part of the enode, there is no apparent difference in behavior (as long as it has the correct number of bytes.
Indeed, if I change the ip address of the enode, there is no apparent difference in behavior.

Where should the bootnode be showing up in the startup messages?
WHat am I doing wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 23:00:25 GMT):<br/>
-----------------------------------
If I put the bootnodes in a config file, would that work better?
What if I defined static nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 01:02:08 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Helder_jn_Pinto, There's a few things going on with your idea, and its worth breaking them down individually:
1. A public node doesn't mine blocks, therefore any transactions submitted to it is forwarded to the Validator for inclusion in a block. If the transaction is invalid (or makes the block invalid) - it will be discarded by the validator, and will never make it onto the blockchain
2. All nodes in a network need to have the same understanding of where hard-forks exist (as define in the genesis file) - otherwise some nodes will halt (or fork away?)
3. You can't add retrospective hard-forks, they really need to be added to the genesis file for a block in the future - and any new nodes which join the network need this genesis file with all hard-forks in it - or else they will stop synching when they reach the fork-block (as the block will appear invalid, or have an incorrect state-root)
</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 01:44:22 GMT):<br/>
Hi @mwaser, Can you run your external node with debug logging on using --logging=debug to your command line so we can if there are any errors relating to establishing a peer connection. Is the same ibft genesis file being used on both the quickstart nodes and your external node? And is the public quickstart node 30303 accessible from the external nodes environment using telnet or something similar?

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 13:23:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi @jframe   Thank you so much for offering to assist.

Additional information:  The "remote" node is my home desktop.  It connects to the public Ethereum network and starts syncing with no problem.

The ibft genesis file on my desktop was directly copied from the Azure quickstart setup.

Telnet confirms that the Azure port is open
mwaser@DESKTOP-PP2MO7N:~$ telnet 20.44.99.125 30303
Trying 20.44.99.125...
Connected to 20.44.99.125.
Escape character is '^]'.

Portnet (http://portquiz.net:30303/) confirms that my outgoing port is open (always a good thing to check since home routers generally block it ;-)
Actually though, since my remote node did connect to the public Ethereum network, I should already have known that.  :-P

==> Looking at it with fresh eyes - the log file shows no signs of having seen the --bootnodes argument.

Log file is at https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgHGbmIQpIRChLBUXT0bSW1ddSN0IA?e=M7arzd 

I'm going to try using a config file next and then static nodes.

Is there anything else you can see?

Thanks!

Mark

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 14:41:09 GMT):<br/>
config file didn't work -- no sign of the bootnode being referenced (which may be correct but I have no idea)

The only real difference I see between public Ethereum startup and the quickstart startup is that  just after

OK.  So static nodes worked -- mostly.  I connected but then am running into security problems.  Time to try to go dig into that.  Any suggestions welcome.  I would also love to know why the --bootnodes command line argument and the config file didn't work . . . .

Thanks, I've fixed my network, I start the network with validators with the same database and the same genesis for hardforks and client version 1, it took some time to continue mining at start (maybe some background schedule or verification ???), I needed also reschedule the last hardfork to future block and deploy with new version.

Still trying to get an external node to connect to my Besu Quick Start.  I'm to the point where I need to work on Permissions.

I'm using the instructions at https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Permissioning/Getting-Started-Onchain-Permissioning/ 

I've gotten virtually all the way through.  When my Metamask was pointed at the public Ethereum Network, the program recognized that and gave the correct error message.

Unfortunately, when Metamask is pointed at my Besu Quickstart the following occurs

Using Typescript 3.2.1 (per previous error message saying I needed to downgrade)

Web browser starts up & console says "Files successfully emitted, waiting for typecheck results..."

After five minutes of watching the blue spinning loop on the Besu Permissioning page, I get the following error on both the web browser and the console

Failed to compile.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Doing more research, I note that asserts wasn't added to Typescript until version 3.7 (i.e. well after the versions we're supposed to be using).

Hi!  Thanks for responding.  

I switched over to trying to build a functioning release (I'm failing with a last compile error as described at the bottom of the chat) & actually missed your reply until now . . . .

The release artefacts seem to be missing a config.json that is necessary.  Below is the session where I ran http-server and tried both firefox and chrome against it . . . .

You need to provide the  config.json file with some info about your setup (https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts#deploying-the-dapp) :)

Hi @mwaser - is the error from MetaMask or from Typescript?
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Wed, 27 Jan 2021 04:31:19 GMT):<br/>
@Julian178 we've run networks with upto 20 validators and it seemed to run ok (though all in the same data centre from memory). The question probably comes down to "how many validators are likely to become corrupted/crash in the same time period" - then build a network which supports that many simultaneous failures.
I.e. 4 validators is _fine_ if you only expect 1 node to be offline at any time. 
If you think there's a risk that 4 validators might be failed at the same time, then you need to have at least 12 validators in the network to prevent the chain from halting

Hi All,  I need help  with permissioning BESU DAPP.
</p>
<p><strong>EmilianoVernini</strong> (Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:49:05 GMT):<br/>
We are working to build a permissioned network, so only indentified organization can join the nwtwork and add a node, but public meaning that all the users can submit transaction to the network. But we must avoid that users can deploy new smart contracts. ```
There is a way to do this just using the permissiong DAPP (for example by defining an authorization policy)?```
Thanks, Emiliano

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=6fQ4HcNuN3ySLXHCq) Thanks for answer! I was referring to the maximum number of validators, as we have already a network of 50 nodes and all of them are asking to be validators. We are concern that making all of them validators the performance of the network will decrease

The standard DAPP implementation doesn't provide this functionality. Any account added to the allowed-list will have its transactions accepted by the nodes.

However, the rule check that is done in the smart contract can be customised to fit other use cases like yours.

Take a look at https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/AccountRules.sol#L76 and you'll see that the smart contract is only checking if the account belongs to a list of authorised accounts, but the api has got all the information regarding a tx that can be used to write custom rules.

For example, you could check if the 2nd address parameter (to) is null, what implies a contract deployment, and check the sender address agains another list, of accounts that can deploy contracts.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 27 Jan 2021 21:08:40 GMT):<br/>
By extending the contract you can create your own rules.

I think you are seeing issues with the very secure randomization of the secp256k1 library.  It drains the native entropy and takes time to re-fill.  Here's how the ethereum hive tests fixed it: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/1464#issuecomment-710027687

Hi @mwaser, you may need to remove the Migrations contract. Once you enable the permissioning, Truffle may be unable to complete the Migrations cycle trying to invoke `setCompleted` method. I think [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/master/packages/migrate/Migration.js#L97) you'll find the relevant part of the Truffle source code
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 18:41:15 GMT):<br/>
Same thing happened with the Admin contract after I removed the Migrations contract.

Is my block gas limit possibly too high?  I set it per the zero-price-gas instructions . . . .

Removing the zero gas price also had no effect.

I'm at a loss here.  I'm clearly connected to my node and the transaction hash indicates that it has been submitted.  Are blocks not being produced because there is only one node?  That would make sense except the instructions say that you're starting with one node.  I'm at a total loss here.   :-(

<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 20:16:27 GMT):<br/>
If you start the node with `BESU_LOGGING=TRACE`, you should see messages containing *Account permissioning - Smart Contract* that may tell you what's going on

Don't archive sync a mainnet node.  It will take months and use 6+ Tib of storage (https://etherscan.io/chartsync/chainarchive).  Testnets would be quicker, classic can be done full, and most private networks I expect could be full synced if the tx load is below mainnet.

My use case is explicitly ETH archive mainnet though.  Just want to try an alternative to Open Ethereum, though also with tracing support and EIP-1898.  I had a big difference in sync time between OE3.0 (3-4 weeks) and OE2.5 (almost 2 months), that's why i'm asking what the experience is with besu is and which release would be best to start from ?

Hi, I am building a permissioned network that has an onchain permissioning check. I cannot understand why a new node has the option to participate in the permissiong or not. In other words, I cannot understand the flag permissions-nodes-contract-enabled. In each condition this flag should be false in this context?
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 20:41:44 GMT):<br/>
I mean, the network is already working and the nodes are using the onchain permissiong.
What happens when a new node wants to join this network with this flag (permissions-nodes-contract-enabled) off?
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 20:42:59 GMT):<br/>
Actually, we are having some problems to include a new node and we received the suggestion to disable this flag on the new node. So, We are trying to understand how this works.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 23:12:33 GMT):<br/>
Say nodes A and B are already running with permissioning enabled, and node C starts up with permissioning disabled - node C can only connect to A/B if their permissioning rules permit node C, otherwise they will reject the connection.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 23:14:05 GMT):<br/>
Alternatively, node C starts with permissioning enabled - nodes A/B  still need to add C to their rules, and node C will connect only to bootnodes until it is in sync (and can thus then get the latest state of the onchain permissioning rules).
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 23:14:38 GMT):<br/>
More context for bootnodes and permissioning here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Permissioning/Onchain-Permissioning/#bootnodes

<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 23:59:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi @macfarla. I tried the link you mentioned but there is no much info. 
In my case, I have  nodes A and B are already running with permissioning enabled. I want to include a bootnode C. C is permissioned (using onchain permissioning).
For some reason, however, C cannot connect. 
I was informed to start C with its flag false to solve the problem. 
So, two questions.
Does this recommendation make sense? What is the logic behind it? In this case, putting this flag to false helps in any way?

starting C with permissioning disabled won't really help in this case. I would 1. check that A and B list C as a bootnode and 2. check that they connect if you turn permissioning off on A and B. 3. you can check the logs to see which node is rejecting the connection (A/B or C?)

Hi, I am trying to create a set of metrics to monitor a permissioned Besu network. Among the metrics, I want to have an idea of how many transactions are arriving in each the writer node. I found the metric besu_transaction_pool_transactions_added_total. Is it the correct one to use? Will it give the total number in the mempool (all transactions that still not entered in the blockchain)?

Running with --logging=DEBUG it is endlessly trying to connect to peers with no blocks being produced.

Another oddity is that even after seeing "JSON-RPC service started and listening on 127.0.0.1:8545", trying to send a miner_start (using the besu Postman export) results in an ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8545

I'm guessing that the miner_start should be unnecessary but I'm trying everything . . . .

My command line is 
bin/besu --genesis-file=testconfig/genesis.json --node-private-key-file=testconfig/key --min-gas-price=0 --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase=0xC3D693fBE006154eF80C288DB527FaC4bd38ca09 --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=ETH,MINER --logging=DEBUG --data-path=chester

I'm trying to start with a single node in order to use on-chain permissioning but I can't get it to mine.  Dropping back to just trying to get it to mine with --logging=DEBUG is just endlessly trying to connect to peers with no blocks being produced.

Another oddity is that even after seeing "JSON-RPC service started and listening on 127.0.0.1:8545", trying to send a miner_start (using the besu Postman export) results in an ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8545

I'm guessing that the miner_start should be unnecessary but I'm trying everything . . . .

My command line is
bin/besu --genesis-file=testconfig/genesis.json --node-private-key-file=testconfig/key --min-gas-price=0 --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase=0xC3D693fBE006154eF80C288DB527FaC4bd38ca09 --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=ETH,MINER --logging=DEBUG --data-path=chester

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 17:47:05 GMT):<br/>
Fantastic catch.  That solved it.

I guess I'll go grab dev.json and start swapping lines one by one . . . . (I'll let you know what blocked mining).

THANK YOU!

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 17:48:33 GMT):<br/>
SOLVED By @diegoll by using --network=dev instead of my genesis file.
Time to go grab dev.json and start swapping lines one by one
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 18:31:53 GMT):<br/>
awesome! I'm glad it helped :)
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:22:38 GMT):<br/>
So, I see the problem now . . . .

I need ethash rather than ibft2

but . . . . can I change that later?

I started trying permissioning with a set of four nodes modified from the quick-start but reverted to a single-node to debug.  DO I need to go back to that?  :-(
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:27:41 GMT):<br/>
no, that's part of the genesis so you cannot change the consensus algorithm later AFAIK. If you go back into your four nodes setup you'll need to setup the initial set of validators to match the addresses for each of the participants
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:29:51 GMT):<br/>
there is a tool for generating a genesis with 4 validators properly setup plus their private keys https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-IBFT-Network/#3-generate-node-keys-and-a-genesis-file
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:32:18 GMT):<br/>
So . . . . with the four-node setup, they were all in a permssions_config.toml and that worked just fine (which is the exact equivalent to your link).

Then, I tried switching to on-chain permissioning . . . .
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:33:33 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to have to go back to be sure -- but I believe that the second I added the 
--permissions-nodes-contract-enabled  --permissions-nodes-contract-address "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000009999"
it all stopped working
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:42:01 GMT):<br/>
ok, so you are looking for an IBFT2 network with on-chain permissioning. I would go step by step.
- Generate the genesis with the tool
- Modify the genesis and add the proper Ingress contract as stated here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Permissioning/Getting-Started-Onchain-Permissioning/#add-the-ingress-contracts-to-the-genesis-file
- Start the four nodes without permissioning enabled and check that they are generating blocks well
- stop the nodes and start them with the flags and check if they are still generating blocks (they should b/c the ingress by default doesn't restrict any connection)
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:43:05 GMT):<br/>
I've always had the contracts in the genesis because the quick-start has them
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:43:29 GMT):<br/>
ok, great
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:44:29 GMT):<br/>
so if you start the four nodes you can see them producing blocks but when you enable the on-chain permissioning on the four nodes then you don't see the blockchain moving?
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:44:44 GMT):<br/>
correct.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:45:48 GMT):<br/>
The bootnode shows 7 peers (I made the quick-starts members peers as well) but each of the other nodes shows only one peer.  When it is working, they all show 7 peers.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:46:22 GMT):<br/>
NOTE:  I just restarted the working network with only the two argument different -- so that is what has me tripped up.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:48:46 GMT):<br/>
ok... this is interesting... looking at the source code for the NodeIngress it works different as the AccountIngress that I was used to use. The AccountIngress allows any transaction to go through when there is no configuration by default, but it seems that the NodeIngress rejects everyconnection by default https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/NodeIngress.sol#L29
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:50:13 GMT):<br/>
so I would say that before enabling the permissioning, you should deploy your own https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/NodeRulesProxy.sol and set it in the 0x00....9999 contract
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:50:54 GMT):<br/>
as a first attempt I would try just returning true for every connection attempt
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:50:54 GMT):<br/>
as a first try I would try just returning true for every connection attempt
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:50:54 GMT):<br/>
as a first step I would try just returning true for every connection attempt
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:53:28 GMT):<br/>
once you deploy your own `NodesRulesProxy` you'll only need to invoke `setContractAddress` into the `0x00...9999` contract pointing to your own contract
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:53:28 GMT):<br/>
once you deploy your own `NodesRulesProxy` you'll only need to invoke `setContractAddress` into the `0x00...9999` contract pointing to your own contract address
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:53:39 GMT):<br/>
I was just looking at accounts ingress.  It looks like it disallows everything by default as well -- except it is my understanding that the first (admin) account is set up by the migrate . . . .
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:54:43 GMT):<br/>
if there is no proxy contract setup, the accounts ingress allows every transaction AFAICS https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/AccountIngress.sol#L23
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:57:07 GMT):<br/>
Wouldn't it just be easier to change the nodes contract to be like the accounts contract?

I.e. change the false in the following to true

        if(getContractAddress(RULES_CONTRACT) == address(0)) {
            return false;
        }
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:57:48 GMT):<br/>
Or would that block setting up new rules?
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:58:35 GMT):<br/>
(I missed the false/true switch before when I was comparing the two)
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:58:38 GMT):<br/>
well, yes... but then you'll need to properly setup the assembly code in the genesis on your own b/c it'll differ from the one provided by the tool. In this case, being just changing a boolean I think it's safe enough
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:59:24 GMT):<br/>
on other cases, setting up the storage for the contract may not be so straightforward
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:59:52 GMT):<br/>
Mmm.  Good point.  I forgot that the  Genesis was *_special_*
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 21:00:32 GMT):<br/>
haha you can give it a try, but maybe you'll be changing many pieces at the same time
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 21:00:49 GMT):<br/>
gotta go, I'll check later how it went
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 21:01:13 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 22:43:43 GMT):<br/>
Yea, there's no good metric at the moment.  besu_transaction_pool_transactions_added_total and besu_transaction_pool_transactions_removed_total will always go up, added - removed is a rough estimate of the size, but because of besu_transaction_pool_transactions_duplicates_total that will never to to zero.  In theory subtracting duplicates removed should get that.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 22:43:52 GMT):<br/>
Really we need to add a new metric that is a gauge metric.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 22:49:31 GMT):<br/>
So . . . . I'm trying to work my way through exactly how to do this.

QUESTION 1.  Am I correct in assuming that, contrary to the instructions, I do not have to add the two command line arguments until after I migrate/deploy the contracts?  If I'm wrong, aren't I dead in the water?

QUESTION 2.  I don't see where  the admin tool requires the command line arguments to be in place before it will function.  Am I missing something or could it be as easy as migrating the contracts, running the admin tool and then restarting after adding the command line args?

If the admin tool does require the command line arguments, it seems as if I have two options.
Both involve altering enodePermitted in NodeRules.sol

1.  Just include my initial nodes as always returning true before the exists call for everything else.  I can even leave the code in place forever.
2.  Always return true, wait until the network is all connected and then migrate again with the normal contract file (I assume that the nodes won't check again until they have to reconnect for some reason).

What do you think? I'd love it if the answer to question 2 was DOH!  It is that easy.  

I'm way past quitting time so I'll try it tomorrow if you think it'll work.

Do you mean [these](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Permissioning/Getting-Started-Onchain-Permissioning/) instructions? I think those instructions aren't necessarily for the use case when you start a PoA network with 4 validators. I think what they propose there is to start with a single node, setup everything to be controlled from it and then make it grow (allow specific peers, vote for new validators, etc).  In the case of  starting with 4 validators I would say you'll need to go with what we discussed earlier
  1. set the ingress at `0x...9999` in your genesis
  1. deploy your own `NodeRulesProxy` (as said, just make one that always return true)
  1. set it it in the _ingress_
  1. stop the whole network (without loosing the state for each node)
  1. restart all of the participants with the options mentioned in the instructions.
About your second question, I'm sorry but I'm not familiar with the admin tool at all, but I would imagine it's meant to be used with the [NodesRules.sol](https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/NodeRules.sol) that Consensys provide. If you want to use this contract, that would be the second bullet of the previous list then, and you'll need to add another step after that to setup this contract instance (either manually hitting the smart contract or through the admin tool)

Hi... I'm new to Besu and have recently started exploring it and have basic queries.  
1. After deploying a permissioned network using OnChain settings can it be reverted back to being permissionless?
2. Also can an ongoing public network be introduced with onchain permissions?
thanks in advance for any help.

Hi there hope you guys are doing great. I have been working with besu and have some questions

https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts#deploying-the-dapp Do I need this to work with permissioned besu? Can I just use my smart contracts as is?

Right now what I have been able to do is connect to metamask and run txs on the besu network. I have been able to run truffle migrate to do some migrations to the network.

Now what I cannot do
Use  remix to read from the block chain
Use ethers.js to connect to smart contracts -> gives me error :
UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: contract not deployed (contractAddress="0xF9e0929a9D7D5AA6991C441B1FE23901d1193c4a", operation="getDeployed", version=4.0.47)
[0]     at Object.throwError (...node_modules\ethers\errors.js:76:17)

Any tips on how to use my private key to whitelist me when querying this blockchain?

I have also had problems with the eth lite explorer from the documentation. Issue here

Hi. I am starting with the account permissioning and I was surprised to note that the default implementation of permissioning smart contracts use the same set of admins to node permissioning and account permissioning. That is not the reality in our network. We want to segregate these roles. Are there a ready implementation of permissioning smart contract that segregate the admins of these two different functions?
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 20:06:30 GMT):<br/>
Hello, I think if you deploy two instances of the [Admin.sol](https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/Admin.sol) contract and set them into the corresponding ingress (accounts or nodes), you should have two different set of administrators. Would that be enough for your use case?
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 20:32:57 GMT):<br/>
It would definitely help. I need to check if it would be just a matter of two deploys or if there is any other impact. 
The permissioning dapp will also be impacted.

<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 20:33:40 GMT):<br/>
I am wondering if it is a frequent issue and if there is a ready solution to that.
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 21:40:16 GMT):<br/>
Also, I believe it is very common to have the admin role of the permissioning dapps linked to a multisig contract. Do you have this ready? What multisig contract do you recommend?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 21:48:56 GMT):<br/>
the short answer to both is yes :)
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 21:50:40 GMT):<br/>
to achieve 1. you just need to restart nodes with the permissions-enabled option/s set to false
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 21:56:34 GMT):<br/>
to achieve 2 (assuming you want to continue with an existing genesis and chain) is slightly more complicated if you don't have the onchain contracts already deployed - you will need to deploy them and set the permissions-enabled option/s as well as the contract-address values, and ensure that all the nodes/accounts you want to participate are added to the allowlists. Permissioning with a public network can be a bit counter-intuitive though so whether it will work well depends on what your use case is
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 22:03:39 GMT):<br/>
We don't have a ready solution to this. You are right that the dapp currently doesn't support this. You could do the 2 deploys as @diegoll suggests and interact with the second one using remix
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 22:05:21 GMT):<br/>
There is also the environment variable INITIAL_ADMIN_ACCOUNTS which is used by the migration scripts to set initial values in the contract - you could duplicate this - but this will only help with initial values - if you need to add/remove admins, this will mean interacting with the contract
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 22:07:41 GMT):<br/>
Updating the dapp isn't on our immediate roadmap at this stage, unfortunately - but feel free to create an issue on the repo and we can see if there is appetite for it
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 22:17:22 GMT):<br/>
you don't _need_ the dapp - you can interact with the smart contracts using your preferred method
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 22:19:21 GMT):<br/>
Besu permissioning doesn't rely on private keys - if MetaMask can connect to your node, the alethio explorer should be able to as well.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 22:20:33 GMT):<br/>
the fromBlock parameter is used to define the range of blocks to search for private logs, just the same as for public logs
</p>
<p><strong>eum602</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 22:24:20 GMT):<br/>
Please @macfarla could you let me know where are the private logs stored and how  they are related to the blocks in the public chain? thanks
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 22:58:04 GMT):<br/>
private logs are stored in the private state, they are events emitted by private contracts
</p>

Hey all,
Currently writing some tests which would benefit hugely from an easy-to-use test parameterization framework (a la JUnit-5) ... is there any appetite to move from JUnit4 --> JUnit5?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 04:56:21 GMT):<br/>
permission denied - the process is trying to create a file in /var/log but the directory does not exist or the user doesn't have permission to create a file in that dir. check directory permissions OR change your log4j config - that's what's trying to write to /var/log

@macfarla thanks for your help :relaxed: .
I have some more queries which would require your expertise. As far as my understanding Besu is just an Ethereum client with node permissioning enabled.
1. Is a running Besu ledger also compatable with Geth client or something similar?
2. Is Account Permissioning applicable to type of txn also:- 
a. Contract deployment b. transfer/contract interaction txn ?
3. Can geth client be used in conjuction with Besu?
4.  As for permissioning - 'permissions-enabled option/s set to false'  is for disabling Onchain permissioning or Ofchain?
5. I'm running Besu in a permissioned enviornment - nd later want to make it a public chain to expand the customer base, does it require to:
a. self-destruct the permissioning contract if that functionality is available?
b. Emptying the Allowed List of Nodes or Accounts?
c. Any third way which you might suggest?

I know its a very long and complex scenario question, your time and help will be really valuable in understanding the nuances of Besu Protocol.

Thanks again :slight_smile:

Hi All. I'm still dealing with the permissioning dapp and smart contracts. I've modified the smart contract logic in order to allow any user to send a transaction, but only accounts with admin role (added to the allowlist) to deploy a smart contract. I also want to to add a blacklist to list accounts that could not use the blockchain. Now i'm trying to understand if i can update the smart contract on the same blockchain or i have to start a new one with a new genesis block (since the permissioning smart contract bytecode is included in the genesis file).
Thanks! Emiliano

<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 13:42:58 GMT):<br/>
Hi Emiliano. You should be able to update the permissioning proxy calling the `setContractAddress` method of the ingress that you defined in the genesis
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 13:42:58 GMT):<br/>
Hi Emiliano. It would depende if you used the default provided ingress contract or a custom one. In the default you should be able to update the permissioning proxy calling the `setContractAddress` method of the ingress that you defined in the genesis

if you are using a custom one and you don't want to restart the blockchain by changing the genesis, I think you could deploy new contracts respecting the mentioned interfaces, and restart all of your nodes by pointing into those address directly in the [--permissions-accounts-contract-address](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#permissions-accounts-contract-address) and [--permissions-nodes-contract-address](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#permissions-nodes-contract-address) options

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 14:24:27 GMT):<br/>
Let me look for the code snippet, but only the most "recent" registered fork applies.  No matter from what they extend their definition.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 14:26:42 GMT):<br/>
org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.mainnet.ProtocolScheduleBuilder#createProtocolSchedule registers a set of protocol specs in order.  If a block has multiple at the same number the last one registered is used.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 14:27:41 GMT):<br/>
Each spec is 100% independent from prior specs.  However you will notice that the pattern is when we define a spec we reference the prior spec.  This is how we get the definition of "Muir Glacier is Istanbul plus Difficulty Defuse".
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 14:28:50 GMT):<br/>
If we added a definition that skipped muir glacier but exetended from petersburg things would work just fine.  We also don't need to list all fork blocks in a genesis.config.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 14:29:48 GMT):<br/>
So while we say skipping a fork block (like setting istanbulBlock to zero) implies that all the other forks that is only because the definition for istanbul includes all those changes.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 14:31:13 GMT):<br/>
This is how we support classic forks.  Many classic fork blocks skip features mainnet has (like block reward changes) and there are classic changes not in mainnet (difficulty defuse and block reward schedule policy for example).
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 14:31:52 GMT):<br/>
so you don't need to remove other hard forks from the code.
</p>
<p><strong>helderjnpinto</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 14:55:46 GMT):<br/>
ok, resuming i not want muirGlacier :sweat_smile: , i have a forkA(extended from istanbulDefinition that starts in blockNumber 0 in custom genesis) and forkB(extends forkA for a blockNumber 1000), in the code i need to extend muirGlacier from (forkA) instead of actual (istambulDefinition) OR just add my forksA and B put my definitions in the code and set in genesis only this two forks configs stay the all like it is ?

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 15:00:43 GMT):<br/>
Just use forkA and forkB in the genesis config.  Have ForkB extend ForkA.

@shemnon, do we have a metric to check if the besu nodes have their permissioning flag enable? I mean, if any node in the network forgot to enable this flag, we can have problems, so it would be nice to monitor this. What do you think?

Hello everyone, I've been testing eth_getLogs and priv_getLogs, I am surprised that even when I have --auto-log-bloom-caching-enabled some tests takes too long to resolve(It is with the besu version 20.10.2). The same happens when searching private logs (in this case I noticed that searching a range greater than 100K blocks can throw a timeout error, I assume it is because the search is slow).

SIGH.  FINAL rat-simple resolution (isn't it always that way?  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: )

Deploy quickstart somewhere in the cloud with local node info added to permissions_config.toml

Do NOT run with the 
--permissions-nodes-contract-enabled 
--permissions-nodes-contract-address 
options

The four (or in my modified case seven) quickstart nodes mine nicely.

Connect the local node to the blockchain.

Deploy the contracts to the local node.

Run the admin tool.

NOW you can stop and restart all the nodes with the 
--permissions-nodes-contract-enabled 
--permissions-nodes-contract-address 
options

It was my attempts to run with the command line arguments at the beginning that kept the quickstart from working and mining and I never should have expected a single BFT node to mine . . .  Ah well.  It's all good now.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 23:01:01 GMT):<br/>
individual nodes can turn their permissioning on and off, so it can change over time.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 23:03:47 GMT):<br/>
I don't know what your use case is - but even if you know that all the nodes have permissioning enabled, they could be pointing to different contracts so I think you're going to have to have some level of trust and/or control outside of this
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 23:06:01 GMT):<br/>
1. yes Besu can talk to Geth and other nodes - we run Besu nodes on mainnet, goerli and other test nets
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 23:07:07 GMT):<br/>
2. you would need to extend the existing smart contract implementation to add more granular permissions. If you search this channel you will find other users doing exactly this
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 23:07:22 GMT):<br/>
3. see 1
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 23:08:12 GMT):<br/>
4. Whichever permissioning method you are using - all are false by default so whichever ones you have set to true
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 23:09:33 GMT):<br/>
5. if you turn permissioning off on that node (see 4) and restart, it will ignore the smart contract - you don't have to destroy the contract.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 23:12:13 GMT):<br/>
I should add - it can change over time _in theory_ but in practice it probably won't
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 23:12:25 GMT):<br/>
but I guess that also depends on your use case
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 23:17:34 GMT):<br/>
So we do have a whole set of metrics that count permits and denys for each permissioning scheme.  If there are any metrics that have `besu_permissioning_` as a prefix then permissioning is enabled.  But our devops guru said that metrics are not meant for echoing configurations.

<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 10:54:49 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for your reply. The original idea was to check if a node is misbehaving by lefting its flag disable in a permissioned newtork. By not checking permissiong, a node would allow other nodes to connect and send transactions and it can be an issue. This rule could be included in an offchain legal agreement among the nodes. 
Since the flag is not enough, the metric would need to check that every node is using the same smart contract to check permissions. If any deviation is detected, the misbehaving node should be pushined.
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 10:57:35 GMT):<br/>

Hi Suzana, the node itself signs RLPx messages as part of the wire protocol and also, in an IBFT network, it adds their signature to the proposed block in each round (and eventually, as you said, they can cast a vote for add/remove a member)

Hello, we've been testing performance under a continuous 200 tps load on hyperledger besu using IBFT 2.0, however we noticed that some transactions that had an invalid nonce were kept in the transaction pool and taking place there and slowing down the generation of blocks by the validator nodes. With a transaction pool of 4096 transactions it was full with these invalid nonce transactions, is this a bug or is there some configuration to ignore invalid nonce transactions from filling the pool.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sat, 06 Feb 2021 23:20:04 GMT):<br/>
Can you qualify what you mean by invalid nonce? Was it a nonce that was set to zero for example, or was less than the current account nonce?
</p>
<p><strong>rami.fatayri</strong> (Sun, 07 Feb 2021 15:56:16 GMT):<br/>
There were transactions both that had zero nonce (sent wrong) and some that had non zero nonce but less than the current account nonce.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 07 Feb 2021 22:38:52 GMT):<br/>
There is nothing special about bootnodes, it is only that during discovery, nodes treat addresses in their _bootnodes_ list differently. But a bootnode doesn't know it's a bootnode for other nodes, if that makes sense. So - it shouldn't be different. I would ask 1. did the "bootnode" have other nodes for its bootnodes? Because with onchain permissioning, a new node has to sync with the chain in order to get the latest state of the permissioning contracts ie the allowlist. So if the new node has no bootnodes (or has discovery disabled) it can't connect to any nodes because its allowlist is effectively empty.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 07 Feb 2021 22:40:18 GMT):<br/>
You can confirm this by looking at the logs to see which node is rejecting the connection.
</p>
<p><strong>rami.fatayri</strong> (Sun, 07 Feb 2021 22:46:38 GMT):<br/>
This behavior seems to be easily reproducible I started fresh besu nodes and sent again this load including some invalid nonce transactions and these transactions remained in the pool. Enabling debug logs shows the node reading them on the generation of every block and logging that the transactions have invalid nonce. So they are being processed on every block and remaining in the pool.

Thank you, @macfarla. Actually, you gave me some instructions in the past saying that it does not make sense. People from other Besu network said that they have seen this behaviour other times in the past. Bootnodes sometimes have problems to syncronize with the flag enable. 
Regarding your question. Yes, the "bootnode with problems to connect" has in its config.toml file other bootnodes. And other bootnodes have also include this new bootnode in theirs config.toml.

Is there any documentation about how close the clock of different nodes need to be? We generate blocks every 2sec and we are facing some issues with clock from nodes that are "on premise". How close the clocks need to be?

Hi @SuzanaMaranhao at the moment IBFT2 expects blocks to not have a timestamp more than 1 second later than current system time.
But, to be honest, its probably a restriction we should/could rethink - its a useful check for PoW, but IBFT2 much less so ...

Sure, since we need to find a solution to this problem as we can't have such a case appearing in production. What should we do?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 22:13:07 GMT):<br/>
It is possible. The dapp would need to send the JWT token in all requests. And the logged in user would need to have permission to the JSON-RPC APIs that the dapp uses. It would depend on your use case as to whether this is worth doing.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 23:11:13 GMT):<br/>
It is hard to suggest a solution without more context. 

If you have control over all nodes in the network, you could prevent misconfigurations by using an automated deployment process.

If you don't have control over the nodes in the network, you can't really prevent another node from misbehaving. As long as the majority of nodes in the network are playing fair, you should be fine and any transactions that aren't allowed won't make it into the canonical chain.

And it isn't possible to prevent a node from relaying messages to an unauthorised node if they don't want to.

Hello @lucassaldanha, yes I read that in the documentation. So the slow responses for private logs makes sense. On the other hand I am curious why public logs have slow responses (when it is supposed that logs bloom caching is enabled). In the past (1 year ago) I tested searching public logs with besu 1.4.1 (with this version the search was performed very fast) but with the version 20.10.2 I notice very slow responses.

Hey @helderjnpinto, I believe the short-answer - it means a peer has sent an invalid peering request - and thus you won't peer with said node.
From memory, its to do with a peer sending an encrypted handshake msg, which contains its node-key - if the encrypting key and the node-key contained therein do not align, you get this error.

This check has been in every version of besu in memory - and its more about the interop between besu and the remote node - and potentially caused by a configuration failure on the other end.

Thank you @lucassaldanha. I agree with you about having an automated deploy process. We have it and it helps a lot. 

However, we definitely do not have control of what other nodes can do. Thank you for explaining that we cannot prevent a node from misbehave.

<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 13:23:46 GMT):<br/>
About this part: " As long as the majority of nodes in the network are playing fair, you should be fine and any transactions that aren't allowed won't make it into the canonical chain". 

IMHO -> I think it is important to implement security barriers in  many layers. Since a misbehaving node can open to the door to many other nodes, unfortunately this permissioning layer, although keeping the data onchain, is still fragile.

Is there any metric that deals with specific transactions in the standard way of doing Besu monitoring? For example, I would love to create an alert if a transaction (any transaction) is still not included in a block after x seconds. I bet the answer is no, but still trying :-)
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 20:56:06 GMT):<br/>
You do need mining enabled if you want transactions to be processed. And truffle migrations send transaction to the node. So you do need to have at least one mining node in your setup.

No, that's not what metrics are for.  The best practice would be for a node to observe the resulting blocks and if it does not see it's transaction committed within a certain window of time to re-submit the transaction.

Hi @mmaryo 1, we have some documentation regarding sending transactions, see https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Transactions/.   Besu does not sign transactions, so you’ll need to use a client library, or use EthSigner to create and sign a transaction.

EthSigner documentation: https://docs.ethsigner.consensys.net/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#eth_sendtransaction

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 13 Feb 2021 23:04:25 GMT):<br/>
This is one of the emergent behaviors of the discovery protocol.  At discovery the nodes do not know key information about other nodes, such as the chainID or clients.  They only know ports and addresses, and sometime fork IDs.  Some clients makes sure the fork IDs match before "knocking," others don't.  My guess is the two red clients are forked off of 1.9.6 geth or earlier.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 13 Feb 2021 23:06:03 GMT):<br/>
So the ports and ips get gossiped across the DHT and once an entry is added it's hard to get it out if it's live.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 13 Feb 2021 23:07:35 GMT):<br/>
One way to make sure these peers get disconnected promptly is to add required blocks to the bootnodes. (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#required-block) - This will cause connected peers to be polled for specific blocks and dropped if the check fails.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 13 Feb 2021 23:09:19 GMT):<br/>
This was initially deployed to deal with the net split style forks often seen in Ropsten but can be used to ensure that different networks that cross-connect will disconnect promptly.  Other blockchains call this "checkpointing"

<p><strong>helderjnpinto</strong> (Sun, 14 Feb 2021 11:22:12 GMT):<br/>

Hi guys! I'm pretty interested in running my own Ethereum Archive Node using the Besu client, especially after the recent support for EIP 1898 (querying by hash), which I was interested to have support for. I'm interested to know how much space does the current Besu requires. The Open Ethereum client goes in the direction of 6.4-6.5T.
</p>
<p><strong>IonutS</strong> (Sun, 14 Feb 2021 17:33:41 GMT):<br/>

Thank you @bgravenorst. I've read that but wasn't sure if is still up to date because 3TB is half of Open Ethereum and is amazing! 
Any reason why it actually requires half of the disk space, are some informations missing from the archive node or do you use compression? The difference is impressive. :-) 

Also I'm curious how far your implementation differs from GETH or Open Ethereum. Is there maybe a comparison table to see which feature is extra and what is maybe missing?

<p><strong>IonutS</strong> (Sun, 14 Feb 2021 23:44:51 GMT):<br/>
The initiative for that comes from me more or less :) But I've found it, it got implemented so v20.10.4 has support for it: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/21.1.0-RC1/CHANGELOG.md
</p>
<p><strong>IonutS</strong> (Sun, 14 Feb 2021 23:46:06 GMT):<br/>
Ah cool, so 4.5 TB maybe is more realistic. Thanks! I would have planned anyway with more than 6 TB, just to be prepared to run it longer.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Sun, 14 Feb 2021 23:49:57 GMT):<br/>
oh, that's great. It seems they forgot to add the entry to the 20.10.4 [changelog](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/20.10.4/CHANGELOG.md) :)
</p>
<p><strong>IonutS</strong> (Sun, 14 Feb 2021 23:51:21 GMT):<br/>
You are totally right. That's why I couldn't find that info in the past as I searched for it also last week or so...
And that's a serious feature. :)

Hey all, when working with Quorum/Geth and Besu, it appears that besu responds differently to a few Json RPCs, to that of Geth. Specifically:
admin_peers.result.id on Besu == node's public key; on Geth == keccack256(publicKey)
admin_nodeInfo.result.id on Besu == node's public key; on Geth == keccack256(publicKey)
I'm assuming its in everyone's best interests if these line up - should Besu be updated to reflect Geth's behaviour?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Mon, 15 Feb 2021 11:22:15 GMT):<br/>
For more info, here are the links to Geth docs (aka the spec):
- https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-admin#admin_peers
- https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-admin#admin_nodeinfo

But we can only deduce that from the example and the return data type is not clearly described. 
We can still ask them what they plan to do though.

Hey everyone, I heard the Consensys founder say in a podcast that eventually Hyperledger Besu will replace GoQourun completely but it would use Tessera as its private transaction manager instead of Orion. Can u allready use this configuration at this point in time or are these two not compatible yet?

Are 12 physical cores(24vcpu) and 128 GB RAM good enough for Besu Archive node?

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 15 Feb 2021 15:13:11 GMT):<br/>
Cores and memory are not the issue in creating the archive node, it's raw disk i/o that is the bottleneck.  While creating the archive node 16-32 Gib should be more than sufficient (16GiB will fall into some cached induced memory pressure during import but if you reboot it every few weeks will be fine).  12 cores will be excessive during the import.  May be useful once service RPCs.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 15 Feb 2021 15:16:31 GMT):<br/>
The lack of clear definition is an issue.  I have a script that uses admin_peers to extract enode URLs from the result, so a keccack in the ID would hurt.  If we do align with Geth I think we should add an "enode" field.

Sure, disks are super important. For that I'll use already use some good NVMe. I run already OE 3.0.1 and a lot of RAM helped due to many issues of OE properly gestioning OOM issues. From what I understand besu seems to be more stable in this regard.

If the IPs are out and in the main DHT other nodes may start connecting.  If you could change the external IPs as well that should address it.  Another option is to add firewall rules blocking it from outside the vpn.

The latest packaged binary is available on Artifactory. See https://hyperledger.jfrog.io/artifactory/besu-binaries/besu/21.1.0-RC2/besu-21.1.0-RC2.zip

The steps you described sounds like you possibly downloaded the source code.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 14:33:15 GMT):<br/>
You can get a balance for any block height after the pivot.  For historical values you will need an archive node.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 14:33:46 GMT):<br/>
Typically the pivot block is around the height of the block chain when the fast sync started.

What library are you using for signing the transaction? I don't see in your code where are you setting the `chainId` value in the `rawTx` object. There are some libraries, like web3js, that can resolve it by calling the `eth_chainId` JSON-RPC method and set the proper one
</p>
<p><strong>adityajoshi12</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 18:18:36 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>adityajoshi12</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 18:19:47 GMT):<br/>

        value: 0,

<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:15:55 GMT):<br/>
it seems to me that this is not an issue on Besu but in the transaction you are intending to send. I'm not used to use `ethereumjs-tx` but on your last modification it looks like what you would need to add is `chainId: 2018` instead of just a single reference to the `chainId` object. Somethig like
```javascript
const rawTx = {
nonce: web3.utils.numberToHex(0),
from: besuAccount.address,
value: 0,
to: null,
data: bytecode,
gasPrice: "0xFFFFFF",
gasLimit: "0xFFFFFFF",
chainId: 2018
};```

Greetings community, I'm new to this protocol and was wondering Hyperledger Besu can also be run for public networks(perhaps switching the permissions off for most part of it except selected components). Does it go against the purpose of Hyperledger Besu and in inadvisable? If not can it be used then with current public ethereum networks as well?
</p>
<p><strong>tomhay</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:33:02 GMT):<br/>
@CodeReaper - Hyperledger Besu can be run for public Ethereum mainnet, as well as testnets. Here is some documentation on how to start Besu for the various networks (mainnet and testnets): https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Starting-node/

by default, when connecting to mainnet, Besu uses [this list](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/ethereum/p2p/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/ethereum/p2p/config/DiscoveryConfiguration.java#L39) of bootnodes

For besu the trace api is simply enabled by using --rpc-ws-api=trace, etc. and --rpc-ws-api=trace, etc. ?
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 19:51:05 GMT):<br/>
I noticed Besu supports push or pull monitoring methods using Prometheus. Is there any significant difference in performance between these two methods considering the Besu node? I mean, is pull more demanding to a Besu node? If we think in a monitoring process running every 1 minute, is it a problem if 20 processes query a Besu node (1 request each 3seconds)? Is it possible that it impacts on the Besu node performance considering a machine good enough? An alternative would be to export the metrics to an external monitoring tool, but it would demand more work to the infra team so we are analyzing possibilities.
</p>
<p><strong>IonutS</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 19:52:22 GMT):<br/>
Or is there another flag. At Open Ethereum was --tracing=on
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 19:55:23 GMT):<br/>
Each request is the same amount of demanding.  All the same metrics are queried.  Typically a prometheus setup will have one centralized prometheus instance polling multiple nodes, not the other way around.  Tools like grafana are put in front of the prometheus instance to render fancier graphs than the prometheus instance can render.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 19:56:16 GMT):<br/>
Another service to pair with prometheus is alertmanager, which can fire off slack alerts based on configurable alerts, such as the process being down, blocks not being produced, node behind chain head for too long.

One quick question about enabling trace api on Besu: is that being activated by simply defining it using --rpc-ws-api=trace, etc. and --rpc-ws-api=trace, etc. ?
</p>
<p><strong>IonutS</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 20:00:17 GMT):<br/>
Also are there any flags related to performance, for example cache size db, blocks, queue ? Same for disks if one uses hdd or ssd/nvme or it doesn't matter?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 20:52:57 GMT):<br/>
If WS and RPC are already enabled those flags will enable it.  If you specify any APIs only those APIs are enabled, so I would include trace,eth,admin,etc.

Hello,
We have noticed that if a private tx reverts (e.g, when a _require_ condition fails), then the private nonce is not incremented. On the other hand, the public nonce, that of the privacy marker tx, do increment. So my question is: ¿is there any way to change this behaviour? We have found it problematic when leading with concurrent private tx, because if tx n fails, then n+1, n+2, etc will also fail.

So my experience so far syncing besu archive node - it went very fast until around 2,2M but now I have the feeling is very slow, syncing at 0,25-0,7Mg/s. An is only block 2,4M where Ethereum wasn't used too much so not that many tx. I use max peers 200. Anything it can be done to improve sync speed? Using nvme disks, 128 GB RAM, 32G min heap with 64G max heap memory and 12 core (24vcore) ryzen.

<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 12:54:15 GMT):<br/>
I think it should be possible. Permissioning is independent of the proof. Bear in mind that the transaction permissioning intercepts incoming transactions where you can check the destination address to be 0x0, but that's not the only way to deploy smart contracts. You can deploy an smart contract from another smart contract and filtering that will be more difficult b/c you'll need to somehow instrument the bytecode of every deployed smart contract to detect that behavior
</p>
<p><strong>prashantgangwar</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 12:57:08 GMT):<br/>
in my case i see this error every time
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 13:59:53 GMT):<br/>
This matches typical experiences.  2.2M block is the "shanghai" attacks and state bloat clearing.  core count and memory isn't the issue it's the serial need to re-calculate the merkle trie.  I/O speed is the blottleneck.  Things will get markedly better in the late 2.xmm blocks when the state clearing ends, then get gradually worse until byzantium fork where we stop calculating state roots in TXes. Then better, then gradually worse due to general use.  You will get some relief at hard forks when storage gas prices go up, but block gas limit always rises. It's months to catch up to chain head via archive sync.
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 14:01:58 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for your reply, @shemnon
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 14:07:06 GMT):<br/>
So let's say that all the smart-contracts that are deployed were allowed by this whitelisting. None of them allow to deploy other smart-contracts or at least they were all intentional. The first check on the parent contract should be sufficient by this, is that correct assumption? 

The check itself that if destination address to  if 0x0 would require additional checks in bytecode perhaps? Otherwise other transactions which have destination address as 0x0 might also be blocked by this logic.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 14:19:40 GMT):<br/>
I think yes, your first assumption is correct, not an easy task though. Essentially you should inspect the bytecode and look for `CREATE` or `CREATE2` opcodes and even in that case I think you'll not be covering all cases, because, for example, you may even have a contract receiving arbitrary data in the constructor which would look like just data but it's intended to be executed, so in that case you should inspect the parameters to every invocation to `CALL` opcode, and so on...
About your second statement I don't know if I'm getting it right, but AFAIK there isn't other usage for sending a transaction to the 0x0 address other than deploying an smart contract (it may also be a conventional address to burn gas/assets but I think that's something that can be advised to your network users)

<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 16:04:09 GMT):<br/>
If the 0x0 address is only used for contract deployment in to address then I think there shall be no need of checking opcodes. which I'll make a check on separately.

However I'm looking at some contract deployment transactions on etherscan and I can see the to address is the contract address itself. For example- USDT's cotract deployment transaction:- https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2f1c5c2b44f771e942a8506148e256f94f1a464babc938ae0690c6e34cd79190
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 16:13:25 GMT):<br/>
what you are seeing in the etherscan dashboard is an interpretation of a contract creation transaction, in this case it prints the contract address field from the transaction receipt resulted from executing the transaction
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 16:13:48 GMT):<br/>
here you can see a raw view of the same transaction https://www.ethereumdecoder.com/?search=0x2f1c5c2b44f771e942a8506148e256f94f1a464babc938ae0690c6e34cd79190

If I comment out that line again and restart, everything is fine again.
I've gone back and forth several times uncommenting and commenting and the behavior is 100% consistent.
What could I be doing wrong?
The web app is showing the correct e-nodes.  Grafana shows that the first/boot node often has a connection with one other node -- but that is pretty much it . . . .
Should I grab a new version of the contracts?

<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Sun, 21 Feb 2021 09:18:04 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @diegoll . It turns out that the 0x00 address isn't used by any other transaction by design. However, it is actually is used for 'signifying' burning of ether by sending it in t address, which I'm willing to block as a transaction itself if needed.
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Sun, 21 Feb 2021 09:23:32 GMT):<br/>
I was wondering:-
1. if the current onchain permission contracts will allow me to block all transactions coming to 0x00 address without any modifications.
2. The contract deployment transactions as it seems don't have the to field at all associated with them. 0x00 is picked just to satisfy the transaction schema. Would Besu still block 0x00 with destination address transactions in case of smart-contract deployment? 

The idea is to enable/disable the simple capability of smart-contract deployment in the network.
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Sun, 21 Feb 2021 10:16:47 GMT):<br/>
I am seeing that the permissive contracts are present to check if the sender account has ability to perform a transaction on the network. For my implementation where 'to' if set to 0x00 needs to be blocked to disallow any contract deployments. 

In my case then it then shall be the receiver that needs to be checked instead in a transaction. 

It will be good if someone can point me the lines in Besu where this the current from address checks are made.

With the line permissions-nodes-contract-version=2, it just repeats the first line indefinitely (presumably as the container keeps restarting)

The "class":"AltBN128PairingPrecompiledContract","message":"Using native alt bn128","throwable":""} in the second line seems pretty suspicious since it does talk about Precompiled Contracts . . . .

Also, I'm making the assumption that this is directly on localhost, and not in some separate node docker container.  If so you will need to set `rpc-http-host='0.0.0.0'` so it will listen to all interfaces

Nodes are only connecting to nodes in a static nodes file . . . . 

I can't seem to get any of the boot nodes commands to work nor are nodes discovering additional nodes.  If it isn't in a static-nodes file, it isn't connected to.

What am I missing?

I don't think the version is an issue. And I can't see anything in your config that seems wrong. Have you checked your firewall config for the port used by discovery? By default it uses UDP 30303.
</p>

And just to confirm, your node isn't connecting to the bootnode enode://45f5<snip>f2ee@20.44.99.125:30303, is it?

Hello, a newbie here. I was wondering what's the difference (or rather one's advantage over the other) between JSON-RPC API and web3j?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 22 Feb 2021 23:50:00 GMT):<br/>
web3j is a Java library that calls out to the JSON-RPC API
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 00:12:39 GMT):<br/>
great, thanks. So, I  can  directly  call the JSON-RPC  API in my  java application but  if I use  web3j then  it makes my work  slightly  easierI  assume?

Is JDK 11 (LTS) or JDK 15 (latest) prefered ?  How about Oracle OpenJDK over "regular" Oracle JDK ?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 04:52:19 GMT):<br/>
JDK 15 will have better performance.  We target Java 11 as it is a LTS version.  There's not much difference between OracleJDK and OpenJDK, the main differentiator being one offers paid support.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 04:52:38 GMT):<br/>
GraalVM has slightly better performance overall, but it is still at Java 11.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 07:03:37 GMT):<br/>
I think I pushed https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1882 to a better state and it can be reviewed again. Most recently, I added an acceptance test showing the chain can create valid blocks.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 09:42:24 GMT):<br/>

Be sure to do your own validation, but that is a reason we also ship graalVM variant docker images.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:01:46 GMT):<br/>
Still fighting with discovery.

Oddity #1 - I've got a core network of 7 validation nodes and 1 RPC node (like the quickstart but I changed the members to validators).
Each time I restart, the bootnode has seven peers, four validators have five peers and two validators have one peer.
Which validator have five peers and which have only one peer changes each time I stop and restart.
What do I not understand here?
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:24:23 GMT):<br/>
Oddity #2 - Remote nodes can connect via a static-nodes.json file but cannot connect using the bootnodes command either in the command line or in a config.toml file.  This is despite the fact that the core network nodes are connecting via a bootnodes command in a config.toml file.  The core network is on Azure and does have 30303 open for Any protocol.  One remote node is on WSL2 and the windows firewall is open both inbound and outbound for Any.  Another remote node is on a Raspberry Pi.

They all see one peer and process it 
    DEBUG | RecursivePeerRefreshState | Iterative peer search complete.  1 peers processed over 1 rounds.
but then are forever waiting for peers
    DEBUG | WaitForPeerTask | Waiting for new peer connection. 0 peers currently connected.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:25:44 GMT):<br/>
The node is NOT connecting to the bootnode UNLESS I put it in a static-nodes.json file.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:26:32 GMT):<br/>
I've upgraded so everything is 20.10.4 (which solved the last of my permissions problems).
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:29:47 GMT):<br/>
periodically it tries the iterative peer search but finds no peers
 RecursivePeerRefreshState | Iterative peer search complete.  0 peers processed over 1 rounds.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:33:32 GMT):<br/>
Got it. Could you try updating your config file with the property p2p-host matching your server external IP address?

https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#p2p-host
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:40:24 GMT):<br/>
This property will be used when advertising this peer address to other peers in the network. So you need to ensure it contains the ip for your server that is accessible by other peers.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:48:31 GMT):<br/>
When you say server -- do you mean the Azure core network or the remote node?  I tried with the remote node to no effect.  If I try it on the core network, won't that mess up the internal communications between the core nodes which is happening on the internal (Docker) network?  If so, should I try exposing all their ports to the outside world and then use the external addresses (seems a bit problematical)?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:53:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm not familiar with Azure deployment so I'm afraid I can't really help you on the actual setup.

But I did notice that you don't have the p2p-host property on your config file. That means that the node will advertise its enode as enode://<enodeId>@127.0.0.1:30303.

Any other node that tries to connect to this address (127.0.0.1) won't reach your node.

So what I'm saying is that each node in the network must advertise an address that other peers can connect to. It doesn't have to be open in the internet if all other nodes are running in some isolated network (like a VPC).

Hello guys. I need some help again with a question about P2P, so i have the follow scenario. I have version 1.4 of besu, (2 public nodes + 4 validators in private network IBFT2.0).
One of public nodes is a bootnode also!

I have the next problems:

1) Other clients networks try to connect as peers (OpenEthereum, Parity, Geth, etc...). For this i put the flag of `--required-block=` and only for validator in private network i cut access to external network, only comunicate with relayed transactions from public nodes.
I don't know if static nodes resolve this problems and disable discovery ?
> https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Find-and-Connect/Static-Nodes/

2)  Next and more critical problem is, when i stop one validator for update something for example, all network stops!!!
  When i put this validator up again with --bootnodes flag of public node nothing happens i wait more than 10 minutes and nothing!

So what i did, i get enode of validator-0 and via ADMIN api added to others validator this enode... and all network start to process blocks again...

What is happening here? bootnode struggling with peers like OpenEthereum, Geth....? Becase in the first year that we lunch the network this not happen.

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 12:41:04 GMT):<br/>
Hmmm.  I think you're on to something.

The Azure deployment is just that there are multiple besu instances, each in it's own Docker container.
Docker-compose then sets up a private network between them.

What I didn't notice before that their command line has a
   --p2p-host=$$(hostname -i) 
option which advertises that private network.

I'll try changing that to the external ip address as I mentioned above.  I'm not savvy enough on ip routing to know whether that is tremendously inefficient or not but I'm guessing/hoping not.

I'll report back after I try.

Do you have any idea why p2p-host doesn't default to (hostname -i) ?
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 12:44:55 GMT):<br/>
@helderjnpinto 
2) Static-nodes resolves p2p discovery problems1) If you have only 4 validators and 1 is stopped, you've fallen below the number needed to continue producing blocks (assuming that your public nodes are not validatprs)

@helderjnpinto 
!) Static-nodes DO skips p2p discovery problems when connecting to the nodes listed (and thus avoids any discovery problems) but does not shut off discovery for other nodes.  I'm guessing that you are missing the p2p-host option (like I was ;-) ) which unfortunately defaults to the useless 127.0.0.1:30303)

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 13:32:01 GMT):<br/>
Latest stable release is currently 20.10.4

<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 14:10:22 GMT):<br/>
Again a greenhorn question, is it advisable to have our application as a separate node and interact with the besu node via jsonrpc/ws or is there a way I can embed my application and besu node into one? Is the latter even worth it?
</p>
<p><strong>helderjnpinto</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 14:13:22 GMT):<br/>

the usual architecture for blockchain applications is to connect to your node through http/ws. It would depend on your application if the latency introduced by that connection affects your performance and may justify embedding somehow your application into Besu, most usual dapps doesn't have those requirements AFAIK
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 14:47:18 GMT):<br/>
yea, was wondering the same. But is it even possible, in a straight forward way, to have my application code in the besu node itself?

the most straight forward extension point for Besu is its [plugin system](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/Plugin-API-Interfaces/) you should evaluate if that provides enough information for your use case

Besu is not a wallet provider.  You should put something like ethsigner between besu and remix - https://github.com/consensys/ethsigner
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 15:18:45 GMT):<br/>
It seems that p2p between 1.4 and 20.10.4 Besu nodes could require the `--compatibility-eth64-forkid-enabled` CLI option to be used on  20.10.4 nodes to be able to discover 1.4 nodes. See https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#compatibility-eth64-forkid-enabled

_Note that it is only in our latest doc but still apply since 20.10.1_

<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 19:57:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi. I want to enable some “observer nodes” in a permissioned Besu network. I mean, a set of nodes that are able to synchronize the blocks of the network but cannot relay transactions from users. The default permissioning smart contracts provided by Besu do not help me, because I cannot restrict that a node can only read transactions and not receiving transactions. Also, I do not want to use gas to solve that (I have some arguments to this decision, but I do not want to go in details about them to avoid confusion).
I am wondering what the best option is.
One possibility would be to filter what is been received by the peer-to-peer port. Besu offers the possibility of exposing or not some APIs to the user (for example, enabling ETH and disabling ADMIN) so I am wondering if it also possible to filter or not some functions on the peer-to-peer port. In this case I want to enable block synchronization (I mean, the observer node can synchronize and read all the info) but disable the possibility of receiving transactions (I mean, the observer nodes cannot send/relay transactions to the network.

<p><strong>josenogueiradalmeida</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 20:06:18 GMT):<br/>
Hello everyone,

Our permissioned network is made by 3 organizations (A, B and C), 2 validators each organization.

Organization C is still pending in the rpc ibft_getPendingVotes query in A and B, although A and B has proposed/voted for C.
Organization C is already validating blocks, we can see that in the block explorer.

So my question is... Is it common to have a validator pending in the ibft_getPending Votes query and the same validator running the consensus as if it was not pending ?
</p>
<p><strong>josenogueiradalmeida</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 20:42:19 GMT):<br/>
I can see the C validators in the ibft_getSignerMetrics. However, they simply proposedBlockCount is ZERO

Hi everyone,
I'm pretty new at using docker but I think I have a good understanding of how to setup a private network using the binaries.
I'm struggling getting it to work using docker tho. What would a docker command look like if I wanted to use a config.toml file?
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 22:25:07 GMT):<br/>
Hey @SuzanaMaranhao, So to confirm - you're looking fora. way to prevent Ethereum transactions from being sent to a given node in the network?
Would this node would still be expected to receive blocks and update its internal world state? Or what is the purpose of this node in your network?
</p>
<p><strong>RobbeV 1</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 22:25:44 GMT):<br/>
This is what I got so far:
docker run --rm --name node1 -p 8545:8545 -p 13001:30303 hyperledger/besu --config-file=/config.toml
</p>
<p><strong>RobbeV 1</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 22:27:02 GMT):<br/>
Unable to read TOML configuration, file not found. I'm getting this error even tho the file is located there.
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 22:27:39 GMT):<br/>
If I've got that somewhat right - the answer is "receiving transactions over Eth doesn't affect the world state" - only mined blocks can do that.
So every node receives every transaction, and stores it in the local transaction pool, _but doesn't execute it_. So, I'd typically say that receiving transactions over the P2P port is normal & safe, but without full understanding of your goals, I just want to be careful :)
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 23:20:34 GMT):<br/>
Hello RobbeV, I think you need to [mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#choose-the--v-or---mount-flag) the `config.toml` from the host file system into the container
</p>
<p><strong>hesusruiz</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 23:23:59 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is that @SuzanaMaranhao wants a node to be able to have a local copy of the blockchain, but not be able to inject new transactions into the network. So it would be a "read only" node.
It can be used to "publish" the information of  the blockchain and allow (for example) any actor to participate as "observers" but without having the possibility to inject new transactions.
This could be done by wrapping the JSON-RPC interface with a filtering sw, but it would depend on the operator of the node.
The question is if the restriction on writes can be imposed at the replication protocol level, so the operator of the observer node can not override it
</p>
<p><strong>hesusruiz</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 23:27:18 GMT):<br/>
As a side note, @SuzanaMaranhao in Brasil, LACChain in several other countries, we in Alastria and the European Union EBSI (where I also participate) would welcome this functionality, to better implement what we all call Public-Permissioned blockchain networks.
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 23:34:57 GMT):<br/>
It's possible "account permissioning" may provide the required behaviour. In that, every transaction must be signed - and account permission effectively only allows certain keys to sign transactions. Thus, transactions signed by disallowed keys would be rejected by the miner, and never included in a block.

<p><strong>hesusruiz</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 07:09:11 GMT):<br/>
That is a possibility, but is is not very scalable in a setting like that. The idea is that anybody can join the network and create and deploy whatever smart contracts the want, including any accounts they want. Permissioning should be only at the node level. Once an entity has one node connected to the network, it essentially works as decentralized as the public Ethereum. Even more: permissioning should only be required if the node is a "writer". For reader nodes, the ideal would be that anyone can join and leave the network when they wish.
</p>
<p><strong>hesusruiz</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 07:12:34 GMT):<br/>
Using an analogy: it would work like in the "real economy": in order to create a business and start operation, you have to register the identity of the company in the business registry of some country. Once this is done, you can do whatever you wish (legal things, of course).
But there may be "observers", like regulators or civil society watchdogs, that do not participate in the economic activity but can observe it.
</p>
<p><strong>hesusruiz</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 07:17:11 GMT):<br/>
Or an even better analogy: the Internet (at the level of the infrastructure).
The Internet is permissioned: the carriers, the access providers, the businesses, and even the citizens, they need to "register" to participate. Once this is done, you are basically free to do your business without asking permission.
But in the case of the blockchain we want those observer nodes to join the network but not inject transactions.

<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 13:25:50 GMT):<br/>
the `-v` links files (or directories) between your system and the container. The `--config-file=/config.toml` is executed in the context of the container, then the path you should refer there is the one that's linked in the `-v` option (the value after the colon)

As pointed out, it cannot depend on the observer node operator. Like principle of least privilege.
Unfortunately, account permissioning is also not the solution to this problem. The issue is really nodes, and I do not want to use accounts to solve nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 17:22:12 GMT):<br/>
By the way, the observer node is a very important feature to our Brazilian Blockchain Network too. We want to create a permissioned government network. Not everyone can validate, not everyone can write. But every citizen should be able to deploy an observer node and read the information “by themselves”.  Ideally this observer node would not even need permissioning.
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 17:22:15 GMT):<br/>
So the question is… What is the best way to implement “observer nodes” in Besu?

<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 17:33:02 GMT):<br/>

The official doc says IBFT 2.0 needs 4 nodes to be BFT and also says 2/3rd should be up and running in order to successfully add blocks. So, does this mean that having 6 validator nodes will give me leeway of 2 failed nodes?

Hey @rampatra, Sorry for the confusion - you must have at least  4 validators to be BFT safe - meaning you can afford to lose 1 validator due to failure/byzantine behaviour.
You do NOT need 6 (though if you do, you can afford to lose 2 validators at the same time)
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 01:54:07 GMT):<br/>
Hei @rampatra, normal nodes are completely not required. A validator offers all the features of a "normal" node, plus a few extra ones (ie making blocks). So yes, you can a validator can be a bootnode, and you can also submit transactions to a validator.

Hi @mwaser is this a single compose file with n nodes on a single VM? Or mulitple VMs each with an instance of Besu managed by docker? If it is the former using a docker bridge for the networking would be the simpler approach akin to https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/templates/besu/docker-compose.yml#L505

Also on that note, if you're attempting to peer to the bootnode, you'll need to map the discovery port to the host port. 

We've got a quickstart which you can spin up here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/quorum-dev-quickstart - this creates a compose file you can use for reference and customize to suit your requirements

sure sure :) So - for a network to be BFT safe, there must be enough validators to determine if one of them is "faulty" - and the minimum number required (including the faulty one) is 4.

</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 10:40:18 GMT):<br/>
i.e. having 4 validators allows the IBFT 2.0 protocol to still successfully produce blocks, even if 1 of the nodes is faulty.
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 10:41:00 GMT):<br/>
If, in a network of 4, you have 2 or more faulty nodes you could:
1. Get the chain halting
2. have forks in the chain (which is bad, as IBFT is meant to provide transaction finality)
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 10:41:34 GMT):<br/>
If you only had a network configured with 3 nodes, then a single faulty node would be sufficient to halt the network.

Hi there, 
Is it possible to upgrade private network protocol (IBFT2.0) attributes such as gasLimit or others without restart the node ?

hello, I am not able to make backup of Besu node. I have tried copying the /opt/besu/data/database folder from docker container but I don't know what to do with it. Previously I was using a ethash consensus network but now I want to change consensus to Clique with the backup from ethash node. please help me it is very urgent

Hi @joshuafernandes   It started life as the quickstart and is using the docker bridge.  Have you ever tried implementing permissions on the quickstart?  It works perfectly without permissions but with permissions, discovery does not work either internally or externally.   I understand that it has to do with p2p-host -- and I probably have to make sure that each node has only one address (for internal and external) but haven't had a chance to implement yet.

It would be awesomely helpful if the team 1) just changed the .env file to the newest version so it doesn't fail the second you tell it to use the newest perms version (that took me a while to debug) and 2) told us what we need to do to get internal and external peer-discovery working -- particularly if there is an easier way than having seven separate config files (each with a different p2p host)

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 12:38:18 GMT):<br/>
@rampatra - The system can tolerate at most F faulty nodes in a N validator nodes network, where N = 3F + 1 -- or F <= (N - 1)/3 -- with a minimum of four nodes.  Using this formula, 4 nodes can't have any faulty nodes, 5-6 can have 1, 7-9 and each successive triplet can support 1 additional faulty node (So, at the limit, it can tolerate 1/3 faulty nodes).
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 12:49:30 GMT):<br/>
@lemonsuy - Why is restarting the node a problem?  

I suspect that your real problem is that your gasLimit is in the genesis file and all your nodes must have the same genesis file hash -- so even restarting the node won't solve the problem since it won't be able to connect.
</p>
<p><strong>lemonsuy</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 14:31:13 GMT):<br/>
@mwaser  My problem is I already launched the blockchain network and want to adjust the gasLimit value in the genesis file to update the network but I don't wanna have a down time for the network. 
So my question is there are any ways to update the network without down time ?
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 14:52:11 GMT):<br/>
@lemonsuy - I do NOT have enough knowledge to be sure that I can accurately answer your question.  I *THINK* that you may not increase your gas limit above that set in your Genesis file -- but someone else who knows the answer needs to chime in.

The answer to your question "is there are any ways to update the network without down time?" is -- 
a) anything in the command line or config file can be changed and nodes bounced one by one and you'll have no downtime
b) someone else needs to answer the question about items in the genesis file

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 15:44:53 GMT):<br/>
Use cases for Besu are the same as for any Ethereum client. You can tryout any dapp, any smart contract that you can find in the Ethereum ecosystem and play with them on Besu. Besu is just a regular Ethereum client.

For instance, you can play with the Truffle pet shop example, we provide a full example of how to run it on a private Besu network here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Examples/Private-Network-Example/#smart-contract-and-dapp-usage-with-the-blockchain-network
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 15:48:13 GMT):<br/>
The reason why we suggest to play with it on a private network is for you to be in a free gas network and experiment with Besu. But this is the same Truffle pet shop example code that you can test on Ropsten or any testnet. (Try not to play with it on Mainnet if you want to save your money...).
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 15:49:30 GMT):<br/>
One thing that is specific to Besu is enterprise parts:
- the private network privacy
- permissionning
- monitoring
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 15:50:33 GMT):<br/>
These enterprise features are expected to run in a private network:

Then one you will have tried that, you will be able to clone and customise and deploy any dapp/smart contracts that you can find on Ethereum network. They usually provide source code in a Github repository, so you have everything to learn from it.
Also look at https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials for good tutorials and for instance https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/ for framworks to write your own advanced contracts.
Last step will be to design your own use case. Good luck!

Hi, could you explain exactly what you would like to do? To me dapps usually communicate by reading/writing the chain, so there's nothing to do on the Besu side. But given you cite Orion, that is our privacy enclave software that has nothing to do with making dapps communicate together, I wonder what your goal really is. Thanks for providing more detail.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:04:22 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for helping out. 

Let's say I have 2 app nodes connecting to 2 different besu nodes (each having their own orion nodes). 

Now, I want one app node of mine to send some messages to the other app node. So, does Besu provide a way to do this?
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:04:53 GMT):<br/>
@NicolasMassart
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:05:58 GMT):<br/>
He is correct that you do not need six.  He is incorrect that you can lose 2 validators at six.  You must have 7 validators to survive having 2 faulty ones.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:07:35 GMT):<br/>
I will consider that what you call "app node" is a service running on some machine with or without a graphical web interface. So let's say it's just regular services. They connect to your Besu node using either a library (web3j for instance if your apps are Java apps) or directly by making JSON-RPC calls to Besu. Is that right?
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:10:34 GMT):<br/>
Yes, think of them as simple java sprint-boot apps communicating with besu nodes via web3j.

Now I want the 2 java sprint-boot apps to communicate with each other without involving the chain.

Of course, I can implement this myself but lookup etc. would  be needed and  it  would be a lot of work to do. If Besu supports this out of the box somehow then nothing like it.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:12:39 GMT):<br/>
Or, does besu have an api to send messages among  besu nodes? 

If yes, I can use the same to send the messages and the other app node can  somehow subscribe/poll  for messages at the other  end.

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:15:29 GMT):<br/>
No, sorry, Besu doesn't provide this kind of feature. P2P communication happens only Between Ethereum nodes about the Ethereum protocol itself. There's not way to "plug" your apps in this network to exchange informations with other apps that would be somewhere connected on the network for what I know.
If you don't want to pass through the chain to exchange data, you will have to setup your own communication system. You can use a lot of existing technologies for that but they are not related to Ethereum.
Also, last detail, what kind of info would you like to pass between your apps? Maybe it would help me give you some ideas.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:23:25 GMT):<br/>
A straight forward example would be to instruct an app node to make a transaction on the chain. Another would be one app node requesting some internal data from other app node.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 17:36:42 GMT):<br/>
Hum, I guess yes you have all the current decentralised computing tools to check for... discovery, messaging, this subject is to broad to give an enlightened advice without knowing far more about your project. If you would like to give me more confidential infos, just DM me.

There's several solutions.  First, log4j can be used to setup rolling debug files. I've attached a fairly elaborate one I use for debugging.

Second many sysadmin tools can do zip and rolling archives. I'd have to ping our devops folks but it's a fairly low overhead service that will do daily ziping of a particular /var/log/* set/

Still fighting with permissions and discovery with the quick-start.  Without permissions, the nodes are fully interconnected.  With permissions, every node connects to the boot node and nothing else.  With permissions, the boot node must have  --p2p-host=$$(hostname -i) but whether all other nodes have it or not has no effect.  If I drop a node off the permissions list. the boot node immediately drops it.  Dropping the boot node off the permissions list obviously kills everything.  What am I missing here?

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Sat, 27 Feb 2021 01:03:03 GMT):<br/>
An external node will connect to the boot node and start downloading blocks.  It often will crash with maximum retries and show no peers.  When I retry enough so that it finally reaches the current block, it shows no peers and doesn't continue.  If I restart it, it downloads the intervening blocks and repeats the behavior.

With my permissioning/discovery problems, there are a couple of other probably related facts that I should repeat (actually, I'll repeat all facts here):
1.  Putting more than one boot node in the boot nodes option causes a node to not connect to any boot node
2.  The boot nodes option will not work for an external node.  The only option that works is the static nodes option.
3.  Internal nodes (those in the quickstart) discover each other when there is no permissioning, only connect to the boot node when permissioning is active.
4.  External nodes connect to a static node but no other node (I'm guessing that you need a boot node for discovery to work).

I'm sure that I'm missing one last little discovery (or boot node) thing or two (though why it works internally but not externally without permissioning but not with permissioning has me scratching my head as well).

5.  I'm guessing that my external boot node problem is probably because p2p-host is not set correctly because it is already set so that the internal nodes can connect (and discover when permissions are disabled).  I could set the p2p-host correctly for external if I could get my internal nodes to use the external address as a boot node -- but I'm not succeeding at that.

I'm sure that I'm missing one last little discovery (or boot node) thing or two (though why it works internally but not externally without permissioning but not with permissioning has me scratching my head as well).

Someone has got to know what is going on.  Does ANYONE have boot nodes and permissions FULLY working (and discovery) -- especially for the quickstart and external nodes?  Team?
This is starting to reach the point of becoming a make-or-break issue as to whether or not we can use besu . . . .

you're confusing bootnodes and connecting to peers. Bootnodes are used for discovery and give the address of other nodes, and possibly theirs. It is possible during discovery that your node will not connect to all the bootnodes as peers.
Bootnodes are only really useful for large public networks. You might be better off having static nodes for small private networks.

@atoulme - Hi!  No, I am not confusing boot nodes and connecting to peers.  As I said in number 2, static nodes DOES work for external nodes and, though I didn't mention it, static nodes also works for internal nodes.  It is definitely not a connectivity issue.  It is a discovery issue.  There is also the question why permissions have ANYTHING to do with discovery as long as there is connectivity (static nodes are stopped without permissions just like any other node so why do static nodes work and discovery does not?).

I wasn't expecting nodes to connect to all the boot nodes.  The problem is that when I put two boot nodes in the command line or config file, the node stops working (i.e. [<address1>] works and [<address1>,<address2> does not).

Yes, we building a large private network (anticipated 200ish nodes).

Thank you for clarifying and sorry for the assumption. Can you explain how it doesn’t work? Is it that besu doesn’t start, doesn’t run discovery, or something else?

No worries.  It's great that you stated your assumptions at the top and if I had been assuming that, it would have solved the problem.

If I have one boot node in the command line or the config file, it works (regardless of permissions) and a node connection (at least to the boot node) is made.  If I have two boot nodes, no connection is ever made.

I'm hoping that this is key to unlocking the whole problem.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Sun, 28 Feb 2021 16:20:51 GMT):<br/>
@Renaud404 - Azure has such a thing but it places the nodes on overly expensive machines.  Besu will run on a Raspberry pi, it does NOT need the high-performance machines the Azure template gives it.  The template is also a very old version of besu and has several other problems.  Do NOT use this.

OTOH, you can easily set up a lightweight virtual machine on Azure and create your own node on it.  This isn't really node-as-a-service but it is a pretty good alternative.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Sun, 28 Feb 2021 16:54:31 GMT):<br/>
Are the two bootnodes aware of each other and have the same genesis file? Can you report this as a bug?

I've run into a very interesting unexpected occurrence.  While testing, i periodically remove the docker containers that my besu nodes are in.  Recently, I dropped all but my boot node.  The new nodes were syncing against that node for a while -- but now I see that all the new nodes are building a new chain while remaining connected to the old chain (which is not advancing -- but which is ten times the length).  I'm curious how this happens.  Did the new nodes all realize that they were syncing off of only one chain and decide to invalidate a block?  Is it possibly because the longer chain had become stale?  I'm not worried about this since it obviously won't happen on a production network -- but understanding it would, I believe, help me to better understand Besu.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 28 Feb 2021 20:29:42 GMT):<br/>
In any case, losing  over half the block producers is not a situation that will self-resolve without manual intervention.  For a PoA chains (clique, IBFT, QBFT) I would recommend bringing validators back in one at a time and waiting for a full sync before starting up the next one.  For Proof of Work I would turn off mining in that case until each miner has fully synced.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Sun, 28 Feb 2021 21:13:19 GMT):<br/>
This is interesting.  If I have the following boot node sequence:

1 uses 2, 2 uses 1, 3 uses 2, 4 uses 3, 5 uses 4, 6 uses 5 and 7 uses 6 . . . 

WITHOUT PERMISSIONS:
1 immediately connects with 2 peers (probably 2 and the RPC), 
2 and the RPC connect with all 7 nodes other than themselves), 
3-7 connect with 6 (probably all but 1)

Interestingly, but possibly irrelevant.  Node 2 and the RPC pick up the fact that there are 47K nodes.  They quickly sync but the other nodes only recognize different target chain heights in the low hundreds and stop and stay there when they reach them despite being fully connected.

If I stop and restart the docker containers, node 3 recognizes node 1, quickly picks up the correct target chain height and quickly syncs.  The other four nodes belatedly realize the correct chain height and sync somewhat more slowly as they are competing with each other for bandwidth.  It is also worth noting that the peer counts are radically different with peers dropping off and reconnecting at a rate much higher than I am comfortable with -- but probably due to network bottle- necking.

Eventually, the nodes trifurcate into nodes 1,2,6 being fully connected; 3 by itself and 4,5,7 being connected only through 5.  

My question here being, why don't they eventually all connect with their original boot nodes?  The network is stuck in this position.  Why don't the nodes reconnect?

Again, if I stop and restart the nodes.  they reconnect again with boot root 2 and those needing syncing being fully connected and 1, the fully synced 6 and the rpc node with only one connection.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Sun, 28 Feb 2021 22:08:17 GMT):<br/>
Eventually. they all are synced at 47K blocks but it requires a stop and restart to cause block production to start happening again -- even though several of the nodes have the three or more necessary peer validator connections.

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Sun, 28 Feb 2021 23:20:37 GMT):<br/>
Repeating the process from the beginning showed exactly the same initial connection result:

1 immediately connects with 2 peers (probably 2 and the RPC),
2 and the RPC connect with all 7 nodes other than themselves),
3-7 connect with 6 (probably all but 1)

And again node 2 and the rpc fiure out the 47L target block while node 4 acts like node 6 did last time.

The runs diverged slightly in that node 4 *did* reach the 47K while the other four again stalled out with different targets in the low hundreds.  This meant that the network only had to be stopped and restarted once for all of them to reach 47K blocks and one more time to start producing blocks again.

Behavior being replicated, time to move on to with permissions.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Sun, 28 Feb 2021 23:35:45 GMT):<br/>
WITH PERMISSIONS:
exact same setup as previously with the sole difference being the argument --permissions-nodes-contract-enabled added to the command line of every node.

NOTHING CONNECTS.

Previously, when everything connected to node 1 as a boot node, every node totally interconnected without permissions and only connected to boot node 1 with permissions.

Next (tomorrow) I'll try everything connected to node 2 as a boot node with permissions to see if it is identical to the results with one or if there is a discrepancy that may tell me something.

This is killing me . . . .  :-(

IBFT  and yeah, I wouldn't try that with a real network.  As Ii said "I'm not worried about this since it obviously won't happen on a production network -- but understanding it would, I believe, help me to better understand Besu."

I think I've got an idea for a really interesting test that may tease out a lot more info.  I really think I've got something set up wrong related to discovery.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 15:03:47 GMT):<br/>
OK.  This really, REALLY sucks.  I did my test (had two boot nodes pointing at each other with evenly balanced nodes using each) expecting each boot node to connect to those nodes using them and no other cross-connections.  I was surprised to see it work.  I said "OK, using only one boot node doesn't work".  BUT, I always test my hypotheses.  I went back to one boot node (totally cleaning everything up).
Now that set-up works totally perfectly as well.  I would almost swear that it is absolutely identical to the configuration that failed repeatedly before -- but I must be mistaken and changed something . . . .

SIGH.  I wonder what the heck it was.  It cost me multiple days and I have zero knowledge to show for it.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 15:06:17 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon - IBFT.  But it does work if the chain is pretty short (like when you only ran it long enough to add nodes with the permissioning app and then restart it to enable the permissions contract).  ;-)

<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:47:10 GMT):<br/>
I am talking about message between my app nodes and not besu nodes (although I have no problem in using besu nodes for this).

The messages can be simple json payloads. Not encrypted. Point-to-point. Http would be fine as the messages  won't  be continuous  like  chat but one-off.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:58:21 GMT):<br/>
So maybe run a http server and send data between your apps?
GRPC would do too?
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:04:58 GMT):<br/>
actually the thing is, we  do not want to code the discovery of other nodes ourselves and wanted to use some existing api if possible. 

For example, let's say, I have 2 nodes named, x and y. I just want to make a simple http call saying send message "abc" to "y" and that should be it.

With gRPC, I think I have to handle the addressing, etc. That is, I have to convert the node name to its proper ip address or something. Am i right?
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:06:01 GMT):<br/>
As besu already supports some sort of private messaging via orion nodes, I was wondering if I can use the same API for my use.

There was also some years back a chat protocol called whisper that was quite interesting but was heavy on use. It had interesting properties, but was never implemented by besu and deprecated by geth.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:27:14 GMT):<br/>
if you'd like to create your very own subprotocol to send messages over rlpx to other nodes, I think that's doable, but would require some heavy coding in Besu. I made Apache Tuweni's implementation of subprotocols more modular so it would allow custom subprotocols, but it's not a client.

<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:29:08 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:29:10 GMT):<br/>
What that tells me is we'd need a better discovery for private networks that leaves a lot less to chance.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:29:21 GMT):<br/>
Please also note - did you reset your node keys in between runs?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:30:04 GMT):<br/>
Discovery uses nodekeys to create identities, which are used to xor against the other nodes to find which bucket to place them in. This means that if you don't ask the right bucket, you can get an empty list of peers.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:30:24 GMT):<br/>

You can also feel free to open an issue with Besu such as: "private networks have no guarantee of interconnection" and explain your use case.

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:37:44 GMT):<br/>
Heh.  If it happens again, I'll grab the logs.  I just hate not knowing since if you don't know, you can't prevent it or fix it in the future.

Then we can think of a deterministic way of guaranteeing discovery. I have the sneaky feeling something is way off.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:38:37 GMT):<br/>
I believe the team also worked on other ways to guarantee connectivity, and maybe someone else will comment on the issue.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:38:50 GMT):<br/>
We also have DNS discovery, but it's mostly for public networks.

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:40:57 GMT):<br/>
If you are part of the team and would like me to file a bug, I would be happy to.  The next step is that I need to do is switch the p2p-host option to using the external addresses of at least a couple or three of the nodes so that they can be boot nodes for external nodes (unless there is some other way to do it).  I'm currently living in fear that that won't work . . . .

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:42:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm a committer yes. It would definitely be of value to me if you took the time to file an issue, and I would pay that forward by exploring how to best make sure this doesn't happen again.

Gotcha @mwaser Yep permissions have to do with the enode (node's public key and the ip of the node). There are 2 modes of permissioning that you can use:
1. static config file which you essentially make a list of enodes allowed. https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/files/besu/config/besu/permissions_config.toml and then in the config of each node hand that file as an argument https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/files/besu/config/besu/config.toml#L30 I believe this is the default mode the quickstart operates in.

2. Via an onchain permissions contract and you make an app to allow you to select which nodes are allowed/disallowed. Docs here: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Permissioning/Getting-Started-Onchain-Permissioning/ and a tutorial video here:

Thankyou for raising that, I'll look into the newest perms version and see what we need to update :) I'll take a stab at the peering question that you have. Please feel free to correct me if Im wrong about assumptions and we can work through that.

By internal I take to mean you are referring to the containers on your  box (laptop etc) locally? And externally I take to mean a box on say a different VM in Azure or another laptop etc?

The p2p-host tells Besu which host interface to listen to for p2p traffic, this is defaulted to 127.0.0.1  for security. If this isn't set on the docker containers it default to the localhost of the container and not the host, so it never sees the rest of the world.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 21:47:15 GMT):<br/>
If you're running a mixed mode like the above (some nodes on containers and some on VMs) then each container will need to use:
- set the p2p-host
-  a different discovery port and bind to the host network ie `30303:30303` on one, `30303:30304` on the next and so on and adjust the same on the static-nodes.json. This allows each container node to be exposed on the same host, so that you can connect to them from an external VM on the LAN or equivalent

Internal vs. external:
I started with the dev-quickstart but changed the member nodes to also be validator nodes.  Since they all use the private docker network, I've been calling them internal even though the are actually on Azure.  ;-)
Similarly, my external node (i.e. not on the Docker network) is my local machine.  I quickly learned that my local machine can only connect via static nodes and that I needed to use p2p-host to get discovery (and apparently connecting to boot nodes to work) since my p2p-host was set to the internal network address (soon to be changed to the external network address).

For some reason, I was having all sorts of difficulties with the internal network, permissions and discovery as well.  They seem to have disappeared for no reason.  Obviously I must have changed something but . . . .

For the newest perms version, the things that I noticed were 
1.  I had to figure out that the besu version was in the .env file and update that to a version higher than the current 10.20.0
2.  I had to realize that I needed the permissions-nodes-contract-version (yes, it is elsewhere in the docs but there are  . . . so . . . many . . . docs ;-) )
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 21:51:11 GMT):<br/>
My firewalls are good.  I can connect with static-nodes so I'm sure everything is open.

Isn't your port binding backwards?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 21:55:41 GMT):<br/>
Gotcha, now Im with you. Yep, fixed the binding :) Yep, am working over the next few months to sort out docs and examples and aiming ot make it simpler and more practical. 
With permissions its a tricky one, even bootnodes wont connect unless they've been told about the new enode and then you've got connectivity.  Glad its working for you now :)
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 22:00:18 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I was having weird circumstances like the second I enabled permissions (after adding the nodes),  the boot node would connect to the other 6 nodes but they wouldn't cross connect.  Now, after trying all sorts of experiments, it is working correctly but, as far as I know, I've undone all the changes that made it work and it still works.  Makes me really nervous as "things that suddenly and inexplicably fix themselves can just as suddenly and inexplicably stop working" :-(
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 22:08:51 GMT):<br/>
Gotcha, was the permissioning added to all the nodes? What I typically tend to do is to put the generalised config in a file and then share that across to all nodes so they're consistent, and then pass in dynamic args like p2p-host at runtime only. There is also a DNS mode which makes life a bit easier https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#xdns-enabled 

When experimenting and firing things up, I start with the bootnodes first and then add 1 node at a time to see the effects. If the node doesnt connect then I use the APIs and go back and figure out why and then restart the process. Helps me isolate connectivity at least and if it works with one node, then it generally works with the rest - my 2c worth only ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 22:13:38 GMT):<br/>
There is one docker-compose.yaml in the quick-start that had the p2p-host argument with a system call.  I moved that out to individual config files.  I should go back and reverse that and see if that was the fix (though it still wasn't working for quite some time after that).

Normally, I am MUCH better at determining the source of a problem -- especially since I always reverse the last step just to confirm that it was the cause of the problem.  I was not happy when it worked after reversing the last several things I did . . . . Hopefully, I just forgot something.  The tests involved a lot of steps to set it up each time . . . .
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 22:15:11 GMT):<br/>
The problem was that all the nodes did connect to the boot node but didn't perform discovery when permissions was enabled.  The permissions had to be correct for the nodes to connect to the boot node so why did they refuse to discover ONLY when permissions were enabled?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 22:15:50 GMT):<br/>
Aye understand, give me a yell if you need a hand. Not sure if this is an option for you or not re Azure, https://github.com/ConsenSys/besu-terraform/tree/master/azure
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 22:17:37 GMT):<br/>
Thats a tf setup that will provision nodes in Azure (sans permissioning from memory) but you'll see the config in 1 place only - the config.toml and uses a galaxy role to setup besu so you treat it like another service managed by systemd
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 22:21:26 GMT):<br/>
To connect external nodes, set this to publicIP https://github.com/ConsenSys/besu-terraform/blob/master/azure/files/besu/setup.sh#L9 and https://github.com/ConsenSys/besu-terraform/blob/master/azure/ibft-4-validators/main.tf#L170 to open up 30303 to `0.0.0.0`
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 22:24:24 GMT):<br/>
Yeah.  I had one config.toml until I moved the p2p-host option into it.  I'm not enough of a Linux/Docker weenie to figure out if I can collapse it back with a system call or not.

I am unfortunately not familiar with Terraform and am going to try the public ip with 30303 through 30309 unless there si some reason why that is a terrible idea.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 23:28:28 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 03:17:32 GMT):<br/>
Hey @mwaser, Not quite sure I understand - but am _somewhat_ worried - as the IBFT2 consensus is  explicitly created to prevent forking.
So to confirm - you have a number of dockerised nodes running (some of which are validators).
If you stop all dockerised-nodes, except the bootnode, then restart them, rater than synchronizing from the bootnode (and then building atop the existing chain), decide to create their own fork?
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 03:19:18 GMT):<br/>
do you have any logs for the various nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 03:21:52 GMT):<br/>
were you using permissioning? I.e. were nodes potentially unable to connect, and thus resolved to create a new chain?

 var contract = new web3.eth.Contract(JSON.parse(variables.ContractJSON),address);
 contact.events.MyEvent( {
          fromBlock: 0,
          toBlock: 'latest'
		}).on('error', function(error, receipt) { 
                console.log("error",error)
           })
          .on('data',function (result) {

What's the best way to get callbacks (or subscribe) to new block additions to the chain? Do we have to make a custom besu plugin (implementing the BesuEvents interface) and expose the data via an API? Or, there are other ready to use APIs?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 14:23:58 GMT):<br/>
Custom plugins is one option to get "push" style events.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 14:24:53 GMT):<br/>
Another option for "push/pull" hybrid is to use websockets and add an event filter.  If the socket becomes disconnected you will need to make sure the subscription covers possible missed blocks, but there are ways to do that too.

Which consensus? If you pick ibft you need enough nodes to mint blocks.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 16:05:56 GMT):<br/>
But this missed blocks handling thingy: wouldn't this be the same with either approaches?

I mean even if I go the plugin route, let's say my push didn't work for some network issue then my plugin should queue those to send later. Am I right?

Depends on how you write your plugin.  If you add retry logic and confirm receipt then yes.  There are so many creative ways to cause data loss on top of this, some architectures do a query of the latest push and then push all the remainder data to bring it up to chain head.
</p>

@shemnon "some architectures do a query of the latest push and then push all the remainder data to bring it up to chain head." --> I think this can be done in both the approaches if I understand you correctly?

Hi everyone! I have a dockerized network with 4 besu nodes and 4 orion nodes using IBFT2. I can connect to metamask just fine and see the initial balances of the accounts. When I try to send a transaction I can ssee the transaction in the logs but it stays on pending:
`node2       | 2021-03-03 14:54:30.068+00:00 | pool-9-thread-1 | INFO  | IbftBesuControllerBuilder | Imported #619 / 0 tx / 5 pending / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x24270303eca8f5cbdfa6fa4c0c3c4110edc6ffa952117d0511045037e29fa9ff)`
Anyone has any idea why this is happening? I tried deploying a contract with remix too with the same result.

suspect you've initialised your besu nodes with the default "min-gas-price" - which means you need to set the gas price to 1000wei - you can change this with the --min-gas-price=X cmdline arg - then the pending txns will get mined into a block
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 01:17:55 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, its a bit tight, and should be relaxed :/ Ultimately you need to have all our nodes time-synced (ideally with NTP)

I set up a free gas network by using the --min-gas-price=0.  I figured I didnt have to add gas to a transaction then. + one of those 5 pending transactions I added lots of wei

Hi All, I am trying to add signer while using clique consensus on private network. By using  *clique_propose*  method of rpc api I can propose signer, and I did this for all the peer nodes by calling the same method. By calling *clique_proposals* I can get the porposed signer as result. When I call the *clique_getSigners* method still I am getting the same signer which I defined in the genesis file.
How will these added signers reflects??

I've solved my permissions issue but am still fighting with bootnodes issues on external nodes
External nodes WILL connect with a static-nodes.json file -- so I am positive that I have tcp connectivity
External nodes will NOT connect using the bootnodes option in any of the command line, environment variable or config file

The following command says that I have UDP connectivity
 nc -z -v -u 104.209.172.204 30303
Connection to 104.209.172.204 30303 port [udp/*] succeeded!

Internal node has p2p-host="104.209.172.204" and is on port 30303
External node has p2p-host="73.251.174.207" and is on port 30303

We have a 4-node permissioned network using Besu and recently we included 4 new nodes. 3 were successful included and are generating blocks.
The last one is a validator according to a Alethio block explorer but is not generating blocks (using IBFT2). We checked its peers and seems fine. 
The log of this node was on info level without any message. When the log was set to debug, we noticed that this message sometimes is printed. Any ideas?

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:34:31 GMT):<br/>
I don't know either, sorry. Those logs contain little info that helps. I hesitate on next steps:
- turn on trace logging
- turn on metrics and look at discovery metrics

Both are paltry options.

Truth be told for most private networks we tend to use static peering since they're relatively small.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:35:13 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=jKcLDqhjoXjkbHBuX) Handshake failed - the peer key doesn't match. Check the enodes and make sure they are correct.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:38:14 GMT):<br/>
Yeah.  They want to grow this one to an obnoxious size so static is not an option.  I think what I want to focus on is why the external node doesn't even connect to the boot node.  It seems as if it should, at least, do that . . . .
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:38:39 GMT):<br/>
but it just might be connecting
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:38:59 GMT):<br/>
???
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:39:03 GMT):<br/>
the notion of discovery doesn't stop at the UDP packet, discovery in ethereum relies on kademlia buckets
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:39:16 GMT):<br/>
so you organize your peers in buckets and only send _some_ of them when asked
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:39:29 GMT):<br/>
if the code of besu is not trying hard enough, you hit an empty bucket...
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:39:54 GMT):<br/>
Hmm.  So I should try again with different keys . . . . (or a different node.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:40:06 GMT):<br/>
hence why you get weird results
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:40:19 GMT):<br/>
my hunch though
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:40:23 GMT):<br/>
I was guessing that the first node would be more like connecting to a static node and then  discovery after that.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:40:45 GMT):<br/>
Seems like that would be faster and more logical . . . .
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:41:41 GMT):<br/>
no that's not how bootnodes work
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:42:04 GMT):<br/>
the idea is that the bootnode is your entry into the network and you connect to it, it doesn't peer with you, instead, it sends you a list of peers to connect to
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:42:06 GMT):<br/>
But . . . if it doesn't try to connect to the first node as a peer . . . and if the other nodes are having trouble connecting . . . . that explains it all.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:42:40 GMT):<br/>
with public networks, there is even an option for the bootnode to not reply to you if you try to tcp in
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:43:25 GMT):<br/>
Especially since I'm having a tcp oddity on the other nodes (they are UDPing just fine but refusing tcp connections).  Crap!  I'm looking in the wrong place at the wrong problem.  THANK YOU!!
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:43:48 GMT):<br/>
oh cool good luck
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:47:18 GMT):<br/>
I also need to replicate it a couple more times but I think I understand the previous problem.  I was trying to avoid having to constantly enter permissions so I was saving and reusing the database on the first node letting the rest sync to it.  That is NOT a good plan . . . .
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:47:53 GMT):<br/>
(Apparently, I'm making most of my own problems here  :-P )

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:49:24 GMT):<br/>
so keep whinging, you're showing where the code falls short
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:49:38 GMT):<br/>
enter issues such as "I need better ways to understand why I don't get any nodes"

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:50:10 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 20:51:02 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean by check the enodes, @atoulme? The node is synchronizing, permissioned and the enode string is correctly presented in command admin_nodeInfo.  I also checked that the address of node is equal to the last bytes of the public key hash.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 21:50:47 GMT):<br/>
I mean that is seems like there is a problem with your handshake indicating that the exchange breaks because the node is not using the right key when connecting to the peer. The key is a portion of the enode URL.

Hi..
In besu, Permissioning is present for the account list and the node list.
The ethereum accounts can be whitelisted for creating the permissions over the transactions using the smart contracts deployed over the besu node.
Is it possible to modify the account-list permission and provide access to the besu node to all accounts but restricts the account from deploying the contract..

@atoulme. Thank you for your answer. I checked private key, public key and enode and it seems fine. It took an entire day but the node was suddenly included as a new validator. 
So, now we have a node that can sign blocks but there is still the same error message every 30seconds (handshake error). It only happens in this specific node. It is not happening in a similar validator node in the same institution. It also only appear when the LOG LEVEL is debug. Any ideas?

Hi all,
So, we're creating a personal public network with on-chain permissions. Along with the basic accounts and nodes rules, we need to create rules for deploying smart contracts. For this, we started looking into the hyperledger/besu code and found the permissioning directory where we can incorporate our changes for our custom on-chain permission.
Since any node can join, we want permissioning to be present at some other point as well, maybe like block creation or validation. Could someone please point me to possible places where this additional check can be inserted and the corresponding files/directories the need to be modified?

Hi all,
So, we're creating a personal public network with on-chain permissions. Along with the basic accounts and nodes rules, we need to create rules for deploying smart contracts. For this, we started looking into the hyperledger/besu code and found the permissioning directory where we can incorporate our changes for our custom on-chain permission.
Since any node can join and we are using PoA, we need to add checks in Validator nodes probably at block creation. Could someone please point me to the corresponding files/directories that needs to be modified?
Thanks

So, I found this function which I suppose add transactions to block. Found in package - package org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.blockcreation;
Is it the correct place to implement custom permission check on smart contract transaction?

I've added logs to Besu source code and built binaries from the source. Now, I created a new image by replacing the binaries in the original *hyperledger/besu* image. But it doesn't seem to work. It's giving me this  error when I debug the container -

Hii all, 
Currently, the accounts can be whitelisted using smart contracts to carry out the transactions with the whitelisted accounts.

I have changed the smart contract code and introduced a check over the target address.
Inside *accountRules.sol* in * transactionAllowed* function to modify the account-list permissions such that the address in the account list can only deploy the contract; while all the accounts can do the transactions over the network.

After that I am compiling the contracts and including the *deployedBytecode* from JSON artificates inside the *AccountIngress.json*.

Then I am deploying the contracts on the besu node, after deployment and whitelisting the accounts, I am restarting the node with permissioning enabled.

On restarting the besu node again the error came up
 * Supplied genesis block does not match stored chain data.*
What I am doing wrong here?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 09:43:33 GMT):<br/>
Hi, what kind of specific validation would you like to add?
Understand that if you do this, you will then become incompatible with other Ethereum protocol clients or unmodified Besu.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 09:55:51 GMT):<br/>
So we are looking into modifying the current use of `accounts-allowlist` to make a check on accounts allowed to deploy smart contracts; while all other txns will be allowed by every account.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 09:56:42 GMT):<br/>
So, it is just a small extra check for **To** address in a txn.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 10:03:01 GMT):<br/>
It's on the permissioning side then, great, nothing that changes the way tx are validated, it's before that. So that will require to be modified on all nodes of your network, otherwise you will have consensus issues. Let me do some research on you question now, will get back to you soon.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 10:12:15 GMT):<br/>
These are the 2 files that I think must be related -
- `MainnetBlockBodyValidator`
- `BodyValidation`.
I haven't tested this yet, but will be doing it today, after testing block creation with the same permissioning.
Although I'm not sure whether these are the correct files and the flow is still not fully clear to me.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 10:19:36 GMT):<br/>
I don't think doing this validation changes at block level on a private chain is the best. It will have too many side effects.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 10:26:29 GMT):<br/>
The verification of blocks is an integral part of PoW consensus. I don't think adding a small check at that point would create any issue.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 10:27:30 GMT):<br/>
It may be more something to update on the permissioning smart contract side that will tell Besu if a TX is allowed or not.
See https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/abfdd543dde1b7405c7729c7f2b91a9da37d7a3a/contracts/AccountRules.sol#L59
Once a modified version of this contract deployed, it may be able to check the transaction more than only on its sender address and check if it's a contract deployment from an unallowed account and return false otherwise return true. Then you have probably nothing to change in Besu, or a very few changes to do to make in places like org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.permissioning.TransactionSmartContractPermissioningController#isPermitted to provide the added reason for rejections for instance.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 10:30:33 GMT):<br/>
If the smart contract permissioning is enabled at the block verification, then I guess the change in the above said file will be enough.
When I went through the code, I couldn't find any link b/w smart contract permissioning and the block verification.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 10:31:09 GMT):<br/>
I guess I'll just have to try first with what you recommended.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 10:49:19 GMT):<br/>
The link to the smart contract is done with CLI or env variables as explained in https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Permissioning/Getting-Started-Onchain-Permissioning/#5-set-the-environment-variables
There's no default value.
You set your ingress contract in the genesis and Besu will look for it if the variables or CLI options are found.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 10:52:22 GMT):<br/>
If you updated the ingress contract code in the Genesis, that creates a different genesis block and that's probably why you have this error. Any change in the genesis block requires to reset the chain. you can do that by deleting the data for your nodes and start with a fresh chain. You can keep everything else: keys, configs, genesis (must be the same for each node).
</p>
<p><strong>prashantgangwar</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 11:29:47 GMT):<br/>
so after startup of besu node  we can't touch genesis file in any condition.
to achieve smart contract tweaks I have to compile the contracts and add the deployedBytecode in the genesis file and leave address to be 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000008888.

@HiteshSharma You're looking in the right area, but I tend to agree with @NicolasMassart and while you _can_ modify this area to work, it's probably not quite right, and that the Account Permissioning framework is a more scalable solution.
I.e. you really want to reject a bad transaction _before_ it gets mined into a block
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 11:59:48 GMT):<br/>
these are the unique message-codes used to identify messages in the Eth62 subprotocol
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 12:00:31 GMT):<br/>
They allow besu to determine how a received packet is to be deserialised
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 12:05:41 GMT):<br/>
So, if a block is received by a node, the code for that would be **NEW_BLOCK**, right?
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 12:06:56 GMT):<br/>
And is it event based or besu is pooling to network?

if you have used the default [AccountIngress.sol](https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/AccountIngress.sol), you can deploy an instance of [NodeRulesProxy.sol](https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/NodeRulesProxy.sol) and set that address in your genesis ingress at `0x0...08888` by calling [setContractAddress](https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/Ingress.sol#L39).

Hey, the problem that I'm thinking is that any node can connect to my personal public network. So the node cannot be verified and if somehow that node publishes the  block (let's say it uses different besu code or permissioning), I don't want genuine nodes to accept that block.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 14:17:48 GMT):<br/>
This is what I'm thinking. Please correct me if I somehow understood the concepts wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 14:42:38 GMT):<br/>
An example of above could be that a bad node is defined a miner and it uses it's own custom besu code that bypasses the permissioning. In that case, the bad block will be accepted by every other node.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 15:02:47 GMT):<br/>
Another question, is this type of scenario is even possible? And is there a better architecture to have genuine nodes only?

<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 00:34:53 GMT):<br/>
So - besu supports "node-permissioning" - which is a list of the ethereum nodes which are allowed to communicate in the network.
You can either have a text file on every node which lists its valid peers, or you can store in on-chain.
</p>
<p><strong>trent.mohay</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 00:35:14 GMT):<br/>
Any node not in the list, is rejected as part of the peering process.

<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 01:38:27 GMT):<br/>
@HiteshSharma I suggest looking into the smart contract based permissioning model. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Permissioning/Onchain-Permissioning/ Its specifically design to maintain consistency with all parties in a private network. The node permissioning logic will mean only nodes that are allowed can participate, and the account permissioning logic will define which accounts can transact and change the rules on the network. You can then extend this smart contract to add in additional rules around who can create contracts.

I have changed the above code to fulfill the account permissioning for the deployment of the contract.
After the deployment of the contract, I wasn't able to do the transaction from metamsak as it gives the error for the invalid parameters for both contract and ether transfer transaction.

I have used clique consensus with a single node and also enabled the permissioning contract in the config.toml file.

Indeed the ingress contract should not be modified, but it can be updated to point to the real updated instance of your contract. You have to use the https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/blob/abfdd543dde1b7405c7729c7f2b91a9da37d7a3a/contracts/Ingress.sol#L39 to define the contract to be used in the end.

Hello Suzana. I think [keythereum](https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum) can handle encrypted files, but at some point I would imagine you'll have to have the decryption password in plain text somewhere (at least in an environment variable)
</p>
<p><strong>prashantgangwar</strong> (Thu, 11 Mar 2021 07:08:38 GMT):<br/>
@lucassaldanha 
I have changed the smart contract code and introduced a check over the target address.
Inside accountRules.sol in  transactionAllowed function to modify the account-list permissions such that the address in the account list can only deploy the contract; while all the accounts can do the transactions over the network.

Hello. I have a IBFT network and i get some problems with other Ethereum nodes trying connect for some reason the nodes stay awaiting for peers... after i test shutdown connections to external internet only giving access to private network, restarted all nodes and all works fine. So i don't want cut external connections in P2P because other people may want connect to this network and sync from a private node. Also i did --required-block flag but not resolve this issue. If i disable p2p discovery and add static-node.json is a solution for stopping this other peers connecting or i need to add  nodes-whitelist https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/1.4.4/HowTo/Limit-Access/Local-Permissioning/#permissions-configuration-file ?

One more thing that whenever I'm compiling the contracts, they are always generating different addresses, but as per this [stack exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/760/how-is-the-address-of-an-ethereum-contract-computed/761#761) answer, that should not happen I guess.
</p>
<p><strong>RobbeV 1</strong> (Thu, 11 Mar 2021 19:23:53 GMT):<br/>
Hey everyone, as far as i can understand every besu node is linked with an orion node via a keypair. This way you can make private transactions between different nodes. What if  my network only has a handfull of nodes, but a hundred accounts using these nodes with their wallets. How would u go about using the privacy features between all these accounts? They dont have a orion node linked to their keys.
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Thu, 11 Mar 2021 22:49:00 GMT):<br/>
Hi @RobbeV 1 this is allowed using the multi-tenancy feature. For more details refer to https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Multi-Tenancy/
</p>
<p><strong>arash009</strong> (Thu, 11 Mar 2021 22:51:27 GMT):<br/>
If you want external unknown nodes to connect to your network then you cant use permissioning and ideally not static peers. Permissioning will allow you to operate on a public network but only with known nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 08:12:25 GMT):<br/>
Another thing is  I was using the network from the [Private Network Example](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Examples/Private-Network-Example/)
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 08:13:00 GMT):<br/>
It's fine for the address to be different for each compilation, it depends on you address and nonce and contract. The SE answer says "deterministically computed from the address of its creator (sender) and how many transactions the creator has sent (nonce)" so if the nonce changes, the address will.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 08:13:11 GMT):<br/>
Your genesis file looks fine.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 08:14:40 GMT):<br/>
If you used the network from the private network example, then you have to reset the chain as the tutorial doesn't include the contracts in the genesis.
You may need to delete the data folder to start from a fresh network.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 08:16:19 GMT):<br/>
Also for the contract address being different each time you build/deploy it, it's not an issue, that's why the ingress contract is there. Once you deployed your contract on the network, you have to register the address in the ingress contract (who has a fixed defined address). Ingress contract is a proxy.

Thanks @NicolasMassart, I was able to deploy the contract using your instructions.
The issue was that the byte code used in the genesis file was wrong. That was silly of me and I don't remember where I copy that from. But that was the problem.
Another thing I noticed is that when using multi node network setup, the contract is deployable only if the RPC node is also a miner. Why is it so?

The issue was that the byte code used in the genesis file was wrong. That was silly of me and I don't remember where I copy that from. But that was the problem.
Another thing I noticed is that when using multi node network setup, the contract is deployable only if the RPC node is also a miner. I tried other possible setup but that didn't worked. Why is it so?

@arash009 I think we can have permissioning enabled for external nodes. Although, we need to get the enode URL for the node and have to add it to the nodes allowlist.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=fdoZ9KAKzEsZiLtsd) @helderjnpinto if you are having trouble with validators not connecting with each other, please have a look at this [example](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Examples/Private-Network-Example/). You should be able to resolve this issue.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 19:46:43 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=JGt4bi8tcXmYQnX6f) You can't check the validity of peers if your public network does not have permissioning enabled. Since anyone can join, and a disconnected node can even join again.
On the other hand, if you enable permissions, you can use the Dapp from this [example](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Permissioning/Getting-Started-Onchain-Permissioning/#9-start-the-permissioning-management-dapp). You can add and remove nodes from here. No node will be able to connect to the network directly. They need to be added to the list first.
If you are looking for off-chain permissioning, it might be difficult to setup. I haven't tried it yet, but I think Besu stores the allowed nodes when starting the node, and if a new node has to be added, all the nodes have to be restarted.

Hey, I'm using Ingress contracts on my network. One thing I noticed is that when using multi node network setup, the contract is deployable only if the RPC node is also a miner. I tried other possible setup but that didn't worked. Why is it so?

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 14 Mar 2021 19:57:58 GMT):<br/>
This doesn't sound right. You should be able to have "non-miner" nodes in the network.

Could you share the config file that you are using for your nodes? Also the debug logs would help us understanding what could be happening.

Also, what do you mean by "the contract is deployable"? What contract is this?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 14 Mar 2021 20:07:27 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the extra info. 

What process are you using to update the account permissioning contract? e.g. are you using truffle or are you doing it manually?

I think the first thing we need to know is if the updated account rules contract has been deployed successfully, and if the Account Ingress contract has been updated to point to the address of the new Account Rules contract.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 14 Mar 2021 20:07:38 GMT):<br/>
So I'd start validating these
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 14 Mar 2021 20:08:52 GMT):<br/>
Also, if you have the debug logs from Besu, when you send the transaction, it could help tracking the problem down.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 14 Mar 2021 23:35:06 GMT):<br/>
Yeah the only scenario that I can think of that would cause this is if you have permissioning turned on from the get go (ie before you have deployed the contracts) - then if your RPC node does not have permission to contact the miner it won't be able to communicate - but you could get around this by using bootnodes config to bootstrap them - or turn on permissioning once the contracts are deployed.

Yes, that's what I asked for. I wanted to check if the node permissioning rules were rejecting other node's connections.

From the log, it looks like they are able to talk to each other.

In the other node's logs, do you see the same msg: "[...] Node permissioning: permitted enode [...]"

Is your Metamask connected to your network? Make sure you have the right URL and Chain Id.
</p>
<p><strong>Dazel</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:28:11 GMT):<br/>
I think so; the URL is the localhost in this case, right?
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:31:29 GMT):<br/>
I copied it first from the recompiled hex code. Then just for verification checked it in the documentation. Both were same.
The one that I had in my code was different from both, which I don't know how did that happen.
So the one mentioned in the docs is the correct one.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 18:34:13 GMT):<br/>
URL should be - *http://localhost:8545*
and Chain Id should be - *1981*

Hello rampatra, try adding `--rpc-http-host=0.0.0.0` so Besu binds the rpc interface to all available in the container
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 16:15:08 GMT):<br/>
I think you most likely will need to add `--host-allowlist=*` as well to allow connections from the host

There are two things in the configurations that I don't understand. Please explain with some practical example -
1. What is difference between `p2p-interface` and `p2p-host`?
2. What is the use of `miner extra data`? I know that it gets saved in the block, but why to do so, and how it helps?

<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Sat, 20 Mar 2021 13:53:44 GMT):<br/>
It's just as @shemnon  mentioned. Here is the quick link -
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/21.1.0/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-IBFT-Network/
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Sat, 20 Mar 2021 13:55:02 GMT):<br/>
This one is for v21.1.0. Change the docs for your version. Though they will likely be same.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 20 Mar 2021 15:19:08 GMT):<br/>
p2p host is what is advertised in the p2p messages as the host address, i.e. the public non-firewalled address.  p2p-interface is what address is bound to locally.  If you have only one network card then 0.0.0.0 is an acceptable interface.  If you use nat-method=upnp or docker it should auto-populate.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 20 Mar 2021 15:19:49 GMT):<br/>
miner extra data is for the graffiti or vanity data.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 20 Mar 2021 15:20:30 GMT):<br/>
the extra data field is used in PoA algorithms like clique, ibft, and qbft for signing, but they leave room for vanity bytes.

Hi all, I'm having an issue using Truffle (at least on v5.2.5) with Besu. Basically the [MetaCoin sample project](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/creating-a-project) doesn't deploy properly. It seems like it's a Truffle [bug](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/3913) and in the thread they're blaming the `--rpc.allow-unprotected-txs` added to geth. The thing is that I'm seeing a surprisingly similar behavior on Besu which, AFAIK, still allows non EIP-155 compliance txs (ref: [PR#1980](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1980)), throwing an exception with the following message `An unsupported encoded 'v' value of 0 was found`. The only tweak needed on the sample project to reproduce it is to add a HDWalletProvider to the `truffle-config.js` for hitting _dev_ network accounts. Has anybody else experienced the same?

It seems like it's a Truffle [bug](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/3913) and in the thread they're blaming the `--rpc.allow-unprotected-txs` added to geth. The thing is that I'm seeing a surprisingly similar behavior on Besu which, AFAIK, still allows non EIP-155 compliance txs (ref: [PR#1980](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1980) ), throwing an exception with the following message `An unsupported encoded 'v' value of 0 was found`. The only tweak needed on the sample project to reproduce it is to add a HDWalletProvider to the `truffle-config.js` for hitting _dev_ network accounts. Has anybody else experienced the same?

I tried some older 5.1.x versions of Truffle as well, with the same result, but I would blame the usual dependency instability that comes along with npm dependencies. I had a project with a cached `node_modules` which deployed fine, but once I wiped it out and installed the new Truffle version it never deployed again. Sadly, I lose the `package-lock.json` to know the proper working versions. Anyway, I went and tried the sample project with the reported results

Hey everyone. I'm trying to create a zero gas permissioned network following this two pages in the docs: (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Permissioning/Create-Permissioned-Network/) (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/FreeGas/). When I try to send a transaction through Metamask between the imported accounts the transaction stays on 'pending', although blocks keep being created. The transactions send properly when I'm using a non-zero gas network. Why is this happening?

Hi everyone, I was looking into pruning with hyperledger besu, and I have 2 questions: First of all, pruning is not supported for private transactions, is this something that will come in the future or is not possible? Second, I read that fast synchronization is enabled by default, wich also enables pruning by default. Therefor my network should allready be using pruning? I have used private transactions on this network so I'm a bit confused. Maybe it means that the public state can be pruned but not the private states?
</p>
<p><strong>RobbeV 1</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:35:14 GMT):<br/>
To add to this, I checked the diskspace of my 4 nodes, 2 of them are 1GB in size, while to others are 250MB in size. all 4 have the same configurations. except that one is a bootnode ofc. Does anyone have an explanation for this?

Hi team, does besu JWT token authentication support algorithm EdDSA specifically Ed25519?
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 11:17:30 GMT):<br/>
I believe we require RS256 JWT tokens, as described here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/APIs/Authentication/#jwt-public-key-authentication
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 11:18:55 GMT):<br/>
does your use case require the EdDSA algorithm? could you explain more about your requirement if so?
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 14:25:38 GMT):<br/>
Hey there, so there's a little inconsistency in the docs we need to fix- the updated content is here. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#sync-mode
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 14:26:59 GMT):<br/>
We are refocusing on Bonsai Tries instead of pruning, pruning is no longer a default in any mode https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Bonsai+Tries+Design+Overview
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 14:27:33 GMT):<br/>
Additionally, if you are connecting to a private network (anything aside from named testnets or the Ethereum main net), the default should be full sync as per the docs.
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 14:30:04 GMT):<br/>
We'll be testing private transactions against the new Bonsai Tries mode in the future for sure. :thumbsup: Do you have a specific need for something like that on your private network nodes? I'm honestly not sure why you have two larger nodes and two smaller, but I wouldn't recommend turning on pruning or fast sync on a private network in any case.
</p>
<p><strong>RobbeV 1</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:19:44 GMT):<br/>
I am looking into besu for using in harbor logistics using a private network. We need private transactions but we also want to make it as easy as possible for our clients to run their own nodes. Smaller disk spaces would be one way to make it easier for them. 
The bonsai tries looks promising, in what kind of timeframe can we expect the implementation of this?

<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 11:53:37 GMT):<br/>
Does Besu currently support Solidity 0.8?

If not, is there an ETA?
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 12:40:07 GMT):<br/>
Hi @mwaser , Ethereum isn't designed to have any knowledge of Solidity actually. Solidity compiles contracts into EVM bytecode which is what is specified by the Ethereum network. For your situation, that means your version is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 12:51:32 GMT):<br/>
But what if a newer Solidity version results in a newer bytecode that the old EVM doesn't understand? In other words, doesn't the EVM need updating in some cases when updating solidity?
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:03:00 GMT):<br/>
EVM changes are made through the ethereum governance process and network upgrades so Solidity never requires that the EVM "update". The dependency is the other way around, solidity targets the EVM.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:05:17 GMT):<br/>
So, you mean before a newer solidity version is released, the EVM is already updated (if necessary) following the eth governance process?
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:06:14 GMT):<br/>
Actually, you will find that the Azure Besu template is old enough that it uses Byzantium which is a problem for newer versions of Solidity and anything other than obsolete versions of OpenZeppelin.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:07:10 GMT):<br/>
Further, if I have a private Besu network, it isn't connected to the eth governance process.
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:08:52 GMT):<br/>
So, my current question stands, slightly rephrased to -- can the current version of Besu handle Solidity 0.8?  Or, do I need to do something else (i.e. the update mentioned above)?
</p>
<p><strong>mwaser</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:12:23 GMT):<br/>
Or, to rephrase again -- does Besu currently come with the necessary EVM bytecode to support Solidity 0.8?

This is a simple yes or no question and the original phrasing of "Does Besu currently support Solidity 0.8?" was entirely correct (and the pedantic lecture did NOT answer the simple yes or no question for a private network case).

<p><strong>rai</strong> (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:29:08 GMT):<br/>
Besu can handle current and all past EVM specifications.

If you are on a private network then you have various network upgrades specified in your genesis file. If you only specify old upgrade blocks, it's possible that Solidity 0.8 won't generate the correct bytecode for it.

Has Besu been used in a real world CBDC use case where a transaction happens between Bank A (client 1) and Bank B (client 2) such that other banks don't know about it? I know we have private transactions via Orion but how do we maintain a central ledger of balances of each bank if we go with private transactions?

What are the options/approaches here?

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 31 Mar 2021 03:58:12 GMT):<br/>
you might want to go to the EEA for those questions - in a nutshell, private transactions still maintain a central ledger, but only the hash of the private data is shared.

Hi All. I'm running some test on my besu private network using caliper.  The blockchain is configured with IBFT2 as the consensus algorithm with 8 validators and a blocktime of 10s. I've configured caliper to have 4 workers (every worker targets to a different validator) and a Master node, running each on a dedicated VM and connected using mqtt (distributed configuration). I'm using fixed rate controller with 1000 transactions and a fixed rate of 100 TPS. I've no problem with the query operation and the test gets completed. But when i run the transaction (or event the open) operation the test gets stucked waiting for "unfinished" transactions. Does anyone experienced the same behaviour? Any suggestions? Thanks, Emiliano

Hi everyone, I'm looking into privacy groups. One of the functions web3-eea offers is 'findPrivacyGroup()'. I can see cases where u want to use this, but in my case I'd rather have that users can't search for privacygroups. I'll explain further, when company A and company B make a privacygroup, I don't want company C to try to guess with findPrivacyGroup() if A and B have done private transactions. Is there a way to configer  my network so findPrivacyGroup is not allowed? Or is my consern flawed?

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 05 Apr 2021 23:24:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes. If you follow this example it walks through deploying a private contract to a group of 2 nodes, and demonstrating that a third node cannot access the contract. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Privacy/web3js-eea-Multinode-example/
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 05 Apr 2021 23:55:28 GMT):<br/>
What permissions have you given the JWT token that you are using? I suspect that EthersJS might be doing some calls to get information about the network but it is failing because it doesn't have the right permissions.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 05 Apr 2021 23:56:15 GMT):<br/>
Maybe you can disable authentication, enable the JSONRPC api tracing log and run your EtherJS script to see what requests EthersJS is sending to the client.

wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKeyBesu, provider);  //<<==this line causes error. No method was called. Before enabling auth, the app can init wallet, deploy contract and call methods of contract.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 06 Apr 2021 05:59:27 GMT):<br/>
What I meant is that I believe that when you instantiate the wallet, EtherJS is trying to get some information from the client through a JSON-RPC call. So it would be helpful to find out if that is the case.

If everything works when using cURL, we need to find what EthersJS is doing differently.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 06 Apr 2021 06:05:34 GMT):<br/>
From EthersJS docs, it looks like they make a call to eth_chainId (or eth_networkId as a fallback).

Could you try calling both endpoints with auth enabled using cURL to see if it works?

Reference: https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/jsonrpc-provider/#JsonRpcProvider

`If urlOrConnectionInfo is not specified, the default (i.e. http://localhost:8545) is used and if no network is specified, it will be determined automatically by querying the node using eth_chaindId and falling back on eth_networkId.`
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 06 Apr 2021 06:06:33 GMT):<br/>
Another thing that you could try for debugging purposes is configuring the JsonRpcProvider with the networkId and see if it works doing that.

Hello. `eth_estimateGas` on Besu rejects if we send the `nonce` argument with an error `Caused by: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field "nonce" (class org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.api.jsonrpc.internal.parameters.JsonCallParameter), not marked as ignorable (11 known properties: "gasPrice", "value", "gasLimit", "gas", "from", "to", "feeCap", "gasPremium", "strict", "data", "payload"])`.

the spec https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API doesn't specify anything about `nonce`. however, other platforms like go-ethereum/GoQuorum ignore if that argument is sent. This is useful when using Web3j Transaction request factory methods to build the Transaction object (code https://github.com/web3j/web3j/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/web3j/protocol/core/methods/request/Transaction.java), as we can re-use the same Transaction object to estimate and send. Having the error from Besu means that we need to build the transaction twice.

Would it make sense for Besu to do the same behaviour as Get/GoQuorum? ofc, other option is also create a change on Web3j to force the nonce as optional and/or allow to easily deep copy a transaction object. Thanks!

the feature is in early access so expect that functionality could change in future releases

<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Tue, 06 Apr 2021 11:47:25 GMT):<br/>
It's been in since 21.1.0 so any release since then should contain it, the latest release is always best for tweaks to the experimental flag features

Besu at the end of the configuration starts on its own and start synchronization. Your Besu is started with the configuration you gave it. so there is nothing left to do normally
</p>
<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Tue, 06 Apr 2021 12:10:35 GMT):<br/>
You launched a node in dev without mining. So I guess it is looking to connect to another peer to start the fastsync. Maybe you should add your peers in the static-nodes.json file to speed up the discovery of your other dev peers

Hi there - after upgrading a 3 node clique/poa private network node running in Kaleido to 21.1.3 from 1.5.0, I executed a protocol upgrade by adding `istanbulBlock` and `muirGlacierBlock`. I see the following exception when the node is attempting to mine what I think is the milestone block for `istanbul/muirGlacier`

</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 04:04:02 GMT):<br/>
The problem may be with `connection` which is currently constructed as object. From ethersjs doc, connection is a ConnectionInfo which seems to be a class. But I could not find how to init an instance.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 04:06:15 GMT):<br/>
I can't think of a reason for this not working. Either this is a hidden problem in Besu or EthersJS is doing something wrong.

I suggest that you do two things:
1. Open a ticket on GitHub and add all the information about the issue. Including the configuration file and other required files. Everything that we need to reproduce this issue ourselves and identify if it is a problem with Besu or EthersJS.

2. Try finding out if EthersJS has had any similar issues when using JWT or custom headers on the connection. It is possible that this has been identified by someone else and they might have a workaround for it.
</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 04:37:06 GMT):<br/>
I will add more info to the ethers github ticket which was opened a couple of days ago. There is no reply or comment yet.

I tried to init wallet with only url which won't work as we know. it returns same error of no network detected. It may be something related to authentication.

Is there any document or github on the subject of how can I deploy Besu as a service? for example a script that ask the user question about network configuration and then deploy in a kubernetes cluster and then the user can import smart contract on it?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 14:00:45 GMT):<br/>
Hi, we have several documentations and tools to ease the creation of a Besu config.
You may find something that suits your need on https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Deploy/Kubernetes/ and look at the Helm files that are designed to deploy a Besu node and some tooling around it. For instance for a PoW Node, you can look at one of the charts at https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/helm/quorum-besu/ethash/besu
Let me know if this is the kind of thing that you need, otherwise don't hesitate to tell me more about your needs.

</p>
<p><strong>reddevil</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:08:25 GMT):<br/>
thanks for taking a look @rai , I had the node running at `INFO` level. do you want me to re-sync the node with `DEBUG` level log?
</p>
<p><strong>reddevil</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:09:04 GMT):<br/>
because the logs don't show much before/after the stacktrace
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:10:10 GMT):<br/>
I'm mostly interested in the INFO level logging that happens at the beginning. So if you just want to provide up until the point you start getting sync messages, that works too.
</p>
<p><strong>reddevil</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:12:02 GMT):<br/>
will attach it to the github issue shortly.

<p><strong>ricardo.silva</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:21:51 GMT):<br/>
@lucassaldanha yes. I will move there.

@shemnon not sure if should be a bug, as this might be a question also if the RPC should be clarified if nonce is accepted or not (or ignored).
</p>
<p><strong>reddevil</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:43:34 GMT):<br/>
logs added with some context
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:56:31 GMT):<br/>
We have a strict/non-strict option for estimate gas. IMHO ignoring nonce ordering is a valid non-strict estimate request. (we already ignore balances for non-strict checks) So a bug would make sure it gets addressed.

I used to reboot the whole server and let the nodes sync. However I noticed a couple of times that there were only 1 or 2 peers synced (shall be 3). Then I tried to manually start node1 and then all other 3 nodes and the network was working fine. I am wondering if the boot node has to be started first.

Hi, I'm trying to setup Token Bridge with Hyperledger Besu and I'm stuck at trying to deploy the TokenBridge Contracts on the Home & Foreign EVM's.
Essentially after running the Deploy script I was able to get the Contracts to deploy on my home EVM but when the script tries to deploy to the Foreign network I run into an error saying I don't have enough (gas * price + value)

I'm using the Ropsten test network
With the Infura API endpoint

I believe I don't understand the formula for the gas when it comes to setting up the environment variables for the token bridge contract deployment script

I've had a look and would suggest following along with the documentation on the tokenbridge site, these are indicated as environment variables for the tokenbridge application. They also have a discord community you may be able to get answers in. Hope that helps!

I have setup orion nodes following the guide here: https://docs.orion.consensys.net/en/stable/HowTo/Quickstart/ however when I send a payload I get this error:
```
{"error":"NodeMissingPeerUrl"}
```
Any thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 23:18:48 GMT):<br/>
the solution was to define othernodes property. If we have multiple orion nodes then we have to define this property I think.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 23:19:04 GMT):<br/>
adding this got rid of the error and I was able to send and receive payload

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 11 Apr 2021 03:42:02 GMT):<br/>
These are the pre-existing account balances for the dev chain at block zero. The first key is the account address (20 bytes of the hash of the public key).  The second pointed value is the private key assocaited with them.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 11 Apr 2021 03:42:58 GMT):<br/>
You would never want to put a real private key in a genesis file, but these are well known private keys commonly used for testing accounts.  Often derived from bad password derived keys such as "cow".

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 11 Apr 2021 19:50:08 GMT):<br/>
Are you using two different public keys? You will get "NodeMissingPeerUrl" if you try to send a payload to an orion node that your node can't find. You can definitely start orion without "otherNodes" property and send to yourself.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Sun, 11 Apr 2021 21:44:22 GMT):<br/>
yes, I have 4 besu nodes and 3 of them have their own orion nodes.

<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Sun, 11 Apr 2021 21:44:33 GMT):<br/>
and I am trying to s end a priv  trans from one orion to another

<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 00:07:02 GMT):<br/>
A generic ethereum question  rather  than a besu one. Can one view (externally) the contents of a private variable defined in a contract? Or, the only way one can view (externally) is by declaring the variable `public`?

Asking because I know that even if a variable is declared `private` it still resides on the public blockchain so wanted to confirm if there are any other ways to read the variable like via eth.getStorageAt API or something.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 01:58:09 GMT):<br/>
it is here in the docs https://docs.orion.consensys.net/en/stable/Reference/Configuration-File/ just not in the "how to"
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 03:38:39 GMT):<br/>
Yes you can view it if you know where it lands in the storage, or if you are running it via a debugger.  the `private` keyword in solidity only applies to the data visibility within the context of the compiler, and does not speak to actual privacy or confidentially of data with regard tot he world at large.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 07:42:00 GMT):<br/>
You have to use the private keys to import it to any wallet.

<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 08:59:29 GMT):<br/>
thanks for your reply. I have some other noob questions if you dont mind. How does one know where it lands in storage?

So, if I understand you correctly, it is possible to read the value of a private variable outside the context of the compiler? So, can I read it via etherscan then? 

Asking because I tried reading it on etherscan and couldn't see it. Thanks again for helping me out here.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 09:01:01 GMT):<br/>
only the property and a short description is mentioned on the page you shared but how does one know that he needs to define a bootnode when there are multiple orion nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 09:02:47 GMT):<br/>
In short, I want to test it out. I want to read a private variable externally directly from the blockchain.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 11:44:33 GMT):<br/>
I saw a default explorer - **Alethio** provided with the containerized Besu implementation for private network. Now that I've successfully created and deployed contracts on the network, I want to have an explorer, with the functionality of paginated list of transactions and may be blocks as well (similar to ropsten).
But I couldn't find any APIs for the listing of txns. How could we do that?

:pray:
</p>
<p><strong>mohjam2004</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 18:23:43 GMT):<br/>
another question is that how can I use this kubernetes operator to deploy ibft2-with-privacy?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 18:47:27 GMT):<br/>
The default is for 2 bootnodes. If you need more, you will have to update the templates.
</p>
<p><strong>mohjam2004</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 18:47:58 GMT):<br/>
my next question is that, I used this operator but my deployed Prometheus has no targets and so the grafana has no graph
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 18:48:02 GMT):<br/>
That? https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/helm/quorum-besu/ibft2-with-privacy/besu
</p>
<p><strong>mohjam2004</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 18:48:38 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>mohjam2004</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 18:48:52 GMT):<br/>
but with kubernetes operator
</p>
<p><strong>mohjam2004</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 19:27:11 GMT):<br/>
I see. my question is that I have defined 3 boot nodes private and public keys:

<p><strong>mohjam2004</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 19:27:53 GMT):<br/>
now what changes I must do in genesis.json file?
</p>
<p><strong>mohjam2004</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 19:33:55 GMT):<br/>
and my next question is that when I wan to add a new boot node, I must only add bootnode3 private and public key in values.yaml? or other changes is required?

Can anyone pl help me with a sample code or reference to create a `flexible privacy group` via JSON-RPC?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:47:35 GMT):<br/>
I don't know how EthersJS does it. You might need to check their docs.
Besu expects is like this: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:48:08 GMT):<br/>
Here is a cURL example:

`curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6WyIqOioiXSwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJ1c2VyMiIsImlhdCI6MTU1MDQ2MTQxNiwiZXhwIjoxNTUwNDYxNzE2fQ.WQ1mqpqzRLHaoL8gOSEZPvnRs_qf6j__7A3Sg8vf9RKvWdNTww_vRJF1gjcVy-FFh96AchVnQyXVx0aNUz9O0txt8VN3jqABVWbGMfSk2T_CFdSw5aDjuriCsves9BQpP70Vhj-tseaudg-XU5hCokX0tChbAqd9fB2138zYm5M' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_listening","params":[],"id":1}' http://localhost:8545`
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:49:30 GMT):<br/>
Creating a flexible privacy group via JSON-RPC can be tricky, because you'll be sending transactions to the node (eea_sendRawTransaction).
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:50:09 GMT):<br/>
It can be done, it is just harder. I'd recommend using web3js-eea to deal with the complexity of building, encoding and signing the tx.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:50:09 GMT):<br/>
It can be done, it is just harder. I'd recommend using web3js-eea (javascript) or Web3j (java) to deal with the complexity of building, encoding and signing the tx.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:50:49 GMT):<br/>
Flexible privacy groups are created using smart contract logic, that's why you interact with them (and create them) using transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:52:19 GMT):<br/>

And here is the source where Web3js-eea is creating the tx that creates the privacy group:

<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:54:35 GMT):<br/>
thanks for helping out. Our application is in java so I am using the web3j sample code but can't get it to work. This is the problem I'm seeing: https://github.com/web3j/web3j/discussions/1401
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:55:00 GMT):<br/>
so thought of doing it directly via json-rpc but seems like that's harder
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:56:44 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for raising this. Hopefully someone from Web3labs will take a look at it soon.

If I have some time I'll try to take a look myself (although they might be able to find the issue faster than me).
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:58:28 GMT):<br/>
However, the `privCreatePrivacyGroup` method in web3j library works fine.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:58:49 GMT):<br/>
do you know the difference between `privCreatePrivacyGroup` and `privCreateOnChainPrivacyGroup`
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:59:17 GMT):<br/>
is one flexible and the other normal?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:00:04 GMT):<br/>
Sure, privCreatePrivacyGroup is used for "offchain" privacy groups, where the membership information is kept in Orion.

privCreateOnChainPrivacyGroup is used for flexible privacy groups. Membership information is kept in smart contracts.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:00:22 GMT):<br/>
So depending on the privacy mode that you are using, you should use one or the other.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:00:30 GMT):<br/>
oh ok
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:00:44 GMT):<br/>
so, the orion one is working so far with web3j
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:00:55 GMT):<br/>
but the onchain one is  not
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:01:10 GMT):<br/>
I can see in your issue that you have the flag `--privacy-onchain-groups-enabled=true` enabled. So `privCreateOnChainPrivacyGroup` is the one that you should use.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:01:38 GMT):<br/>
Your code in the ticket looks alright. Hopefully we can find what is happening and help you out.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:02:49 GMT):<br/>
Sure, that would be great. In the meanwhile, I will continue with the off chain privacy groups.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:03:33 GMT):<br/>
Could you please update the ticket with the web3j, Besu and Orion version that you are using?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:03:47 GMT):<br/>
That should make it easier for reproducing the problem locally
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:03:56 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 22:05:30 GMT):<br/>
and, just fyi, some of the sample code in web3j docs is outdated for sure. as I am using the latest web3j and some overloaded methods arent there
</p>
<p><strong>tomhay</strong> (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 00:44:25 GMT):<br/>
Would being able to use the Besu API to return a transaction object work for you in this case? I'm not sure that this is the direction you are thinking, but my thought is that you could use the Besu API method eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex and write a script in order to get a transaction object back, which you could transform into a list of transactions. I may be overcomplicating what you are trying to do, but in case this is useful, here is the reference to the API method: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#eth_gettransactionbyblocknumberandindex and the transaction object that would be returned: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Objects/#transaction-object
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 01:42:46 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I've got some extra info.

This bug has been fixed on Web3j a few weeks ago, but the latest released version of Web3j doesn't have the fix.

You should either wait for a release or maybe use a development version to get it working.

I've added some extra info on the ticket. Do let me know if there is anything else that I can help you with.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=rmG9Y9QfHaNuT8sDr) @NicolasMassart It would be great if I can find an explorer to use with Besu.
But if not, then I think there is no other option than saving the transactions in a database using the API that @tomhay pointed out (or may be any other).
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 14:36:43 GMT):<br/>
Any type of node that has enabled their RPC, is a RPC node. That can be a member node or a miner or even a validator.
If you have enabled RPC on your member node, you can run your codes their.

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 17:16:47 GMT):<br/>
Well if you want an explorer, any Ethereum compatible explorer will work, but if you want one that we tested, you can use the one described on this doc page https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Deploy/Lite-Block-Explorer/
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 17:19:38 GMT):<br/>
You don't need to change anything in the genesis. The genesis config describes what your network will be, what the first block will be (genesis block). But all nodes uses the same genesis. The only reason to modify a genesis is to add validators in the genesis block. But with the Besu IBFT2 setup that we provide , you already have enough validators to be bale to add new ones after the genesis by making them vote for the new nodes. So in your case, I think probably nothing to change on the genesis.
</p>

You don't need to change anything in the genesis. The genesis config describes what your network will be, what the first block will be (genesis block). But all nodes uses the same genesis. The only reason to modify a genesis is to add validators in the genesis block for PoA consensus. But you seem to use PoW Ethash. So in your case, I think probably nothing to change on the genesis.

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 17:20:35 GMT):<br/>
Then yes you may ahve to change the values to add you additionnal boodnode key, change the other keys to your own.

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 17:31:07 GMT):<br/>
About what else you need to change, it's going to be the templates used to generate the network config files.
The best is probably to start looking at the Helm tool before trying to make changes to the templates. https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/ will help you to get tarted.

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 20:57:52 GMT):<br/>
Hi @mohjam2004 in the quickstart the RPCnode is the equivalent of a member that you have in the operator - if you've spun up 3 members, then you can pick any of them
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 21:01:57 GMT):<br/>
To the best of my knowledge the operator doesn't have that functionality added yet and it will be added this year. There are helm charts that are available here https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-azure that you can use to spin up nodes with a privacy manager attached - these do IBFT2 only though, not ethash. But you can change that in the genesis jobs

https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/helm/quorum-besu/ethash/besu/templates There are only 2 bootnodes in the templates, hence only 2 are deployed
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 22:19:21 GMT):<br/>
Any charts in the https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/helm are intended for learning, and are quite 'fixed' ie the entire chart deploys a full network, rather than one node for example
</p>

The helmfile setup here https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/helmfile/quorum-besu/ibft2 should do what you want when you configure things. Or alternatively https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-azure/tree/master/helm/dev

<p><strong>markatag</strong> (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 22:31:18 GMT):<br/>
using modified npx docker setup, have 4 validator nodes on original setup, with RPCnode as well..and another machine on a seperate network with same setup...copied the genesis file, and added the RPC enode top static files list of second machine, as well as adding the RPC node and validator1 node to the second machine static nodes list as well
</p>

maybe i am confused..but I thought the second machine would see the first machine enode and pick up the details and sync..

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 08:38:35 GMT):<br/>
There are a couple of things you need to do to get Ethash working:

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 08:41:20 GMT):<br/>
then add the  `--miner--enabled` and `--miner-coinbase` parameters to some nodes that will serve as miners. Basically with the POA (IBFT) algorithms the validators create the blocks, with POW(ethash) you need to replace the validators with miners
</p>

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 16:07:37 GMT):<br/>
@mdwright88 this seems to have a nice UI and easy to use, but be careful because it requires a 3rd party: this is a service that you have to feed with your chain data using their CLI tool but you can't have the explorer running on your own architecture and it opens a breach to the outside if you want your network to be isolated from the outside. May be interesting though, but be careful about this aspect of the tool.

Nodes are syncing fine.  The error statement is noise and occurring at too high a level.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:44:03 GMT):<br/>
If your node has stopped syncing, it's likely because of a different problem.

<p><strong>IonutS</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 18:14:54 GMT):<br/>
I can confirm that it still syncs, I got confused by the noisy logs. I thought it keeps trying to go beyond that error. 
Any plans to improve syncing? Currently it is super slow compared to Open Ethereum client. I have like 2 months of syncing and still at block a bit over 10600000

https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/helm is probably the best learning tool re all consensus algorithms - they are however in helm and not an operator. So you'd need to look through the templates and customize to suit your requirements

Hello! First of all my compliments for having this really interesting project! I'm currently looking into Besu and I wonder if there are some guidelines about when to use which consensus protocol. It's especially the difference between Clique and IBFT that's not clear to me. Also I wonder about scalability, how large could IBFT or Clique based networks scale?
</p>
<p><strong>arjanvaneersel</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 03:59:24 GMT):<br/>
And just out of curiosity: Quorum was made in Go (for as far as I know), why the change to Java? Usually I see people moving from Java to Go for performance reasons, but from Go to Java I have not seen before.
</p>
<p><strong>sownak</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 08:41:00 GMT):<br/>
So it seems that although Besu now supports DNS names via Xdns-enabled but the admin_addPeer function does not accept a DNS name in place of the IP address (it is throwing parse error). Where can this issue be raised?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 10:48:21 GMT):<br/>
This is a bit more complex and only brand related. Let me explain:
- Before August 2020, Quorum was a JP Morgan project written in Go and forked from Geth.
- Besu is the Hyperledger ethereum client written in Java.

ConsenSys acquired the Quorum project and decided to use the name as an umbrella for a suite of products related to Ethereum enterprise offering.
They then renamed the Go client to GoQuorum. Besu, the Java client, is still Besu. But now both are shipped by ConsenSys under the Quorum brand alongside other tools like EthSigner, Tesssera, Orion,...

So there was no migration from Go to Java, Quorum is just a name for an ecosystem composed of the Go and Java client. You can choose which one to use.
See more about Quorum, the umbrella brand, at https://consensys.net/quorum/faq
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 10:52:11 GMT):<br/>
The biggest difference is Clique doesn't have immediate finality compared to IBFT2. Read more about these PoA protocols on Besu doc https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Consensus-Protocols/Comparing-PoA/
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 10:57:20 GMT):<br/>
This is very likely a network issue between your two machines. Did you open 30303 ports on both UDP and TCP? Are you sure the interface used to expose your node are not localhost only?
Are the routes between your two networks correctly configured (can you telnet on port 30303 between the nodes?)
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 10:58:01 GMT):<br/>
We would need the command line and toml configuration file used on both nodes to investigate more.
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 10:58:57 GMT):<br/>
This is a different problem than the zero gas price one right?
</p>
<p><strong>IonutS</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 12:55:02 GMT):<br/>
That would be great feature though! I think currently Besu is the only real alternative to Open Ethereum with trace api and EIP 1898 included. We now see again the OE has issues during the Berlin Hard Fork and a lot of services are relying on that.

Hi everyone, I'm looking into privacy groups. One of the functions web3-eea offers is 'findPrivacyGroup()'. I can see cases where u want to use this, but in my case I'd rather have that users can't search for privacygroups. I'll explain further, when company A and company B make a privacygroup, I don't want company C to try to guess with findPrivacyGroup() if A and B have done private transactions. Is there a way to configer my network so findPrivacyGroup is not allowed? Or is my consern flawed?

I get that error over and over again until besu just dies. This was happening before i updated the besu client but am now on version besu/v21.1.1/linux-x86_64/openjdk-java-11
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 18:49:39 GMT):<br/>
Hi @A1forETH, we have a fix for that being worked on right now: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2143
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 18:50:29 GMT):<br/>
However, I wasn't aware that it was causing the node to fall over. I was under the impression that it was just spamming a lot of logs. Could you provide your full besu logs?
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 18:51:00 GMT):<br/>
And all configuration including the command line args and the config-file you're using
</p>
<p><strong>A1forETH</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 18:55:52 GMT):<br/>
Yea i can but I think I found the real issue. It was just buried in the other errors that 2143 fixes.
My drive is full thought it was 2T but its only 1T. 

If I enable pruning will besu start pruning the database right away to start making more space?
</p>
<p><strong>rai</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 19:05:10 GMT):<br/>
Ok, that makes much more sense. With pruning, it takes some space to makes some space unfortunately! We have to store metadata (namely which nodes to keep when we start sweeping the database). Try resizing and starting pruning

Ill have to move to a new drive. Im currently remote form my system so i may just have to remove the chain data and start with pruning enabled.

@clzola That is an interesting question indeed. I'd like to know the answer to that too.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 14:40:52 GMT):<br/>
Suppressing empty blocks is not part of IBFT2 right now.  IIRC only Aura on OpenEthereum supports that feature.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 16:50:49 GMT):<br/>
it's also a good idea to have blocks, even if empty, as they help the chain keep secure. Otherwise the tip of the chain can be forked more easily.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 18:21:54 GMT):<br/>
With a BFT protocol you can keep increasing the round counter instead of issuing a block. But BFTs are different from Clique and PoW in that a quorum must approve the block, so there is no forking. (that's how they get their finality).  I think it was discussed as a possibility for QBFT but I'm not sure how far the discussion went.

Hi everyone,
we are working on adding a new signature algorithm (secp256r1) to Besu. The Java implementation is finished, but for performance reasons we need to select a native library implementation as well. I reviewed many different libraries and I think two of them would be suitable. I have created a Google Doc with an overview. Please let me know what you think about them:

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=jaLFJMrxzAmcbacxs) as @shemnon mentioned, IBFT2 requires blocks being mined even if they are empty at the current state. However, instead of not mining empty blocks, maybe there could be an algorithm which groups the empty blocks together as a chain re-org and registers as one block only. 

So if your 1st block is mined and from 2 to 8th blocks are empty and there is data on only 9th and later blocks, maybe the daemon can pack the blocks from 2th to 8th, and record as single block.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 13:14:07 GMT):<br/>
Though again this approach has to be tested against malicious nodes (if there are untrusted participants in the PoA)
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 13:16:27 GMT):<br/>
Do you guys think it is a good idea to remove the PoW and Clique related things if we want to deploy IBFT2 chain? Besu currently supports different consensus algorithms but I wonder how that effects the performance & storage of the client.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 13:18:38 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=TwuyJkS84nTAKewix) Why would you want to do that? In case you want everyone to pay the same gas price for executing things, what happens when there are more TXs coming than your network can handle per second?
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 13:19:23 GMT):<br/>
I mean, assume that you handle 5 tx per second, each 10 gwei/gas. If you start receiving 10 tx per second and you won't allow people to outbid each other, it's gonna be like rolling the dice to have a tx get recorded.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 13:20:20 GMT):<br/>
If you don't think you'll reach the block limit, then simply set min gas variable when running node, so that node rejects any tx sent with lower gas than that. And that would be the minimum limit, so kinda like fixed but if network activity grows, can increase etc.
</p>
<p><strong>RobbeV 1</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:34:25 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone, I'm trying to  add a member to a privacy group. web3.priv doesn't have the addToPrivacyGroup function, am I supposed to use web3.privx? And what is the difference between web3.priv and web3.privx?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:39:03 GMT):<br/>
Not right now.  It would be difficult because a gas free network is actually a network that accepts a zero gas price.  TXes are always free to set the gas price to whatever they want.  The problem with a fixed cost network is you would disregard the gas price in the TX.  Doable, but that's not how Besu is currently written.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:41:37 GMT):<br/>
Removing the clique and PoW code from Besu in general is a non-starter.  Mainnet compatability is one of its pillars.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:42:00 GMT):<br/>
If your code is only configured to use IBFT then clique and PoW specific code won't be used.

But the difficulty of a block is showing as - `0x20000`. Also, it is taking very long for block creation, something like more than 15 mins. And even the difficulty is not changing with blocks. I only have 2 miners in the network for now.
Please guide me on this, to how to have a network with 12sec latency in block creation, and dynamic difficulty; similar to Ethereum blockchain.

But the difficulty of a block is showing as - `0x20000`. Also, it is taking very long for block creation, something like more than 15 mins. And even the difficulty is not changing with blocks. I only have 2 miners in the network for now.
Please guide me on this, to how to have a network with 12sec latency in block creation, and dynamic difficulty; similar to Ethereum blockchain. Currently, the permissioning contracts have not been deployed on the network, as I was just checking that the node connects and the block creation time is correct.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 15:10:23 GMT):<br/>
`0x20000` is the protocol defined minimum difficulty for a floating difficulty.  Try playing with `fixeddifficulty` - that will provide the irregular block times you don't get with clique - https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/Config-Items/#fixed-difficulty
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:24:46 GMT):<br/>
But wouldn't that fix the difficulty in the future too? I mean when there will be many miners with high computation resources, the blocks could be mined in very few seconds, and that create inconsistency within the network.
P.S - This Ethash network will be public.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:33:04 GMT):<br/>
```
Using fixeddifficulty is not recommended for use with Ethash outside of test environments. For production networks using Ethash, we recommend setting a low difficulty value in the genesis file instead. Ethash will adjust the difficulty of the network based on hashrate to produce blocks at the targeted frequency.
```
Quoting this line from the link you provided and the statement that you made `fixeddifficulty` is static and the minimum difficulty would be `0x20000` only when using `difficulty` parameter. But as the miners increase and the difficulty should exceed the above number, will then the difficulty becomes dynamic and works similar to Ethereum?
Second question is - can we decrease/increase the block creation time than the one in Ethereum? If yes, how?
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:57:39 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK fixed difficulty is, well, fixed. You use it during development. And you switch to difficulty on deployment.

If you can't find enough hashpower to mine even 0x20000 on the beginning, you might want to reconsider your choices for the network security because anyone renting hashrate from Nicehash would be able to takeover your network.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 08:10:41 GMT):<br/>
Okay. @Nithronium, thanks for verifying this.
If we take care of the hash power, will the `difficulty` be dynamic after that. And secondly, can we change the block creation time?
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 10:05:46 GMT):<br/>
on the config, for the IBFT2 (i am trying that one), I have options inside the ibft2 object, that can specify `blockperiodseconds` so maybe for ethash there's that too.

Hi everyone. When creating a free-gas permissioned Clique network, transactions aren't always sent. I have tried this a few times and on some tries it works, on others doesn't. I have followed the documentation, what might I be doing wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>cbfh</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 11:27:28 GMT):<br/>
Blocks are created correctly, and the nodes connect properly as peers
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 13:17:27 GMT):<br/>
What error/message do you get when you submit a transaction? How do you submit your transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 13:59:14 GMT):<br/>
ethash cannot fix blocks per second.  Difficulty floats or difficulty is fixed.  Perhaps we need to expose a knob to make the floor difficulty configurable.  But I think a better approach would be to use GPU mining via stratum.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:43:50 GMT):<br/>
The thing is, Ethereum has a fixed 13 second block-interval. So depending on the average difficulty increases or decreases to hit the 13s average target. 

Now one might want to have a PoW network with ethash where block interval is, say, 30 seconds, or 5 seconds. 

I think this could be an option for ethash too, so on private PoW networks using besu one can configure block interval.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:44:54 GMT):<br/>
If one wants to create their own chain, and not planning to use mainnet ever, this still would be a no?
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:45:36 GMT):<br/>
Or perhaps adjust the build + somehow embed the genesis file in it? So once node is built, release could be shared with other peers and they can run a peer node without specifying any flags.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:45:48 GMT):<br/>
Or would it be better to build a docker container for the peer node?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:47:26 GMT):<br/>
Ethereum 1.0 does not have a fixed 13 second block interal, there is a floating difficulty algorithm that averages down to 13 seconds in the long run.  Minimum difficulty is part of that algorithm
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:48:00 GMT):<br/>
Why fork the client?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:49:17 GMT):<br/>
If you can configure a genesis that accommodates your chain definition forking the client adds risk, you then have to keep the fork up to date.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:50:15 GMT):<br/>
That's my point. Sorry for phrasing it wrongly (english is not my native). What I meant was what you said, on average it finds blocks every 13s. Changing that shouldn't be that hard, no? Simply on the algo multiply the diff target by 1/13 to get value for 1s interval, then multiply with whatever number you want to adjust the average block interval. 

Couldn't that be an option on besu for private networks?
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:51:18 GMT):<br/>
If I configure a genesis, I still need a way to make people download besu + download genesis + run with the flags. In order to have something that takes just one command with no flags + automatically connect to the chain would be a better user experience.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 15:07:55 GMT):<br/>
Right, that's just a distribution not a fork.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 15:09:31 GMT):<br/>
Proof of work for private networks is a very bad idea.  It's only useful for really one top dog network per algorithm, otherwise you can be 51% attacked very easily.  That's why Besu has Proof of Authority algos like BFT and Clique.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 15:11:20 GMT):<br/>
If you can enumerate who should be using the network (hence the private moniker) then you can enumerate who should be validating.

hello again @joshuafernandes 
I have opened an issue in Alethio.
If you can help on this, I'll be glad to.
https://github.com/Alethio/ethstats-network-server/issues/23
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Sat, 24 Apr 2021 12:08:52 GMT):<br/>
But this network is supposed to be public. So what I can understand is that the Besu PoW network would try to have a average of 13s interval by default and the minimum floating difficulty is `0x20000`.
Can we change these values and if yes, then how?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 24 Apr 2021 13:51:55 GMT):<br/>
Code would need to be written to allow the minimum to be configured.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 24 Apr 2021 13:53:52 GMT):<br/>
I would first recommend trying to get a local stratum instance setup, with GPU mining.   A typical GPU should be able to pull the minimum by itself.  CPU mining in Besu is quite inefficient.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 24 Apr 2021 13:54:40 GMT):<br/>
But your public network will also be trivially subject to 51% attacks.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Sat, 24 Apr 2021 14:14:11 GMT):<br/>
Will do that @shemnon . Thanks for the advice.
I suppose the 13s interval is also not configurable, even in the source code, right?

<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 03:55:14 GMT):<br/>
It really changes for me. I have multiple droplets of same spec, generated them together by creating multiple instance at once.

Some of them directly starts the node, some of them does that and it sometimes takes 5 seconds, sometimes 30 minutes. What's weird is that once a node starts and I abort with CTRL + C on the terminal, and restart with same command, it sometimes takes 10-15 minutes for it to load the library. 

Eventually the node starts. Maximum time period I saw was 30 minutes.

I am trying to configure a clique network. When running the network locally as stipulated in the tutorial in the documentation everything works fine. However when I deploy to AWS the initial signer node isn't producing any blocks.

}`

Other nodes can connect without a problem: `EthScheduler-Timer-0 | INFO  | FullSyncTargetManager | No sync target, waiting for peers: 4`.

Also the log shows no errors, just this warning, but the node does boot: `ANTLR Tool version 4.7.1 used for code generation does not match the current runtime version 4.8ANTL Runtime version 4.7.1 used for parser compilation does not match the current runtime...`

The signer's node address is: 0x860dd0cc99142b5ebc39a6ceb99ce05348851d4f. That's included in the extradata part of the genesis file.

Anyone having a clue what I'm doing wrong, causing that the node isn't producing blocks?

I'm building a netowrk with besu and orion, with two machines in aws, each machine has group of 3 nodes with orion, under a Dicker network. When two of the nodes of the same machine send a private transaction between them, all goes right, when sending a private transaction between a node in a machine and a node from the other, seems like everything goes ok, but an event that should be emiited, is skipped, but there is no error log anywhere

Hi guys, may I ask you whether it is possible to get the current list of validators from the smart contract, please? Sometimes it might be very useful - e.g., governance. This info should be presented in extraData header field but even this one seems not accessible from the smart contract.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 17:13:22 GMT):<br/>
Currently, no.  My take is that this would require a new precompiled contract since it's interacting basically across layers.  However there are bytecodes to support PoW consensus (COINBASE, DIFFICULTY) so its addition woudln't be without precedent.

</p>
<p><strong>arjanvaneersel</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 13:26:16 GMT):<br/>
I found the issue. Something went wrong in with deploying via terraform and the keys weren't saved on the AWS node. This caused that the node got a different address than what was mentioned in the genesis file, hence it not being a signer.
</p>
<p><strong>arjanvaneersel</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 13:29:00 GMT):<br/>
My previous issue is solved. The only thing I don't get yet is how I can add additional signers. In total I have 4 nodes. So as stipulated in the documentation I sent the request to add node1 as a signer to node0. That went fine.

To make node2 a signer I sent the request to both node0 and node1, however that didn't work. I do wonder whether I should change the value of ID in the rpc request?

<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 15:56:26 GMT):<br/>
The smart contract, as well as the EVM works deterministic. So adding the extra data field to the contract wouldn't be something "inside" the EVM but someting inside the node. 

What you can do is that write a contract that holds an array of IP addresses, and each time you run your contract from one of the machines, let the machine first get network state, then embed it to the call and write to the contract. This way, just like oracles, you would be writing node state TO THE CHAIN.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 16:04:56 GMT):<br/>
That's the outside approach.  The downside is that you need to keep the observer service up, so if the observer goes down data goes out of sync.  The upside, which should not be overlooked, is that you can do this without changing node software.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 16:05:25 GMT):<br/>
Are there any ways to make IBFT2 mining profits to go to one wallet address instead of the verifying node? I tried `coinbase` parameter on Genesis but seems like it doesn't work.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 16:05:57 GMT):<br/>
You can add hooks so that contracts can detect a downed observer by adding "heartbeat" checks that will always update some value at fixed intervals even if nothing changes.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 16:06:12 GMT):<br/>
More devops work, but zero node changes.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 16:07:17 GMT):<br/>
Adding node list as a extradata has no benefits in terms of networking because each node will be producing different extradata depending on peers they are connected to. This would break the deterministic approach of EVM.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 16:07:51 GMT):<br/>
On the other hand, if one node periodically writes that extra data to the chain, it means there's trust involved. And since there's trust involved, the node's peer activity can be tracked with an external software.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 16:08:13 GMT):<br/>
Even better, if all nodes have their RPC exposed, a single app can fetch that data periodically from each node and record.

<p><strong>cbfh</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 16:18:21 GMT):<br/>
Have you tried using --miner-coinbase when you start a node?
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 16:19:32 GMT):<br/>
The --miner-coinbase is related to node's mining setting. I require something that is in the genesis.json so if more nodes (independent ones) start up, their validated income also paid to the miner address in the genesis.

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 22:17:05 GMT):<br/>
We have a page in our docs about setting up a permissioned network. I believe it is a good start to understand how it works.

</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 22:22:49 GMT):<br/>
@IvanHomoliak it would be interesting to hear what is the use case for having access to validators from the EVM scope.

At the moment, Besu has a JSON-RPC method that you can use to retrieve the list of validators on any point in the chain (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#ibft_getvalidatorsbyblockhash).
</p>
<p><strong>Victorbesu</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 22:23:29 GMT):<br/>
Hi team.

Looking for some support please. To set up Besu, I went in the direction starting with besu-sample-networks project. Well since then I have successfully used besu locally with my dapp and it worked well for my initial tests. I could query, and send txs to the blockchain.

Then I handed this off to the devops in my org and after a few weeks he had it in Argo CD setup. Now I am in the following situation

* I can connect to this remote besu instance in meta mask
* I can see that I have a balance in metamask on this network
* I can run migration scripts from truffle to my network
* I can load code into Remix and interact with the contract.
* But in remix, I cannot read from the contract

Now my problem is although I can see native eth balance and execute transactions with my account ( it has balance on genesis file) --> 

I still cannot "Get" from the blockchain, I cannot read anything. I cannot read values with remix, I cannot read values from my ethers.js project.

When checking documentation someone mentioned this https://github.com/adetante/explorer-besu-plugin , is that my best bet to resolve this issue?

When using https://github.com/ConsenSys/besu-sample-networks how to configure allow list if using on the cloud?t
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 22:28:03 GMT):<br/>
It should make no difference running Besu locally or on a hosted server (considering all the networking configuration is correct).

Do you get any errors from Remix when trying to "read" from the contract? Anything on Besu logs that could indicate an issue?

Remix interacts with the node through JSON-RPC (so does MetaMask). You could try sending an eth_call cURL request to the node to check if you can get an insight on why it isn't working.

Hmmm, now that I have checked this issue with my own instance, I've seen the same. 

The node must be reporting correctly because I have an EXTERNAL block explorer installed and there I can see the total supply, token holders etc. on my custom ERC-20. But for some reason Remix can't parse that data.

      documentAddress
    );

    // Build Increment Tx
    const documentTx = document.methods.setKey(receiverAddress, key);

    // Sign Tx with PK
    const createTransaction = await this.web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(
      {
        to: documentAddress,
        data: documentTx.encodeABI(),
        gas: 23064,
        privateFrom: enclaveKey,
        privacyGroupId: privacyId,
        privateKey: this.account.privateKey.substring(2),
      },
      this.account.privateKey
    );

    // Send Tx and Wait for Receipt
    const createReceipt = await this.web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
      createTransaction.rawTransaction
    );
    console.log(
      `Document shared successfully with hash: ${createReceipt.transactionHash}\n`

There's no problem there. However, keep in mind that if they deploy the nodes on one machine like the examples on documentation, if machine goes down, your network might stall. 

Also if internet goes down, since they all have same network, all nodes will go down.

Hello, when dealing with a permissioned network for many institutions, is it possible to have a topology that the validators talk to each other using nodes that are not validators?

I heard it was not possible a few years ago (not sure if it was a bug). Does Besu support that?

<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Sat, 01 May 2021 07:17:58 GMT):<br/>
The topology you posted is valid. However what you are asking is not valid afaik. 

The reason would be the Byzantine Attack because if you put a bridge node, that node might interrupt messages (even though can't change). That might cause network to stop producing blocks. 

Also would cause extra workload.

<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 13:32:26 GMT):<br/>
I agree with your concerns, @Nithronium. The bridge node may be attacked in this architecture and could stop the communication with validators anyway. 
I think there are pros and cons in creating this "bridge" node that protect validators. 
Anyway, I heard that this option was not even possible 1-2 years ago. It seems that there was a strict requirement to validators talk directly among them.

if you are using a home network and your IP changes, you will have to restart the outside nodes because they'll have to find your new IP. 

OR you can configure an outside node as the bootnode, and your local node as the secondary nodes so even if your IP changes, your node will connect to bootnode.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 18:16:37 GMT):<br/>
Also if you want other nodes to access your node, you might want to open your 30303 port from the router

ConsenSys Software R&D is working on crosschain function calls across any blockchain (permissioned, permissionless, EVM based and non-EVM based). Have a look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12783.pdf and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixK0_ltjr8k

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 04 May 2021 02:00:55 GMT):<br/>
@SuzanaMaranhao you are correct. All validators must be able to connect to each other. There is no relaying of IBFT messages.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Tue, 04 May 2021 08:32:28 GMT):<br/>
@SuzanaMaranhao could you please explain what would be the pros of such approach?

Besu node doesn't store any private key except the one for the node. So the worst case scenario for direct communication with a node is that you leave some ports open and people SSH and steal your key for your node. And what they can do with that is being a byzantine node and broadcasting false messages. Which actually has the same attack surface with your bridge node. 

Are there any pros that I am missing?

Regarding my last question about dynamic IP: if I'm running a node at a home network for a permissioned network, is there any way I can take advantage of a website like No-IP to set up a dynamic DNS IP? Or must I stick to the solution provided by @Nithronium about using an outside node as a bootnode?

<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Wed, 05 May 2021 15:02:17 GMT):<br/>
Hey @RobbeV 1, the Besu team improved Caliper support for Besu last year and have been testing against Caliper for a good while now - these instructions should work to configure everything I believe https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/ethereum-config/
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 06:38:41 GMT):<br/>
I haven't tried such service myself. However, if the mentioned service makes you install an app on your device, and every time your IP changes, updates their DNS records to resolve the domain always to your device, then this might do it.

The next two week release should eliminate those logs.  Some other client on the network (not besu) is sending a bad key in p2p stuff.  
The fix is to move the notification from error to debug.

Has anyone benchmarked Besu for gas cap? For example, if set with 4 nodes and 50M gas with 2 sec block interval, if we have like 32 GB RAM, 16vCPU, load balancing system, would it handle?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 20:15:30 GMT):<br/>
50MM gas is no enough, you will saturate the chain at that level. 
 Try 70-100MM.

300 tps.  And the constraint was how fast we can serve the transaction receipts to the test harness.  If the harness checked receipts later and did more sensible querying it could ho higher.

Probably only need 8-16 Gib and 4-8 cores to achieve that.  You will also need one or more RPC only nodes. with beefier specs.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 20:17:04 GMT):<br/>
A more useful metric would be how much gas per second is used because not all Ethereum transactions are the same.  I don't think we could do 300 uniswaps per second, for example.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 20:19:06 GMT):<br/>
What about regular 21K gas transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 20:19:43 GMT):<br/>
and also what is the bottleneck in sending 300 uniswaps per second for example? the cpu or the memory? or simply read-write ratio of the storage?
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 20:21:00 GMT):<br/>
BSC can handle 150tps as of now, I think
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 22:16:46 GMT):<br/>
Is there any way to reduce maximum allowed gas after deploying the chain?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 22:26:37 GMT):<br/>
Two approaches, either restart each node with `--target-gas-limit` or call https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#miner_changetargetgaslimit on each node.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 22:26:42 GMT):<br/>

In besu when you create a private transactions you end up with a public marker transaction and a private one distributed with orion.

<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Tue, 11 May 2021 05:39:03 GMT):<br/>
To get a list of all private transactions in a network you can iterate over all blocks and transactions using json-rpc and then filter out the ones that are addressed to the marker transaction.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Tue, 11 May 2021 05:40:05 GMT):<br/>
It's the same question as get me a list of all transaction to an address. The answer is, it's a pain because you need to iterate over every block.

<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Tue, 11 May 2021 07:12:01 GMT):<br/>
sorry, I actually mean how to read the contents of the private transaction after knowing the public marker transaction?

I understand that I have to iterate all the blocks and filter out the marker transactions and there's no direct way to get all marker transactions yet.

Also, is this the same with tessera?
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Tue, 11 May 2021 07:49:03 GMT):<br/>
Once you have the transaction key it's easy. You can just hit `/receive` with the transaction key and the enclave key.

https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/acceptance-tests/tests/src/test/java/org/hyperledger/besu/tests/web3j/privacy/PrivacyClusterAcceptanceTest.java#L169

shows you how it was done in besu.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Tue, 11 May 2021 07:49:42 GMT):<br/>
The other option is to hit the db directly. Setup orion to use postgres https://docs.orion.consensys.net/en/stable/Tutorials/Using-PostgreSQL/ then just query that like normal!

</p>
<p><strong>cbfh</strong> (Tue, 11 May 2021 07:57:10 GMT):<br/>
I guess eth_sendTransaction gets called inside w3.eth.contract(), which is not supported
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 11 May 2021 07:58:17 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Tue, 11 May 2021 13:53:12 GMT):<br/>
So, if I go with the postgres route, would I still need to traverse the blocks to get the marker transaction? 

In other words, would I need the key (used to receive the orion payload) from the marker transaction?

If I have access to the entire db then I can just read it from there without this key. Am I right?

Not sure entirely what you mean. But the commit seals that are included in the extra data for the finalised block are created using IbftRound.createCommitSeal which does a keccak256(commitHash) where the commit hash is the hash of the proposed block header with the extra data changed to exclude the commit seals.

The hash that is signed and included as part of the IBFT2 messages does a keccak256(messageCode, rlp(payload)) which is done in IbftPayload.

Hi Vijay, thank you very much for your reply. I've downloaded the https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart samples and I'm following the Hyperledger Besu path. I've successfully launched the test network with privacy enabled and my next step would be the pet-shop dapp deployment. This deployment is currently failing due to a lack of funds in the owner account I'm using, but I've realized the genesis file includes three accounts with plenty of balance. The problem is when I import any of those accounts in metamask, it is showing a zero/empty balance, though, the account's balance on the block explorer shows the opposite, that's why I'm pretty sure there is a problem with metamask. Then, to workaround this issue, I'd like to find a way to manually create accounts, in this manner I'll be able to include them in the genesis file and finally, recreate the network and use those accounts to deploy the dapp. I'm trying to build something based on web3 to do that, so, as I've told, any help will be very appreciated.

Hey @gortaire it looks like your Metamask is not connecting to your Besu node. Can you perhaps screenshot the address and port in your Metamask network selection? Are there any errors in your Besu logs when you try to connect?

in the rpcnode?

Fixed!. I've recreated again all the installation and also the rpc connection on metamask with a different name and now all is working fine.

<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 21:50:14 GMT):<br/>
i'm having a hard time understanding the initial sync process of my Besu client.... here's what I think i know so far.  I'm running fast sync, so it shouldn't be trying to execute any contracts older than my pivot block, which is top block as of startup time, minus 64. My blockchain is synced up till the time I started it, but it hasn't pulled in any new blocks. It continues to pull down world state too. How can I tell if I did anything wrong, or how much of the state tries remain to be pulled in?
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 21:51:13 GMT):<br/>
i'm currently almost 6K blocks behind, and not sure when that will start coming down. I'm not sure how much world state remains or what it's actually doing right now.
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 22:28:00 GMT):<br/>
Blocks after the pivot block can't be imported until the whole world state has downloaded, because those do need to have their transactions processed and that requires the world state.
Unfortunately with the way that the protocols work for fast sync there isn't any way to get a clear indication of how many trie nodes are left to download because it keeps changing.  Last I heard I think was about 700 million but my memory may be off on that.

Also, it's common for the process to need to move up to a more recent pivot block because all peers have pruned the world state at the original pivot block. In that case Besu has to walk the whole world state trie again and download any nodes that have changed which significantly increases the total number of trie nodes that wind up being downloaded.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 22:30:27 GMT):<br/>
thanks! that explains a lot. I assume when i get to a case where  state has aged out, i can just bounce my client, and it'll choose a new pivot 64 blocks from head of chain
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 22:54:24 GMT):<br/>
Definitely don't bounce your client.  Besu will handle the case where it can't get the state from peers automatically.  You'll see it log a message about selecting a new pivot block - not sure what the actual wording is though.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 22:55:25 GMT):<br/>
is increasing --max-peers worth a bounce though? I have plenty of bandwidth (gig fiber)
</p>
<p><strong>ajsutton</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 22:56:55 GMT):<br/>
Maybe but usually the sync is limited by your disk speed.  The problem with restarting is that you guarantee Besu will have to start walking the trie from scratch again when you do it.
</p>
<p><strong>RoboCopsGoneMad</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 22:57:41 GMT):<br/>
right because it's a wholy new intermediate state starting point

You can _read_ public state from private tx but you can't write to the public state from a private transaction. We have a web3js-eea example here which reads from the public state https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3js-eea/tree/master/example/accessPublicState
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 10:17:57 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 10:18:39 GMT):<br/>
Then what will be the work around for this? What if one wants to update the public state in a private transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 12:41:07 GMT):<br/>
you can't it's basically impossible to do it in a single transaction. 

You could have something like an atomic swap between public and private state to achieve what you want but it's a multistage process.

Hi, sorry for only getting to this now. What I want to do is be able to recover the ethereum address that created the seal. I'm able to get to the correct block hash (or commitHash above), but the recovered addresses doesn't match the validator addresses. It should be as simple as ecrecover(keccak256(keccak256(rlp encoded blockheader)), validator seal), right ?

</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Tue, 18 May 2021 17:09:05 GMT):<br/>
Not the actual UTXO implementation as simply it's not an EVM chain. However, the communication protocol could be implemented as an alternative, I think
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Tue, 18 May 2021 17:09:19 GMT):<br/>
It basically deals on the communication aspect of the nodes and scalability.

Hi coenie, We are actually do a recover to verify the seals are from known validators in the BftCommitSealsValidationRule which uses the BftInterface so you can see how to recover the validator address that created seal in this code https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/consensus/common/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/consensus/common/bft/BftBlockInterface.java#L98.

Basically you need to do a ecrecover of the block hash and the validator seal then convert that public key to an ethereum address. So basically publicKeyToAddress(ecrecover(keccak256(rlp encoded blockheader), validator seal))

A general question: how does ethereum prevent double spend of erc20 tokens? The code for the transfer is this:
```
  function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {
    require(value <= _balances[msg.sender]);
    require(to != address(0));

    _balances[msg.sender] = _balances[msg.sender].sub(value);
    _balances[to] = _balances[to].add(value);
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
    return true;
  }
```
I was now wondering how does ethereum prevent double spend in this case? Is it with the help of account level nonce or something else?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 19:34:21 GMT):<br/>
Because ERC-20s are account based there are no double spends.  Double spends are an aspect of UTXO based systems, where you in effect have a sort of a digital bearer bond.  Account level nonce ensures that an account's transactions are not replayed.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 23:22:22 GMT):<br/>
There is some work underway on this, it's still in the "experimental feature" phase. If you search PRs for "elliptic curve" and "SECP256R1" you can view the code changes - but keep in mind it's still under active development so things could change.

Asking because the nonce for account A for privacy group ABC is different to the nonce for account A for privacy group AB.

So, how does besu prevent double spend in this case? Does it use the nonce for the marker transaction to prevent double-spends?

I will bump the version of opentelemetry to at least 0.14.1. There is a long  list of breaking changes between lates and our current rev (despite being only 5 months old!)

even the bump to 0.14.1 causes interface changes/deprecations that are not immediately obvious how to rectify - I will defer to @atoulme on this since it seems like it is in his wheelhouse

Hi all, for non-boot nodes, the config still is similar to boot node, which requires rpc enabled, rpc-http-api, rpc-http-hosts and rpc-http-cors-origin. My question is that since non-boot nodes does not take rpc call directly from clients, why the rpc is still enabled for them?
</p>

What is wrong with the message below? The same config (with different port) works on other node.

Hey everyone, would it be possible to run a small permissioned Besu network with 3 nodes on Raspberry Pis with 1gb of ram?
The idea would be to have a block time of around 15 seconds and have a low transaction amount of around 30 transactions/hour.

There is no unit for gas.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Sun, 23 May 2021 07:27:50 GMT):<br/>
The unit for gas price is `wei`.
So the transaction fee is calculated as -
`gas used` * `gas price` wei.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Sun, 23 May 2021 07:28:03 GMT):<br/>
And `wei` can be converted to `Ether`.

Hi guys, is there a way to show the currency symbol as something other than `ETH` by default?
My main motive is to start a chain for which the currency symbol - 'DDR'. I don't know the logic behind it. Is it just to tell others that the mined coins for this network is `DDR` and not `ETH`? But connecting to the chain, shows currency symbol as `ETH` by default. How to go forward with it?

Hi @HiteshSharma, is it metamask you're seeing this currency symbol in? It may be that you need to discuss this with that team. Depending on your use case you may instead want to use an ERC20 token https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/erc20
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 13:59:53 GMT):<br/>
It may be possible, but I would generally expect to need 2-4x more RAM than that depending on load - I would check out the Ethereum on ARM project who have been testing this. Unfortunately we do not have any standard tested minimum specs as this is not a common request. https://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM/status/1374646640242475013
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 14:00:47 GMT):<br/>
if you take your private transaction manager offline, the transaction can
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 14:00:54 GMT):<br/>
can't be executed
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 14:01:44 GMT):<br/>
currently there are no native features to allow synchronization of private state between two different groups
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 14:02:19 GMT):<br/>
this is something we're looking into but is a hard research problem
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 14:08:11 GMT):<br/>
okay but still the nonce of the private marker transaction are executed serially. am i right? And, this nonce is the account nonce of the caller?

In other words, if one account makes 2 different requests (private transactions) in 2 different privacy groups then these 2 requests would be executed one after the other and not in parallel. Am I right?
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 15:25:29 GMT):<br/>
let me check
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 15:32:18 GMT):<br/>
privacy group nonces are separate to the private marker transaction nonces. you have a separate account nonce for the private marker transaction and also each privacy group
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 15:34:00 GMT):<br/>
yes, that I am aware of. I am concerned about the order of execution of privacy marker transaction nonces.

More specifically this:

I think the answer is yes after reading the docs as the marker nonces are nothing but normal account nonces for public transactions. But it's good to be doubly sure. Maybe I am missed something.

Just to clarify, a PMT is a regular public ethereum tx. The nonce for a PMT has to meet all criteria for a valid tx.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 20:50:28 GMT):<br/>
And remember that the sender of a PMT is not necessarily the same sender of the Private TX associated with the PMT. So there is zero association between the two nonces.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 20:52:43 GMT):<br/>
Interesting, in a 4 node network, all nodes should have 3 peers. Maybe the bootnode is counting itself?

Have you tried admin_peers to see who is in the bootnode's peer list?

https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#admin_peers
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:16:40 GMT):<br/>
This is an interesting point. How can I guarantee that the sender of PMT is the sender of PT?

In what cases are they different?
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:17:55 GMT):<br/>
No, I mean an api or something.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:20:09 GMT):<br/>
As I mentioned, the PMT is a regular Ethereum tx. The two "special" things about it is that its data will be used by Besu as a key to the private tx in Orion/Tessera, and that the 'to' address is the address of the privacy pre-compiled contract.

If you want the same sender for the PMT and the Private TX, you can do it by creating the private tx and the PMT manually (see https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Creating-Sending-Private-Transactions/#priv_distributerawtransaction)
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:21:25 GMT):<br/>
However, I would discourage use cases that rely on the same account sending the PMT and the private tx. The privacy group is a world state completely independent from the public world state. So the account "x" in the public world state is not the same account "x' in a privacy group.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:22:16 GMT):<br/>
What I'm trying to say is that the PMT sender account doesn't matter for the logic inside the private group.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:23:21 GMT):<br/>
In its "default" configuration, the PMTs are sent with a random account.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:24:06 GMT):<br/>
What I want is, the sender in one PG shouldnt use the same token (double spend) in another privacy group.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:24:49 GMT):<br/>
and, one way I was thinking to check this is via account nonce of PMT. This way I didnt have to do anything and leverage ethereum to do it for me

</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:25:31 GMT):<br/>
How would you use the nonce to check?
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:27:06 GMT):<br/>
no, I won't do anything. ethereum doesnt execute a bigger nonce from the same account until all smaller nonces are executed. So, this means all requests from a single account are executed one after the other. So, no chance of double-spend. So, I was thinking to leverage this for my purpose.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:27:24 GMT):<br/>
Hello @mohjam2004 , thats a typo and should be orion2. I've fixed that up now, so do a pull and should be good to go
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:27:42 GMT):<br/>
I'm sorry but I don't see how this would prevent double spending between privacy groups.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:28:18 GMT):<br/>
But give it a shot and see how it goes
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:31:27 GMT):<br/>
let me give an example, if sender A did a PT with nonce 1 and did another PT (in another group) with nonce 2 then these two requests will be executed one after the other (serially) right?

Don't worry about state here. Assume the sender is maintaining the same state in both privacy group.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:31:27 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:33:16 GMT):<br/>
In this case, the sender is playing by the rules. What happens if they send PT with nonce 1 on group A, and PT with nonce 1 on group B? Only members of each group know what the nonce of the private tx is.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:33:39 GMT):<br/>
There is no way of verifying it outside of the privacy group.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:34:26 GMT):<br/>
I am talking about the PMT nonce. Can they control the PMT nonce?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:34:52 GMT):<br/>
They can.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:36:00 GMT):<br/>
The sender can choose the nonce for the PMT, but they are subject to the nonce rules.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:36:37 GMT):<br/>
If sender A sends two PMTs with the same nonce, whichever is processed second will be invalid.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:37:35 GMT):<br/>
okay, then that will solve my problem. Even if they change the PMT nonce and play dirty they wont be able to succeed.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:38:17 GMT):<br/>
So, only thing I need to take care is the sender of the PT should be the sender of the PMT.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:38:28 GMT):<br/>
Am I correct?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:38:58 GMT):<br/>
To use the same sender for the PMT and the Private TX you can use https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Creating-Sending-Private-Transactions/#priv_distributerawtransaction
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:39:40 GMT):<br/>
I am using web3j fopr my requests, I need to check what are they using underneath.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:40:23 GMT):<br/>
They'll be calling Besu APIs. So even if they don't have support for distribute private tx, it should be easy to extend it.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:41:14 GMT):<br/>
makes sense. Btw, do you agree with this:

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:41:43 GMT):<br/>
I can't agree because I don't see how this will solve the double spending problem between privacy groups :)
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:42:02 GMT):<br/>
But if you think it is possible you should try it
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:42:18 GMT):<br/>
even after assuming the state is same?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:42:30 GMT):<br/>
How do you know the state is the same?
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:42:57 GMT):<br/>
okay, do you agree whether the requests would be executed one after the other and not both at the same time?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:44:05 GMT):<br/>
For two PMTs with the same sender, if one has nonce 1 and the other nonce 2, they won't execute at the same time.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:48:11 GMT):<br/>
now that you're here :) I would like to ask another question to you. Can a participant (other than the sender) in a privacy group prevent a PT from happening?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:50:19 GMT):<br/>
In a general sense no. However, if that private tx is calling a contract for example, the contract code might have rules that make the tx invalid (e.g. a require or assert)
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:51:02 GMT):<br/>
The transaction will happen, but it won't modify the contract state
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:52:19 GMT):<br/>
One option (and this is deep in the weeds of private tx processing) would be modifying the privacy precompile to deal with the private tx in a different way.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:52:36 GMT):<br/>
But then all nodes in the network will need to run your custom Besu build.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 21:54:33 GMT):<br/>
ok. got you.

hey @lucassaldanha, sorry it's me again. Is there a way a private SC make a state change in a public SC? Or, can it only read from a public SC?

Only read
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 22:24:30 GMT):<br/>
No workarounds for this? 🤔 

Will oracles be a good practice to use if I want SC in different PGs to access a common datastore?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 22:25:48 GMT):<br/>
> No workarounds for this? 
No. Ultimately, it doesn't make sense to let a private tx (that not everyone will be able to see) affect the public state that is visible to everyone.

I'm not sure. I haven't seen this being done before.
</p>

our project is a bit different. we want certain transactions to be private but the fund pool is common.

Hi, guys!

How do you manage your nonce?

Quorum and Geth use that account management feature, and I didn't need to manage nonce on the client side, but in case of Besu, I need to manage nonce by myself. I am using Besu to develop a system that has the ability to send tx continuously from one account, and I am having trouble with nonce management: even if I can get the nonce count of the pending tx from the tx pool and put the incremented value in the tx and send it, it does not necessarily mean that the previously sent Even if I can get the pending nonce count from the tx pool and put the incremented value in the tx, it doesn't necessarily mean that the tx sent before will arrive before the last tx sent.

If you have a good solution or an example that might be helpful, please let me know.

So, a coin name is not hard coded anywhere in a network. Its just a convention for some value used on a network.
So you mention your network to the public and say that this is the name of the coin we use on this network.
And you use your network id and chain id, to give it a specific name. And then you give a specific coin.

So, a coin name is not hard coded anywhere in a network. Its just a convention for some value used on a network.
So you mention your network to the public and say that this is the name of the coin we use on this network.
And what you are actually doing is - you use your network id and chain id, to give it a specific name. And then you give a specific coin name to it.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 13:40:42 GMT):<br/>
Then you contact some 3rd party service to show your coin to the public users with a specific symbol that you decide upon.
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 13:42:07 GMT):<br/>
Am I thinking correct?
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 13:46:17 GMT):<br/>
So, if I'm using Besu to create my own network and I've a explorer. I just need to mention my coin name, e.g. `DDR` on the explorer. Is that the correct approach?

@lucassaldanha , Here is a log from the  besu doc for setup a 4nodes private ibft2 private network. The peer count is 4. But the doc doesn't specify if the log is from boot node or non boot node.

Hi, I'd like to ask a question related to Besu. On the /data/database directory there are files with ending .log, what are those? Simply logs of the console? Can I delete them?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 22:17:29 GMT):<br/>
Those are rocksdb files.  IIRC that's the write-ahead-log.  Don't delete them, RocksDB should delete them when they are merged in.  Generally speaking deleting or editing anything in .../database could cause data corruption.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 22:24:42 GMT):<br/>
Thanks a lot. I am trying to forecast the required storage data for running a node with 2s block interval in the long run.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 22:26:55 GMT):<br/>
An empty block seems to be around 800bytes, lets call it 1KB to ease the calculations.

That is roughly 16M blocks a year and 15GB storage. This is only assuming blocks are empty.

Assuming a little network utilization, this could be around 25GB a year. 

However, currently I am at 1M blocks and already storage is around 2GB (which is double the amount I estimate by calculations)

<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 22:27:05 GMT):<br/>
That's why I wondered if they were just scrap logs

On your current setup, give it the same path as your existing nodekey for the --privacy-marker-transaction-signing-key-file and you should be fine - that about right @StefanPingel ?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 05:25:23 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 05:28:05 GMT):<br/>

or set ```--privacy-marker-transaction-signing-key=/opt/besu/data/key``` ie the same value as the `--nodekey` parameter
</p>
<p><strong>mohjam2004</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 05:51:57 GMT):<br/>
this should be set on all yaml files in statefulsets? right?
--privacy-marker-transaction-signing-key=/opt/besu/data/key

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 05:52:55 GMT):<br/>
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Use-Privacy/Sign-Privacy-Marker-Transactions/ the parameter requires a key. The orion.password files are passwords used to encrypt the privacy managers keypair files
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 05:58:43 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=hWG4MbnhZe8Qi4fiS) Nope, the privacy marker transaction key deals with privacy and is set on only the nodes that have an orion/tessera pair, ie you are intending to send private transactions fron node1privacy to node2privacy for example. The validators do not have a privacy transaction manager (orion/tessera) and do not need it. When you set the value, you need to provide it with a key - this can be the nodekey itself or something else you'd like to use to identify who signed the marker tx.

hi - are you referring to a specific tutorial?
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 08:59:46 GMT):<br/>
RPC calls are independent from the type of node.
But in actually, the non-boot nodes are the one's for which the RPC is usually enabled. Eg. infura spawns a node for you that connects to the Ethereum chain. And then you use that infura node to read blockchain data.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 09:49:28 GMT):<br/>
you can run non-boot nodes without http-rpc-api parameters
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 09:50:05 GMT):<br/>
bin/besu --data-path=data --genesis-file=genesis.json --bootnodes=enode://PATH@IP:PORT --p2p-port=30303
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 09:50:05 GMT):<br/>
`bin/besu --data-path=data --genesis-file=genesis.json --bootnodes=enode://PATH@IP:PORT --p2p-port=30303`
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 09:50:39 GMT):<br/>
Setting correct `bootnodes` parameter will run your second node, it will just be a node and won't reply to any HTTP calls.
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 09:51:39 GMT):<br/>
I generally use;

`bin/besu --data-path=data --genesis-file=genesis.json --p2p-port=30303` on the first node, then run the command I shared above on secondary nodes. Only on one of them I enable the http-api so I can perform tasks.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 12:05:18 GMT):<br/>
nice, happy for you to submit a PR with any updates. I do need to update the repo but haven't had the chance to yet
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 12:16:26 GMT):<br/>
Hi @EmcLab this can vary depending on conditions. So for example you may want to add/remove peers or make permissioning calls or the like you would do that on all nodes. Hitesh and Nithronium are right, it really depends on how you configure your nodes

In a private network a common pattern with separation of concerns is bootnodes (for other nodes to join the network), validators (to just create blocks) and RPC nodes for API calls/transactions etc. All nodes will have the rpc options set, but the bootnodes and validators may be restricted to only trusted CIDR blocks.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 15:08:46 GMT):<br/>
Rocks DB has "write amplification" to speed up reads and writes, so it may store that 1kb several times. Level style DBs are mostly optimized for speed and not storage size, so they will leave junk around and periodically garbage collect it.  If you put it in a graph you will see a nice sawtooth.

Alright, thanks a lot for the information.

Check what's in the "data" field - not sure why you need to do `as string` there - it should be the data field as for a normal public tx. Also check if there is anything in Besu logs.

Anyone else having problems adding a node to the "allow list" on an ibft2-with-permissioning network using: perm_addNodesToAllowlist API method?

Example:
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"perm_addNodesToAllowlist","params":[["enode://7e4ef30e9ec683f26ad76ffca5b5148fa7a6575f4cfad4eb0f52f9c3d8335f4a9b6f9e66fcc73ef95ed7a2a52784d4f372e7750ac8ae0b544309a5b391a23dd7@127.0.0.1:30303"]], 
"id":1}' http://127.0.0.1:8545

Hi All, 
I'm new in besu development and I am trying to create a private network running on k8s.
As first step I have to create configuration files so I am running:

docker run --rm --volume $PWD/ibftSetup/:/opt/besu/data hyperledger/besu:latest operator generate-blockchain-config --config-file=/opt/besu/data/ibftConfigFile.json --to=/opt/besu/data/networkFiles --private-key-file-name=key

as per indicated in: https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/helm/quorum-besu/ibft2/besu

Immediately I got this error (I am showing the whole output)

2021-05-28 02:23:07.763+00:00 | main | ERROR | GenerateBlockchainConfig | An error occurred while trying to generate network configuration.

Hi Vijay, im writing a paper on besu. Ans im interested in all 3. Most importantly TPS, but also how the network is affected when there are more or less nodes. IBFT2 gets slowwer when nodes are added. Im curious how much this is really affecrted
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 14:51:44 GMT):<br/>
Docker needs to be able to write to the host `$PWD/ibftSetup` - check your file permissions
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 01:26:25 GMT):<br/>
there's no mechanism in privacy groups to vote, I meant it would need to be built into the logic of the smart contract. It would increase the complexity of your contracts so depends on your use case whether this is worth pursuing. https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.4.24/solidity-by-example.html

Hi, thanks for reply.
Reading the logs is clear that is a permission issue. However, what happened is that I was running the command outside the directory structure of the chart.
How I solved, I downloaded the chart and inside the directory I ran the commands.

This signals a problem with reading/writing the allowlist file used by local (file-based) permissioning.  Check file permissions.

Hi all, just a note here for users of the EEA privacy capabilities in Besu: ConsenSys has merged all Orion functionality into Tessera, so Orion is being deprecated. 
We recommend the use of Tessera as a drop-in replacement private transaction manager in place of Orion. Tessera supports the same endpoints and functionality, nothing needs to be changed in your Besu deployment to migrate. 
ConsenSys will continue to support Orion users until 30th November 2021. You can find out more here: https://consensys.net/blog/quorum/tessera-the-privacy-manager-of-choice-for-consensys-quorum-networks/

Hi, I have created 3 besu+orion nodes, I am able to do private transaction also but problem is that how to get all inserted records from ledger by each participated node.

I am using web3-eea sendRawTransaction method to created private transaction for node1 and node2, so it's not visibel to node3

here is my code to insert record using contract insertrecord method

  const functionAbi = contract._jsonInterface.find(e => {
    return e.name === "insertrecord";
  });
  const functionArgs = web3.eth.abi
    .encodeParameters(functionAbi.inputs, [arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5,arg6,arg7,arg8,arg9,arg10,arg11])

  };
  return web3.eea
    .sendRawTransaction(functionCall)
    .then(transactionHash => {

      );
    })
    .then(result => {
      console.log("Event Emitted:", result);
      return result;
    });

here is my code to retreive all inserted record using contract allrecords method ---------Problem how to get all inserted records , which method to call and I am transaction id 
to get transaction details, please tell me the method to get all the records or some sample

You should be able to call the same method "allrecords" using web3-eea if that method exists on your smart contract. If it's a read-only method, priv_call works the same as eth_call but for private txs. That might be what you're looking for. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#priv_call

Thanks macfarla. It is working but always returns latest record. When I run same smart contract in remix. It returns all the records but here by using below code-const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi);

// eslint-disable-next-line no-underscore-dangle
const functionAbi = contract._jsonInterface.find(e => {
return e.name === "allrecords";
});

const functionCall = {
to: address,
data: functionAbi.signature,

return web3.priv.call(functionCall).then(result => {
console.log(Get Value from ${url}:, result);
return result;
});

I would like to add a new validator by curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ibft_proposeValidatorVote","params":["0xFE3B557E8Fb62b89F4916B721be55cEb828dBd73", true], "id":1}' <JSON-RPC-endpoint:port> as stated in the besu document. But when i go inside one of the validator pod by kubectl exec -it. It doesn't have curl, and i can't do apk add curl or apt-get curl. I would like to know how to add a new validator with curl inside a kubernete pod?

Finding peers to sync.  Very frustrating.  It seems the only way my system can find peers is for me to restart besu alternating with a static file and without.  Besu will run for a few hours and stop syncing.  So I will restart with 10 or so static nodes and it will find peers and sync for a few hours.  Then I restart without the static nodes...  How do I debug this?

I would like to change the minimum difficulty of `0x20000` set for the PoW network. My network is very small for now and doesn't have any external nodes, neither I'm allowing.
For this reason, I was looking for a cost effective machine on AWS. But the problem is the difficulty . So from where can I change this difficulty in the source code?
</p>
<p><strong>HiteshSharma</strong> (Wed, 02 Jun 2021 11:58:29 GMT):<br/>
Secondly, for the same PoW network, I spawned a mining machine with 8 cores. But I saw that only 1 or 2 cores are being used for the computation. Why not all the cores are being used? And is there any way to do so?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Jun 2021 18:58:31 GMT):<br/>
Besu CPU mining is unfit for production use (this is the same for all eth clients).  You should be using custom GPU mining software managed by Besu's stratum support.  Because GPUs outclass CPUs for ethash no serious work has gone into making it multi-core efficient.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 02 Jun 2021 19:00:20 GMT):<br/>
And unless you can dominate the hashrate for a particular asic (of which the whole of GPUs is one class of ASIC) I would not recommend PoW in any production setting.

Based on the logs CoDeFi and Orchestrate are sending the errors, possibly based on configuration mismatches.  The ConsenSys discord should have better insight: https://discord.gg/hYpHRjK

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 14:34:41 GMT):<br/>
Each besu node would run basically one pool. So each new besu node generates it's own proposed block. There's no payout management, just block production.

I am thinking that besu is unfit as a client period.  Giving up trying to find why Besu stops syncing after a few hours.  Existing solution of swapping out a static node file on alternating reboots is a waste of time.  Was hoping to find an alternative to geth to promote decentralizing clients.

When using IBFT2, does Besu generate fixed-length blocks (without considering the number of transactions in it) or a variable one (like PoW)?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 08 Jun 2021 00:20:08 GMT):<br/>
Fixed duration blocks typically. All available transactions, subject to block gas limit, are typically included.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=qCcv6pxB9h8zTksWZ) Assuming your talking about a private network with multiple participants and enclaves. 

The node upgrade should 'just work' - but treat it like a db upgrade, take a backup of your volumes etc. As far as the data on the blockchain it shouldn't be an issue it will re-propagate from other nodes. The thing you need to be concerned about is data in orion/tessera data that will not be re-propagated. So definitely take a back up of your enclave data before you upgrade your node. 

If the node re-syncs then the data must be in your enclave before hand (technically before your node processes that block).

Hi @bradmcbrayer, I'm sorry you're having a bad experience trying out Besu. Can you share your logs or the errors that are coming up? There are a bunch of mainnet nodes running Besu and are constantly testing against mainnet so I'm confident we can help solve your problem with a bit more guidance on what's going wrong!

I have deployed a besu private network (ibft2 with privacy) based on this doc:
https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/kubectl/quorum-besu/ibft2-with-privacy
Is there any dapp that I can investigate privacy in this deployed network? or how can I customize "pet shop dapp" to investigate privacy in my deployed network?

As my previous investigation, I have deployed a private besu network (ibft2) base on this:

No real error messages.  Will sync for 60 to 120 minutes then stop finding peers.  I will turn on a static node file with 20 nodes and reboot Besu.  It will sync for 60 to 120 minutes then stop finding peers.  I will turn off the static node file, reboot Besu and it will sync for 60 to 120 minutes.  I current thought is my ISP is blocking some of my traffic after some time.

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Tue, 08 Jun 2021 14:16:29 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Wed, 09 Jun 2021 12:59:28 GMT):<br/>
The symptoms make me think that perhaps uPNP is not activated on your router and you are using NAT mode auto (default NAT method, see https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Find-and-Connect/Specifying-NAT/#auto) but port is not forwarded on the inbound routing so your node P2P port can't be reached from the outside. Then other peers probably reject the connection after some time because they can’t join the node directly and the advertised ip in the enode is not the right one (P2P host defaults to localhost if NAT fails or host not configured: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#p2p-host). Just my 2c but checking this could help to eliminate NAT misconfiguration as a cause.

I will let run all night and will not sync a block.  In morning I will reboot without a static file and sync for 30 -60 minutes.  Reboot with a static file and sync for 30 - 60 minutes... repeat all day.  this is not what I had in mind for a production ready ethereum client.

You could alter the dapp to send private transactions instead of public transactions but it won't work by default because the method calls are different. I recommend starting with the web3js-eea examples https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Privacy/web3js-eea-Multinode-example/

I have been looking into this and I get the voting part, however, I am not able to find the info that explains how a node would get notified somehow that there has been a private transaction and it needs to vote.

The web3j doc only shows how to create a privacy group and how to call a method in a private smart contract.

Or, do I need to add a scheduler or something that would read all the proposals in the contract at regular intervals and vote & execute the ones that got the vote?

<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Thu, 10 Jun 2021 12:26:42 GMT):<br/>
Another way would be to fire events but are events 100% reliable? What if a node misses an event or if an event isnt fired by besu? Does besu keep track of missed events and fires them again later?

I don't really have more ideas on your issue to be very honest. I'm going to try to get more expert devs involved in this thread.
There's clearly something specific to your setup here as we have mainnet nodes running for months, but I'm not really able to dig deeper here. Sorry.
</p>
<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 08:52:14 GMT):<br/>
Could you provide us all the logs (hiding the data you consider sensitive : IP , enode)? This may allow us to investigate
</p>
<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 10:00:15 GMT):<br/>
Do you have this kind of message in your logs AbstractRetryingPeerTask | Retrying after recoverable failure from peer task CompleteBlocksTask: Timeout after 5000 MILLISECONDS ?

<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 10:11:40 GMT):<br/>
if you have this logs maybe you can try with this parameters `--Xsynchronizer-downloader-chain-segment-size=5
--Xsynchronizer-downloader-header-request-size=5` even if you don't have it can be interesting to test if it can help

hello matkt. TY.  Don't recall seeing above message.  Glad to send logs of sync.  I assume your interested when web3.eth.syncing = false.  Its running now will wait until stops in another 20 min or so.
</p>
<p><strong>bradmcbrayer</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 12:07:30 GMT):<br/>
well on second thought.  Lets let it run for a few hours.  Last night it ran all night adding zero blocks.
</p>
<p><strong>matkt</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 12:12:35 GMT):<br/>
Why I ask this because one of the reasons that can cause the loss of peers is that you have timeouts (when you communicate with a peer) and the list of peers goes down to 0 after several timeouts . This may come from a connection issue. In general a good way to test if this is the problem is to increase the timeout or decrease the size of the data transmitted between peers "--Xsynchronizer-downloader-chain-segment-size = 1
-- Xsynchronizer-downloader-header-request-size=1". But if you don't have these messages this shouldn't be the reason
</p>
<p><strong>bradmcbrayer</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 12:37:55 GMT):<br/>
i understand.  will look for these timeouts.

thank you very much.. I saw that but I wanted to accelerate, I think that the quorum dev should provide clear instructions on how to use own private keys, provide ssl certificate and sync external nodes under the ibft2 consensus.

Hi, I'm using fast sync mode syncing besu for 1 day. It's downloading state nodes and the pending state nodes are varying. The number of blocks behind is increasing. Why is it not syncing the blocks? And is there a max limit to the state nodes it has to download?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 12 Jun 2021 22:07:59 GMT):<br/>
Which network?  For mainnet 3 days is not unexpected, possibly mode depending on how fast your storage is.  While fast syncing the blocks behind will increase because the fast sync pivot block is fixed.  Once the fast sync completes the blocks behind will decrease as it catches up.
</p>
<p><strong>pkchai</strong> (Sat, 12 Jun 2021 23:19:34 GMT):<br/>
Ah ok. It's on mainnet yes. Storage is a nvme m2. I'll let it sync then. Thanks for ur repsonse
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 12 Jun 2021 23:25:22 GMT):<br/>
local or AWS?  For AWS the more IOPS the better.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 12 Jun 2021 23:26:23 GMT):<br/>
I haven't watched a fast sync in a while, but I expect the state nodes to be in the 700MM range, maybe more. The ConsenSys devs should be able to quote a number from the last two weeks.

I am working on one POC. My project is on private network .we found the 3 node are provide by besu kit and they are syc with each other . but when i try too connect with different node it's  not sycn . please guide me how to sync and also need help to increase the block time or difficulty level.i don't understand i had more than 2 Cr. block in span of 4 months and don't know how to stop it form increasing.

The rpc-http-api method PRIV was not set on config.toml of privacy nodes. Now I don't get the previous error:
rpc-http-api=["DEBUG","ETH", "ADMIN", "WEB3", "IBFT", "NET", "EEA", "PRIV"]
rpc-ws-api=["DEBUG","ETH", "ADMIN", "WEB3", "IBFT", "NET", "EEA", "PRIV"]

My new issue is that the transaction is got stuck in mining and I get this error:

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 13 Jun 2021 23:28:05 GMT):<br/>
Re events the consumer can query or subscribe to events. You're right in that if your node is offline it could miss events (but in this case you would lose your subscription and have to reconnect, so you would know) but sending a query will give the complete history.

Do I need to do something extra (like enable some flags when starting besu nodes) in order to subscribe to events? I am getting a connection timeout when I try to subscribe to an event.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:22:10 GMT):<br/>
Code snippet looks like:
```
EthFilter ethFilter = new EthFilter(DefaultBlockParameterName.EARLIEST, DefaultBlockParameterName.LATEST, contract.getContractAddress());
        ethFilter.addSingleTopic(EventEncoder.encode(TransactionDemo3Contract.TRANSFERREQUEST_EVENT));
        node.privLogFlowable(privacyGroupId, ethFilter)
                .map((eventLog) -> {
                    final EventValues eventValues = Contract.staticExtractEventParameters(TransactionDemo3Contract.TRANSFERREQUEST_EVENT, eventLog);

                    TransferRequestEventResponse response = new TransferRequestEventResponse();
                    response.log = eventLog;
                    response.id = (BigInteger) eventValues.getNonIndexedValues().get(0).getValue();
                    response.amount = (BigInteger) eventValues.getNonIndexedValues().get(1).getValue();
                    response.sender = (String) eventValues.getNonIndexedValues().get(2).getValue();

@VijayMichalik, this is 4 nodes network and shall have 3 peers. I just check the log and they all synced up. It seems that it took sometime for all 4 nodes get synced. Usually how long it takes for 4 nodes network to be synced?

<p><strong>mohjam2004</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 03:54:27 GMT):<br/>
I think so, But it needs more investigation as you mention.

<p><strong>mohjam2004</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 03:57:55 GMT):<br/>

But I'm also looking for a DAPP like pet shop example and a scenario based on this DAPPto examine privacy.

What I was looking for 1st demo was a smart contract that shows privacy in besu private network, for example we have 3 besu nodes and we only want only node 1 and node 2 be aware of transaction payload and this is what I exactly need.
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 08:40:07 GMT):<br/>
I am using the besu quick start guide and I start the nodes like:
```
besu --data-path=data --genesis-file=../genesis.json --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=ETH,NET,IBFT,WEB3,EEA,PRIV,PERM --host-allowlist="*" --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" --min-gas-price=0 --privacy-enabled --privacy-url=http://127.0.0.1:8888 --privacy-public-key-file=Orion/nodeKey.pub

I want to use a GPU for a PoW network. For this I'm using AWS `g4dn.xlarge` instance.
I also installed the required driver using this link - `https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/install-nvidia-driver.html#nvidia-GRID-driver`.  And it's installed properly.

Now, when I'm starting the node using the following command, it's not mining - 
```

What should I do?

I installed the GRID driver using this guide -

But the mining is not happening.
Should I install the `Gaming driver` or install `Ethminer`? Will this work and would there by anything to do after this?

I think that the GPU mining is not well described in the documentation. It only says how it was tested, but not how we can use it. It arises the question whether we need to do it the way it's tested or not.

invalid params indicates that something is incorrect or missing in your rpc request. Check carefully - sometimes it can be hard to spot! or provide your rpc here for public review :)
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Fri, 18 Jun 2021 01:31:23 GMT):<br/>
If you want to use websockets you need to enable that separately but over http nothing extra is required. Does everything else work - is it just the subscribe() bit that times out?

Hello everyone!
I found this page on the interwebs: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub/
And it contains something amazing:
```
{"id": 1, "method": "eth_subscribe", "params": ["newPendingTransactions", {"includeTransactions":false}]}
```
It's that `includeTransactions` toggle.
It's a terrible omission from the websocket provider I'm using to inspect realtime swaps on PanCakeSwap.
Is it possible to use your tech for a PanCakeSwap feed?
i.e. on BSC blockchain...
</p>
<p><strong>dragnet</strong> (Sat, 19 Jun 2021 16:13:27 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dragnet</strong> (Sat, 19 Jun 2021 16:14:02 GMT):<br/>
I can't see if your technology is providing an alternative way to interact with an existing Ethereum-based blockchain, or if you're making a CUSTOM blockchain that supports such streams.

How come Besu is providing this?
</p>
<p><strong>dragnet</strong> (Sat, 19 Jun 2021 16:24:58 GMT):<br/>
It seems to offer a superset of the standard Etherrum websockets I see everywhere.
</p>
<p><strong>dragnet</strong> (Sat, 19 Jun 2021 16:25:30 GMT):<br/>
I'd need to find a provider running Besu nodes for BSC chain.
</p>
<p><strong>dragnet</strong> (Sat, 19 Jun 2021 16:25:51 GMT):<br/>
And Infura doesn't support BSC chain, I don't think...
</p>
<p><strong>dragnet</strong> (Sat, 19 Jun 2021 16:26:05 GMT):<br/>

includeTransaction is part of the JSON-RPC Pub/Sub spec https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/pubsub so it should be included in all clients and api providers.
</p>
<p><strong>dragnet</strong> (Sat, 19 Jun 2021 16:32:39 GMT):<br/>
I already tried:
```
                await self.streamer.send(
                    json.dumps({
                        'id': WS_BSC.ID_PENDING_TX,
                        'method': 'eth_subscribe',
                        'params': [
                            'newPendingTransactions',
                            {
                                'includeTransactions': True

                    })
                )

But it has no effect

You are right, maybe it's not implemented on all clients. I see some conversations about this in https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/15804
</p>
<p><strong>dragnet</strong> (Sat, 19 Jun 2021 16:34:33 GMT):<br/>
By 'client' do you mean wss-provider?
Or would this be generic to all PanCakeSwap wss providers?
</p>
<p><strong>dragnet</strong> (Sat, 19 Jun 2021 16:36:26 GMT):<br/>
Ah yes, I found that issue yesterday.
</p>
<p><strong>dragnet</strong> (Sat, 19 Jun 2021 16:37:01 GMT):<br/>
The best I can do is monitor logs:
```
'jsonrpc': '2.0',
'id': WS_BSC.ID_LOGS,
'method': 'eth_subscribe',
'params': [
    'logs', {
        'address': [ self.pair_token, ],
        'topics': [ HASH_FOR_SWAP, ]  # HASH_FOR_SYNC
    }
]
})
```

I don't even know was a pancakesawp provider is, it's application level and I'm not working on this, but only at L1 protocol level. I can only tell you that Besu as an Ethereum client probably implement this option. Then you can use it to connect to an Ethereum network. Sorry, that's all I know.

Hi all,
We are using Hyperledger Besu (1.5.5) in out project and we tried to specify configuration file via `BESU_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable, but to no avail. 
Specifying same file via command line parameter (`--config-file`) works well.
Does anyone had same issue?
</p>
<p><strong>Soul_man</strong> (Mon, 21 Jun 2021 11:26:45 GMT):<br/>
Judging by the code, `BESU_CONFIG_FILE` env variable is not taken into consideration when parsing at all.
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/1.5.5/besu/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/cli/util/ConfigOptionSearchAndRunHandler.java#L64

But it should be, if I read the docs.

When I load a private smart contract in web3j via `SmartContract.load()` method supplying the node and its private transaction manager, won't the `msg.sender` (for later interactions with the contract) have the address of node that I supplied initially in the load() method?
</p>
<p><strong>rampatra</strong> (Mon, 21 Jun 2021 14:26:31 GMT):<br/>
I am using web3j library (and have a smart contract named Contract) and was wondering whether the node supplied to the `Contract.deploy()` method should match the `msg.sender`? I understand that the msg.sender resembles the caller of the contract but in web3j, I deploy passing the node and then load the contract by passing the same node. So, I assumed the `msg.sender` should be the same as the node that I passed. But it doesn't look it. Can anyone pl tell me what I am missing here?

Also, how do you get the address of the node using web3j? Is the `getAddress()` method in `Credentials` the right way?

What happens when one machine needs to change the IP in a Besu network? 
I imagined that:
- All institutions need to review firewall rules
- It is necessary to update the permissioning config
Condering that the IP is part of the e-node, is there any impact on the nodes peers? I imagined that they automatically connect with the new enode and ignore the old one. Is it the case?

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 23 Jun 2021 01:45:12 GMT):<br/>
Ah I'm sorry. Now I understand what you meant with your question.

With account permissioning, you can have rules around what addresses (EOA or contracts) are allowed to perform some actions.

The rules are implemented in smart contracts, so they can be customized.

Our standard implementation does the opposite, a whitelist of addresses allowed to create transactions.

Hi guys, I deployed a besu private network. I am wondering how do you guys handle smart contract revert reason? My use case is to log down the reason of a failed transaction e.g. you are not the owner, not enough token balance.... It seems that the offical document said that it is not recommend to set the revert-reason flag to true due to memory issue. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#revert-reason-enabled . I found a way to handle it (https://blog.8bitzen.com/posts/12-12-2019-hyperledger-besu-web3j-where-is-my-revert-reason), i would like to know is it the only and the best way to handle the revert reason from smart contract?

If using discovery, the nodes should find each other. If using static nodes, you would have to update the static nodes file.

If one VALIDATOR needs to change the IP in a Besu network and 
- there is no static nodes
- the private/public key/node account is not changed
What need to be done? I imagined that I need to regenerate the e-node using the new IP. 
Since the validator account is not going to change, I imagined that there is no need to start a voting session, right?

If your ip address changes then your enode address will also change. Any node connected to the old node will loose the peer connection when the ip changes, this might take awhile though. Node discovery will also the new node to added as peer again with the new ip to the existing nodes.

IBFT2 only considers the address derived from the node account or public key in determining which nodes are validators. It doesn't care about the enode or ip address. So if the node key hasn't changed then IBFT2 will treat node with new ip same as the old node as far as being a validator. There is no need to vote in the new validator if the ip address has changed.

For IBFT2 to function correctly it is important that the old peer is not still a peer for the other validator nodes after the ip changes and that the new nodes have a new peer connection with your validator with the new ip. The reason for this is that we will gossip IBFT2 messages to the peers that match validator addresses and if there is more than one peer with the same validator address we will choose the first one, which might not be node you expect. You can use the https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#admin_peers to see what peers the nodes have.

If your ip address changes then your enode address will also change. Any node connected to the old node will loose the peer connection when the ip changes, this might take awhile though. Node discovery will also add the new node as peer again with the new ip for the existing nodes.

IBFT2 only considers the address derived from the node account or public key in determining which nodes are validators. It doesn't care about the enode or ip address. So if the node key hasn't changed then IBFT2 will treat node with new ip same as the old node as far as being a validator. There is no need to vote in the validator again if the ip address has changed.

For IBFT2 to function correctly it is important that the old peer is not still a peer for the other validator nodes after the ip changes and that the new nodes have a new peer connection with your validator with the new ip. The reason for this is that we will gossip IBFT2 messages to the peers that match validator addresses and if there is more than one peer with the same validator address we will choose the first one, which might not be node you expect. You can use the https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#admin_peers to see what peers the nodes have.

Copying from a previous answer here:
That's the write-ahead-log, so you shouldn't delete them, RocksDB should delete them when they are merged in. Generally speaking deleting or editing anything in .../database could cause data corruption.

Hi all, I have a kubernetes private network. I am trying to add validator. 
I ssh to the node, go inside the besu docker container, install curl, then run curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ibft_proposeValidatorVote","params":["0xf9d1b75f43193fc237b6f0a09167ef9407fc1c82", true], "id":1}' http://jsonrpc.besu.svc.cluster.local:8545 to propose adding a validator
I repeated the above steps for all 4 validators which are separated in different nodes and docker containers.

But, it seems that the proposed validator is not added when i run curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ibft_getValidatorsByBlockNumber","params":["latest"], "id":1}' http://jsonrpc.besu.svc.cluster.local:8545 which just returns the original 4 validators.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=Kiu7ZncRWqFgM7E6u) You can write a plugin to wire it up to whatever db you want. e.g https://github.com/abdelhamidbakhta/besu-storage-redis it's just a key value store. I guess it depends why you want to use something else.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 08 Jul 2021 18:57:03 GMT):<br/>
1559 only burns eth.  It doesn't burn tokens.  And it only burns it per the basefee as part of the transaction fees. And by burns the deducted amounts "burnt" are not sent to the miner.  So I'm not sure what you are looking for. @matkt and @abdelhamidbakhta are the experts on that section of code.

<p><strong>mkm 14</strong> (Fri, 09 Jul 2021 15:40:06 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. Actually we did not deploy using truffle. Deployed a besu privte network using https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/1.3.0/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-Private-Network/ and use --min-gas-price=0 in the command line. Is that enough to keep the gas price  to zero in all cases ? What happens if a user adds gas price greater than zero while doing a transfer thru metamask ? will the gas fee still be zero ?
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Fri, 09 Jul 2021 16:20:43 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Fri, 09 Jul 2021 16:36:42 GMT):<br/>

Topology is the main limiter at the moment. 300tps has been done with caliper with 4 signers and 1 large RPC node with IBFT2.  RPC and test harness overhead was the bottleneck (No need to query every receipt individally 1s after completion).

yep, I think the requirement is still there for the user to correctly specify 0 gas in their transaction

Thanks for the info!

Can caliper hit different RPC nodes to simulate typical blockchain network usage? Or would one need to put a load balancer before multiple RPC nodes to be able to do that?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:01:14 GMT):<br/>
Caliper supports that, although we didn't configure it for that test.  Add more RPC nodes and more caliper workers and point each worker to a different node.  Once the bottleneck becomes block production you've scaled rpc enough.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:01:37 GMT):<br/>
Block production being the bottleneck will manifest as block time increasing.

if you want to 'test drive' 1559, I would suggest setting up a local besu clique network with a london fork block in the genesis file.  If you do not specify an initial base fee, it will default to 1 gwei
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Thu, 22 Jul 2021 17:33:35 GMT):<br/>
here is an example genesis I have been using for a local clique testnet, with the london transition block set to block 10:

This won't be possible until the 21.7.0 release of quorum that has qbft support. You get started with a Besu qbft network though using Besu qbft docs https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/QBFT/

Is the Private Network Example current? A warning is reported in start-up of one of the besu nodes and the blockchain does not appear to generate any blocks.
The example is here: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Examples/Private-Network-Example/

Hi everyone!
I'm experimenting a bit with BESU and I'm encountering an issue when trying to follow the "deploy smart contract" guide (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Contracts/Deploying-Contracts/).
When sending the transaction with `sendSignedTransaction`, the following error is raised:

`var err = new Error('Returned error: ' + message);
                  ^
Error: Returned error: Wrong chainId`

I've searched where that `chainId` could/should be specified and tried to add it within the Tx, unsuccessfully so far.
Interesting point though, when deploying the contract with Truffle it seems to work well.

Did anyone experience a similar issue and could help me with it?
Thanks in advance :)

ChainId is set when signing the transaction.  It is the sigining library that set it.  Look in the log for `Invalid transaction` and it should tell you what the proper chainid should be and what the provided chainid was.

Yep I actually figured that out and started reading through @ethereumjs/tx package as ethereumjs-tx mentioned in Besu's guide seems deprecated 😅
At this stage I can specify my chainId within the transaction signature process like:`const common = Common.custom({ chainId: 1337 });`
`const tx = new Tx(rawTxOptions, { common });`

</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Mon, 02 Aug 2021 03:57:06 GMT):<br/>
you need to run all nodes to achieve consensus. You cannot just run one node at a time.

Hello everyone, I do ask to you, reader of this question a bit of patience, but I need your help and knwoledge.
Here It is my simple question, I need to update the configuration of the cliqueGenesis.json (changeing the blockperiodSeconds, from 15 to 3) in my Hyperledger Besu BlockChain (private and gas free). 
My BlockChain is already up and running with few block in it, so to make use of those new configurations should I delete everything (blocks, nodes, vloumes etc...) and start rebuilding all over again? Or simply update the file and restart???
Thank for the help :D :)
</p>
<p><strong>AlessandraC</strong> (Mon, 02 Aug 2021 15:14:11 GMT):<br/>
same story here... I used Hyperledger Fabric for a while (just for studying purposes), on Fabric if I had the need to do it I used to simply stop and erase all the containers  and running the new images... but didn't have any transaction on. Do not know in this case what should be the proper thing to do...
</p>
<p><strong>GabrieleVitae</strong> (Mon, 02 Aug 2021 15:20:56 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @AlessandraC I don't know if It is the same procedure here on Besu, but I whould like to be sure before delete evrything and not beacuse  I don't want to,  but beacuse i would like to know what is the correct path to follow in this scenario.

some genesis file changes require you to do this - if so you would get this error when restarting https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Troubleshoot/Troubleshooting/#supplied-genesis-block-does-not-match-stored-chain-data
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:06:04 GMT):<br/>
That change for clique block period though - I think you can change that without having to delete everything.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:23:42 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for raising this @NgugsJohn - that tutorial is missing some info. I've raised a docs ticket to update it. https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs/issues/760
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:24:40 GMT):<br/>
As for your questions: 1. you can save the second code block as a new .js file and name it anything you like eg deploy.js and run it the same way as the first `node deploy.js`
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:25:23 GMT):<br/>
2. the first few examples on that page (public contract deployment) don't use web3js-quorum, that's only required for private contracts https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Contracts/Deploying-Contracts/#using-eea_sendrawtransaction-for-private-contracts
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:27:12 GMT):<br/>
Also note that we are in a period of transition from web3js-eea (deprecated) to web3js-quorum. So some of the examples in the docs still point to web3js-eea - but advise using web3js-quorum if you're starting out.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:34:22 GMT):<br/>
I believe this is fixed in the latest version of the quickstart >= 0.0.26.  - can you update and try again?

Hey guys, recent mainnet transactions through besu are flagged as private txs? 
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/commit/fa2d53859c45c26e40a9265092308bcdba5b7b8f#diff-8f3af0f8da1b352c31d41501c14cf92a66947bc3dc2a2f0d617c1691c380c70fR500

ECDSA (r,s,v) ; shouldn't v == 37 or 38 for regular mainnet txs are defined here? https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155

( v = CHAIN_ID * 2 + 35 or v = CHAIN_ID * 2 + 36 )

The `besu`, `besu-docs`, and `besu-native` repos have all flipped from using the `master` branch as the default branch to using the `main` branch as the default branch.  To keep up with these changes 

(a) rename the default branch in your forked repositories to `main`.  Github will provide reminders when you navigate to your repos.
(b) update your working copies to use `main`.  This script will work for remotes named `origin`
```
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```

Hi! I suggest your read the documentation about how private transactions work in Besu. It should help you understand how to use them.

To answer your questions:
1. To send a private tx, you define a list of ids that correspond to other participants. This list is set on the `privateFor` field. These IDs are public keys corresponding to the participants' Tessera nodes.

2. A public tx is visible to any node in the network. If you network is public, everyone has access to the public tx. If you network is private, all nodes connected to the network will have access to the txs.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:33:02 GMT):<br/>
I forgot to post the link to the docs: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Overview/

Can you elaborate on how you observed this breakage?  Was it on mainnet, a private tx?  Was it using a running instance or using the code as a library?

When a new node enters a network, it should be discovered immediately assuming UDP is working even close to correctly. UDP isn't a guarantee though, but in reality this always works. Leaving is a little different- if a peer hasn't heard from another peer in 12 hours it will check on it to see if it is there. If it doesn't respond, it's dropped as a peer.

Since Besu keeps private key in plain text, we need to be very concerned about "perimeter security". In a paid version of Besu, is it possible to not using the private key as plain text but only  cryptographic file?
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 14:33:37 GMT):<br/>
Also, if we delete the file containing the plain text key, will the node work with this info only in memory? I mean, is the file necessary only to start the node or during its operation too?
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 15:43:42 GMT):<br/>
FYI, late yesterday we discovered a defect in besu which affected value transfer transactions.  It isn't a consensus critical bug, but we are highly recommending folks to upgrade to 21.7.2 to fix this issue that is present in the prior 21.7.x release line:

</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 18:26:28 GMT):<br/>
this needs to be heavily qualified. You are referring to this option, correct? https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#node-private-key-file

This file stores the node private key which is used to identify the node on the network. This identity is not important on mainnet and public networks, but has special importance in private networks.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 18:27:50 GMT):<br/>
There is no such thing as a paid version of Besu. Hyperledger Besu is an open source project trademarked by the Hyperledger Foundation, a commercial product would be named differently and would require you to address the vendor. Just clarifying this bit.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 18:28:26 GMT):<br/>
The file is read at startup and can be unmounted, discarded afterwards.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 18:29:47 GMT):<br/>
Now on to your actual concerns:
* Ideally, you'd store the file in an encrypted volume. If you'd like the file itself to be encrypted and unlocked via a password, then we didn't achieve enough since the password needs to be provided.
* It could be possible to provide the private key via an env var that can then be provided as a secret. If this interests you, I recommend you file an issue on the repository asking for this functionality.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 18:30:36 GMT):<br/>
I'm not familiar with this CLI flag but it might address your concerns nicely: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#security-module

Hello @NgugsJohn the first section  shows you how to compile a solidity contract - in this case the contract is  https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/files/common/smart_contracts/contracts/SimpleStorage.sol and to compile that contract we use https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/files/common/smart_contracts/scripts/compile.js.

The part that is in the docs is a simplifed version of the compile.js file above ^
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 05 Aug 2021 05:50:02 GMT):<br/>
Once you have your compiled artifacts you use the ABI and the bytecode of the compile step (which we've precompiled and saved here https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/tree/master/files/common/smart_contracts/contracts ) and then deploy that as a transaction which is the second section of code. An example of this is https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/files/besu/smart_contracts/scripts/public_tx.js
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Thu, 05 Aug 2021 05:50:37 GMT):<br/>
All of the examples and snippets in this section have the code, contracts etc in the quickstart in the smart_contracts folder

All of the examples and snippets in this section have the code, contracts etc in the quickstart in the smart_contracts folder. As @macfarla has mentioned above they use web3eea atm and we're transitioning to web3js-quorum and we'll update both soon!

Hi everyone. I want to ask about TPS in besu. Right now I am using a genesis file with blockperiodseconds is 2. And when I try to send transaction using loopback explorer API, it will give response every 2 seconds. Does this related because it wait (asynchronously) for the block to be created? I wonder how to make the TPS go higher.

In that case, my questions are :
1. How do I config number of transactions per block?
2. How do I config the transaction to be submitted synchronously?
3. Is there any drawback with what I'm approaching above? 

Thank you!

We don't have flags to set the pivot block for fast sync outside of what the protocol settles on.

<p><strong>jlochman</strong> (Thu, 05 Aug 2021 12:49:48 GMT):<br/>
number of transactions per block should be determined mainly by block Gas Limit. We've tested Besu with gasLimit=20e6 and blockTime=2s - Besu processed 952 tx per block without any problem (txs were sent by web3.js)
</p>
<p><strong>BrunoMartins3</strong> (Thu, 05 Aug 2021 15:46:23 GMT):<br/>
Is eth_gasPrice meant to be returning a constant value block after block?

<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 05 Aug 2021 16:26:32 GMT):<br/>
@atoulme, first thank you very much for your answer.
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 05 Aug 2021 16:28:22 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I was refering to the private key file and I am really creating a permissioned network. This is the node key and is used in IBFT and in our metatransactions.
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 05 Aug 2021 16:29:17 GMT):<br/>
I knew Besu is a Hyperledger project. I was trying to refer to other paid version of Besu. Isn't Pagasys offering a premium solution with some additional features?
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 05 Aug 2021 16:29:48 GMT):<br/>
The file is read at startup and can be unmounted, discarded afterwards. -- I didn't know this. Thank you for clarifying.
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 05 Aug 2021 16:33:42 GMT):<br/>
I actually looked at this CLI flag some time ago. I was told that I need to set up a security module to deal with that and it does not seem a simple thing to implement. That is actually I asked if there is a paid version including this.

What explorer do you use for Besu?
I see Alethio Lite Explorer is the only explorer mentioned in Besu documentation.
We've tried Blockscout, which added Besu support app. one year ago https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/pull/3154. Unfortunately, there were no Besu-related changes to Blockscout since then and we are facing some issues when connecting Blockscout to the up-to-date version of Besu. A communication with the Blockscout team is a far cry from what we need for our production purposes.

We were thinking to use offchain privacy groups extensively and were wondering if there would be any scalability issues with it. Any documentation or research done on this topic? 
For example, let's say we have 1000+ besu nodes and we create 2^1000 privacy groups (i.e., for all combinations). Would this be a problem?

I've opened a github issue several days ago

lite explorer - do you mean Alethio? I've tried this explorer months ago but compared to Blockscout, it offers very little :( maybe I'm wrong, but I haven't found any integration of smart contracts in Alethio, nor any display for ERC20 tokens, which both are the crux of the matter for us.

The exception is from a non-critical part of code, the DNS resolution for initial peer discovery.  If this is occurring after the node has been running a while, I'd consider it a symptom that the whole process lost network connectivity and hence all peers.  Which is why a restart fixed things.

Hey Charlie, the pattern we often follow is we open up an ssh tunnel for the rpc port, that way we do not have to expose rpc to the wider internet, e.g.:

```ssh ec2-user@host -L 8545:localhost:8545```

and then when interacting with RPC from our local machines we just use localhost:8545

Another option is to try to whitelist just the IP address or subnet that you are planning to deploy from

Besu nodes can participate in an IBFT 1 network but can't be validators. So I think you would be connecting to an IBFT 1.0 network of GoQuorum nodes. I believe you want to use the istanbul commands in GoQuorum. Does this tutorial help? https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net/en/stable/Tutorials/Create-IBFT-Network/

Dears, we have a Besu permissioned network where all nodes are using the node https://dl.bintray.com/hyperledger-org/besu-repo/besu-1.5.2.zip. A new node will enter in the network. However, this link is now unavailable. I know we need to upgrade Besu, but we are minimizing these activities since we are still on testnet. What can I do? 
* Is there any other link to download this version?
* are there issues to this new node be the only one in a much advanced version?

Bintray went out of service, we had to migrate off of bintray.  
Look here: https://hyperledger.jfrog.io/artifactory/besu-binaries/besu/ and for that version it is here: https://hyperledger.jfrog.io/artifactory/besu-binaries/besu/1.5.2/besu-1.5.2.zip
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 12 Aug 2021 17:46:45 GMT):<br/>
This artifactory service is paid for by Hyperledger (your company's membership fees at work!) so I expect this location to be more permanent that the last permanent home.

<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Thu, 12 Aug 2021 19:05:03 GMT):<br/>
Thank you, by the way, I think it is important to understand how close different versions should be. Is there a site where you list the non-backward compatible versions of besu nodes? For example, is besu-1.5.2 compatible with the current version?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 12 Aug 2021 19:24:26 GMT):<br/>
We've moved to a calendar versioning basis.  The ethereum mainnet hard-forks we follow make semver particularly problematic.  I would recommend using the most recent major release as they come out.  As far as chain defeinitions they will remain backwards compatible, you may see CLI changes and new features with each major release.

Hi @rampatra we don't have data on your specific scenario. Our testing and that of community members does show there is some processing and memory overhead with using privacy but it's still on our list to do benchmarking with the different types of privacy and different sized networks. You would need to consider the CPU and memory requirements for the nodes. We would definitely be interested to know what you find out, if you're willing to share. Make sure you use latest Besu because we did fix a memory related bug in privacy recently https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/2387

Hi there, I'm using a Quickstart installation from Azure Marketplace. The peers were running well but they suddenly stopped. I suppose that could be an out of memory issue and resized the VM RAM. Now is working, but when looking at the node status I see "Up (unhealthy)", what does "unhealthy" means ? Can I repair them ? Thanks in advance

Hello @sebaleoperez yes I expect the OOM issue is due to size of the VM. What VM size did you pick and what options did you select for the quickstart please? They should all be healthy, did they go unhealthy after the restart? If so what do the logs report back? The logs are located in the `logs/besu/` dir of the quickstart
</p>
<p><strong>sebaleoperez</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:36:35 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for answering. I was using 4 Gb and expanded to 8 Gb. The nodes are currently running and for  the moment is going well. If I run the list.sh script all the nodes still are "unhealthy" but working
</p>
<p><strong>sebaleoperez</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:37:09 GMT):<br/>
I don't have any "logs" folder, 'm using the quickstart from the azure marketplace
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:42:59 GMT):<br/>
Alright, there are a couple of them - the one that you run has 4 nodes? bootnode, rpcnode, node3 & node4?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:44:29 GMT):<br/>
If so that appears to be logging to console. So to get those logs run:
```docker ps | grep rpcnode```
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:44:52 GMT):<br/>
then use the containerId it returns in
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:45:08 GMT):<br/>
```docker logs <containerId>```
</p>
<p><strong>sebaleoperez</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:49:13 GMT):<br/>
In the list the are 4 nodes: node1, node3, node4 and rpcnode
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:50:08 GMT):<br/>
something is a bit off there, could you send me a link to this one in marketplace please?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:50:25 GMT):<br/>
This is the more upto date version we recommend for use https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/consensys.quorum-dev-quickstart?tab=Overview
</p>
<p><strong>sebaleoperez</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:50:32 GMT):<br/>
I was able to get the logs with the command you sent
</p>
<p><strong>sebaleoperez</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:51:04 GMT):<br/>
this one:

</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:51:29 GMT):<br/>
What do the logs say? If the chain head is progressing (blocks are being created, there isnt a reason for the nodes to be unhealthy ie their RPC endpoints are not accessible
</p>
<p><strong>sebaleoperez</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:51:41 GMT):<br/>
ah ok, so quorum and besu are going to be the same soon ?
</p>
<p><strong>sebaleoperez</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:52:16 GMT):<br/>

Not quite - consensys offer both besu and goQuorum options in a quickstart and you can use either option to spin up a full chain. This marketplace offering is maintained and has docs and examples. The besu quickstart was based off it but isn't as easy to keep up to date due to some azure restrictions
</p>
<p><strong>sebaleoperez</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:55:35 GMT):<br/>
I see, so do you recommend to use quorum instead of besu ?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:56:16 GMT):<br/>
I'd recommend using this one https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/consensys.quorum-dev-quickstart?tab=Overview on a fresh VM and you have the options of privacy as well using Tessera as well as permissioning that you can explore. Doco for it is here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Examples/Private-Network-Example/
</p>
<p><strong>sebaleoperez</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:57:35 GMT):<br/>
Ok great to know, thanks for that. And 8 Gb RAM seems to work well, right ?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:59:56 GMT):<br/>
No no, you still use Besu, just a different marketplace offering that is more uptodate. When you fire that one up, select Besu which is the default (option1). I'll work on updating the other Besu quickstart to get it up to date (but this takes a while with Azure)
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 00:04:02 GMT):<br/>
Besu nodes generally require a min of 4GB each, https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Get-Started/System-Requirements/System-Requirements-Private/#java-virtual-machine-size For something that you test with a VM with 8 will run for a while until there are transactions etc until it'll need more RAM.
</p>
<p><strong>sebaleoperez</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 00:38:14 GMT):<br/>
I understand. Thanks for your help. I'll try then a new instance

Hello everyone, I am trying to send some transactions to besu, however besu always returns 'Upfront cost exceeds account balance' error even if I have set the gas value reasonably low. What do you suggest to solve this?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 22:10:16 GMT):<br/>
The account you are signing with on that particular chain does not have enough ether balance to cover the gasLimit * gasCost.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 22:10:24 GMT):<br/>
Add ether to that account.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 00:36:16 GMT):<br/>
Your chain configuration is your genesis file, right? As long as the file is not in the data-path directory you should be fine.

If you are using mainnet or a public testnet they have all gone to eip-1559, which has a mandatory 7 wei base fee.  Zero gas costing will only work on pre-london networks.

When using IP address of the server, the 4th_blockNumber returns number. However when using domain name it return nothing. When ping to the domain, the same IP is returned. What can cause the failure of eth_blockNumber with domain name? Here is the message with IP address:

}%

<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 18:07:00 GMT):<br/>
`ping domain_name` resolves to the same IP address xxx.xxx.21.141

Yep absolutely. You can do this with Besu out of the box. It has a native by default. You would also need to use a bridge like Chainstack's ChainBridge to enable cross-chain transactions though.

hey folks, when you look at the privateFor of a private transaction, can you tell which parties are part of the transaction, or is it obfuscated? I forget.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:01:02 GMT):<br/>
privateFor lists the Tessera public keys of the recipients. If you want obfuscation, you need privacy groups
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:01:32 GMT):<br/>
excellent, so there is a solution
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:01:36 GMT):<br/>
thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:01:57 GMT):<br/>
Besu privacy groups :)

<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:02:40 GMT):<br/>
I admit I didn't have time to play with those.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 02:11:29 GMT):<br/>
So ethersjs must be sending through this `type` parameter. Is this new behavior? Can you share the json request you are sending to ethersjs?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 02:12:33 GMT):<br/>
We do already ignore certain fields to `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas` because they are passed in by third-party libs eg https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2464 so it's possible we need to add an exception for this one too
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 02:13:28 GMT):<br/>
If it makes sense to do this, it's a pretty easy change to make
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 02:35:56 GMT):<br/>
the ANTLR version thing is just a warning, it shouldn't affect besu operation.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 02:36:45 GMT):<br/>
the native libs loading messages, similarly, shouldn't affect node operation - it's just telling you where it's looking for native libs and where it finally finds them

we have added ignores for other non-spec fields that are added by other third-party libs but this is a new one
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 29 Aug 2021 23:08:54 GMT):<br/>
I haven't investigated why ethersjs is adding this field but this change would get around it https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2690

ok sounds like updating ethers.js is the fix then!
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 01:01:40 GMT):<br/>
@macfarla perhaps we could consider ignoring unknown parameters and attempting the call with what is left? This smells like ethersjs was using a pre-final form of the London JSON-RPC changes.

Hello team!!
My company has an Alastria node with Besu deployed (besu/v20.10.2/linux-x86_64/oracle-java-16) where we are trying to integrate some dApps. The Smart Contracts have been deployed properly using truffle. The problem comes when we try to interact with them. I can't connect metamask with the besu node, it says: Could not fetch chain ID. Is your RPC URL correct?

We haven't added Linux arm64 to our supported list yet.  We can get mac to build on M1 chips but native libraries we depend on are the longer poles, stuff like snappy compression.
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 18:20:54 GMT):<br/>
ok, would it be possible that Mac M1 binary packed in docker image work on linux, this may be a stupid idea, just thinking out loud
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 18:21:04 GMT):<br/>
Also any plan to support linux arm64 ?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 18:22:14 GMT):<br/>
no one's made commitments to linux arm yet. It hasn't been on anyone's radar.
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 18:23:08 GMT):<br/>
Ok, are there huge fixes that need to be done, if the fixes are few I can make an attempt myself to make it work.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 18:24:38 GMT):<br/>
It's the native libraries. https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-native will need to be updated, a local arm64 version of libsodium for the privacy tests, as well as nss.  Let me run some searches to see the other native libraries needd.
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 18:25:44 GMT):<br/>
I have been able to setup libsodium on arm64
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 18:34:19 GMT):<br/>
jars with libs - `jansi-2.3.4`,  `jline-2.14.6.jar`,  also these, but they look to have the needed arm libs already - `jffi-1.2.17-native.jar`,`jna-5.8.0.jar` `netty-all-4.1.66.Final.jar`, `netty-tcnative-boringssl-static-2.0.40.Final.jar`, `rocksdbjni-6.15.2.jar`, `snappy-java-1.1.8.4.jar`
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 18:34:34 GMT):<br/>
so it looks like just the ansi support and native crypto are in needed.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 18:37:07 GMT):<br/>
Looks like all that may be needed is to major version update jline to the 3.x series.  Besu will fall back to pure java crypto if the native libraries are absent.
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 19:56:03 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon can you help me where to put these jar files. I am stuck in last stage (build jars) of building besu-native now
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 19:56:38 GMT):<br/>
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 19:56:41 GMT):<br/>
Had to tweak few rust files to reach there (type of c_char is u8 in arm64, code was expecting i8)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 19:56:53 GMT):<br/>
then update versions.gradle to sue the -SNAPSHOT version published
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 19:59:20 GMT):<br/>
Will try this, will also study a bit more in depth on how gradle commands work.

Hello.
I have a question about contract of flexible privacy group.

I need to get lock before addParticipants function.
but, i don't need get lock before removeParticipant function.

why different both addParticipants and removeParticipant funtions

I think also need to get lock before exec removeParticipant funtions.
I also think don't need to get lock before exec both functions.becouse transaction of blockchain is not conflict if get lock or not.

Agree @shemnon - this matches what geth does too. https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2690
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 02:16:24 GMT):<br/>
This likely means that there's a problem with the URL you're entering into Metamask. Have you allowed MetaMask access to Besu (CLI option `--rpc-http-cors-origins`)
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 02:16:47 GMT):<br/>
Could be something like localhost vs 127.0.0.1 https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/91196/could-not-fetch-chain-id-is-your-rpc-url-correct

Could you please share OS and Besu version being used?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 07:16:18 GMT):<br/>
You only need to lock when you are adding because the “adder” needs to prepare the blob of data that contains all the private transactions up to that point. The lock is to prevent private transactions between creating the blob and adding that member to make sure that the new member ends up having the same state as everybody else. This is not necessary when removing someone from the group. Does that make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>hkiridera</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 07:30:25 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for kindly replying. I understand that why need lock mechanism.

Yep, you can either make a private network/sidechain or join the public Ethereum network! Any of which would be a real blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 15:37:02 GMT):<br/>
You can use a blockchain-as-a-service provider or other managed service to access Besu networks, otherwise you have to ensure you are building a highly available endpoint for yourself

If I would like to use domain name in provider, how shall host-whitelist and host-allowlist be configured? What I find is that if host-allowlist is removed, then using IP address in provider does not work.

Hi team, i have an issue interacting with a deployed smart contract, i have created a smart contract in remix ide, i have spun up besu nodes (etc), deployed the contract and was able to successfully interact with it in the remix ide. I was able to see confirmation blocks.

mining and gas prices are not related, mining relates to the security of the network. Gas prices are DDoS protections for transactions.

If you use PoW, you use mining. Try running Besu with a different consensus algorithm instead.

Hi Vijay, no worries, thanks for taking the time to respond! The migration to web3js-quorum is fair enough, but it would be still good to merge this one and issue (at least) one last release IMO before the support period ends (Dec 31st 2021) for people who are on the old code still (web3js-eea)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=5vTp3dCtFsYZC82PT) Thank you very much for replying, in private networks there may not be transactions every minute, there may not be a single transaction in hours, so it would be a waste if block generation in every few seconds can't be controlled.

@VijayMichalik also it is to save storage as in private blockchain we will not have many transactions in every second like that of public blockchain network

@VijayMichalik as you have already stated you guys are looking into something like this right now on my previously asked question "Hello guys, i would like to know if it possible to configure a network such that new blocks are added only when there is transactions in the pool using IBFT 2.0 consensus protocol?" and you also wanted to know the motivation behind this. 
The motivation is to save storage as in private blockchain we will not have many transactions in every seconds like that of public blockchain network and many empty blocks will be created in every few seconds which is a problem. Can you please provide me with any update about it?

Yep, we are working on this, and will likely plan to push a change here later this year or early next. It requires some changes to the consensus protocol which are non-trivial. It will prevent nodes from being required to store empty blocks.

Hi, for option host-allowlist, who is the host on a boot node? My understanding is that boot node serves rpc http calls from hosts (Ethereum clients) from internet.
</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Wed, 08 Sep 2021 21:49:00 GMT):<br/>
Also here is an example in Besu doc example for host-allowlist, host-allowlist=["medomain.com", "meotherdomain.com"]. Here is "medomain.com"  the domain name for boot node?

Hello there.
I have a question about Flexible Privacy Group.

In this case, I use Flexible Privacy Group.
At first. I create privacy group that include node1 and node2.
then, node1 deploy smart contract in privacy group and invoke some transaction at that smart contract.
if node2 is removed from the privacy group, but node2 can refer to data up to the time it was expelled from the group that using `web3.priv.call` function.
but if node2 use `web3.priv.generateAndSendRawTransaction` function, node2 can't read it.

I want to know the policy of `BESU`. which is true if node2 was removed from privacy group. node2 can or can not refer to data up to the time.
The implementation of one being readable and the other being unreadable seems inconsistent.

If it is a possible bug, I create an issue and steps to reproduce.

@VijayMichalik i have two questions
1. I have created a private network on my local pc using IBFT and then when i send the first transaction from a account using metamask most of the time it's pending, then in order for the transaction to go through i need to reset the account and then send the transaction again which is not a solution and sometimes when i reset the account and send a new transaction both the transactions go through at the same time (previous pending one and the new one) so what's the solution behind it?

2. I have created another network with the same configuration and hosted in AWS in a single day after the network was up my RAM usage went to 1.3gb from 600mb! is it normal? cause if its then its not feasible as its kept on increasing little by little.. so what's the problem here? 

And thanks in advance!!!

Very new to Besu and having below error:
Not sure what I am doing wrong?

ERROR | PrivDistributeRawTransaction | org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.rlp.RLPException: Expected current item to be a list, but it is: BYTE_ELEMENT (at bytes 0-1: [52]af69ec00...)

@hkiridera I am new to private transactions on besu. Would you guide me how to successfully achieve my first private transaction?
I have 4 EC2 nodes on Besu (Out 4, 1 is boot node, 2 are sealers / Validators and 4th one is the passive just importer node)
I have tessera installed and configured on all 4 nodes. And all normal (public) transactions / contract deployments and execution of functions are working fine.

However having no clue, how to achieve the private transaction on my this setup. Would you able to guide me please.

This message indicates a problem with the RLP decoding of what you're sending to PrivDistributeRawTransaction. Can you share more about how you're calling this method - and what client library you're using to generate the private transaction? Eg web3js-quorum

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 13 Sep 2021 01:10:04 GMT):<br/>
`host-allowlist` is where you list which other nodes can connect. This is just an example. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/APIs/API/#host-allowlist

Hello can anyone answer these two questions of mine? I would really appreciate it.

1. I have created a private network on my local pc using IBFT and then when i send the first transaction from a account using metamask most of the time it's pending, then in order for the transaction to go through i need to reset the account and then send the transaction again which is not a solution and sometimes when i reset the account and send a new transaction both the transactions go through at the same time (previous pending one and the new one) so what's the solution behind it?

2. I have created another network with the same configuration and hosted in AWS in a single day after the network was up my RAM usage went to 1.3gb from 600mb! is it normal? cause if its then its not feasible as its kept on increasing little by little.. so what's the problem here?

And thanks in advance!!!

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=4yTmE4fRJkEGDbCdK) on 4 node IBFT2.0 network, the rpc port for boot node is 8485 and rpm http request is directed to port 8485, is the boot node the only node serving the clients' http requests?

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 01:54:52 GMT):<br/>
You can send rpc requests (if rpc is enabled) to the boot node, it's just a regular node. Are you referring to a specific example?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 01:56:19 GMT):<br/>
if you're using caliper + ganache, you might be better off asking in the caliper channel?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 01:57:50 GMT):<br/>
sounds like there is an issue with the json file you're providing though
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 02:02:51 GMT):<br/>
Re 1 - if you're using Metamask and switching networks (eg from besu to ganache, or restarting besu with different db, or deleting besu db and restarting it) - you nearly always need to reset the account in metamask - I would recommend doing it before sending any transactions. My understanding is that Metamask keeps track of the account nonce so if you change that in besu (eg delete besu db and restart so nonce is zero) then the nonce doesn't match. Resetting the account in Metamask resets the nonce to match besu.

<p><strong>ShaharinAhmed</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 03:20:30 GMT):<br/>
@macfarla Thank you very much for answering, now please help me out with the second one, i have no idea why is this happening, i can understand why disk space might decrease but memory usage!! i don't have a clue, right now its a major headache
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 03:52:59 GMT):<br/>
I don't know the answer to this one - can ask the team - to help get answers can you provide some more info - what besu version are you running? are you connecting to mainnet or a testnet or just your own nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 03:57:58 GMT):<br/>
The intention is that node2 would retain access to the info in the group up to the point in time when they were removed (via priv_call, and specifying a block prior to when they were removed). Once they are removed, they can't send any further transactions (sendRawTransaction). Does that answer your question?

Hey folks - Hyperledger is participating in Grace Hopper's Open Source Day on October 1st from 9 AM - 5 PM PST. It is a great opportunity to showcase Hyperledger Besu and get new developers working on our codebase. We'd love to add a few more "good first issues" so - if you think of something that would make life easier as a dev or user of Besu, please create an issue for it. https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22

<p><strong>hkiridera</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 06:40:01 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for your answer. I understand that removed besu node can read old data in privacy group .
I thought it would be better to change the description to use'web3.priv.call' in each chapter of the tutorial.
</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 06:46:28 GMT):<br/>
@ShaharinAhmed How much memory have you allocated to Besu? Besu docs have some more details on the recommended memory https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Get-Started/System-Requirements/System-Requirements-Private/.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 06:55:09 GMT):<br/>
ah ok so maybe the docs need updating - can you share the link to the tutorial you mean? Thanks!

@jframe yes i have already seen it, and allocated 8 GB for memory and hard disk of 2gb but both memory usage and disk usage keeps on growing, disk usage maybe understandable in some sense but i am not really understanding why memory usage keeps on increasing

<p><strong>hkiridera</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 07:07:03 GMT):<br/>
I read this tutorial.
This sample program attempts to read from a privacy group smart contract using `web3quorum.priv.generateAndSendRawTransaction`.

I thought it would be better to use `'web3quorum.priv.call'`.

Hey @ShaharinAhmed, could you create an issue on Github? That way we can investigate. Memory should indeed not be increasing!

hi, i need some help to find a issue. so to summarize i had a client IBFT with custom hardfork the blockchain as been work with version 1.4 for quite some time and recently i upgraded to version 21 of besu. all works fine if i sync with normal default parameters. if i do sync-mode FAST the client stop sync giving a "invalid block header and give the block number and transaction hash" i checked this block and not have transactions the parent block is ok as in the current network, what could be wrong here ? what are the files that in charge of checking the fast sync mode.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 23:02:56 GMT):<br/>
you have a point - however the difference is that tutorial uses `privateFor` values to send the transaction, whereas `priv_call` uses privacy group ID. So slightly different scenarios. The good news is, your understanding is correct!

One thing to check - is your node producing blocks? either mining (PoW) or correctly validating & producing blocks (PoA). If blocks aren't being produced, then the migration won't work.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 15 Sep 2021 23:03:44 GMT):<br/>
There shouldn't be any difference in block validation between full/fast sync. Are you sure that the block is the correct one for your fork in both cases? You could try using `--required-block` parameter  https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#required-block

I'm a newby here to hyperledger besu! I've been reading over the documentation, and I see that on boot nodes one can configure the chain ID to be main net, rinkeby, or a permissioned network, etc. 

I also see that a genesis.json is used as well to configure an entire network's chain ID

What I'm struggling to wrap my head around is, when creating nodes in a network, can I have nodes that exist on main net and nodes that exist on a private network that can interact with each other?

For example, let's say I have a private smart contract sitting on the private network of course that handles transactions that require permissioning. Could this smart contract inform / interact with a public smart contract that sits on a node configured for main net ethereum?

start here https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/main/docker
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:24:37 GMT):<br/>
there is more than one

<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:28:08 GMT):<br/>
Was there any discussion about multi architecture Docker images? Currently I want to run besu on a Raspberry Pi for an experiment, but the Docker images does not support arm
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:29:54 GMT):<br/>
you're the same guy who was recompiling native libs for arm right?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:30:13 GMT):<br/>
we depend on besu-native - you need to port it to arm first
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:30:24 GMT):<br/>
Ehm... not that I remember :D At least not for besu
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:31:00 GMT):<br/>
well ok. So right, first off, we don't support arm because our native dependencies don't support arm
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:31:10 GMT):<br/>
look here https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-native
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:31:34 GMT):<br/>
we can do without native, but it's slow. You can try to create a besu docker image for arm
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:41:14 GMT):<br/>
Ok, will try to compile. Actually I just need to run a single node clique network, so I guess speed is not that important for me.
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:42:23 GMT):<br/>
Regarding native stuff: I just was involved a bit in improving dependency situation of web3 library regarding multi platform support / removing strange pre-compiled dependencies, but never with besu until now.

Hello everyone ! Hope this question hasn't been posted 1000 times (if yes, I am genuinely sorry). Me and my team are doing some POC on VM instrumentation and we are looking forward to use besu as a library. Would it be possible to have a more recent artifact published to maven central ? The last one is from March 2021 (21.1.1) and we need the last opcode changes from the newest versions :)

We don't post to maven central at this time.  We maintain a jfrog repository at https://hyperledger.jfrog.io/artifactory/besu-maven/

Hi, that was me trying to port native library to arm. I got occupied with office work and couldn't complete it.
I am still stuck on that, issue is with rust code having C_CHAR type coming as u8 where its expected to be i8. Haven't been able to fix this.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:32:00 GMT):<br/>
ok

do all this please:
* open a draft PR with your progress
* point the issue in a comment on it
* ask for help
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:32:44 GMT):<br/>
I am not a rust dev, can't help you, but let's give this one a chance
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:34:55 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good with me, will do in coming 1-2 days.
In the meantime if there is a way i can build besu for arm without native, that will help me a lot. I need to have it on arm64 on new AWS linux.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:36:10 GMT):<br/>
no idea, it's not been tried
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:36:32 GMT):<br/>
If you want to see arm support, open an issue on the besu repo
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:37:03 GMT):<br/>
Okey, will do thanks :)
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:37:37 GMT):<br/>
You did mention it can be done without native, what did you mean by that ?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:37:55 GMT):<br/>
on startup, besu checks if it can load the native libs
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:38:09 GMT):<br/>
if they're not present, it defaults to a java impl instead which is slower
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:38:33 GMT):<br/>
Okey, so if I build without native it should work ?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:38:42 GMT):<br/>
not been tried
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:39:18 GMT):<br/>
I can try that, i was able to build the docker images for arm, will let you know tomorrow around the same time if it works
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:39:49 GMT):<br/>
I ... I don't care. Just trying to help you here.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:39:59 GMT):<br/>
Make sure you open issues and tell everyone about it
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:40:06 GMT):<br/>
don't post on a thread in rocket.chat
</p>
<p><strong>hckkid</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:40:22 GMT):<br/>
oh okey, will definitely do as you suggested.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:57:46 GMT):<br/>

You could try fiddling with the `blockperiodseconds` value in the genesis https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/Clique/#genesis-file
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 01:08:37 GMT):<br/>
The short answer is no. Nodes have to be on the same network, ie chain, to talk to each other. (There are "bridges" and sidechains that do tricky things but don't start there if you're just learning :)
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 01:11:03 GMT):<br/>
we don't support arm because our native dependencies don't support arm

<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 10:21:43 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Minnu, Hyperledger Besu and Fabric are very different architectures, so I wouldn't expect it to be easy to get Besu and Fabric applications to work well together. In particular, I'm not familiar with any ways to port a Fabric application to Besu. You might be able to find a bridge technology between Fabric and Ethereum, and this should work for any Besu network as well.

We recently changed besu to ignore all unknown fields to eth_estimateGas. https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/2690 If you are using an older version of besu, can you update and try again?

Hey @iffathossain, most networks like to separate responsibilities to reduce the risk of impacting consensus. So the RPC node accepts and broadcasts transactions and reads and the validator nodes are responsible for block creation.
</p>
<p><strong>VijayMichalik</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 07:26:34 GMT):<br/>
Each node can be tuned to the performance requirements of the role as well.

Hey @hjpn we don't have a specific recommendation (the Alethio Lite Explorer is bundled with Besu but only serves basic information) but would love your feedback on what works and doesn't for you. We have an ongoing desire to support whatever you'd like to use!

I'm following the lacchain tutorial -> https://github.com/lacchain/besu-pro-testnet/blob/master/roles/lacchain-bootnode/tasks/install-orion.yaml  , and trying to put UP my first node... But after my node goes UP I'll install with new versions. For now, I'm learning about eth and besu.

<p><strong>GiovanniZanol</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 11:52:33 GMT):<br/>

there shouldn't be anything special that you need to do here - it's just making sure remix can talk to your besu node over http. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#rpc-http-cors-origins

Besu's P2P code manages a lot of this automatically, with peer connections prioritised and/or closed according to a number of factors. There is no setting for individual connection timeout. There are options to manage remote connections eg https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#remote-connections-limit-enabled

I'd also like to see the result of net_peerCount on the node that is returning false for eth_syncing (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#net_peercount).

I think `eth_syncing` only returns true when the node is actively syncing ie it has to get out of sync

Hi, I am having a problem regarding the blocktime
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:13:05 GMT):<br/>
I have set the block interval as 5 seconds on my Besu configuration, and I am running 4 nodes on the same machine for testing purposes
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:13:24 GMT):<br/>
I am receiving errors regarding the block timestamps, it seems that the blocks are being produced between 4.5 - 5.5 seconds
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:13:39 GMT):<br/>
the ones produced in 4.5 seconds get rejected automatically due to blocktimestamps
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:13:54 GMT):<br/>
Which causes my average block interval to be 12 seconds (due to blocks being rejected)
</p>
<p><strong>Nithronium</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:14:26 GMT):<br/>
Here: ` Invalid block header: timestamp 1633529637 is only 4 seconds newer than parent timestamp 1633529633. Minimum 5 seconds`

we don't have a specific recommendation (the Alethio Lite Explorer is bundled with Besu but only serves basic information) but would love your feedback on what works and doesn't for you. We have an ongoing desire to support whatever you'd like to use!
</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 04:41:29 GMT):<br/>
What version of Besu are you using? The behaviour of the block period timestamp has been improved in recent releases.
</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 04:43:32 GMT):<br/>
This happens due to variability  with the Java timer. Sometimes the timer delay can be shorter or longer than the specified value

Hey Everyone, 
Currently, I have run the default structure of BESU. Which have 4 peers and 1 bootnode.

But Blocks are created automatically without any external transaction and it also affects storage. after 1-2 days storage is fulled.

How I can stop this continuous Block generation in BESU?
Thanks.

I just tested this locally - started a node that's producing blocks, it's up to 11000 blocks, started another node with an empty db and it returns true for eth_syncing while it's catching up (but only for the 5 or so seconds it takes to get to chain head). But once it's in sync (ie only importing the 1 or 2 blocks it's behind), it always returns false.

If you delete them Besu will re-generate them, possibly as late as the next restart.  The queries will be generally slower until the cache is re-generated.

when including a new validator in an IBFT2.0 permissioned network using voting (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/Add-Validators/), I can use ibft_getPendingVotes to check if the vote of a validator was computed or not. Is there a way to know what is the state of voting for all validators? I mean, how to make sure that the votes are happening, remember who still not vote etc.

Hi do you perhaps have access to the logs, perhaps you'll find something similar to:

`2021-10-13 19:38:51.870+00:00 | StatePruning-0 | INFO  | Pruner | Starting Pruner.`

Alternatively if you have metrics enabled you should be able to see some metrics if pruning is enabled.

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 23:31:49 GMT):<br/>
By and large there are no hard and fast rules re nodes, but the general practise is to work with the governance model of your org. For example validators are often sealed off and only allowed to talk to other validators, bootnodes and selected rpc nodes, but you can have them open to all. The general rule of thumb is to have seperation of concerns ie validators only produce blocks, specific nodes for txns and others may be for read only operations/bootnodes etc

Can a VPC with a public gateway be used for these cases? I haven't found any guide.

Is there any particular reason for why the mandated algorithm is RSA-2048?
</p>
<p><strong>Librechain</strong> (Fri, 15 Oct 2021 01:28:01 GMT):<br/>
Given the fact we're dealing with cryptocurrencies to begin with, the departure from ecdsa / edwards' curves struck me as a bit strange (I'm guessing ecdsa is out bc rsa provides encryption); but I have an issue with the weakness of the algorithm mandated (since the documentation is about securing JSON RPC).
</p>
<p><strong>Librechain</strong> (Fri, 15 Oct 2021 01:29:32 GMT):<br/>
Recently, the NSA published renewed guidance affirming that RSA-2048 keys should be deprecated in favor of ones that are at least 3096-bits. That aside though the JWT protocol allows for the use of much stronger algorithms that can be executed by virtually any major cryptographic library (OpenSSL, libgcrypt, NaCL, libsodium, Botan, etc.)

</p>
<p><strong>Librechain</strong> (Fri, 15 Oct 2021 04:12:25 GMT):<br/>
Sorry I misspoke. It doesn't restrict it to that bit-size, but it does restrict the algo to RSA.
</p>
<p><strong>Librechain</strong> (Fri, 15 Oct 2021 04:14:03 GMT):<br/>
I don't want to be a dick, but that restriction honestly defeats the purpose of even provisioning any type of JWT-based API auth. for Besu. Using 3096+ bit keys in a world where smaller, more efficient, secure, and flexible algos are out there is a no-go for most if not all devs at this point.
</p>
<p><strong>Librechain</strong> (Fri, 15 Oct 2021 04:15:57 GMT):<br/>
Is there some drawback to allowing other key algos to be used for the generated JWT pubkey?
</p>
<p><strong>bgravenorst</strong> (Fri, 15 Oct 2021 04:31:20 GMT):<br/>
You can delete the data in Besu's data directory to restart generating from block zero. The data directory is configured in the `--data-path` CLI option

Hi @damianlluch you can put the instance in a VPC but preferable in a public subnet so metamask can connect to it. Enable the 'public_ip' option when you spin it up. If you are deploying the instance in a private subnet you need a VPN or tunnel or equivalent  that will resolve and connect to your instance
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Fri, 15 Oct 2021 12:39:18 GMT):<br/>
It may also be a good practice to change the `chainId` and probably something from your genesis like the `timestamp` to make sure you start building a completely different chain

Hi everybody, I've been diving into Besu for the past couple days, trying to get an Ethereum chain setup on AWS.
</p>
<p><strong>natedl98</strong> (Sat, 16 Oct 2021 03:30:23 GMT):<br/>
I have one instance on HDD and one on SSD. One thing I noticed is that the eth_syncing return object is different between the two
</p>
<p><strong>natedl98</strong> (Sat, 16 Oct 2021 03:30:59 GMT):<br/>
On HDD it has 2 extra keys, "pulledStates" and "knownStates". My SSD blockchain doesn't have those two keys in its object
</p>
<p><strong>natedl98</strong> (Sat, 16 Oct 2021 03:31:55 GMT):<br/>
We wanted to make both nodes an archive node, but I am guessing we accidentally synced one of them in fast mode
</p>
<p><strong>natedl98</strong> (Sat, 16 Oct 2021 03:33:07 GMT):<br/>
The other thing I noticed is that the HDD version (the one with the additional key-value pairs in its eth_syncing return object) seems to be syncing a lot faster than the SSD version (the one with out "pulledStates" and "knownStates"). Any idea why this might be?
</p>
<p><strong>natedl98</strong> (Sat, 16 Oct 2021 03:34:24 GMT):<br/>
Also, it seems like the sync process times out sometimes. On my HDD node, it seems like it has gotten stuck on block 0x9d6fa0. I'm not sure if I should just let it continue or do something?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 16 Oct 2021 03:47:48 GMT):<br/>
HDD is running in fast sync mode.  Not useful as an archive node  The block number is just the download over the p2p, no processing.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 16 Oct 2021 03:48:07 GMT):<br/>
HDD won't be able to keep up with block processing at chain head.  No client can on an HDD

Thanks for the quick reply. Yeah that's unfortunately what I was suspecting. Do you think it's possible to do the original sync on SSD and then convert the disk to HDD when the initial sync is complete? That was my plan because HDD is like 1/10th of the cost of SSD on AWS

Hi 
I am new to Quorum and wanted to try it out. I followed the instruction on the guide --> https://consensys.net/quorum/products/guides/getting-started-with-consensys-quorum/
Unfortunately, along the way I encountered a difference between the instruction on the guide vs the actual execution. The guide mentioned that I should answer "Y" when prompted this question "Do you wish to enable support for logging with ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana)? [y/N]", however what I saw when in the actual execution is 
"Do you wish to enable support for logging with Splunk or ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana)? Default: [1]
	1. None
	2. Splunk
	3. ELK
"
So I answer "3" since it is the closest to what the guide meant.
Subsequently, it continues to run and ended with this error "Error response from daemon: invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not exist: /Users/Thomas/work/quorum/quorum-test-network/logs/tessera"

My system config as follows:
- macOS Big Sur 11.6

<p><strong>bgravenorst</strong> (Sun, 17 Oct 2021 22:59:33 GMT):<br/>
Hi, do you want to run a customised Besu docker image?

Otherwise, instructions to run Besu using Docker can be found here:

https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Get-Started/Installation-Options/Run-Docker-Image/

You can also run the development version by replacing `latest` with `develop`
</p>
<p><strong>bgravenorst</strong> (Sun, 17 Oct 2021 23:28:45 GMT):<br/>
I'm able to replicate this behaviour. Are you able to run using the Docker image?

Alethio isn't currently under active maintenance.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 18 Oct 2021 00:59:21 GMT):<br/>
You raise a good point @Librechain - I don't think there's a good reason for this restriction. In theory, we can support whatever algorithms the JWT spec and Vertx can support. Would you create a GitHub issue for this and we can see where it fits in terms of priorities!

I followed exactly to the guide. I chose Besu and followed by
- "N" for Codefi Orchestrate 
- "Y" for Private Transactions
- "3" for ELK

thanks

Hello!

Anyone who works with Hyperledger Besu? What is the best alternative to use as a block explorer?
I have 4 nodes on two AWS instances working perfectly, and I would like to add the block explorer, I have seen several on github. And I have also seen blockscout on AWS which is available to deploy on one instance. Now, reviewing the blockskout documentation for manual deployment, I see it complicated, I think the documentation is not clear.
Any other option? any clear blockskout tutorial?

thanks

Hi @Bhawikchawda Have you sent any transactions to the network? If you use the privacy examples that will send a few across. An uncle /ommer is a block that is orphaned becuase its not on the same longest chain - in the above your network doesn't have any - this is a good thing
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 18 Oct 2021 21:37:08 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/web3labs/epirus-free is an alternative. Blockscout is easy enough to deploy but is quite heavy on the RPC calls because of a lack of support for ws. Ultimately I think it depends on what would you like the blockexplorer to do - each has pros/cons

For IBFT2, QBFT, Clique and ethash, besu creates blocks even without transactions being submitted. You can increase the timing so that there's more time between blocks but you can't stop Besu from creating empty blocks.

Hi @Bhawikchawda so how far have you got ie is your network up? In general to add a node you need : 
1. the new node to have the same genesis file as the existing network
2. be able to connect to the bootnodes & as many other nodes as possible.
3. If you use permissions then you need to add the new node's enode to the permissions file of every existing node
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Tue, 19 Oct 2021 22:21:58 GMT):<br/>
So with the quickstart you have permissions being used and you have a couple of options to go:
- run another container standalone via `docker run -d network=quorum-dev-quickstart -p -v ./loca/path/to/genesis:/config/genesis.json hyperledger/besu:latest --genesis /config/genesis.json --rpc --bootnodes=<Node-1 Enode URL> --p2p-port=30304 --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=ETH,NET,IBFT --host-allowlist="*" --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" --rpc-http-port=8546` Alter the list of commands to suit and put in the bootnode enodes and you need to mount the genesis.json file
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Tue, 19 Oct 2021 22:25:01 GMT):<br/>
In the logs for this node, you will get an enode which you now need to update all the existing nodes with either by adding it to the permissions file https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/files/besu/config/besu/permissions_config.toml . This file should be in the config directory of where you do the ./run.sh command from. Once added you need to restart all the existing nodes
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Tue, 19 Oct 2021 22:26:03 GMT):<br/>
Alternatively instead of restarting make an API call to each node via https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#perm_addnodestoallowlist
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Tue, 19 Oct 2021 22:33:36 GMT):<br/>
2. Create another node similar to the rpcnode (https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/templates/besu/docker-compose.yml#L423) in the compose file itself and give it a known set of keys (https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/tree/master/files/common/config/nodes) and a known IP. Add the enode to the permissions file https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/files/besu/config/besu/permissions_config.toml and restart the docker-compose file 

This is the simpler of the two. In real networks, the former is generally done

Hi all, Is there a way to set the minimum number of transactions for a block in besu? I am using the IBFT 2.0 protocol and there are a lot of empty blocks that are created when are no transactions on the network!

Hi all, how do you allow metamask to interact with the network with the rpc-http-cors-origin option other than using "all" or "*". metamask was not able to connect to the network since i made rpc-http-cors-origins=["https://remix.ethereum.org"] instead of using "*"

Adding `https://remix.ethereum.org` would allow you to use remix with your besu node. Are you trying to use remix, or metamask? Or both? To allow a client to connect via metamask, you need to add the client domain https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#rpc-http-cors-origins

Right now I am trying to use both metamask and remix as I want to allow remix to interact to the network through metamask. the problem that i encounter is that im not sure for what the client domain is for metamask. I tried adding the url extension `chrome-extension://nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn` however its still not working for me

Hello, all... 
I created 4 nodes on 2 servers.. First server is Bootnode and node2.  The second server (2 nodes) connects to the bootnode smoothly. 
But the "peers" count are: Bootnode: 3 peers, node2: 1 peer, node3: 2 peers, node4: 2 peers. 
What am I doing incorrectly? Shouldn't it show 4 peers for all nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 25 Oct 2021 11:49:39 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Bhawikchawda can you confirm that you have a genesis file at `./local/path/to/genesis.json` - you need to provide the relative path to the genesis file here. https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#genesis-file   Also `--bootnodes=<Node-1 Enode URL>` needs to the actual enodes ie enode://abcd......@w.x.y.z:30303 https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#bootnodes
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 25 Oct 2021 11:51:31 GMT):<br/>
Have a look in the compose file how we configure the nodes.  https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Configure/Using-Configuration-File/ We use a config file `config.toml` and cli args are sometimes added depending on the type of node
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 25 Oct 2021 11:56:27 GMT):<br/>
They should show 3 for all of them if peered right ( total - self). Generally they will get to 3 in time after they gossip for a while. Sometimes its depends on how they've been started  ie if they all come up at the same time node 3 may not see node 4 from the bootnodes, I'd suggest bringing up them up in sequence and waiting 30s in between for them to communicate and start. ie bootnode first -> node 1 -> node 2 and so on. With each successive node that joins the bootnode will report them as peers to the next joining node
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 25 Oct 2021 11:58:09 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for response.. OK, I will wait a while. 
I started them as shown in the setup guide. Will update here in both cases.

Nice work @shadiayoub! on the public node would also recommend setting the CIDR to allow traffic to your IP only and not the world else you could get a bunch of unneeded reqs come through. ie open 8545 etc to your IP instead of 0.0.0.0/0
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 22:12:28 GMT):<br/>
Yep @damianlluch , normally do one validator at a time in a rolling restart manner (what we do for updates to Besu versions). This keeps the network live and producing blocks and doesn't take it down.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 22:17:21 GMT):<br/>
Yep, that makes sense. How do you mount the genesis file in the above command? ie the file may exist locally on your machine but how does it get into the container. Refer to  https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/ . In the command above I gave you ` -v ./loca/path/to/genesis.json:/config/genesis.json` did that and you need to edit the path as per your setup

In fact, it says in the documentations that: blocktime is one of the attributes that cannot be changed after starting a network. So I believe you'll need to restart it as a new network after you change blocktime. 
"The blockperiodseconds, blockreward, and miningbeneficiary properties cannot be updated once your network is started."

Hello
Is there a way to produce the accountkey file content from the public/private keys for a node?
I am referring to the files in /config/nodes folder in the quickstart after running the setup. 
I want to use the quickstart to create a network what does not use the default keys for nodes.

<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 20:54:51 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 21:55:41 GMT):<br/>
You'll likely need to get the latest version of the quickstart 0.0.41 I think which has this functionality
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 21:59:10 GMT):<br/>
The accountkey specifically is only needed for goQuorum - Besu doesn't do account management so you'll need to use something like ethsigner https://docs.ethsigner.consensys.net/en/latest/Tutorials/Start-EthSigner/ or QKM https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-key-manager

It shows the transactions for the block from memory, if you know the hash of the block enter that in the search bar and it'll pop open the block view which details all txns in there

The blockperiodseconds, blockreward, and miningbeneficiary properties cannot be updated once your network is started.

Hello, a very basic question: How to do a backup in my Besu node? 
I know one possibility would be to have another node in my institution. But, if I want to store this backup offline, together with other storages, should I only copy the block files? Is it common to do that?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 19:58:36 GMT):<br/>
It's basically the data-path dir - does this page help at all? https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Backup/Backup/#data-backups

Hi all,  I am creating ibft2.0 based private besu network with 4 nodes, the network is working fine but am not able to access the node (neither from host machine  nor from inside the same container) getting the error - 'Host not authorized' . I have already provided 'BESU_HOST_WHITELIST="*"' env variabel in all the containers, still the issue is same.

Besu's EVM supports all of the Mainnet forks and all of the Classic forks.  So London is probably the answer you are looking for.

also you don't need both BESU_HOST_ALLOWLIST and BESU_HOST_ALLOWLIST - they are aliases for the same option. you can just use BESU_HOST_ALLOWLIST

When we change the nodes key files in quickstart, we still have to update the extradata in genesis file, correct? 
Given that we update all the related files that contain the enodes.

<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 01 Nov 2021 17:49:26 GMT):<br/>
What are the correct steps to using QuickStart with new keys, please?  
1. Generate keys
2. Update enode addresses in relevant files.
3. Export code for 'extradata' field in Genesis.

We have a permissioned network in operation for 1 year in contantinopleFixBlock. I am trying to discover for what hard fork should I upgrade. I have seen that https://eips.ethereum.org/meta contains a list of hardforks. Looking to this site, I concluded that I should go to Hardfork Meta: Muir Glacier (It is the last one in Final category). Berlim still appears as Draft. 
What is the best link to provide me with info to decide the protocol upgrade of a Besu network?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 01 Nov 2021 20:20:03 GMT):<br/>
London.
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Mon, 01 Nov 2021 20:22:49 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, @shemnon. Is there a site with the list of all hardforks and their starting block?

<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Mon, 01 Nov 2021 20:37:29 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Mon, 01 Nov 2021 20:40:44 GMT):<br/>
Should I update the network from Constantinople to London directly, right?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 01 Nov 2021 20:52:44 GMT):<br/>
Is it a zero wei/gas network? There may be a second flag you may need to turn off the fee market.  Berlin doesn't have the fee market and has all the functional gains (and most of the gas schedule changes).
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Mon, 01 Nov 2021 20:58:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes, zero wei/gas net. What flag are you talking about?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 01 Nov 2021 21:26:21 GMT):<br/>
There were some second-price fee market chagnes in London.  I think some of the private network consensus team members should chime in on how it impacts private networks.  @macfarla / @lucassaldanha

<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 01 Nov 2021 22:14:49 GMT):<br/>
I generated keys for nodes using the key generator in extra data (nice work).
Then changed the enode addresses in all the relevant files. 
And exported the node addresses to RLP, and put the output in extradata field in genesis.  
But when running the network, it never comes up. Explorer says -1.

For private networks London is not yet supported, so Berlin would be the hard fork of choice.

Hi @kaveri , you will be able to follow the same (21.7.0) instructions to use generateAndSendRawTransaction with your version of Besu. That method generates, signs and sends the transaction using eth_sendRawTransaction. (the difference in docs is because we deprecated web3js-eea client lib and changed the docs to use web3js-quorum)
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 02 Nov 2021 23:49:01 GMT):<br/>
You would only get that error if you are sending tx via eth_sendTransaction (which Besu does not support). If you're still having trouble, can you share the code that you're using to send the tx to Besu?

I changed all the possible attributes, and yet, when it runs it fetches the default allocations and puts them in the Genesis. 
And I cannot know where it gets the values from, specially after updating all the original genesis files with new wallets.

I was running into the same problem. Changed the alloc section public keys in all the Genesis files. Still the network starts with the default values. 

The solution that worked for me is to change the settings in .env file. And also change the Genesis file.

Hi @frankliawesome as of right now I'm just playing around with the quickstart network with IBFT2.0 and privacy disabled. I was just trying to test out how a web application such as Remix interact with the network. recently I was playing around with the the http cors origin option to find out if i can only allow certain websites to interact with the network. I tried on the block explorer that is on my localhost which was provided by the quickstart and it works. next i was just testing if i can do this with Dapps such as the pet shop which is hosted locally and remix which uses injected web3 that interacts with the network with metamask, however metamask seems to be unable to connect to the network when the http cors origin is specified for remix or the petshop.

Hi, I was wondering what does the extra data represents other than the validators in the genesis file. the documentation shows extraData - RLP([32 bytes Vanity, List<Validators>, No Vote, Round=Int(0), 0 Seals]) in https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/IBFT/#minimum-number-of-validators . I'm not sure what it meant. also for the quickstart what does the extraData represents?

As far as I have checked looking at https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs#ethereum-protocol-releases, the new EIPs from London are all related to gas. Since we are not using it, I think it is not a problem to go with Berlin. Perhaps I am missing some important info, though.
Thank you for the answers

Based on Q/A above, I understood that I need to update my private net from constantinopleFixBlock to Berlin.
So, how exactly should I update the genesis file? 
Today, I have
"config": {
      ....
      "constantinopleFixBlock": 0,
      ......
}
After changing it, the new genesis file would be like this?
"config": {
      ....
      "constantinopleFixBlock": 0,
      "london": "####numer_of_the_first_block_using_london###",
      ......

You can run Besu and GoQuorum together, using Clique or QBFT. The quickstart by default runs either Besu nodes or GoQuorum, but it would be easy enough to modify it to have some of each. If you're using privacy, Besu can run GoQuorum compatible privacy https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Use-Privacy/Use-GoQuorum-compatible-privacy/#goquorum-compatible-private-transactions
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Nov 2021 03:58:40 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean by changing the asset name? GoQuorum will use ethereum as the platform but you can deploy your own stuff on top
</p>

There's a diagram here that might help https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/Clique/#extra-data
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 04 Nov 2021 04:02:06 GMT):<br/>
The extraData is slightly different depending on the consensus algo being used. But in all cases the main thing is the representation of the validators.

<p><strong>frankliawesome</strong> (Thu, 04 Nov 2021 05:43:36 GMT):<br/>
gotcha, in your use case it sounds like the only failing step is metamask interacting with the contract through Besu. I've given the url `chrome-extension://nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn` a go (adding it to my allowed cors-origin array) and I could use metamask as normal.
</p>
<p><strong>frankliawesome</strong> (Thu, 04 Nov 2021 05:45:16 GMT):<br/>
I'll get you to try this for me: spin up your quickstart nodes with 'rpc-http-cors-origins=["chrome-extension://nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn"]' in the config.toml file (or however you want to pass the option in) and make sure you can do something as simple as sending eth between two addresses with metamask.

OH it seems to be working now @frankliawesome , I'm not sure why last time it didn't work it seems that I needed to change the network first in Metamask instead of using the retry button when it is unable to connect. now I'm confused to how to allow truffle to deploy contract to the network since it also uses rpc http api. so, what client domain need to be used for the cors origin to allow truffle to deploy contracts?
</p>
<p><strong>frankliawesome</strong> (Thu, 04 Nov 2021 11:35:21 GMT):<br/>
I think truffle runs on a custom port on localhost, and this can be changed under `truffle-config.js`, so try something like `http://127.0.0.1:22000` replace the port with your actual port number?
</p>
<p><strong>frankliawesome</strong> (Thu, 04 Nov 2021 11:41:06 GMT):<br/>
Did you need the `chrome-extension://nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn` for metamask to work? @marchelbudi.k
</p>

What about Besu version? What is the most recent Besu version that you recommend to use in a permissioned network using IBFT2? I heard that your new permissioning layer prevents forwarding a transaction to other nodes when it is not allowed to be sent. Is it correct? I think it is very important!

For the genesis block the important information in the extra data is the list of the validators all other details have essentially empty values.

For blocks other the genesis block this extra data holds additional information that is required for the consensus mechanism. In addition to the current list of validators it contains the seals of the validators (list of signed block hash from the validators that committed the block), any votes and the round the block was created on. This article has some more details https://consensys.net/blog/enterprise-blockchain/scaling-consensus-for-enterprise-explaining-the-ibft-algorithm/

Hi @deathdealer007, I've checked and this is the right option. Could you please share the full command that you are executing? Maybe there is something wrong in the command.

Also if you could share the link to the docs page that you looked, I can take a look to see if anything is missing.

Last but not least, if you have already figure out what is wrong and want to help us improve our docs, a PR to https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs will be more than welcome!

I tried applying this to the quorum quickstart network and when I tried to add a node to the allow list in the Dapp it seems to have an error with a message of "could not add node <enode> was unable to be added. please try again later". and when I check the browser console it seems to have a metamask - RPC Error. The others for account and admin is working fine and only the node permissioning I am having issues with.

Hi, @frankliawesome so I find out something odd and if it is true the documentation might slightly misleading. when i allowed metamask to interact with the network with `chrome-extension://nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn` to the cors origin, any Dapp that uses web3 injected or relies on Metamask to connect to the network such as the pet shop Dapp will be able to interact with the network without the need to add the Dapp client domain to the cors origin, therefore it does not require for the client domain to be added to cors-origin to interact to metamask as metamask accepts any domain that intreracts with metamask . Im not sure if this is only for my case.

Hi all, after making change in config.toml, do I have to restart the node to sync up? I mean if I leave the node running, will it eventually sync up by itself with other nodes?

If you have made changes in your config file you should restart your node to pickup the updated config. AFAIK Besu only reads the config file during startup.

Regarding eth_sign, it is by design i.e. https://docs.ethsigner.consensys.net/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#eth_sign ... the input string is converted to ethereum specific signature and signed as: sign(keccak256("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n" + len(message) + message)))

Hi! When you start your Besu node, you need to ensure the RPC configuration is correctly set, exposing the port that you want, and listening in the correct interface.

Take a look at the `rpc-http-*` options in the docs to find what you could be missing. If you want to share the config file that you are using to start your node we can try to help identifying what could be missing.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 01:48:35 GMT):<br/>
There is also a note in our docs re using Besu with Metamask (how to configure the cors settings correctly). Take a look into it: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#rpc-http-cors-origins

Hello, I've deployed a private network using the IBFT 2.0 consensus protocol (Proof of Authority) following the article below: 
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/21.10.1/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-IBFT-Network/
Now I want to connect Metamask from another computer but port 8545 is only listening on 127.0.0.1. How can I open the port to be accessible from other computers? Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:41:25 GMT):<br/>
Hi!
You have to bind the HTTP interface to a public one in your instance. Take a look at the [rpc-http-host](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#rpc-http-host) flag
</p>
<p><strong>Luis_Manuel_Cortes_Tirado</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:46:50 GMT):<br/>
Then I have to stop the boot-node with CTRL+C and restart it including the --rpc-http-host=0.0.0.0 flag, right?
</p>
<p><strong>Luis_Manuel_Cortes_Tirado</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:50:28 GMT):<br/>
Only boot-node (Node-1) or all 4 Nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 13:10:26 GMT):<br/>
exactly, you have to restart it. You only need to do it in the node you want to connect externally
</p>
<p><strong>Luis_Manuel_Cortes_Tirado</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 13:12:01 GMT):<br/>
All right, thank you very much!

Hello. I've discovered IBFT2 has problem with scalability. I want to scale to about 1000 validators. Is it possible with any of Besu's algorithms? I found that there is a YAC algorithm in HL Iroha, that scales well. Are there perhaps any plan to implement it in Besu?
</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 01:35:13 GMT):<br/>
You are correct in that IBFT2 is not designed to work with such a large set of validators.
</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 01:35:15 GMT):<br/>
Why do you need such a large number of validators?
</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 01:36:16 GMT):<br/>
There are no plans to implement the YAC algorithm in Besu at the moment. Is the scaling of validator nodes in YAC the main reason for wanting YAC in Besu?

<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 01:38:13 GMT):<br/>
The only consensus mechanism in Besu that might work with such a large set of validators is Clique but then you have forks and give up finality and byzantine fault tolerance. So probably not something you would want to use in a production network. Mostly just mentioning it for completeness.

Hey, I am trying to invoke smart contract through web3js  in besu private IBFT network. I am using ethereumjs-tx dependency,  The problem is   when trying to invoke the contract it throwing error - 'Error in createRawTransaction Error: Chain with name 1337 not supported'

<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 06:34:58 GMT):<br/>
Hi! RLPx is used by default in permissioned networks.

The only exception is if you are using TLS for DevP2P. We recently introduced the option of using TLS for DevP2P connections. In this case, the RLPx encryption isn't needed anymore (because all packets are already encrypted by TLS).

More info: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Configure/TLS/P2P-TLS/
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 06:37:07 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure how your code looks like. It seems it is trying to map your chainId configuration to a network name (maybe one of the "standard" names like ropsten, rinkeby or mainnet).

I'd suggest double-checking your ethereumjs-tx initialization in your scripts.

If you want to share your scripts someone might be able to help spot what's going on.

_Downloaded 7800000 world state nodes. At least 13961106 nodes remaining.
Downloaded 7900000 world state nodes. At least 13879115 nodes remaining

Executing 'eth_blockNumber' returns the value before i restarted the node and right now is ~500 blocks behind and keep increasing. Can someone explain what exactly is going on and why chain height stays the same?

Thanks, I couldn't replicate this so it's likely something with your API call has gone wrong - this is what I've done:
</p>
<p><strong>frankliawesome</strong> (Fri, 12 Nov 2021 06:13:36 GMT):<br/>
1. Latest Besu master repo, built
2. Running from build/install/besu/bin/besu (should be the same as running a fresh Besu binary) with the command line arg config-file=config.toml (your file) and the public key is under root as well
3. Tested POST `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_listening","params":[],"id":53}` which is a auth protected route with your JWT, got the correct result, altered one character in the JWT, got unauthorized.

Hi 'frankliawesome`, I log the Authorization header on nginx proxy server and verified the jwt token in the log on jwt.io. The token's signature was verified successfully. It seems that something happened on besu server made the signature verification failed. the besu version is 21.10.0 which is the latest. What can go wrong with token verification on besu?

With IBFT2.0, is it possible to change blockreward and blocktime via "transitions" after the network has started?
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Sun, 14 Nov 2021 21:25:14 GMT):<br/>
There is a caution block in the documention: "The blockreward and miningbeneficiary properties cannot be updated once your network is started." Not sure if this is only in combination with miningbeneficiary or in general.
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Sun, 14 Nov 2021 21:55:56 GMT):<br/>
looks like it's working. Just tried with one signer node to change blocktime and reward.
</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Sun, 14 Nov 2021 22:26:10 GMT):<br/>
It is possible using transitions to change the block period and mining block reward. Changing the block period was only just added in the in the most recent of Besu 21.10.1.
</p>

That caution in the docs applies to either blockreward or miningbeneficary or in combination.

I should have clarified that blockrewards is also supported for transitions, documentation is coming soon for that we only just added that feature. So it is possible to change the validators, block period and block reward for IBFT2 and QBFT. Yes it isn't possible for change the mining beneficiary using a transition right now.

Just a suggestion to troubleshoot

There is nothing specific in Besu for interacting with your contracts. If you have [RPC enabled](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#rpc-http-enabled) you can use any 3rd party library to interact through JSON-RPC with your contract. E.g. [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/) and [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io)

Regarding on-chain permissioning for nodes/accounts: the howto is with predefined ingress contracts in the genesis file. Is it possible to start unpermissioned and then deploy onchain permissioning later? I.e. without predefined ingress contracts in genesis, but later regularly deployed?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 16 Nov 2021 21:14:01 GMT):<br/>
Yes. You can start the network without permissioning, deploy your contract, and then restart the nodes with permissioning enabled, using the deployed contract address.
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Tue, 16 Nov 2021 21:16:58 GMT):<br/>
If you are doing this, it is probably a good idea to start the network with a single node. After the contract and the rules are ready, you add more nodes to the network, and they will sync up the chain and start using the rules.
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Tue, 16 Nov 2021 21:18:17 GMT):<br/>
great.. thanks. I was afraid that the predefined ingress contract in the genesis file are mandatory.

Hi there, does Besu have a local transaction journal that can be recovered from the disk? I'm trying to determine if, like geth, there's a local journal that can be copied over when a node is being restored from another node's database backup
</p>
<p><strong>reddevil</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 10:53:49 GMT):<br/>
`geth` generates a `transactions.rlp`, which contains pending/queued txns submitted to the node and that file can be restored in lieu of resubmitting transactions after a node is restored using a manual recovery (for example, using backup from another node)

For IBFT2.0.. I assume since it's PBFT-like voting mechanism, the complexity for voting messages increases O(n^2)? what would be a good enough sweet spot in regard to complexity/performance vs decentralization? Something between 10 - 20 validators?

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 22:32:34 GMT):<br/>
Besu doesn't manage private keys.  EthSigner does and serves as an intemediary between your node and your client code.
</p>
<p><strong>Clippo 3</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 22:45:11 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=Ti32okpEyguNz4vgw) I don't get how i can use that , cause to use eth signer to do a v3vaultkey and what do u do with that cause it's only the private and a password , how can u do that with a deployed contract , cause the rawmethod of besu rpc-json only take one parameter to work.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 22:53:04 GMT):<br/>
The raw parameter is the fully signed transaction.  eth_signTransaction takes all those pieces, adds a signature from your private key, and generates the single parameter then feeds it into the same logic as eth_sendRawTransaction.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 22:53:42 GMT):<br/>
EthSigner does the same, but instead of seding it to an interlal method for eth_sendRawTransaction it sends that byte array to the besu node via eth_sendRawTransaction
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 23:16:13 GMT):<br/>
@Clippo 3 it might help to look at the web3js-quorum examples to see how they work - you can follow the examples to sign and send the tx https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/Client-Libraries/web3js-quorum/ - or you can run EthSigner alongside Besu and just send your eth_sendTransaction to EthSigner and it will sign and send to Besu.

Hi, we have a problem with our Besu nodes, they run out of space after a while, they consume a lot of disk space. I have read somewhere that with the use of Merklee Trees it is possible to solve this issue. I have not found anything in the documentation about this issue, is it possible with Hyperledger Besu to work with this technology?

Thanks

We have this problem also. Perhaps it's possible to produce only populated blocks, omitting empty ones. We're investigating this.
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Thu, 18 Nov 2021 13:29:53 GMT):<br/>
I don't know exactly the requirements behind blockscout in terms of services provided by the node. But if it barely needs a client to emit events for every block to put them into some indexed storage for their frontend, you can give it a try to sync a Besu node using the Bonsai data storage. You can read a little more about it in a [recent post](https://consensys.net/blog/news/bonsai-tries-a-big-update-for-small-state-storage-in-hyperledger-besu/) from the Consensys blog

Hi there! Quick question: is it possible to set the `blockperiodseconds` in IBFT 2.0 to a value smaller than <1 second? I tried doing so (I set it to 0.99, was 1 before) but based on what I observe I _think_ for values smaller than <1 second, or non-integers in general, Besu (latest release, 21.10.2) just uses a default value instead (but I don't see anything about this happening in the logs).

No, this is for an IBFT network (running in Kaleido). For Quorum, when there's a situation where chaindata in a node is unrecoverable due to errors, we restore the node by using a backup. We also restore the `transactions.rlp` that is copied out before restoring, to ensure that any locally submitted transactions get re-submitted on start up. In Besu, we recently ran into 
```
2021-11-15 19:19:38.244+00:00 | main | INFO  | DatabaseMetadata | Lookup database metadata file in data directory: /qdata/ethereum

org.rocksdb.RocksDBException: SST file is ahead of WALs
```
for which restoring the node from a backup or have it catch up all the way from the start is the solution

Besu is a good project for your first time time contribution. And there's a helpful bunch of documenters available to help should you get stuck :)

You mentioned that you've looked at the contribution docs? If you get stuck with any of the steps, give us a shout and we'll get you unstuck.

IBFT2 was able to safely handle up to 30 validators beyond that there was some performance degradation. So IBFT2 should be handle 10-20 validators without any issue.

Perhaps it's an election thing. So it's kinda normal. But let's wait for the experts' opinion
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 18:00:02 GMT):<br/>
Bootnodes != validators or miner nodes.

What consensus are you using? PoW, IBFT2?
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 18:00:49 GMT):<br/>
I suppose Clique.. Since they're 3 nodes
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 18:02:09 GMT):<br/>
Not sure we can deduce that but yes you are right, Clique is also an option.
So Clique, PoW (Eth) or IBFT2?

I hoped an easy way to access besu IBFT API would be to use goquorum and attach it to besu RPC port: `docker run --rm -it --name goquorum --network container:besu_node quorumengineering/quorum attach http://localhost:8545`. However, I can not see ibft or any other additional api being offered when calling `web3` on console.

Another question regarding mixing goquorum and besu in a IBFT2 network: can goquorum also handle transitions in the same way like besu can?
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Sat, 20 Nov 2021 06:59:16 GMT):<br/>
I just noticed the JSON RPC methods for ibft in goquroum and besu are called differently..

Is there a web wallet for Ethereum, other than MEW, that's open source?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Sun, 21 Nov 2021 20:12:31 GMT):<br/>
Could you clarify what do you mean by "handle transitions in the same way like besu can"? Are you talking about some specific feature re transactions? Or are you considering performance?
</p>
<p><strong>ivicaa</strong> (Sun, 21 Nov 2021 22:10:23 GMT):<br/>
@lucassaldanha besu can add transitions in the genesis file to reconfigure network parameters like blockrewards and blocktimes. If goquorum and besu ibft are compatible, are there similar transition mechanisms in goquorum like in besu?
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 22 Nov 2021 00:40:22 GMT):<br/>
Ah sorry, I believe I misread transition (I thought you were asking about transactions). My bad!
I'll ask someone from the GoQuorum team about this and get back to you.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=Big9qwBCL43mQEzd8) I started studying Besu a while ago.
There is very little Besu information in Korean, so it will be helpful for other Korean developers to translate while studying. I want contribute to all page.

GoQuorum does not support the notion of transitions. You can not 'fork' the network with a new Genesis, there is an exception to this. You can migrate from IBFT to QBFT at a specific block height (testQBFTBlock).

<p><strong>ArneGebert</strong> (Mon, 22 Nov 2021 13:53:16 GMT):<br/>
Is there a recommended way to do off-chain storage with Besu? As far as I understand, using private transactions essentially achieves off-chain storage but adds a lot of complexity due to also having to configure and deploy the Tessera nodes and due to needing to send private transactions. Are there other recommended alternatives if I don't need the privacy features?
</p>
<p><strong>Clippo 3</strong> (Mon, 22 Nov 2021 15:00:28 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>loziniak</strong> (Mon, 22 Nov 2021 15:02:20 GMT):<br/>
This is probably similar to off-chain storage in every other Ethereum client, so there's plenty documentation out there. IPFS seems to be very popular for the purpose.

Thanks, that is helpful :) Do you, or anyone, else know whether Tessera or IPFS will tend to give a better overall latency/performance (given that whatever we store off-chain, we also have to retrieve..)?

I think not. 
However, you can replace PoS with rewards using smart contracts. 
It is more flexible this way.

Hi - silly question. According to the documentation, ETH methods should be enabled by default? But when I try and execute sth like `new Web3(...).eth.getTransactionCount(....)` I get a method not enabled error. The address I pass into the `getTransactionCount` method is one of the account addresses registered in the genesis file (dev.json).
</p>

I think it's not meant for production  environments. Although perhaps there are usecases, when decentralization is not a requirement.
</p>
<p><strong>efrain</strong> (Sun, 28 Nov 2021 08:32:15 GMT):<br/>
I think so too. When we need a decentralized ethereum network, we should not use Kubernetes.
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Sun, 28 Nov 2021 11:39:21 GMT):<br/>
Technically it is decentralized. 
Administratively it is centralized. 
Blockchain persay is a decentralized technology. Nodes running the blockchain can be either:
1. public: anyone can operate a validating node. This model is also administratively decentralized. 
2. private: admins decide which validating nodes are added. This model is a blockchain but "permissioned" and controlled; hence administratively centralized.

<p><strong>gad0lim</strong> (Sun, 28 Nov 2021 18:57:26 GMT):<br/>
Does anybody have a good write up on pros and cons of running no gas private network vs setting up fees? Sth with lessons learned? I see setting fees as ability to limit network spam, e.g. I wonder how contract execution would stop if there is a bug and there is no gas. I would like to play with it in close VPN accessible network, so I am don't need to really be worried about huge number of malicious actors.  So maybe it's more practicality. Internally I could share eth via faucet (is there any open source faucet i could use spin for that purpose?).
</p>
<p><strong>gad0lim</strong> (Sun, 28 Nov 2021 18:59:04 GMT):<br/>
(also if I set gas, will miners be earning it and that's the only way to get it then. I will have couple addresses in genesis with inital balance).

<p><strong>gad0lim</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 00:19:03 GMT):<br/>
What's your reasoning going IBFT2 vs Clique? I kind of feel that the "delayed" finality with forks of Clique is closer to consensus protocols in main networks out there, so apps written will need to be more resilient and will be more transerable to other blockchains?

I think optimal for PoA is organizational centralization – hence the name consortium. There you have common policy and mutual trust, but each suborganization administers it's own node independently (own servers, passwords, admins, private keys etc.).

<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 13:16:32 GMT):<br/>
Anyway: with smart contracts: 
you create the network with 100% premined amount. 
You dedicated portion of the coins for rewards (instead of mining them). 
You create a smart contract that distributes rewards to users based on conditions you set: amount of staking, period length, operating a node..... whatever you want. 
This way it is way more flexible than the standard PoS mining.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu?msg=Poe85rPSqBDCidJXX) Not needed. 
Instead, you create smart contracts just like on Ethereum, and dedicated wallets for rewards. 
Think of it this way: What if you want to create a smart contract on Ethereum network to reward stakers with Ethereum (you won't do it but..) , you'd do this on your chain and own coin

Dears, we have a Prometheus/Grafana monitoring in our Besu permissioned network. We want to understand what ethstats can do that our existing monitoring cannot. As far as I understood, Ethstats  has the advantage of reading data from the http/rpc port of a node and, of course, extract info from the blockchain itself (transactions, balances etc). Is that the main difference?

For clique every "epoch" block (3000 by default) lists all validators in the extra data. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-225

For IBFT 2.0: :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone: Not a protocol I know the low level details of.

It can be done with genesis but not needed... So you don't fork.

In IBFT2, the validators are kept as a list in the Block Header's extra data field.

yep we did move orion binaries to cloudsmith. But also we've officially deprecated orion in favour of tessera (as of end of Nov ie today/tomorrow depending on your timezone). Is there a reason for building an old version of Besu or should I not ask??

yes i are building a old version due a issue in our mainnet, dev and test net are updated but with other issue that block are mined off time, the block need 4seconds and for some reasom mined before, so the new cliente validate this and can't import. https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/2797#issuecomment-976206735. but due a new issue we can update directly to production :) so we do a downgrade in all networks and later we will update all to new versions.

In a scenario that a validator node called A (that is not bootnode) is linked directly only to one bootnode and many other validators, what happen if the bootnode fails? Will the validator A also fails? Or will the validator A keep communicating with other validators as usual?
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 21:54:15 GMT):<br/>
Another question:
What happen if a validator node A (that is not bootnode) is linked to many bootnodes? Will the validator node A randomly choose one bootnode? Will the validator node interact with all bootnodes? Will it impact the performance of validator node A?
</p>
<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 22:44:54 GMT):<br/>
validator A should keep running peering with the other validators

</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 23:20:48 GMT):<br/>
Validator A will use all the bootnodes for initial peer discovery in this case. It will attempt to establish a peer connection and interact with all the listed bootnodes. There shouldn't be any performance impact on validator node A.
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 23:26:23 GMT):<br/>
Thank you, @jframe.  Will Validator A use the boots just in the initial peer discovery? Will validator A run discovery again and again periodically?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 23:26:24 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 23:33:50 GMT):<br/>
ethstats gives a view of the overall blockchain (many nodes, not just Besu, and not just your nodes if it's a public network), Besu metrics gives a view of the besu node itself.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:42:21 GMT):<br/>
discovery is triggered by "insufficient peers" ie if your peer count falls below the threshold

Dears, Besu natively inputs a lot of metrics to Prometheus. But supposing we want to include new metrics, e.g., what are the 5 more called smart contracts in a permissioned network? I imagine I can develop an additional software to extract this metric and input it in Prometheus, correct? Is there any ready template/sample code/docs for using as a reference to that?

@antonydenyer Interesting... 
And in all cases, there is no way to set gas at a fixed ETH price like 0.01 , is there?
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 16:49:31 GMT):<br/>
There is no gas price in GoQuorum - maybe in the distant future but not right now. What specific features in GoQuorum do you want to use with gas?
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 16:50:43 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I meant with Besu.. Gas price is set by max. blocksize and not with a defined Eth price.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 16:52:48 GMT):<br/>
Okay, so you if want a fixed gas price of 0.01 eth you should be able to set it and use a non proof of work consensus algorithm ie QBFT.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 16:54:24 GMT):<br/>
You will need to fund an account at genesis and use that as a 'faucet' for funds to do transactions
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 16:55:26 GMT):<br/>
This is news... Good news. 
We can set up a fixed gas fee network using ibft ?!
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 16:56:36 GMT):<br/>
yeah I think so (not 100% sure)
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>efrain</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 19:04:43 GMT):<br/>
Finally, there is some clarity about gas price in a goquorum network. I think they should put this in docs.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 11:18:28 GMT):<br/>
sounds like a file permissions issue - can you check the permissions for the user you're running the quickstart under - that user will need to have write permission to your file system
</p>
<p><strong>SergioTorres</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 12:36:58 GMT):<br/>
Yes... I execute this deployment with the only user of the host. If I deploy older versions of Besu it works... I don´t know what happend with the new release, but it doesn´t works

I have not yet tried this. Not sure how to set a fixed gas price...
</p>
<p><strong>efrain</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 11:45:20 GMT):<br/>
In docker-compose.yaml file I have set `--min-gas-price=400000` and started the network.

I can verify that some gas fee is needed to execute a transaction and the gas fee is deposited to the validator's address.  
When I kept 0 as gas price in metamask, the network keeps the Transaction pending for a long time. 
The transaction gets accepted when I set the gas price as non-zero. Even if the gas price is just 1. But I have set `--min-gas-price=400000` and I thought such transactions would fail.

@efrain The min-gas-price does not set the actual price of gas, but the minimum possible. Gas changes based on the size of the transaction. This is where the gas-limit comes into place. 
So I am not sure if we can set a defined foxed gas price.... Or not yet at least.
</p>
<p><strong>efrain</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:03:15 GMT):<br/>
@shadiayoub 
I understand that `min-gas-price=400000` sets a lower limit on the gas price. So, it should not allow the Tx when the client (metamask in my case) sets the gas price at less than 400000 gwei. But the Tx gets through. 

Is the `--min-gas-price` value to be specified in units of gwei, wei or ETH? I assumed it is gwei.

I understand that `min-gas-price=400000` sets a lower limit on the gas price. So, it should not allow the Tx when the client (metamask in my case) sets the gas price at less than 400000. But the Tx gets through.

What is the unit for `min-gas-price` -  wei, gwei or ETH? I assumed it is gwei.

I dont want to set a fixed gas price. Even if I can set a minimum price, that is sufficient for my purpose.
</p>
<p><strong>efrain</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 13:24:28 GMT):<br/>
From experimenting I found that the unit for `min-gas-price` is `wei`. The docs are not clear on this https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#min-gas-price
 
@madelinemurray Can you raise a ticket to include this info in the docs?

Hello Clippo. Besu doesn't support handling user keys/wallets, you may want to use EthSigner if you really need to use `eth_sendTransaction` or sign your transactions on your client to prepare them for `eth_sendRawTransaction`. You may fin more info [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Account-Management/)

<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 21:40:07 GMT):<br/>
Safe-wise I guess no problem. 
For example when we get a full Ethereum node on Google cloud this is what they do. They copy the data to a new disk, and then the new node takes it from there.

It's said that ibft2 is not scalable to large networks. 
What's the definition if 'large'?
</p>
<p><strong>efrain</strong> (Sat, 04 Dec 2021 17:49:39 GMT):<br/>
I want to run a node using Besu with IBFT2 consensus. This node should not receive transaction fees but there are other validator nodes which do receive the fees. This node should have the full data of the blockchain and RPC endpoint. Is it possible to run a non-validator node?
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Sat, 04 Dec 2021 18:40:25 GMT):<br/>
How do nodes get fees? 
I thought we can set one beneficiary address in genesis.
</p>
<p><strong>efrain</strong> (Sat, 04 Dec 2021 19:20:28 GMT):<br/>
Validator nodes get the transaction fees. The configuration for this is not to be done in genesis file. While starting the nodes with `besu` command we have to include the command line option  `--min-gas-price=1000000` or any non-zero value. Then when a transaction happens in the network, the addresses of the validator nodes  get the fees.

This largely depends on the network config and the contracts that are in play, but about 30 is safe. If all the nodes are using private address for example in a VPC the latency is a lot quicker, than by going via the public internet
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Sun, 05 Dec 2021 23:35:21 GMT):<br/>
Hi @SuzanaMaranhao I think the closest thing we have is the plugins interface and you can develop custom plugin to do this https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Plugins/ In this case the smart contracts & txns and build off that? Tessera has something along these lines though (API metrics) that you could also use as sample code

How can we use mining in ibft ?
And can it be for a limited supply?
</p>
<p><strong>madelinemurray</strong> (Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:43:54 GMT):<br/>
Adding some additional info here - the comment about large refers to the number of validators in the network not the total number of nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>joshuafernandes</strong> (Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:48:10 GMT):<br/>
Thank you Madeline :) yes, should have clarified that. You can have n nodes (non validators) and the comment above is for validators only
</p>
<p><strong>jframe</strong> (Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:48:36 GMT):<br/>
In ibft2 there is no mining as such. But you can reward the validator the proposes the block by setting the miningbeneficiary and a blockreward in the ibft2 configuration https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/IBFT/#genesis-file

How to increase throughput? I am getting a lot lesser throughput (around 400-500) before applying RPC max active connection (default was 80). After applying this configuration the throughput increased, but sometimes more transaction is causing the network to get stuck. I am using docker to run the besu network in AWS, and the network is gas free

@shemnon - you said "Check gas costs on sloads on a repeated slot read in the same tx.
Or submit a "type 1" or EIP2930 transaction with an access list.""

What is the best way to do this? I was trying to debug a transaction using Remix and analyzing the "step details". Is it the way to go? What do you recommend?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 15:33:07 GMT):<br/>
sload costs changed in general, so any transaction when run through a simulator with the same state should hve the same gas cost.  Just compare the costs at the end.  But a type 1 transaction is the quickest to verify, but not many wallets support it.
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 16:15:02 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon I am trying to understand your comment. I think I need to understand some points before it. I do not have experience with low-level ethereum code:
1) Is the Remix debug a simulator to test the gas cost?
2) I think you are referring to EIP-2929, which seems to change the gas cost of SLOAD to 2100. Is it the case? 
3) As far as I understood from EIP-2929, I need to check different uses of SLOAD in the same function, correct? Because now you said to look at the cost at the end.... 
4) Do you have an example of wallet that supports type 1 transaction? Do you have a link to this?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 16:15:53 GMT):<br/>
1-3 yes, verify the simulated gas cost matches the receipt from your network.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 16:16:19 GMT):<br/>
4, no, I don't know of a wallet that does type 1, they all went straight to type2/london/eip1559
</p>
<p><strong>SuzanaMaranhao</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 16:17:47 GMT):<br/>
If "the simulator gas cost matches the receipt" it means that the fork happened?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 16:26:44 GMT):<br/>
yes

<p><strong>matt.nelson.csi</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 20:23:16 GMT):<br/>
A zero-day vulnerability has been published in log4j, which is used by Besu.
We released 21.10.3 which includes a patch: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/21.10.3
All users should upgrade immediately or manually mitigate.

Manual mitigation can be done by running Besu with this additional flag “‐Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=True”
Note that this may impact the behaviour of your system’s logging if it relies on Lookups for message formatting.
</p>
<p><strong>matt.nelson.csi</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 21:00:07 GMT):<br/>
Hi all - with regards to the above message - please hold off on updating for now and apply the manual mitigation as necessary. We are testing this release more carefully to see if there are any other issues
</p>
<p><strong>Koen84</strong> (Sat, 11 Dec 2021 00:38:26 GMT):<br/>
Confirmed as fixed

Hello all... How can I trace down the reason no blocks are being produced? 
It's a new network from scratch. Peers show as connected. Logs don't show complains.

Hello all... How can I trace down the reason no blocks are being produced? 
It's a new network from scratch. Peers show as connected. Logs don't show complains.
Edit: Answer is: because I created a network with 15 validators, so from extradata it is expected to have at least 2/3 of these 15 validators operational. 
I had only 4 running so no blocks were validated. 
Solution: operate 10 validators at least for this network, or create a network with 4-6 validators and operate 2/3 minimum.

Hi! Excited to be part of the group.

I have a question. We are considering the use of Hyperledger but not sure which "version" to use. We believe that BESU may be the best option given our goals. That being said, can someone tell me the following:
1) Does BESU have the ability to leverage Hyperledger functionality on a private network (nodes) and interact with the Ethereum (ETH) Main Net, when necessary? For example, we would have a private ecosystem that facilitates transactions amongst users but leverages an ERC-20 token. That would require calls to ETH main net for balances or transfers but the remaining transactions would be private within our ecosystem. Is this possible with BESU?

Hey! Sounds like Besu suits your use case perfectly - it's our mainnet client with privacy and permissioning features. I recommend having a read through the docs here https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/ and maybe give the quickstart a go, let us know if you have any questions.
</p>
<p><strong>frankliawesome</strong> (Sun, 12 Dec 2021 23:58:16 GMT):<br/>
Teku is our ETH2.0 client that can be run alongside with Besu https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 13 Dec 2021 04:17:26 GMT):<br/>

If you can supply the smart contract and complete js script you're using to call it, that would help us in reproducing the problem. Also version of Besu and any other environment info. If you create an issue in github there's a template which has prompts for various info which helps us. Thanks!

Besu doesn't support eth_sendTransaction https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Account-Management/
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 13 Dec 2021 04:29:13 GMT):<br/>
You can either sign the transaction yourself - see https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3js-quorum `generateAndSendRawTransaction` OR run ethsigner alongside besu - you can send eth_sendTransaction to ethsigner and it signs and sends tx to besu

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 13 Dec 2021 19:50:19 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  Use 21.10.3 or later.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 13 Dec 2021 19:50:58 GMT):<br/>
(21.10.3 is the latest at the moment.)

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 13 Dec 2021 20:39:33 GMT):<br/>
When I say "yes" I mean it has the vulnerable Log4J version.  It can be mitigated also with command line flags, or a custom log4j file.
</p>

privateFrom (when you're sending a private transaction) has to match the Tessera public key you have configured. Besu points to Tessera using privacy-url and the keys need to match

Hello everyone.
I would like to know if besu persists a list of nodes it's connected to? in case it falls, it can reconnect with these nodes.

for example: I'm connected to node B from discovery and I'm also connected to bootnode C. If my node goes down, when I get up, I'll connect directly to node B or I'll connect to node C and use discovery to find the B

Hi, i'm running Besu(21.10.2) on Ethereum mainnet in fast sync mode, so far it reached chain height=13,754,413 and it is not importing any blocks for past several days. In log there are messages like:

EthScheduler-Services-7 (requestCompleteTask) | INFO  | CompleteTaskStep | Downloaded 396900000 world state nodes. At least 34650350 nodes remaining. 
CPU (4vCPU machine) is around 70%, disk is around 65% full (520GB).
I have difficulties to understand what exactly its going on, is it working, is it stuck or else?

I'm have tried geth attach http://localhost:8545/ but i'm unable to send transaction from the account i imported from the instructions via the CLI. Manually clicking it on metalmask works will allow the transaction to go through.

Where can i find the ipc file that the network has started? Am i heading in the right direction?

We have just release besu 21.10.5 (https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/21.10.5). This upgrades log4j to version 2.17 to patch the third critical vulnerability in a fortnight. Although from the limited information we have about this new issue it seems that besu is not affected.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 19 Dec 2021 23:35:09 GMT):<br/>
My first guess is that now that you have more validators, you need 2/3 validators to vote

<p><strong>siladu</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:34:49 GMT):<br/>
Not exactly sure how the situation occurred. You can bypass the voting and reset the list of validators with a transition though: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Consensus-Protocols/Add-Validators/#adding-and-removing-validators-without-voting
</p>
<p><strong>lucassaldanha</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 02:29:25 GMT):<br/>
Sending transactions to besu won't work in the same way as geth because Besu does not has wallet capabilities. Take a look at https://docs.ethsigner.consensys.net/en/stable/
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 02:48:07 GMT):<br/>
Once it gets a pivot block, fast sync has a stage where it has to download the world state before it will progress. During this stage, no blocks are imported. It can take several days since the world state is quite large
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 02:50:21 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing you're using the quickstart? https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Developer-Quickstart/#add-a-new-node-to-the-network
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 02:51:30 GMT):<br/>
The short answer: no. Besu does not persist connections. It will start again with any configured bootnodes/static-nodes

i am researching out for gaming on besu using ERC1155
can you help me!
</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 23:40:31 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, the besu config.tom used to use * to allow any connection. Today a trusted domain name is added with host-allowlist=["my-domain.com"] and host-cors-original = ["https://my-domain.com"]. Here "my-domain.com" is the domain name for the physical server where 4 besu nodes are running. However there is error of "Host Not Authorized"
</p>
<p><strong>EmcLab</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 23:41:02 GMT):<br/>
Connection mainchain error  [Error: bad response (status=403, headers={"date":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 23:17:55 GMT","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","content-length":"34","server":"nginx/1.21.4","connection":"keep-alive"}, body="{\"message\":\"Host not authorized.\"}", requestBody="{\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":42,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\"}", requestMethod="POST", url="https://my-domain.com", code=SERVER_ERROR, version=web/5.5.0)]

The node has token authorization enabled and it was working before.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:20:46 GMT):<br/>
that doesn't look like a besu error
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:25:57 GMT):<br/>
so it was working when you had * but when you put the host name into host-allowlist and rpc-http-cors-origins it doesn't work?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:26:15 GMT):<br/>
I would recommend changing one at a time to try and narrow it down
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 04:26:43 GMT):<br/>
could it be the host is http not https? could it be a dns issue?

Hey y'all
</p>
<p><strong>Clippo 3</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:30:39 GMT):<br/>
How i connect a node to my besu network from another computer
</p>
<p><strong>Clippo 3</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:30:48 GMT):<br/>
I was reading the docs but i got lost
</p>
<p><strong>Clippo 3</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:31:00 GMT):<br/>
Like i want to add another validator
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:35:53 GMT):<br/>
Follow the step of adding the second node. But replace 127.0.0.1 with your first node's ip address in the enode address. 
You can ask if you need more details.
</p>
<p><strong>Clippo 3</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:37:59 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for answering so i need to use this?
</p>
<p><strong>Clippo 3</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:38:00 GMT):<br/>
besu --data-path=data --genesis-file=../cliqueGenesis.json --permissions-nodes-config-file-enabled --permissions-accounts-config-file-enabled --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=ADMIN,ETH,NET,PERM,CLIQUE --host-allowlist="*" --rpc-http-cors-origins="*" --p2p-port=30304 --rpc-http-port=8546
</p>
<p><strong>Clippo 3</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:39:02 GMT):<br/>
Or this besu --data-path=data --genesis-file=../cliqueGenesis.json --bootnodes=<Node-1 Enode URL> --network-id 123 --p2p-port=30304 --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=ETH,NET,CLIQUE --host-allowlist="*" --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" --rpc-http-port=8546
</p>
<p><strong>Clippo 3</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:39:25 GMT):<br/>
But mi question is that the other computer needs the genesis file?
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:40:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes. 
Each computer needs a genesis 
In fact, each node does. But nodes on a single computer can share the genesis file for ease. 
Copy the contents of genesis file to the new node
</p>
<p><strong>Clippo 3</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:41:01 GMT):<br/>
Thanks very much
</p>
<p><strong>Clippo 3</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:41:11 GMT):<br/>
I appreciate it now i understand it
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:42:31 GMT):<br/>
Same goes for permissions and static-nodes files.  But those two do not have to be the same on all nodes. 
Genesis does.
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:45:51 GMT):<br/>
It's worth mentioning that on the computer you can leave out specifying the ports.. i.e. 8546 and 30304 
Since it will use the default ports 8545 and 30303 without conflicts. 
In the tutorial however, nodes are on the same machine, therefore we have to specify different ports for additional nodes.

Hi, I've added world state completed and pending requests to our grafana dashboard, pending requests looks strange with spikes i don't understand, is this normal behaviour or this indicate some problem?

@JiriPeinlich is this normal behavior for fast sync? I would think it looks ok but you have more knowledge of this area!

Gas price for the network you mean I guess. 
This attribute in Genesis cannot be changed after running the network, as mentioned in the docs.
</p>

Hi all, I saw in one of the documentation today that ether transfer cannot be private. I was wondering if it is only limited to ether or other custom ERC20 tokens. Also if ether transfer cannot be private does private transaction pays gas?

In dockerized world it is quite hard to overwrite --entrypoint with parameter. I would rather try to give config via environment variable eg. docker run  hyperledger/besu:latest -e BESU_CONFIG_FILE=/config.toml ( if file is on your localfs you need to map it as well)

Thanks, number of pending requests dropped to zero and chain height moved to head of chain and  I thought things will 'stabilize'  but after some time client entered again in this mode with huge number of pending requests and increasing number of blocks behind. Is this also normal behaviour and is there any meaning to anticipate when it will finish?

</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 10:58:44 GMT):<br/>
Private transactions can still pay gas. You can configure the network to be zero gas (free gas) or non-zero gas - more info here - https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/FreeGas/#configuring-free-gas-in-hyperledger-besu

Thanks for answer, what i don't understand is how to interpret this, i've been running this client for almost 2 months and this `behaviour` just keeps repeating, meaning at some point block behind eventually will reach zero but afterwards it will start to increase (reaching 10K, 20K etc) which i guess it means my client is no longer in sync which is showstopper. Or, i'm missing something?

Hi everyone. Does anybody know whether there is a call to make a Besu node (in a permissioned setting) to try connecting to other peers? We have a permissioned dynamic connected blockchain (not static connections) and some nodes are less connected than expected. We could use addPeers, but it would be a static-connections-like solution. I could not find a call to make nodes dynamic discover and connect to other peers. Any thoughs? Thank you.

Currently, the algorithm for downloading world state is processing the world state tree close to almost breath first. That has the following consequences:
1) We need to store huge number of requests of state nodes that we still need to process in a cache
2) When we reset to a new pivot block, we need to rerun the algorithm from start.

There is a PR now in works that changes the algorithm to close to almost depth first search. After it will get merged into main you should see this behaviour to be improved.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:05:06 GMT):<br/>
There isn't a "start a discovery round" call but discovery does happen periodically, based on numbers of peers and peer thresholds. You can use the admin_addPeer to force a specific connection to be attempted but as you say this is point to point, not discovery.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:06:04 GMT):<br/>
Could it be an issue with your permissioning config? maybe a particular node is not on the list? Are you using onchain or offchain permissioning?

<p><strong>gladsjr</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:23:00 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your answer. Do you know how often this discovery round is and is it configurable?
</p>
<p><strong>gladsjr</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:24:29 GMT):<br/>
We use on chain permissioning. I'll take a look. Because there must be some root cause for the current situation...
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:42:28 GMT):<br/>
The frequency is not configurable. There is --max-peers as well as --remote-connections-limit-enabled and --remote-connections-max-percentage and also https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#random-peer-priority-enabled which I didn't even know about!
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:42:39 GMT):<br/>
Also consider using bootnodes if you aren't already
</p>
<p><strong>gladsjr</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:48:17 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the references. If the frequency is not configurable, what is its value?
</p>
<p><strong>gladsjr</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:50:30 GMT):<br/>
We are using boot nodes, indeed. Sorry, I did not get why bootnodes influence this question.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:58:10 GMT):<br/>
bootnodes might help because when a node starts up it always attempts to connect to its configured bootnodes. Similarly in onchain permissioning it is a fallback - if the node gets to zero peers it will try to connect to bootnodes
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 22:00:02 GMT):<br/>
As far as the frequency of peer discovery - I think it is more to do with whether the node thinks its peer table is full (max-peers) - if it doesn't have that many peers yet it will still be searching for peers using discovery. In a private network like you're describing this should be sufficient (on mainnet it's different because you don't want to be stuck with the same peers forever)
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 22:00:44 GMT):<br/>
so you should be able to see in the logs where the nodes are searching for peers
</p>
<p><strong>gladsjr</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 22:00:54 GMT):<br/>
Ah, ok. Got it! The network is very stable (I'm even considering seriously to make it static), so nodes coming in and out do not happen frequently.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 22:14:42 GMT):<br/>
that's why the static-nodes option exists! discovery is inherently messy
</p>
<p><strong>gladsjr</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 22:16:50 GMT):<br/>
Yeah! Now I see!... :tears:
</p>
<p><strong>gladsjr</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 22:18:46 GMT):<br/>
Well, does it still make sense using boot nodes in a static network???
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 22:24:55 GMT):<br/>
bootnodes are like static nodes if you're using discovery. So if you're using static nodes, you don't need discovery
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 22:25:22 GMT):<br/>
Does that make sense?

@gladsjr besu supports custom dns discovery configuration via genesis (custom config of eip1459 dns node discovery).  That is probably the best route to finding dynamic peers quickly and reliably.  If the nodes are going to join and drop regularly, you would likely need to create automation to create/update the DNS TEXT entries for each node.  See:

Hi, happy new year. Quick question: assume there is a malicious tx  storing unwanted data (e.g. illegal) on the ledger and we want the data removed, is there a way? Or modifying the peers and making a hard-fork is the only way?

I am not completely knowledgable about the topic, also I don't know what you mean by "we" in "we want the data removed" but if your client will consider some transactions invalid (for instance for legal reasons) than you will fork yourself into another chain that does not have those in the chain (lets call it "legal chain"). If you convinced the majority of the network to consider the transaction invalid, then that would then make everybody join the majority eventually, even the participants that don't care about the legality.
</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:17:52 GMT):<br/>
hi @JiriPeinlich thanks for the response. By "we" I am referring to the peers operators of a permissioned network. Assuming there is consensus that data from a tx should be removed from the ledger, are there other ways than modifying the source code of the peer?

</p>
<p><strong>JiriPeinlich</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:21:48 GMT):<br/>
Currently, the ledger is immutable. So, data cannot be removed without reordering the history. There might be in the future a day when we start dropping historical data from the memory of nodes. Currently, the only way I see is reorg using change of the source code of peers.

@macfarla , I was revising carefully the parameters (options) you said could be useful to examine. It called my attention that there is no a minimum connections option or something like that. Assuming this option does not exist, what is the threshold under which a node start a new discovery?

</p>
<p><strong>gladsjr</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 21:16:10 GMT):<br/>
Really? It does not look like that's what's happening in our network. Nodes have much less connections than the maximum.
</p>
<p><strong>gladsjr</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 21:16:58 GMT):<br/>
Maybe it's some kind of issue, since our nodes (the ones that belong to the company I work to) are having problems with permissioning.

Hello everyone.
I'm a newbie learning Besu and currently having two questions
They are mainly related to the characteristics of private transactions implemented in Besu blockchain with the application Tessera.
Question 1: Can a smart contract deployed as a private transaction be called by other smart contracts?
Question 2: Can the specific content of the smart contract deployed as the private transaction, including code and member variables, be accessed by other members of the blockchain?
Because, as far as I know, the  code of  smart contracts on ethereum is available, and also the values of all variables can be obtained through the methods provided in web3.
So I would like to know if private transactions can protect the content of smart contracts.

<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 03:42:25 GMT):<br/>
my meaning was: if peerCount < maxPeers, then that node will still attempt to find peers (discovery)
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 03:43:00 GMT):<br/>
whether it successfully finds peers depends on permissioning (and obviously how many peers are available)

yes if you deploy a smart contract to a privacy group, it can be called by other contracts (or directly via priv_call) that are deployed to the same privacy group. If you aren't part of that privacy group, you won't know about that contract - even if you somehow have its address, it would be like calling a contract that didn't exist ie no op.
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 12 Jan 2022 03:04:02 GMT):<br/>
if you look at the web3js-quorum examples, there are some that show this scenario. eg the multi node example has 3 nodes but only 2 are in the privacy group. when you try to "get the value" from node 3, it can't see it. This link is to the exact line of code but I recommend running the whole example so you can see it in action :) https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3js-quorum/blob/0ed71eff6b8e09f431889f018076222e7883373b/example/multiNodeExample/storeValueFromNode1.js#L100
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 12 Jan 2022 03:21:35 GMT):<br/>
If you want the return value of a function it's probably eth_call that you're after rather than the tx receipt https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Transactions/#eth_call-vs-eth_sendrawtransaction
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Wed, 12 Jan 2022 03:22:21 GMT):<br/>
Also working through some of the examples using web3js-quorum is probably useful https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3js-quorum

Welcome new members 🙂 Let us know if you've got any questions about getting started with Hyperledger Besu. The quickstart is a good place to start! Also we do have a few people away on leave or sick at the moment so response times might be a bit longer than usual - hoping everyone is safe and as well as can be!

<p><strong>loziniak</strong> (Wed, 12 Jan 2022 12:27:51 GMT):<br/>
Hi! I need to monitor mainnet activity for events from my smart contract. Is this possible to run Besu in a mode, when it doesn't store any blocks, just responds to 'latest'? What problems can it generate? Is 'latest' already confirmed with other peers? How to check if it's confirmed?

<p><strong>diegoll</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:35:23 GMT):<br/>
isn't this one of the use cases for Bonsai? If I understood it correctly, it stores all headers, but not all states (older states can be rebuild up to some number that I don't recall)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:35:29 GMT):<br/>
The problem with "latest" is re-orgs.  Bonsai tries get you close but we haven't put in older state pruning yet,.

hello guys,
I would like to know if you know any references about contracts in genesisfile. I even found a page on the besu website (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Contracts-in-Genesis/) but it says very little. I'm mainly interested in how this "storage" tag works. can you help me ?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Jan 2022 15:33:05 GMT):<br/>
Storage pre-populates the contract storage at genesis.  Originally this was implemented as an aid to reference tests but was exposed generally as it has utility.  When the genesis block is calculated the keys and values are stored in a merkle trie and the merkle root is calculated.  Hence the four principal parts of an account stored in the account trie (balance, code, nonce, and storage) can be pre-set at genesis.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Jan 2022 15:35:23 GMT):<br/>
So if, for example, you need to migrate an old chain to a new genesis but keep contract state you can extract all the storage keys (via debug_storageRangeAt rpc) and code and balance and even nonce and migrate to a fresh new chain.

Hi friends! I'm working on a write up to help people run the Besu-Teku client combo on Kintsugi and I'm running into an issue running Besu on that testnet.
I put all the relevant description in this Github gist. 

https://gist.github.com/luisnaranjo733/81f4d5396d3f93352f93f0c3e16b9f49

Is this the right place to reach out for support? I'm happy to file an issue or move over to Discord, just not sure what works best for the team. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:19:36 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I have the same question. Did you find an answer?
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:33:41 GMT):<br/>
Hello 
To connect to a remote node, just replace the 127.0.0.1 in the enode address to the IP of the remote node. 
In the tutorial, this is shown in adding second node. 
In this case you do not need to specify custom ports.
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:38:34 GMT):<br/>
Thank you very much. Let me try. So when I replace the 127.0.0.1 with the IP of the second node, I don't need to provide the ports(the bold line), right?

besu --data-path=data --genesis-file=../genesis.json --bootnodes=<Node-1 Enode URL> *--p2p-port=30304* --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=ETH,NET,IBFT --host-allowlist="*" --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" --rpc-http-port=8546
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:41:42 GMT):<br/>
إثس
--p2p-port=30304
--rpc-http-port=8546
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:41:42 GMT):<br/>
Yes 
--p2p-port=30304
--rpc-http-port=8546
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:43:09 GMT):<br/>
But to clarify: you don't need to specify the ports because you're on a different machine. 
If you run more than one node on one server then you will need to specify ports from the second node up.
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:45:07 GMT):<br/>
yes, makes sense. Thank you very much, I will try it now:):pray:

Hi, sorry for asking again, but I tried to replace the ip and it is still not connecting: 

2022-01-17 12:59:49.189+02:00 | EthScheduler-Timer-0 | INFO  | FullSyncTargetManager | No sync target, waiting for peers: 0

I tried multiple devices, IPs, even tried with both ading and removing ports but neither way works. Do you have idea what might be wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:18:15 GMT):<br/>
Show me the command you run on the second device please.. If you want, in a private message.
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:19:18 GMT):<br/>

Just to confirm: you're positive that the first node is actually running
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:24:57 GMT):<br/>
yes, I actually just restarted it. So the new enode is now : 
enode://0789c0cefaf14c7b736aca28bea4606ea7d47f92bb3026db3e64940d77fead4904b4eaea1a216948b25c7afe9b27c185dd48091c845a8b1a6ef9e6033c314dcf@127.0.0.1:30303

But yes it is working and giving this output:

<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:28:07 GMT):<br/>
Can you share the first node's command please ?
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:29:25 GMT):<br/>
yes sure:

<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:30:22 GMT):<br/>
Is it ibft or clique
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:30:59 GMT):<br/>
Basically on my 1st laptop I run this command in a directory called besu, where I have a privateNetworkGenesis.json and Node1 folder
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:31:03 GMT):<br/>
its EThash
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:31:12 GMT):<br/>
but I have tried everrything
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:32:08 GMT):<br/>
if it is easier for you I can try also clique or ibft
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:32:27 GMT):<br/>
OK.. 
Which documentation did you use.. Can you share the link please ?
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:32:43 GMT):<br/>
yes sure this one:
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-Private-Network/
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:39:56 GMT):<br/>
Checking 
I always setup ibft so I want to 'stare' in the docs a bit. 
But so far it looks fine. 
Do you have firewall enabled on the first node ?
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:41:58 GMT):<br/>
I can also try with ibft for me it doesn't matter. More important is understand how to connect them. About the firewall, I am not very sure. Let me check
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:43:35 GMT):<br/>
No, the firewall is turned off and it says that all connections are allowed
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:43:37 GMT):<br/>
Go IBFT and I am here fully for it.
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:43:48 GMT):<br/>
ok one sec I will do it now
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:44:22 GMT):<br/>
It has a different approach, as you must create the keys for the validators.
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:44:40 GMT):<br/>
I will follow this tutorial : https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-IBFT-Network/
</p>
<p><strong>shadiayoub</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:45:22 GMT):<br/>
Yes...
</p>
<p><strong>dakata</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:46:15 GMT):<br/>
I will text in on private message maybe it is easier

There is kuntsugi-specific chat over on discord for sure. But looking at your error `picocli.CommandLine$ParameterException: Unable to start mining without a coinbase.
` <- this means you have mining enabled --miner-enabled=true but you haven't set the --miner-coinbase
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 21:01:00 GMT):<br/>
yes it will be in the next RC release. I can't give an exact date for that - we're testing these changes on our canary nodes - but hopefully within a week or so

To connect to a remote node, just replace the 127.0.0.1 in the enode address to the IP of the remote node.
In the tutorial, this is shown in adding second node.

The problem was: he is setting Besu on two computers in the office, both behind an Internet router. 
This confused Besu and could not start. 
It worked when he concected the computers via local IP;s.

It looks like it will handle them in parallel, however it waits for them all before sending the response back to the client.

Hey guys, I was trying to run Besu with a config.toml file (besu --config-file=config.toml) and got this error. Does anyone how to fix it and why it occures?

<p><strong>siladu</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 11:53:16 GMT):<br/>
Looks like you've got a string value instead of a list of strings, e.g. you need something like: rpc-http-cors-origins=["*"] 

This property requires an array when using toml format. See 'Configuration file' example here:
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#rpc-http-cors-origins

<p><strong>prasanthdotv</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 12:13:13 GMT):<br/>
Yes. Warning is sill there. Even though node is running. Thanks

Do you mean the `WS_SECRET` for ethstats?. It can be set in the connection URL for the server. Take a look at the [ethstats](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#ethstats) value option format

AFAIK, the secret is defined by the ethstats server, it isn't specific to besu

Hi all, for the local permisioning for accounts, I understand that transaction that is received by a normal node will be propagated to validator node. I was wondering if the normal node have Account A in the permissioning list and validator node does not have Account A in the permissioning list, will the transaction created by Account A which is received by the normal node be completed?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 23 Jan 2022 00:57:56 GMT):<br/>
In short, the tx would be rejected by tx propagation, but if the normal node is producing blocks, a block containing that tx would be accepted. This scenario is explained here: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Limit-Access/Local-Permissioning/#account-allowlisting
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 23 Jan 2022 00:58:51 GMT):<br/>
However I guess you might be talking about IBFT2 specifically? In which case it's only the validators producing blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 23 Jan 2022 01:01:08 GMT):<br/>
I don't see any reason why not. At the protocol level the transactions would look the same
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 23 Jan 2022 01:02:50 GMT):<br/>
Also note we do recommend each node in the network has the same accounts allowlist. :)
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 23 Jan 2022 01:06:30 GMT):<br/>
the tricky thing here is getting the storage right. This might help https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/internals/layout_in_storage.html

That problem is unrelated. When you are up-to-date with the head, then a different part of the system takes over.

As you're already synced, you will not benefit from the update unless you would start your sync from scratch by deleting the local data. There is no need to start from scratch unless you would want to satisfy your curiosity.

Look in the genesis config files (https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/8bf078cd613a0b305de72d27d9ab0d776a00b606/config/src/main/resources) to see what the current version is for each chain.  For a private chain just make sure the desired EVM version is set in the genesis file (such as `"londonBlock":0`)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 06:57:48 GMT):<br/>
21.10.3 has support up to london.
</p>
<p><strong>errorfourten</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 07:20:40 GMT):<br/>
Does that mean that as long the block number is in the config file, I can assume that the EVM supports that version?

Question on OpenTelemetry integration There is a "resource_to_telemetry_conversion" setting inside the awsemf exporter that pulls a metric called "service.name" and it is set to "best-client" I see "best-client" is the default for the prometheus job name but I can't seem to change this AND use OpenTelemetry ...there anything I'm missing?

Hi everyone. Does someone know from which version the host-allowlist option was introduced in Besu? It seems that it was previously called host-whitelist, right?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 20:01:41 GMT):<br/>
20.10 or so.
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 20:02:07 GMT):<br/>
host-whitelist is still a supported option, it is just hidden since 20.10.1

Is it possible to remove transactions of the transaction pool? Does shutting down the node empty its transaction pool?
</p>
<p><strong>GarySchulte</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 23:40:26 GMT):<br/>
yes.  the Transactions may get re-gossip'd however

</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 26 Jan 2022 04:24:23 GMT):<br/>
There is no metric named service.name. Did you mean an attribute value?
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 26 Jan 2022 04:24:40 GMT):<br/>
I believe you mean "besu-client" not "best-client"
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 26 Jan 2022 04:25:06 GMT):<br/>
finally I don't quite follow what you mean by prometheus vs OpenTelemetry.
</p>
<p><strong>atoulme</strong> (Wed, 26 Jan 2022 04:25:23 GMT):<br/>
So please walk me back, slowly, from first principles. I'm not quite sure how to help you.

Hi, are there any tutorials on how to set up and deploy a Hyperledger Besu network with privacy group to the cloud?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 10:07:37 GMT):<br/>
You have both tutorials in the Besu doc, one is privacy, the other is cloud, you can probably pick the best of each.
- https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Privacy/Configuring-Privacy/
- https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Kubernetes/Overview/

<p><strong>kaijuneer</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 10:27:40 GMT):<br/>
Just to check my understanding, if I have a privacy group, does that mean anyone would be able to send transactions to a contract in that privacy group, however only the miners in the privacy group will have access to the state of the contract, and even the transactions sender will not be able to see other transactions other than their own?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 10:38:38 GMT):<br/>
Privacy group restricts who can interact with the contract in terms of Tessera nodes. So only private transactions from a node in the group can be made available to the group. No one outside the group can see the tx private part. The miner has nothing to do here (and we usually don't have miners as we require finality so an IBFT consensus and it only has validators, no miners).
Any member node of a group can read and send tx to the group it's part of. Look at the examples in
https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Groups/#besu-extended-privacy
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasMassart</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 10:41:39 GMT):<br/>
> Access between states
A contract in a privacy group:

- Can read or write to a contract in the same privacy group.
- Can read from the public state including public contracts.
- Cannot access contracts from a different privacy group.
- A public contract cannot access a private contract.
</p>

I see, thank you for the clarification. 

In such case, is there a way to configure Besu such that any users can submit transactions to the network, however it is a private network and only the nodes can see the transactions and maintain the state of the network? I apologise if this is a dumb question
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 11:46:45 GMT):<br/>
What's use case you're trying to solve?
</p>
<p><strong>kaijuneer</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 13:25:45 GMT):<br/>
I am creating a private registry that is maintained by a few independent nodes. Anyone could add items to the registry, however we would like to maintain privacy. Only the nodes would be able to see all the items in the registry.
</p>
<p><strong>antonydenyer</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 14:09:49 GMT):<br/>
No, you can not blindly send a transaction into a privacy group. This is by design. You could do it an application level.

Node A + Node X = Privacy Group A

Node X + Node Y + Node Z = Privacy Group Pool

When Node A submits to Node X using Privacy Group A only they know about it. Then at an applicaiton level Node A would need to submit a transaction to Privacy Group Pool which only Node X,Y,Z can see. 

The main thing to remember is that in besu private state is always consistent. There is a private state per group.

Hello. In my private chain I'd like to filter transactions based on type and source account. This should be done when receiving transactions through RPC, and when importing blocks from other nodes (anywhere else?). Also, I'd like to query smart contract data for configuration.

I think the best approach would be to expose relevant functionality in *Plugin API*. What are the points in code, where transaction verification is done, that I could plug into? Would Besu team be interested in such a contribution?

I can reproduce this behaviour on my local machine. I see you created an issue - thanks! https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/3338 - please note that this isn't a high priority for us right now especially as it is a --X "experimental" option. I would recommend creating a config file and run besu directly (without the launcher)
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Sun, 30 Jan 2022 21:56:03 GMT):<br/>
You could try `besu --network=dev` which uses dev.json that exists in besu repo - it's probably similar behaviour to what you're after - and you can copy that config and modify as you need.

different stuff - it is there to identify the node on the p2p network.  It doesn't have any bearing on the miner-coinbase.  If your node is producing blocks, you will need a miner-coinbase

What I want to create is a blockchain network similar to ethereum main net or matic network where computers can connect to the network using the internet and where they can then act as validator nodes or bootnodes etc. Please guide me how to achieve this. I would really appreciate any help from your side or anyone.

HI, i've updated to latest version few days ago, client reached the head of the chain and things are working fine for now....
I've noticed that CPU is bit higher than usual, not sure if that's problem per se

Hi Team , I have a question regarding the licensing of using Hyperledger for production use? Is there any Enterprise version exist for Besu or is there any cost of using Besu ?
</p>
<p><strong>RyanJJones10</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 03:23:47 GMT):<br/>
Hi @vsh1982, thank you for reaching out. There is no cost to using Besu in production. When you do, we'd love to hear any feedback you have.
</p>
<p><strong>RyanJJones10</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 03:24:54 GMT):<br/>
At ConsenSys we do offer Professional Services to help get you up and running at scale correctly and we also offer Support as an option to quickly fix any issues that might arise in production.
</p>
<p><strong>RyanJJones10</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 03:26:10 GMT):<br/>
With Support, comes additional products that make it easier to build and manage Besu based blockchains.

Hi @Avijeet_15, are you looking to actually create something like Mainnet and Polygon (Public Permissionless) or are you looking to make your own network that others can join but you have control of who joins as a node (Public Permissioned)?
</p>
<p><strong>RyanJJones10</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 03:39:42 GMT):<br/>
Here is some documentation around creating a permissioned network

Hi everyone. We`ve studied a lot on chain permissioning in Besu (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Permissioning/Getting-Started-Onchain-Permissioning/#7-clone-the-contracts-and-install-dependencies). 
However, we are not sure if it`s possible to write specific contracts for our network. It seems to be possible, but it`s not clear how to do it yet. Would you suggest some material about it, please

Hello Guys, I was reading the permissioning documentation at this link: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Permissioning/Getting-Started-Onchain-Permissioning/#7-clone-the-contracts-and-install-dependencies and I didn't understand the purpose of the storage in the genesis file. What this means?
</p>
<p><strong>isavelli</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 21:37:25 GMT):<br/>
Hello, I have a question: 
Can a (master) contract deploy another (child) contract, but with different privacy, e.g. with different flexible privacy groups or privateFor? My idea is to have a public contract that receives all transactions and then depending on some criteria creates different derived contracts to manage subsets of these transactions (e.g. for settlement purpose).
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 04:51:00 GMT):<br/>
A good place to start might be looking at the tests for the existing contracts https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts/tree/main/test and also the EEA spec (version 6) - basically Besu can talk to any contract that implements the spec. This is what's implemented by NodeIngress and AccountIngress contracts. https://entethalliance.org/technical-specifications/
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 04:56:00 GMT):<br/>
this sets the initial state for the contracts that are deployed in the genesis file

A contract can only deploy contracts in the same world state. We think that would be a pretty cool feature but it's not on our roadmap rn!

hello

I am struggling with the error of "Failed to import block to chain".
and I found this closed issue:  https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/2899

I am not sure if it is the same problem, my network is still running and this error only showed 2 times in the past week.
(running on AWS)

I want to identify if this problem also belongs to issue #2899, 
(then I can solve it with upgrade the version),
Or I have to do other research related to verifying the blockhash or something. 
(want to know what's meaning of the error message below)

I'm sorry that I couldn't provide more environmental information because I am very fresh in this field. 
If any advice that I can get to make a research direction, that will be really helpful. 
Thank you in advance.
