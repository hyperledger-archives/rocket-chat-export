He will have someone from TCF (Trusted Computing Framework- soon to be renamed) presenting as well. Our output will be a cross platform paper on Privacy put out by the Architecture Working Group. We have already put out papers on Consensus and Smart Contracts; we are working on Interoperability and Privacy and Confidentiality. We normally have sections that are more generic, stating the problem and then sections on the individual frameworks in Hyperledger on the topic, which call out the ways in which they have solved the problem and the differences in their approach. By doing this we also hope to make the Engineers look at ways in which others have solved the same problem and to get feedback from the community members on how to improve their solutions.","username":"VipinB","ts":"2019-09-07T00:32:29.457Z"}

Our IBFT implementation essentially starts with a MainNet spec and then swaps out the bits that are different, including the header validator which checks the block period.  `IbftProtocolSchedule` defines those changes.\n\nYou'd also need the `BlockTimer` which is used by the block creation process to know that the block period has changed.\n\nIf you find usages of `IbftConfigOptions.getBlockPeriodSeconds` you can follow things through fairly well.","username":"ajsutton","ts":"2019-10-07T21:41:01.080Z"}

When another node sees the PTM, it will try to process the tx.\n\nThings happen in this order:\n1. nodeA will distribute the transaction payload to nodeB\n2. nodeA will validate and execute the transaction.

Really the only way to tell is to do some tests with storing the data in the Ethereum world state and see if it works well enough for your specific use cases.  If you find you need to raise the block gas limit to extremely high values to store the amount of data you need that would also be a sign that ipfs/swarm would be worthwhile.","username":"ajsutton","ts":"2019-10-24T06:29:56.736Z"}

{"msg":"Hi I'm wondering if anyone has ever experienced truffle tests timing out when running against the clique consensus. I'm walking through the simple quickstart tutorial ( https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Quickstarts/Private-Network-Quickstart/ ). Everything works when using the default run.sh, and the truffle tests pass in seconds. However when I try `run.sh -c clique` the truffle tests time out:  `\"before all\" hook: prepare suite: Error: Timeout of 120000ms exceeded.` \nIs there anything else I need to do to get clique working?

My guess is that there is something in the before all hook in the solidity tests that's making multiple blockchain calls, and when the block period is 15s it takes more the 120s to complete them all. Setting a lower block period allows all these tasks to complete. Since tests will be running against a test network, I'll just lower the block period to 1 s.","username":"jacobsaur","ts":"2019-10-29T13:53:07.269Z"}

{"msg":"This is a problem with the Clique protocol itself so does apply to all clients. However, it becomes much more likely when there are a lot of out of turn blocks being produced. That in turn tends to happen if signers are either misbehaving (Geth and Besu both behave well in this regard) or if the time required to propagate blocks across the network is close to the block period time.  The one key difference between Geth and Besu which may help this happen less on Besu is that when there are two blocks with equal difficulty Geth will pick one randomly whereas Besu will stick with the first block received. That doesn't eliminate the issue but does mean that if a couple of signers have slower network connectivity and are producing out of turn blocks as a result, the other nodes are likely to have recieved the in-turn blocks first and will stick with them making it more likely the network will continue.

We just assume that there is a point in time after which the transmission latency is bounded.\nThis is is to make the protocol as generic as possible and not dependent on a specific implementation.\n\nHowever, Beau as all (or most) Ethereum clients, implements the network layer via gossiping in which case if you send your tx to an honest nodes, then this node will propagate the transaction to all other nodes.\n\nHaving said this, a very strong adversary may be able to mount an eclipse attack on an honest node, so sending the tx to more than one node increases the possibility that the transaction will be  eventually received by all honest nodes.\n\nIn conclusion, in most scenario sending a tx to only one node (if you know that that node is honest) will suffice, but if you are in an environment with high risk of attack I would suggest sending the tx to more than one  node. This applies not only to IBFT2, but to all protocols running on top of a gossiping protocol.\n","username":"robertosaltini","ts":"2019-12-06T23:27:33.115Z"}

{"msg":"We think we have an idea of whats going on in the setup, let me try and explain:\nIf you are starting your network fresh with the bootnode NOT being a validator, and only nodes 1-4 as validators, we have specific rules that allows nodes to talk to bootnodes as they are not aware of the permissioning rules. When you then try to add a node to the whitelist contracts, those blocks must be mined through the 2/3 of the validators accepting the blocks, because those validators arent on the whitelist, they cant talk to each other and therefore the whitelist never updated. So there are two ways around this that I can think of:\n1. Start the network with permissioning disabled, but the contracts still deployed. Add the nodes 1-4 to the whitelist (with permissioning disabled they will peer and validate the blocks). Then bring down all the nodes, turn permissioning on, and bring them back on.\n2. Start the network with permissioning on, with the Bootnode ALSO as a validator. Update the whitelist to include all the nodes, then use the IBFT remove validator APIs to remove the bootnode.","username":"arash009","ts":"2020-01-10T03:21:40.805Z"}

I've been testing out Besu/Orion, specifically around the privacy features and I had a general question about a scenario I was playing with. \nI was envisaging a scenario of minting a token with a new private smart contract, to a defined privacy group - but then having private transactions with this token with a smaller subset of participants having visibility than the broader privacy group.\nI understand that Orion (by design) doesn't allow making private transactions to a subset of the original privacy group, so would the general advice be to use Besu + something like AZTEC due to its ZKP features for this kind of use case?

{"msg":"Hi all, we have been receiving some feedback over the past little while around ease of use of Jira vs Github for raising issues. The community response points to Github being a more familiar tool, as well as general access being already available, making it a lower barrier to entry to log issues, view progress of work, and engage with other contributors to the project. Based on this, we are considering switching the repository of Besu tickets from Jira to Github. Are there other considerations or other feedback that we should think about? This topic will also be tabled at the next few Besu contributor calls for discussion as well.","username":"arash009","ts":"2020-02-10T02:08:50.119Z"}
{"msg":"The \"difficulty\" field specifies the difficulty of the genesis block.  When using fixed difficulty I think it has to be the same, but if you were using \"real\" ethash the difficulty would gradually adjust with each block to keep block times roughly consistent as available hash power changes.  In that case you'd want to ensure the initial difficulty is set to something reasonable for the amount of hash power you have - too high and you won't be able to mine new blocks, too low and it may take too long to adjust to a sensible value for that amount of hash power.","username":"ajsutton","ts":"2020-02-10T02:14:04.903Z"}
{"msg":"I would advise against fixed difficulty in anything other than a test environment.  Simply remove that line and difficulty will float as a function of time between blocks.

{"msg":"I believe this is how all ethereum clients will treat it.  We need to be able to replace mempry pool transactions on occasion.  i.e. transactions not mined.  Once case I had to deal with was when I set the gas price to zero and no miner would mine it but it had propagated to all the miner nodes.

Fast sync does not process transactions prior to the \"pivot block\" (the block which the world state is downloaded for).

{"msg":"It depends what you mean by \"trusted\".  For example, even if you did a full sync and processed every transaction, it's possible to be the victim of an eclipse attack where your peers feed you valid blocks which are not actually the canonical chain.  You can spot that easily if you verify the final block hash you reach with some other source to confirm you have reached consensus.\n\nWith fast sync, the chain of block hashes are fully verified which includes the hash of the state root.  It also includes the transaction hashes.  It does not check the proof of work solution for every block (to speed up importing it only checks a random sample of blocks) and it does not process transactions so can't verify that the new world state is the correct result from applying the transactions in the block.\n\nYou can however trust that the world state you downloaded is the correct state for the block because the state root hash matches.  You know that the ancestor blocks (and the transactions they contain) of the pivot block are correct because each block includes the hash of the parent.\n\nBut, just as with full sync, you can't know for sure that the block hash of the pivot block is correct.  Besu will confirm that multiple peers agree with that same block hash but it's impossible to fully prevent eclipse attacks.\n\nBottom line, however you sync, if you verify the pivot block hash with other sources you trust then you can be 100% confident that the entire chain and world state is correct.","username":"ajsutton","ts":"2020-03-19T03:21:22.362Z"}

Because when I try to create a ingress or loadbalancer service with both protocols appears the next error: \n\n\"Error: release besu failed: Service \"besu-validator1\" is invalid: spec.ports: Invalid value: []core.ServicePort{core.ServicePort{Name:\"json-rpc\", Protocol:\"TCP\", Port:8545, TargetPort:intstr.IntOrString{Type:1, IntVal:0, StrVal:\"json-rpc\"}, NodePort:0}, core.ServicePort{Name:\"ws\", Protocol:\"TCP\", Port:8546, TargetPort:intstr.IntOrString{Type:1, IntVal:0, StrVal:\"ws\"}, NodePort:0}, core.ServicePort{Name:\"graphql\", Protocol:\"TCP\", Port:8547, TargetPort:intstr.IntOrString{Type:1, IntVal:0, StrVal:\"graphql\"}, NodePort:0}, core.ServicePort{Name:\"rlpx\", Protocol:\"TCP\", Port:30303, TargetPort:intstr.IntOrString{Type:1, IntVal:0, StrVal:\"rlpx\"}, NodePort:0}, core.ServicePort{Name:\"discovery\", Protocol:\"UDP\", Port:30303, TargetPort:intstr.IntOrString{Type:1, IntVal:0, StrVal:\"discovery\"}, NodePort:0}}: cannot create an external load balancer with mix protocols\"\n\nThanks in advance","username":"arunog","ts":"2020-03-27T17:31:27.833Z"}

Stop Besu and update the config with the correct account and node permissioning contract addresses (https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#permissions-accounts-contract-address and https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#permissions-nodes-contract-address).\n\n4.

{"msg":"Hi every one, we are having an issue getting all the events emitted by a Solidity Smart Contract, in a private chain which currently have 11856000 blocks. \nOur node works with Besu v1.3.6 \n\nThe problem is that the response time is too long, when we filter fromBlock: “0x0”. I dont know if there is any solution to this or something we can configure on our node.\n\nWe try to get these events with the help of web3js (v1.2.1) in a similar way to this:\n\nlet contract = web3.eth.Contract(myContract.abi, this.myContractAddressr)\ncontract.events.myEvent({ fromBlock: 0 }, callback);\nhttps://github.com/TribalyteTechnologies/quorum-websockets-example/blob/master/eventListener.js\n\nThis works fine for us to get the events emitted after the subscription, but the previous events (from the block 0) are not listed. On others networks (Quorum, ganache) we get the performance expected, where all the previous events are listed.\n\nWe also try to get the expected response from inside the node with:\n\ncurl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":5,\"method\":\"eth_getLogs\",\"params\":[{\"fromBlock\":\"0x0\",\"topics\":[\"0x187688f6f8bbd0d48b66ed106a5d61d42f9b889d36a5bfe0ecdd056b139ebd8b\"],\"address\":\"0x92c1cce3d02fce1b813824f77046d597980285e3\"}]}' localhost:4545\n\nBut we dont even get a response, with later versions of besu (v1.4.4) we get the expected result after 30 MINUTES.\n\nSimilar issues have been reported, the pegasys team raised a ticket and studied it. We want to know if it possible to reduce the response time.\nTicke and investigation: \nticket: https://pegasys1.atlassian.net/browse/PAN-3219\nissue: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-64","username":"rdemera","ts":"2020-06-09T13:36:02.716Z"}

{"msg":"Thanks for responding. I have another question for clarification. When a transaction is received by a besu node in a permissioned network, it firstly goes through the ingress contract, then the account/node rule contract and finally through the application contract? or is it first received by the application contract which then sends it through the ingress contract?","username":"poojagupta23","ts":"2020-08-10T06:38:52.538Z"}
{"msg":"Yes, the current implementation of the permissioning smart contracts use a static ingress contract that does not change to then call out to specific node/account contracts that can be changed over time. These contracts then respond to specific methods to Besu that determines if a transaction or connection is allowed or not.

{"msg":"Hi Besu devs, I am a newbie to Besu and blockchain in general. A couple of questions/design suggestions I need your advice on:\n\nWe want to create a dapp on top of Besu with focus on privacy in the chain. Our system needs to have a UI, smart contracts that will be called from the UI, backend to generate signatures and a caching layer that caches the blockchain transactions.\n\nOur initial version was built on top of Quorum (without privacy) and the caching layer loops through the transactions in the chain and caches it in a DB. Now we wnat to add privacy to the data in the chain.\n\n1. Correct my understanding if I am wrong: I can call eea_sendRawTransaction to send the transaction payload and the group ID to besu, which stores it in Orion and distributes it to the orion nodes of the participants that are involved in the private transaction. \n2. For us, there are no participants or a consortium, but just different users in the system having different permissions. So for every combination of permission set I need to have, I should be creating a separate privacy group right?\n3. If the above is true, I should also be deploying separate besu and orion nodes for each unique permission set I have (multiple users in our system can have the same permission set). I am ignoring multi-tenency because we need to use onchain privacy groups since group members will be modified over time\n4. Now the crux: how do we make the caching system work? If the system reads the transactions in the chain, it only gets the marker transactions. So there is no way to get the private transaction from the marker? Or is there a way to read the private transactions from orion given the enclave key/private transaction hash? \n5. Another requirement is to add validations to the private transactions in the chain? Our existing solution validates it in the contract (which the UI will send the data to) and writes it to the chain if valid. But in besu privacy mode, we cannot add validations before we write to Orion. So this means we need to add the validation in the private transaction processor (I am assuming that it will be a smart contract in itself, but then I am not sure what is a precompiled contract then! Maybe we can add the validation in the precompiled contract and update the private world state only if the transaction is valid?)","username":"RamkumarVenkataraman","ts":"2020-08-29T12:11:47.572Z"}

Our system needs to have a UI, smart contracts that will be called from the UI, backend to generate signatures and a caching layer that caches the blockchain transactions.\n\nOur initial version was built on top of Quorum (without privacy) and the caching layer loops through the transactions in the chain and caches it in a DB. Now we want to add privacy to the data in the chain.\n\n1. Correct my understanding if I am wrong: I can call eea_sendRawTransaction to send the transaction payload and the group ID to besu, which stores it in Orion and distributes it to the orion nodes of the participants that are involved in the private transaction. \n2. For us, there are no participants or a consortium, but just different users in the system having different permissions. So for every combination of permission set I need to have, I should be creating a separate privacy group right?\n3. If the above is true, I should also be deploying separate besu and orion nodes for each unique permission set I have (multiple users in our system can have the same permission set). I am ignoring multi-tenency because we need to use onchain privacy groups since group members will be modified over time\n4. Now the crux: how do we make the caching system work? If the system reads the transactions in the chain, it only gets the marker transactions. So there is no way to get the private transaction from the marker? Or is there a way to read the private transactions from orion given the enclave key/private transaction hash? \n5. Another requirement is to add validations to the private transactions in the chain? Our existing solution validates it in the contract (which the UI will send the data to) and writes it to the chain if valid. But in besu privacy mode, we cannot add validations before we write to Orion. So this means we need to add the validation in the private transaction processor (I am assuming that it will be a smart contract in itself, but then I am not sure what is a precompiled contract then! Maybe we can add the validation in the precompiled contract and update the private world state only if the transaction is valid?)","username":"RamkumarVenkataraman","ts":"2020-08-29T12:11:47.572Z"}

{"msg":"4. You can read the private transaction from Orion using the payloadKey. However, you'd need to have some kind of protection layer to ensure that only participants allowed to read the transaction can call the api (maybe mapping your concept of users to Orion keys). Besu also exposes an api for reading private transactions, assuming the node is a participant (priv_getPrivateTransaction and priv_getTransactionReceipt). So your caching layer could use those apis. Just be aware that once the caching layer reads the information, it needs to ensure only the right participants have access to it.","username":"lucassaldanha","ts":"2020-08-30T22:21:04.853Z"}
{"msg":"5. I'm not sure if I understood this part. You want to validate a private transaction based on what? If you have a smart contract that does the validation for you, you can deploy the contract in the privacy group and use the same logic. You'll need to deploy one validator contract per privacy group because there is no shared information between privacy groups.\n\nAlso, if you need some sort of global information for validation (that applies to all groups), you can have the information in a public smart contract, and your private validator contract can read that information (private contracts can read information from the public state).","username":"lucassaldanha","ts":"2020-08-30T22:21:15.686Z"}

{"msg":"1 and 2. Privacy groups members are identified by their Orion public key, it doesn't really matter the number of nodes in the network. Although in most use cases you might have a pair of Besu and Orion nodes per participant, it is possible to have multiple participants using the same node (with Multi-tenancy this is quite common). I remember that you mentioned that you aren't considering multi-tenancy because you want to use flexible privacy groups. However, depending on your timeline, you might be ok. We are planning to release support for multi-tenancy for flexible privacy groups in our 1.6 version (should be released in a month or so).","username":"lucassaldanha","ts":"2020-08-31T23:01:36.984Z"}

{"msg":"4. Yep, this workflow is correct. You won't need to call Orion directly, I believe that prig_getPrivateTransaction will get the original private transaction from Orion for you.

{"msg":"5. Let me try to explaing my thinking here. There are two different concepts here. A valid transaction at the protocol level isn't the same as a valid transaction based on some business logic rules. Upon receiving a \"protocol valid\" private tx (e.g. correct RLP, signature, etc), the transaction will be sent to Orion. However, when the transaction is being executed, let's say you are calling a smart contract. This smart contract will do you business level validation and can fail processing the tx. This will mark the tx execution as failed. Any business level validation would need to be done via smart contracts.","username":"lucassaldanha","ts":"2020-08-31T23:01:53.916Z"}
{"msg":"6. Smart contracts can talk to each other. You can check solitidy docs on how to do it. Let's imagine the following scenario: a system that allow members of a privacy group to exchange tokens. You would have a private smart contract that has got the token exchange logic. A member of the group would send a tx to this contract to transfer tokens. When processing the transfer, the exchange contract can also read information from a public contract that has some business logic rules to check if the transfer is valid. This is what I think it would make business logic validation. I'm not sure if I'm being clear, let me know if it doesn't make any sense.","username":"lucassaldanha","ts":"2020-08-31T23:01:59.197Z"}
{"msg":"Thanks @lucassaldanha for the help again :pray: Most of the things are clear except one small tiny bit (sorry for the newbie confusion):\n\nIt is clear now that the privateTx gets added to Orion and the smart contract validates it later during the processing phase. \n\nCorrect me if I am wrong: In a system without privacy, we can call the smart contract from web3 and the contract does business validation. If it is all fine, then the transaction gets mined and written to the chain. If not, nothing gets written on the chain. So our caching layer reads only the valid transactions from the chain.\n\nHowever, with privacy, both the privateTx and PMT get written before doing business validation. While procssing the transaction later, we can do validation in a smart contract. Now if it fails, the privateTx processing will fail but the PMT will already be there in the chain right? So when the caching layer reads the PMT and the privateTx from orion, it will not know if the business validation has failed? \n\nNow, how to ensure the caching layer only reads the valid privateTx?

{"msg":"I believe Besu does not provide a way to selectively protect different API methods. You either have all of them protected or not.\n\nOne thing that is possible is to have granular method permissions per user. So you could have a \"admin\" user that can access the ADMIN and PERM methods, and other users that can access other methods. The downside with this approach is that either you'll need to have a user for each one of your clients or they would need to share a specific user.\n\nA second approach that could work would be exposing on the JSON-RPC API all the methods that you want to be publicly available, and perhaps using the WebSocket API to expose only the ADMIN and PERM methods. The JSON-RPC and the WebSocket servers have independent configurations, so you could have the latter only accepting local connections (and you can send JSON-RPC requests through WebSockets). The downside with this approach is that you'd need some kind of adapter that translates JSON-RPC calls to WebSocket calls.","username":"lucassaldanha","ts":"2020-09-21T04:18:04.836Z"}

I.e. you’ve lost control of your network.\nSo, for a byzantine party to have sufficient control to vote in their own validators (i.e. > 50% validators) - the network has already failed its IBFT block creation requirement (that no more than 33% of validators are byzantine).\ntl;dr: An IBFT network is only guaranteed to be valid if < 1/3 validators are byzantine - which is less than the 50% required to vote in new members.","username":"trent.mohay","ts":"2020-09-26T02:46:35.597Z"}

{"msg":"Hi Besu team,\n\nOn Orchestrate we manage private transactions using `priv_distributeRawTransaction` and `eth_sendRawTransaction` for the marking transaction. After `priv_distributeRawTransaction` has returned the `<enclave-key>`, we generate the marking transaction and we use `eth_estimateGas` to estimate the gas limit (we do not hard code the gas limit so we keep the execution of the marking transaction as close as possible to a regular public non-marking transaction and we are able adapt to upgrades of the privacy pre-compile), then we sign and send the marking transaction. \n\nUp to Besu `1.5.3` this flow is working perfectly fine and the marking transaction ends up being mined.

{"msg":"Hi -- I'm running into a hard to figure out issue with Besu + Orion running in Kubernetes.\n\nThe setup I'm running with is 4 validators (IBFT, doubling as RPC, one as bootnode) + 4 orion nodes on AKS.

{"msg":"Hi @MarkThompsonPH, \nWhen you say the network appears to stall - I'm assuming that means that no blocks are being produced.\nFor IBFT to continue to mine blocks, its important that each validator has at least 1 connection to another validator, such that all validators are connected to each other (even if its in a long chain). If a validator is left orphaned, i.e. connected to the network, but cannot see another validator, it will not be able to participate in consensus. In a large network, losing a single validator (either through orphaning or failure) may be ok, as there's still enough validators communicating to continue mining, but in a small network (eg 4 or 5 validators) losing a single validator may be sufficient to halt the network.\nBest way to ensure propagation:\n* Always have at least 6 validators (allowing for 1 validator to go offline at anytime)\n* Make sure all validators connect to each other, either through initial bootnode setting, or by connecting them via the add_peer json rpc","username":"trent.mohay","ts":"2020-10-15T20:08:25.659Z"}

Otherwise your node would be almost always wrong. It can't know if you prepared tx and nid not send them yet.

{"msg":"Hi @Helder_jn_Pinto, There's a few things going on with your idea, and its worth breaking them down individually:\n1. A public node doesn't mine blocks, therefore any transactions submitted to it is forwarded to the Validator for inclusion in a block. If the transaction is invalid (or makes the block invalid) - it will be discarded by the validator, and will never make it onto the blockchain\n2. All nodes in a network need to have the same understanding of where hard-forks exist (as define in the genesis file) - otherwise some nodes will halt (or fork away?)\n3. You can't add retrospective hard-forks, they really need to be added to the genesis file for a block in the future - and any new nodes which join the network need this genesis file with all hard-forks in it - or else they will stop synching when they reach the fork-block (as the block will appear invalid, or have an incorrect state-root)","username":"trent.mohay","ts":"2021-01-22T01:02:08.572Z"}

Since they all use the private docker network, I've been calling them internal even though the are actually on Azure.  ;-)\nSimilarly, my external node (i.e. not on the Docker network) is my local machine.  I quickly learned that my local machine can only connect via static nodes and that I needed to use p2p-host to get discovery (and apparently connecting to boot nodes to work) since my p2p-host was set to the internal network address (soon to be changed to the external network address).\n\nFor some reason, I was having all sorts of difficulties with the internal network, permissions and discovery as well.  They seem to have disappeared for no reason.  Obviously I must have changed something but . . . .\n\nFor the newest perms version, the things that I noticed were \n1.  I had to figure out that the besu version was in the .env file and update that to a version higher than the current 10.20.0\n2.

If the node doesnt connect then I use the APIs and go back and figure out why and then restart the process. Helps me isolate connectivity at least and if it works with one node, then it generally works with the rest - my 2c worth only ;)","username":"joshuafernandes","ts":"2021-03-01T22:08:51.831Z"}

Besu, the Java client, is still Besu.

I've successfully launched the test network with privacy enabled and my next step would be the pet-shop dapp deployment. This deployment is currently failing due to a lack of funds in the owner account I'm using, but I've realized the genesis file includes three accounts with plenty of balance. The problem is when I import any of those accounts in metamask, it is showing a zero/empty balance, though, the account's balance on the block explorer shows the opposite, that's why I'm pretty sure there is a problem with metamask.

{"msg":"i'm having a hard time understanding the initial sync process of my Besu client.... here's what I think i know so far.  I'm running fast sync, so it shouldn't be trying to execute any contracts older than my pivot block, which is top block as of startup time, minus 64. My blockchain is synced up till the time I started it, but it hasn't pulled in any new blocks. It continues to pull down world state too.

{"msg":"Blocks after the pivot block can't be imported until the whole world state has downloaded, because those do need to have their transactions processed and that requires the world state.\nUnfortunately with the way that the protocols work for fast sync there isn't any way to get a clear indication of how many trie nodes are left to download because it keeps changing.  Last I heard I think was about 700 million but my memory may be off on that.\n\nAlso, it's common for the process to need to move up to a more recent pivot block because all peers have pruned the world state at the original pivot block. In that case Besu has to walk the whole world state trie again and download any nodes that have changed which significantly increases the total number of trie nodes that wind up being downloaded.","username":"ajsutton","ts":"2021-05-13T22:28:00.631Z"}

{"msg":"Hi! Excited to be part of the group.\n\nI have a question. We are considering the use of Hyperledger but not sure which \"version\" to use. We believe that BESU may be the best option given our goals. That being said, can someone tell me the following:\n1) Does BESU have the ability to leverage Hyperledger functionality on a private network (nodes) and interact with the Ethereum (ETH) Main Net, when necessary? For example, we would have a private ecosystem that facilitates transactions amongst users but leverages an ERC-20 token. That would require calls to ETH main net for balances or transfers but the remaining transactions would be private within our ecosystem. Is this possible with BESU?","username":"HyperledgerNewbie","ts":"2021-12-11T23:57:36.903Z"}
