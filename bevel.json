{"msg":"Would you mind sharing some details on your CA strategy? The best I can tell, all crypto material is generated on the fly at deployment time using self signed certs (if it doesn't already exist). The main piece I'm missing is how you are dealing with tlsca (if at all). I've seen mixed suggestions on organizations sharing a root tlsca vs maintaining their own and just curious how BAF is approaching this.","username":"rpocase","ts":"2019-11-13T16:10:21.869Z"}
{"msg":"This partially depends on the platform as Fabric, Corda, and Indy all have different methods for generating their keys/certs. In general, our scripts will create the keys/certs on your behalf for the connivence of deploying dev/test environments. In production environments, we expect organizations will be generating their keys/certs according to their own security policies, and often times, from their existing CA infrastructure. The automation framework requires the generated keys/certs be placed in the appropriate Hashicorp Vault instance where each organization is expected to have their own Vault under their own control. ","username":"mwklein","ts":"2019-11-13T20:55:49.046Z"}

My initial concern was this feels like a lot of overhead on the ops side, but if increasing the peer/user count is relatively infrequent and there is sufficient tooling (e.g. ansible helpers or otherwise) then that becomes less daunting. \n\nThere just isn't a lot of good material for HLF at scale yet","username":"rpocase","ts":"2019-11-14T14:24:41.105Z"}

{"msg":"I have an hyperledger fabric network (v2.2.0) running in a kubernetes cluster deployed using baf. Initially the network had 5 orgs (Org1, Org2, Org3, Org4 and Org5), later I tried to join an org (Org6) into the network using the baf script. Since using baf script didn't add the org to the channel successfully, I have manually joined the org6 to the network using the configtxlator tool. Now during Chaincode installation, I am facing an issue. Tested the fabcar chaincode (from the github repo - fabric-samples-2.0.0-beta), this chaincode installation resulted in same package id for all the 6 orgs in the network. But when I tried to deploy my own chaincode, I am getting different package id for the newly added 6th org, and different package id for all the remaining 5 orgs. Can anyone explain the cause of this? Thanks in Advance!","username":"Soundarya_Ayyappan","ts":"2020-11-27T08:09:59.028Z"}

{"msg":"@arsulegai I would like to explain the complete steps that I followed based on your suggestion. I have destroyed the org2 cluster - which has a peer org deployed in it(thus simulated a disaster scenario and the peer org is down now). Then I have manually deleted the vault auth path, vault policy and vault crypto for org3. And removed org3 from the channel manually using configtxlator and jq tools. Now created a new cluster to deploy the removed org2 again. For that, as per your suggestion I have written a new ansible playbook that calls only the roles create/namespace_vaultauth and setup/vault_kubernetes. For the above roles I have given the condition \"when: item.org_status == 'new'\". So I wrote the network.yaml like org2 has org_status as new and org1 and orderer org as existing. Ran the playbook. The ansible playbook script got completed without any error. But all the components in org2 namespace (ca, peer, peer-cli, install chaincode, approve, joinchannel) got crashed and didn't come up.

I tried to set up by playing around with the configuration file for each organization but did not make much progress. \nThe issue is that as per the deploy-network playbook the 'configtx.yaml' file contains the definition for each org that is taken from the 'organizations' key in the configuration file (Task - Adding organization patch to configtx.yaml),  but if the aim is multi host deployment, the file should ideally contain only one organization definition.

We succesfully managed to deploy 2 organisations using the same network.yaml file. Then, we attempted to deploy a third one that would simulate independency using a different network.yaml.
