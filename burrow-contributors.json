We should find a nice way to support common chain types\n- Improving logging - there is a powerful mechanism for customising logs, but it lacks presets and debug output from the EVM is hard to read\n\nAll of these things would be good starters to get you familiar with codebase without requiring deep knowledge of blockchains or Burrow","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2017-12-19T15:01:29.016Z"}

{"msg":"@silasdavis In vm_test.go (line 80), there is a byte array element byte(0x60 + len(N) - 1), which I have interpreted and changed to PUSH2, and another element (line 81) byte(0x1b + len(N)), which I have interpreted and changed to the value 0x1d given the previous PUSH1. I have run 'go test' against vm_test.go with changes that left these elements untouched and it passed; I also ran 'go test' against vm_test.go with my interpreted values, and it also passed. My question is why did you originally tie these values to the length of the byte array N? Also, in changing the magic bytes to opcodes, I had to cast them in the following way--i.e. for a PUSH1, I had to write byte(PUSH1). Is this what you intended for me to do, or is there a cleaner way to achieve this casting?","username":"smblucker","ts":"2018-01-03T18:44:07.155Z"}

{"msg":"@smblucker regarding your question - bear in mind I didn't actually write any of the vm tests - the reason the length of `N` is used in combination with the `PUSH` opcode is that the intention of the code is to push the bytes in the `N` slice onto the stack and a the appropriate push is the one corresponding to the length of the slice.\n\nMy 'Splice' function (https://github.com/silasdavis/burrow/blob/hypermarmot/execution/evm/asm/bc/helpers.go#L15) can help here with the casting/readability. We should be able to rewrite the entire `code` assignment in a single declarative block, e.g.:\n\n```\nsixZeroes := Splice(0,0,0,0,0,0)\ncode := Splice(PUSH1, 0x21, sixZeroes)\nassert.Equal(t, []byte{0x60,0x21,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0}, code)\n```\n\nSo we can mix `OpCode` (just an explicit named type for a byte that happens to be a real opcode), bytes, and sequences of bytes (as `[]byte`) and it will convert in a flattened sequence of bytes. In a particular if you have a repetitive reusable segment of code (like the sixZeroes example) then you can define a function to emit that or a variable and just pass it to splice, which is much easier than doing something similar with an explicit loop all the time.","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2018-01-09T20:08:46.537Z"}

However, the call is being made by a function with the same name, though the number of arguments for the two functions are different.

Strings in Go are arbitrary byte slices, to all intents and purposes you can treat `string` as identical to `[]byte` and they are convertable, so `str := string(bs)` and `bs := []byte(str)` are availabe and that's what you should do if you have a byte slice with some text.\n\n2. When our execution receives an error from `vm.Call` it 'automatically reverts' - actually it just doesn't commit the tx which has the same effect. We will want to return an exception and that may be all we need to do (we can embed the return value in the exception as a string) - but I need to have a closer look at other implementations to make sure that is correct - particularly for nested calls. I think its the right thing to do but I need to check. Will get back to you on that.\n\n3. It is not idiomatic to return a value and an error in Go so we should avoid that. In any case in the case of a full revert then that output can't be used and should just be a message.

Further, I tried making it into a string and, using hex.DecodeToString which returns a byte array, tried returning the decoded version, but when you convert it back to a byte array you get the integer equivalents of ascii values. The EIP 140 clearly states that there should be both an error returned and a message that essentially says the same thing (except in the case of create, where I believe only the error message is needed).

{"msg":"@smblucker I think you're slightly missing the point here. `string` and `[]byte` are different types, which effects how the are printed by default. `[]byte` is the appropriate type to use for the vm output because it can be arbitrary bytes (including possibly text). The VM does not know (or care) when it is text. The reason the output is printed like that is just because the test use the fmt package to print the default byte slice representation:\n\n```\n// original\nfmt.Printf(\"Output: %v Error: %v\\n\", output, err)\n\n// If you happen to know output contains text and you _want_ to print it \nfmt.Printf(\"Output: %v Error: %v\\n\", string(output), err)\n```\n\nRegarding the return value, it does look like this might be needed so that EVM calling code can make use of the message. So seem like execution might be able to continue (for example to add to the error message) even though all state changes will be reverted. The confusing thing about this is that 'all remaining gas is refunded', but the previous remark would suggest more gas could be consumed (even though we don't need to worry about that.

{"msg":"To give some preliminary thoughts on your question 'why not use it':\n- I was not aware of another Apache 2.0 EVM like this at all before\n- Actually the most recent raison d'etre for Burrow is not really to be modular in itself (we leave that to Sawtooth and Fabric) , but to be a decent library and extensible (not pluggable in execution engine or consensus). So there is something to be said for our niche as being a single process, single language (Go) codebase with a concrete (not generic) feature-set: our own permission layer, snatives, EVM, and Tendermint consensus. Having said that, this just reflects my most recent thinking and is not in itself a good enough reason not to change.\n- Our permissions layer is quite tightly/deeply integrated into the EVM - we probably can't easily just use something like SputnikVM unless their API boundaries provide the appropriate hooks to build them in.\n- Although Burrow has some issues it has had many non-trivial things built on it over years. Sometimes better the devil you know...\n\nBut really this is the first time I have seen this project, so thanks for bringing it to my attention. I think Rust is a great choice for something like this, and the project looks really on point in terms of their aims and the velocity they seem to have. I would need more time to study the code quality and maturity of the project.\n","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2018-02-26T10:17:16.372Z"}

I've moved the monax-keys command into burrow, see https://github.com/seanyoung/burrow/tree/monax-keys. The next step would be for keys/keys_client.go to be able to switch to use the keys directly (without going to the server, or use a separate keys server).","username":"seanyoung","ts":"2018-04-23T15:43:37.431Z"}

{"msg":"@silasdavis Thanks for this, it is an interesting model. Just some clarifying questions and exploratory push back:\n  1) Attaching a fee at account creation - Does this mean that the contract creator will set the fee for a deployed contract? I’m thinking in the public chain context where anyone can deploy contracts. If this is the case, then there could be a race to the bottom for fees, at the cost of the validator fees. On the other hand if the protocol sets the contract Fee on what basis will it find a fair price?\n 2) Will the fee then be aggregated for cross contract calls? (E.g. - A user calls a method on contract A with Fee X, which in turn calls contract B (with Fee Y), is the original call Fee then X+Y or X alone? If not aggregated, then users could wrap an ‘expensive’ contract call in a ‘cheap’ cross contract call.\n 3) Contracts have different functionalities. A method setting a single storage variable, is much less work than iterating over a large array. Even with a gas limit for termination, I wonder if a single fee is granular enough to accommodate the difference in possible functionality.\n 4) What do you see as the benefits of abandoning the gas per operation model of fee calculation? If a flat fee model is adopted, how to keep it in line with a sense of “fair” payment for network resource usage? \n\nYour proposal seems good from a user standpoint since network resources (computation and storage) could theoretically be used for small flat fees, but will validators want to support the network (again thinking of a public network) if there are little fees to compensate them for their operating costs? \n\nMy thought is that the best part of the pay per operation model is that the free market dictates how much resources cost on the network and should achieve a ‘fair’ equilibrium. If users pay too little, the miners don’t process their transactions (or do in a slow manner). If the miners charge too much, there are less transactions as users move to other networks or just limit their transaction activity to save costs. ","username":"finterran","ts":"2018-05-23T05:10:10.587Z"}

{"msg":"I think it needs pushing back on. To clarify where my blinkers are - in our current model the only contracts deployed are the operational contracts ordained at genesis (i.e. eventually no human has CREATE permission). I'm not totally wedded to this for us, and certainly this is a smaller use case than what Burrow is meant to serve, but for the sake of argument. In this scenario these foundation contracts are all factory contracts and responsible for creating the actual business contracts (for us: archetypes (templates of agreements), agreements, processes, etc). So since 'we' as the designers of the networks are controlling the base contracts we can control the fee we charge at the same time as the value contract demands to be transferred. Since archetypes are competing there is a market for their value but there's no market (or incentive) for them to charge a higher fee as you point out.\n\nI want a system where validators make a percentage cut of all value changing hands on the network. \n\nHere is a better model, I think more in line with what I actually intended: when value is transferred a percentage fee (let's punt on how this is set, whether it is per account) is deducted and taken as the validator fee and then distributed as I described.\n\n","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2018-05-23T20:30:48.263Z"}
{"msg":"so on 1) Let's say the fee is set for the network flat - validators have a defined upside that scales with volumes, consumers have to transfer value to pay for things, but other utility level things could be free (in our model this works because all our contracts are 'friendly')","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2018-05-23T20:32:25.625Z"}

It would not be that hard to implement and for our public/semi-public use cases I'm increasingly thinking that maybe we should. I'd also like to have a flexible fee charging structure so perhaps we do need the ability to charge for gas. It seems silly to me that Ethereum once pitched itself as a 'computer for the world' when it is so slow - the value is obviously in reaching consensus on transactions so metering computation seems a bit beside the point. Also there is a lot of room for optimising computation whereas there is less room to optimising the slowness of consensus (at least in PBFT-ish) so I'm inclined towards thinking of computation as commodity - which doesn't mean it's right to do that.","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2018-05-23T20:41:27.311Z"}

It should be noted that the other role of fees is for spam prevention, so as long as a fee is safely enforceable on the Contract level then Contract attachment may also be workable. I’m a bit skeptical of placing fees in control of the validator node RPC, it seems that there could arise the possibility for validators to act selfishly to acquire more fees. Not sure exactly how, but my spider sense is tingling. \n\n2. As mentioned - % of Tx value only works for some use cases. % of network volume seems interesting, I will give it some thought as well.   If I were to imagine something that is dynamic per operation based, I would suggest accepting the Ethereum gas model (with some possible amendments to the gas table) to account for termination and computational limits (as Burrow already has), but then keep ‘pure computation’ operations free (gas tallied but not charged in the fee), and only charge for storage modifying operations. \n\n  This way termination is still ensured and validators can still set their ‘computational threshold’ by having their say about this limit. But also pure computation is no longer costly for consumers (and computation efficiency becomes a competitive advantage of a network/sub-network whereby validators can increase the computational limit to compete with others).  \n\nOn this account storage costs are covered since the gas for them is included in the fee. I will say the storage rental model proposed by VB in @bird_alone’s post may have some merit as a supplemental implementation for a more sustainable model, at the very least there should be some incentive for contract makers (and consumers) to garbage collect their unused storage space.\n\n 3. The current model: network minimum, then user defined, then validator incentive to take the largest, seems to work well. I don’t really like the idea of consumers being able to jump the queue by paying higher prices, but I have to admit that it does extract the optimal amount of value for network resource usage. On this note, it is also the reason I am a proponent of leader based payouts rather than distributing fee across the validators directly.   \n\nFor contract owner fee setting, unless the contract creator get a portion of the fee I don’t see any incentive for contract creator to increase fees at all. Either they will use the contract themselves in which case they want it as cheap as possible, or they want everyone else to use their contract so similar.  \n\nThe validators defiantly should have a say in the fees they collect, and on the current paradigm they do through leader Tx selection and gas price voting. I’m open to suggestion for a more efficient model but can't think of anything sufficient currently.\n\n  In any case, it is good to keep the ideas flowing. Thanks much.","username":"finterran","ts":"2018-05-24T07:12:11.378Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow-contributors?msg=zeQaLtHxLJTFNKzyn","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow-contributors?msg=zeQaLtHxLJTFNKzyn","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}
{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow-contributors?msg=a7zE5hnefpAf8DL6R) @bird_alone Agreed - a sustainable model that accurately represents the long-term costs is good to think about. In the current era we think everything is good because generally the token prices are increasing. But many years in the future this may not be the case, and so chain death could occur because the maintenance cost is so large that validators drop out. On the other hand it could be argued that this maintenance cost is what supports the value of the token, similar to the Bitcoin mining/electricity argument.","username":"finterran","ts":"2018-05-24T07:36:03.084Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow-contributors?msg=a7zE5hnefpAf8DL6R","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow-contributors?msg=a7zE5hnefpAf8DL6R","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

{"msg":"Hi all. Silas requested i post about my plans regarding the reinvigoration of the js libs. There are a couple things that are on my mind here. First is switching to use GRPC. An ongoing process but one that removes a bunch of handwritten code for server communiation. Once done, the 'db' portion of the lib starts to become small enough to not really consider it its own lib (it never really was suited for that anyways) so im planning on merging them into a single lib. One which still exposes the lower level access but then builds with contracts and abi handling on top. A major consideration at this point is if I want to continue wrapping the web3 solidity function or move away from that since a lot of that code is strickly speaking unnecessary and i could just use the abi coder. Im still back and forth a bit on this so ill probably decide when I get there. When the merge is complete im hoping to do away with the ContractManager... i really think its unecessary and should just be new Contract(abi, <bytecode| address> [input account]) but im still feeling my way through it.

As-is it is difficult to filter except if you use name registery to store all nodeKey. Any better idea?

{"msg":".... Just to reprise earlier convo about seeds. SeedMode is something that can be enabled on a node. If a node is in seed mode it will accept inbound connections, share its address book, then hang up. Seeds modes will do a bit of gossip but not that usefully. You can list any type of node in 'Seeds' in the config, whether or not another node considers you a seed is independent of whether you are in 'seed mode'. These are different concepts. You are free to use a non-seed-mode node as a seed. \n\nYou do not want to have too many seeds in your network (because they just keep hanging up on other nodes once they've spread their wild oats), but they are useful for accelerating peer exchange (of addresses).\n\nPersistent peers are peers that you want to connect of regardless of the heuristics and churn dynamics built into the p2p switch. Ordinarily you would not stay connected to a particular peer forever, and you would not indefinitely redial, but you will for a persistent peer.\n\nIncidentally there is an online interface for dialling peers and seeds which has a flag for persistent.

{"msg":"Regarding the node key/validator key. My hunch is that nothing would explode if you were to use a single key for both purposes. There are two reasons not to I can think of: 1. the node key is used (a lot) for the station-to-station protocol (can think of it as a kind of peer-to-peer TLS). This effectively runs down the entropy in the key from the perspective of what you have revealed to a potential attacker. I don't know how this would be quantified, but having a separate transport level key to your identity's signing key is 'good practice'. 2. is basically segregation - your validator key may in principle have real-world value (validator voting power == bond) by keeping it used for the single purpose of signing votes the attack surface area (and frequency of signatures) is reduced. Actually the node key doesn't get used for signatures, but it is still 'exposed' through the STS DH.","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2018-10-09T14:09:39.835Z"}
