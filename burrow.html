I can kick start the conversation here with a short introduction of Burrow and myself (thx Tracy and Ry for creating the channel!)
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 15:47:40 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger Burrow is a permissioned Ethereum smart contract machine that newly joined the Hyperledger family as an incubation project!  We are very honoured and look forward to closer integrations and collaboration within the Hyperledger umbrella.  You can find the code development for Burrow here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 15:48:51 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis and I will move our development discussion from internal slack here and we welcome people to join those discussions and the development

Last perhaps I want to thank @Dan and @amundson for a two days at the Hyperledger hackfest. I safely touched ground and will look to do a first PR burrow-evm as a sawtooth transaction processor by COB tomorrow (I slept on the flight back sorry :) )

@benjaminbollen - Is it correct that the ABI is only used on the client side when creating the transaction, and that we do not need to send it as part of the transaction?

that is correct; the ABI sits at the client side; internally though we have plans for the ABI definition to be understood by the chain;  this is hard to do on a public ETH chain, and wasnt incorporate but is possible on a permissioned chain and of a lot of value

</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 16:38:50 GMT):<br/>
(this also was dependent on EIP 141; which allows to interject a hash into the compiled contract code to match the ABI definition to compiled smart contract code)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 17:15:38 GMT):<br/>
Hi @benjaminbollen, maybe there should be optional attestations from a TEE to ensure that the code was deployed from a secure node. This can start with just being in the deployment of the contract and some sort of protocol interacting with the ABI hash. Further we can look at this being part of sensitive or high value transactions (also on an optional basis)-this way we harden the trust envelope (maybe cheaply)
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:06:49 GMT):<br/>
hi @VipinB !  that is a great suggestion.  We have the foundation for that through the permissioning system, as `CREATE` is a permissioned execution step; but this can be much further worked out and connected to other attestations (TEE as you suggest) and better integrated user experience

great!  note that we have moved the javascript libraries into legacy mode, which we will maintain; but the idea is very much for burrow to fully move out of monax tooling and the associated javascript libraries and for burrow to live independently of monax tooling;  unfortunately right now the documentation and user interfaces are still all written for monax; not burrow directly

</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 20:35:17 GMT):<br/>
I am digging into the burrow evm code a little to get a better understanding of what it does and how it works, as well as skimming the Ethereum yellow paper. I am hoping I can get some help with a few questions. Let me know if there is a better place to ask these. Thanks!
1. Is the storage referred to by opcodes SLOAD and SSTORE blockchain storage?
2. Is this storage always associated with an account?
3. The AppState interface define by the burrow evm seems to treat accounts and storage differently, as does the FakeAppState type. Is this out of necessity or convenience?
4. How is storage for an account limited?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 22:10:00 GMT):<br/>
1) Yes
2) Yes
3) .... Dunno Ben will have to address
4) Contract storage is a key-value storage system which allows for any 32 byte key. 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 22:12:44 GMT):<br/>
2*) We have introduced some things such as the namereg and permissions. The Namereg has its own trie I believe and permissions I forget how they are associated. But there is probably discussion to be had about how the division of these things are going to work.
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 12:22:38 GMT):<br/>
hi Adam.  I think this channel is the perefect place to ask such questions;  

3. FakeAppStore can be misleading as it stores all storage for all accounts in the same storage (by appending the account address and storage location to make a bigger unique key)
when you look at the AppState interface (it is poorly documented) the first word256 is the account address to get/set storage for; the second word256 is the key location in the storage for that account;

In Burrow the EVM will act on a TxCache (which implements AppState; https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/manager/burrow-mint/state/tx_cache.go#L30-L34) where it will keep for storage a Tuple256 (account and storage key); this TxCache itself is synced back to the BlockCache backend (which for us then also holds a cache for the NameRegistry);  The TxCache does a conversion to/from vmAccounts (which dont hold their own stateRoot) to stateAccounts (https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/account/account.go#L55-L64) which do have the stateRoot;  When syncing TxCache back to BlockCache you see we start splitting the storage for the accounts: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/manager/burrow-mint/state/tx_cache.go#L143-L146 

The BlockCache is backed up by State and will make a trie for storage for each account;  these tries are put in the trie for all accounts in state

</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 12:27:53 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik so in a first draft; we could lean closer to FakeAppState than to the State in Burrow (or at least that is the argument for cutting the EVM out at AppSate; rather than at our Application Blockchain Interface (underneath State handling);  
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 13:06:50 GMT):<br/>
additionally Address+Key is a 20+32 byte depth
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 13:08:44 GMT):<br/>
so we will want to deal with that differently in Sawtooth
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 13:08:44 GMT):<br/>
so we can't naievely do that

Quick question about the Account type. There is an Other field which doesn't seem to be used by the VM. Does that field have an intended purpose? I see it being used by TxCache to store a pubkey and storage root, but is this a burrow/tendermint specific usage?
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 16:29:06 GMT):<br/>
I posted written comments back in #sawtooth-burrow where option 4. might shine a light on that question; namely that the StorageRoot allows us to store the storage in the DB as a new MerkleTree; and such for each account

<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 16:33:29 GMT):<br/>
the PublicKey is used for ed25519 validation of signatures (ed25519 is more efficient than secp256k1 but doesnt support public key recovery); in burrow every tx has the public key in it; but on the first tx for an public key derived account, the public key is immutably written to that account and hence used for verification of messages

@benjaminbollen do you know someone on github named sushantdm ? they have requested becoming a burrow maintainer, which would give them commit rights to burrow. should I approve or deny that request?

Quick question. Ethereum defines the address to be assigned to a newly created account as “the rightmost 160 bits of the Keccak hash of the RLP encoding of the structure containing only the sender and the nonce”. I see the following in `txs/tx.go` for account creation:
```
func NewContractAddress(caller []byte, nonce int) []byte {
    temp := make([]byte, 32+8)
    copy(temp, caller)
    PutInt64BE(temp[32:], int64(nonce))
    hasher := ripemd160.New()
    hasher.Write(temp) // does not error
    return hasher.Sum(nil)
}
```
Does this follow that spec, with the exception of using ripemd160 instead of sha3?
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 10:04:08 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis can you do initial work to update to Tendermint 0.10.0-rc1 in a feature branch off of develop?
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 10:06:52 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik yes, so burrow will have different accounts calculated (ie we use ripemd160 instead of truncated SHA3)
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 10:08:01 GMT):<br/>
this is a choice that can be remade; or carried over in STL; it is relevant before EVM execution on validating the signatures to the account
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 10:14:50 GMT):<br/>
to be EVM compatible it is sufficient for it to be 20 bytes; we initially (and still have the framework for) built it to be configurable (ed25519 + ripemd160; or secp256k1 + SHA3); but we found ourselves defaulting to ed25519

is there anybody  who can give a comparison between burrow and etherum
</p>
<p><strong>zhangchao</strong> (Tue, 23 May 2017 09:58:03 GMT):<br/>
burrow looks like etherum on the one hand,  and looks like fabric on the other hand
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 23 May 2017 18:36:38 GMT):<br/>
Hi @zhangchao, 'ethereum' has few different meanings or senses. There is Ethereum the foundation, ethereum the 'specification' (people like to say it is specified by the 'yellow paper', which is almost true, there is ethereum the public chain, and there are ethereum node clients (like go-ethereum or parity). Burrow is a blockchain node client so the most direct comparison would be with something like go-ethereum, so I'll get to that. Burrow doesn't really compare the Ethereum foundation or the public chain (out there), so I'll discount those.

There is another sense in which Burrow 'is ethereum', in that our execution engine is an implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) which is a bytecode language and stack machine specification on which smart contracts are written (in languages like Solidity). Our blockchain state is also in the 'ethereum world view', having to do with accounts at certain 20-byte addresses.

To compare us to public ethereum clients makes sense as a comparison, but a more apt comparison would probably be to other 'permissioned' or 'enterprise' ethereum clients (some standardisation around what it means to run non-public ethereum-based blockchains is happening at https://entethalliance.org/, I don't care much for the enterprise moniker, but fundamentally running chains amongst non-anonymous collaborating identities is different from the public chain use case.

There are other 'enterprise ethereum clients' (as which Burrow may be loosely classified) such as Quorum and I belief to some extent Parity. We are by far the most mature (at least, oldest) permissioned ethereum (that is EVM running) client. We are not substitutably compatible with the Ethereum public chain as public ethereum node clients are. And we have made different choices about various things. However we are contract-level compatible with smart contracts written for Ethereum (your Solidity code will run on us). The most important things we do differently (by design rather than by accident) are:

- We use Tendermint consensus with a lightly proof-of-stake approach but more importantly with finality
- We have a powerful secure native system (snatives) for running non-smart contract code outside of the EVM.
- We have a deeply integrated permissioning system that is accessible from smart contracts using certain snatives
- We have an independent implementation of the EVM according to the spec
- We have a different event system/model

With respect to the comparison with fabric, we are both full blockchain node clients for a non-public (enterprise) setting so we are similar there. There are plans in the offing to further modularise Burrow to have it run not as a full blockchain node but as an execution substrate on top of other blockchains like Sawtooth Lake (there is active development on this now), and possibly in the future on Fabric too if there is interest from the Hyperledger community.

Public blockchains include Ethereum have wallet, but I dont think enterprise chains like burrow/fabric has it, so it's an another major difference.

Burrow does have an internal token, much like Eth, and all accounts have a balance that can be changed by Calls or a SendTx. This token is generally used as a way of controlling who can do computation (call contracts) and to bound that computation through the charging of gas (also like ethereum) rather than a bearer of value. It would be possible to make use of the token from smart contracts, however you could just as well represent value in a completely custom way by writing it into a contract (in the simplest case as a table of balances amongst whatever you consider to be 'accounts'). I suppose the crucial difference is that on public ethereum the Eth token is meant to connect you to some 'external' notion of value. This is necessary in the public anonymous setting, but in a permissioned chain since you have some external knowledge of the identities you can imbue those identities with whatever external value or significance that you like. On the other hand the internal token of a freshly spun-up Burrow chain has no external value (though there are ways you could link it to value). A big goal of the ethereum chain is to provide natively an interface to external value through its token,.

So I'd hesitate to say you shouldn't use our internal token, but it is conspicuous that no-one does, and moreover I don't see a good reason to couple the notion of 'token' you may have to the internal token (which in Burrow is more used for book-keeping) or the notion of 'account' you may have to out notion of account (a place where code resides, and where identity is defined). You have more freedom to define these at the contract level (I may use contract/account/address somewhat interchangeably - they refer to different aspects of a unified object), though I can see cases where you might want one contract/account per 'bank account' if that is what you are thinking of.

It's also worth noting that when we re-introduce validator bonding/unbonding and as we work on the EVM we are probably due a rethink on how we prices gas and possibly how we think of the internal token. It seems it has an important role but it has inherited from public ethereum and feels a bit vestigial in some places. Our gas pricing is also rather arbitrary (we can get away with caring a lot less about this in a permissioned context).

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 10:45:55 GMT):<br/>
When you refer to 'wallet' I'm not sure if you are referring to a portable key store or perhaps a 'light client'. Both are possible with Burrow, but we do really have a light client, though in some sense you could describe any app using our RPC as a light client. We could provide something that could ask for proofs of state that could work a bit like: https://github.com/tendermint/light-client. We have some plans to provide a kind of lightweight node (that does't validate or maintain the entire blockchain). In terms of key storage we currently have: https://github.com/monax/keys which provides a mixture of key storage and crypto as a service. It is unaudited crypto for development purposes and is not really to be trusted. We aim to replace it with a more robust system imminently, that would be an interface that could be implemented against various backends including hardware security module backed devices.

Hey everyone, hope all is well. I had to ask you guys, what do I need to learn in order to further my knowledge as far as developing, deploying, and understanding the mechanics of blockchain technology? All I really know is Linux Sys Admin stuff and some bash scripting. But I've fallen in love with this concept and I'm willing to learn anything that helps.

Hi, Burrow team. I created a shared calendar for all Hyperledger community meetings. You can find it here: http://bit.ly/HyperledgerCal. Use the &ctz=_TZ_ option to specify your time zone. See the TZ column for list of options: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List. I would really love to add any Burrow meetings to this calendar.

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 11:52:28 GMT):<br/>
@zhangchao every account has an associated balance, which you can query. Here is the data structure: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/account/account.go#L59

Hi I am a little new, and I am trying to get Hyperledger Burrow running locally, and I am receiving a Time Out before connecting to the server. I followed the tutorial in the hyperledger/burrow github, and used monax to create the genesis, config and priv_validator files. Not sure what the next step is here and would appreciate any help!

<p><strong>atq</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 11:17:41 GMT):<br/>

//             taskmanagerContract.addTask(

Hi everyone. I have a question about atomicity of transactions. If I send a transaction to a contract, which triggers a wave of transactions to many other contracts (and so on), what guarantees do I have about all those transactions actually happening? Is there an "all-or-nothing" atomicity?
</p>
<p><strong>djones2</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 14:58:08 GMT):<br/>
I'm also a little confused about the deterministic nature of smart contract execution. To my mind, the outcome of running a set of transactions in some particular order can be deterministic. But the order is chosen somehow. When tendermint reaches a consensus on order, is it simply that one validator chose an order (perhaps based on arrival time of transaction messages) and applied them to its view of the world before sharing the block around for agreement?
</p>
<p><strong>djones2</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 14:59:19 GMT):<br/>
And while other nodes may have been working on a different order, when they receive the proposed block and validate it, they throw away/roll-back their world state and apply the new block in the order defined?

@marc4gov Agreed. It would be useful. Waiting on Revert Opcode which may or may not be returning error info, and that can make these things a lot easier to deal with (particularly as it comes to standard libraries).

@djones2: 
" If I send a transaction to a contract, which triggers a wave of transactions to many other contracts (and so on), what guarantees do I have about all those transactions actually happening?": It's guaranteed by design.
" Is there an "all-or-nothing" atomicity?": Correct, it's all or nothing.
Re: the order of execution of TX: Yes, an order is chosen, by one agreed validators (I think they rotate in a round robin fashion), and that defines the order in which the TX will be executed. Note that this implies that the TX execution is sequential.

I am following the getting started tutorial of monax. I was able to successfully do everything but when I restarted my PC. following the same tutorial, the deployment of smart contract does not work.

Everything goes well till this point :

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 03 Jul 2017 20:50:01 GMT):<br/>
@VamzR : Hyperledger Burrow is for permissioned networks. While it implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) specification, it does not use the public Ethereum network. You will need to determine what is the linkage between Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum and maintain that in your application.

@cbruguera: burrow is the blockchain implementation underneath monax. It used to be called erisdb in the past, and it uses tendermint at its core. Monax added on top of tendermint an EVM implementation that supports permissions, they built a set of tools to manage the whole ecosystem (CLI creation/start/stop of chains, deployment of smart contracts, JS libs to interact with smart contracts) and have built a very comprehensive set of smart contracts libs for various business domains (they have strong roots in the legal space). Now, the blockchain part has been rebranded burrow and what is referred to as "monax" is the toolkit to interact with a burrow blockchain.

When you run `monax chains start my_chain --init-dir $config_dir` it spawns a docker machine which runs a "burrow server" based on the config data you pass it.

@atq Re. `burrow serve...`, that doesn't seem sufficient. It picks up where it left off (e.g. at block X, rather than block 1). I seem to have found a solution involving deleting the `data` directory from the chain working dir.

<p><strong>atq</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 10:04:36 GMT):<br/>
basically, the resetting of priv_validator file is mostly removing the block height, the last sig and anything other than private key, pub key and address (don't have the file easily accessible now, sorry)

<p><strong>cbruguera</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 21:42:48 GMT):<br/>
I heard Monax was going to back off from burrow development and leave it to the hyperledger community, is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>cbruguera</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 21:45:05 GMT):<br/>
On the same subject, javascript libraries have been marked as "deprecated" by Monax, are there any ongoing efforts to resume these libraries' development by hyperledger as complements of Burrow technology?... It seems to me that client-side libraries/SDKs are really important components for a smart contract platform such as burrow/monax.

<p><strong>mtxset</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 06:48:26 GMT):<br/>
@atq, yes, it is, but where is API description?
</p>
<p><strong>mtxset</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 07:00:59 GMT):<br/>
I guess: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/docs/specs/api.md
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 08:26:26 GMT):<br/>
@mtxset: correct. you can also find our Swift implementation here: https://gitlab.com/katalysis/BurrowBlockchain (@cbrugera).

@atq, is there example with solidity contract being deployed and executed on burrow?
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 08:33:42 GMT):<br/>
@cbruguera, yes client side libs are quite important. We are ourselves using the monax/burrow framework for our own product, and have written some Swift libs to interact with the blockchain. Wrt Monax scaling back on the js client libs, my take is that they probably do not have the resources to maintain them for free at their current stage. As a startup, we are in the same situation of needing to make sure we spend our time wisely :).
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 08:35:18 GMT):<br/>
@mtxset, you mean through Swift?
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 08:35:51 GMT):<br/>
no. this is just the api implementation. would love to put it on our roadmap, but for now, no time.
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 08:36:22 GMT):<br/>
if just through any means, I guess the monax tutorials are quite good. and their tests: https://github.com/monax/monax/tree/master/tests/jobs_fixtures
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 08:39:40 GMT):<br/>
currently, we craft the byte code to call the contracts semi by hand (https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI).
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 08:40:12 GMT):<br/>
deploying contracts is mostly sending a Tx to the 0 address so should not be rocket science to implement.
</p>
<p><strong>mtxset</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 08:49:16 GMT):<br/>
so, basically it's not yet for production, although possible, I guess fabric should be sufficient  
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 19:09:22 GMT):<br/>
I am looking for a list of emails for the maintainers of Hyperledger Burrow. I did not see anything in the source code. Does this exist somewhere that you can point me to? I would like to send an email to the maintainers of Hyperledger Burrow without using the mailing list at lists.hyperledger.org.

@atq, https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/rpc/tendermint/core/routes.go are working rpc functions, and there is broadcast_tx, could you share with an example (tx sample)?
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 06:59:02 GMT):<br/>
@mtxset, the way it works high level is at follows: you have 3 main entry points. $ip:46657, which is the http entry point for the web api. $ip:1337/rpc, which is the JSON-RPC entry point for http rest. you need to POST and put the json as payload. finally, you have the $ip:1337/socketrpc, which is the web socket entry point. payload is the same JSON-RPC as the HTTP REST one.
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 07:16:50 GMT):<br/>
Regarding payload examples, I don't have anything precoded unfortunately.

<p><strong>atq</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 07:18:13 GMT):<br/>
when I have some time, I will clean some internal stuff I have in Swift and share it. 
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 07:20:18 GMT):<br/>
the Websocket endpoint is not as stable as the HTTP one, so I added a BroadcastAndHold entry point in this PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/624. It may make your life easier if you are able to sign locally.
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 07:21:14 GMT):<br/>
One thing to note is that if you use the Broadcast* endpoint, you need to be able to sign messages locally. Else you need to use the TransactAndHold endpoint and send in your private key with it.
</p>
<p><strong>mtxset</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 07:37:10 GMT):<br/>
@atq, well API page is out dated but it works fine with: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/rpc/tendermint/core/routes.go
I managed to use get_account, list_accounts, and blockchain (tested RPC as well as REST)
What I'm asking is the how do I encode/put out the transcation itself: I dont know format I'm suppsed to send the tx in broadcast_tx
Yea signinng is following part
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 08:13:59 GMT):<br/>

As this is a broadcastTX (no Hold), you will also need to subscribe to the event and listen for the result to come back.

I understand JSON format for broadcast but how do you get data, do you just copy bytecode from solidity compiler?

</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 08:40:33 GMT):<br/>
the above gives you the format.
</p>
<p><strong>atq</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 08:41:16 GMT):<br/>
the first 4 bytes are the function signature, and then you need to encode the  params.

@mtxset: as far as I know, development is still going on (maybe more so in private forks though). there are PRs coming in once in a while (especially on the develop branch). I think 0.17 is expected to be out within a few weeks. @benjaminbollen or @compleatang might be able to give a better picture?

Hi guys, I've got a question about launching Burrow in a Kubernetes cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Sat, 15 Jul 2017 13:15:31 GMT):<br/>
Would I be correct in assuming that https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/d7e7449db97230c361458dbba4377f9270e5c295/deployment/start_in_cluster is meant to be triggered from inside a container?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Sat, 15 Jul 2017 13:16:39 GMT):<br/>
And you'd set the variables used in that script through a deployment defintion like this one: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/d7e7449db97230c361458dbba4377f9270e5c295/deployment/kubernetes/node000-deploy.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Sat, 15 Jul 2017 13:18:48 GMT):<br/>
Another question I have would be about CHAIN_SEEDS in those scripts.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Sat, 15 Jul 2017 13:19:26 GMT):<br/>
Do those have to be actual instance IPs ? 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Sat, 15 Jul 2017 13:19:26 GMT):<br/>
Does that var have to contain instance IPs ?

I have Sawtooth and Burrow built and installed, and have brought them up. I am now trying to set up an account using seth. The docs say that it requires an alias for a key. Is this a filename with the public key in it, and, if so, what does the format of the public key need to be (sorry if this question is clueless).
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:52:12 GMT):<br/>
Sawtooth and Burrow are separate projects. Currently the integration between the two is Sawtooth a transaction family that wraps the Burrow-EVM (v0.16). So you don't need to run both. The seth "alias" is just a keyword you define which you use to refer to your private key later.
</p>
<p><strong>JamesKempf</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 19:49:31 GMT):<br/>
I'm now running sawtooth-validator and sawtooth-rest-api in addition to burrow-evm-tp. Are you saying that I don't need to run the sawtooth*? W.r.t. seth, when I run the command to create an account, I get this:
</p>
<p><strong>JamesKempf</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 19:49:38 GMT):<br/>
ubuntu@blockchain01:~$  seth --verbose account create --permissions=+all player01
Error: Couldn't load key from alias: No key with alias player01
</p>
<p><strong>JamesKempf</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 19:50:02 GMT):<br/>
So it seems to me that it wants to load a key, or maybe I'm missing something?

<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 20:17:09 GMT):<br/>
Hey @JamesKempf you may have better luck asking in #sawtooth

<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 20:17:25 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 17:08:07 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for the delay. The correct sequence of commands is:
`sawtooth keygen --key-dir . player01`
`seth account import player01.priv player01`

and then what you ran:
`seth --verbose account create --permissions=+all player01`

<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 15:29:53 GMT):<br/>
as a first rule, I recommend to only keep the data on chain that is needed to progress the state of the smart contracts, ie what you need to calculate; all other state that is not read, or written to by the smart contract can be linked to with a hash and stored off chain

Hi, do we have Docker images for Burrow? Or any instructions to generate and run such containers would be helpful...  And, will sawtooth-core have to be separately installed and run?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:46:57 GMT):<br/>
@sambitnayak we do: https://quay.io/repository/monax/db?tab=tags
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:47:11 GMT):<br/>
However the primary way to run this is by using the 'monax' tool, see here: https://quay.io/repository/monax/db?tab=tags

@marc4gov could you check if you see the same issue if you install using go directly with `go get github.com/monax/monax/cmd/monax`?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 06 Sep 2017 11:17:04 GMT):<br/>
You would need Go installed and `$GOPATH` set
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 06 Sep 2017 11:17:31 GMT):<br/>
the binary will be in `$GOPATH/bin/monax`

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 06 Sep 2017 11:17:31 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 08 Sep 2017 11:37:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying out the Docker container and I'm getting an error: `panic: Panicked on a Sanity Check: Error initializing DB: sync /home/monax/.monax/data/burrowmint/data/burrowmint.db: invalid argument`
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 08 Sep 2017 11:38:37 GMT):<br/>
I copied over the quay.io db image to my own docker repo. So I'd have everything in one spot.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 08 Sep 2017 11:40:14 GMT):<br/>
I'm using this: `docker run -v /c/Users/Robert/Containers/burrowconfig:/home/monax/.monax --rm --name burrow-node robertdiebels/burrow-node` command to run the node/server.
</p>

@marc4gov this isn't something I can reproduce on my linux machine, and I don't have a mac to try this on if it is an issue there. Is `exit status 1` all it outputs? Could you try `monax -d init`? I'm not up-to-date on the state of docker on mac, are you using docker machine?

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 19 Sep 2017 13:18:58 GMT):<br/>
It can, it just requires a proper configuration to be present. A template configuration is documented here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/config/templates.go. Currently it is easier to use the monax tool to generate this, but there is nothing to stop you from using those functions to create your own config or writing it by hand.

Will Burrow have Solidity events implemented for the upcoming 0.8 release? Also, the Solidity documentation says that transactions don't return a value, but there is a note in the seth Go code that return values from transactions will be implemented at some point. Does this mean that the results of the transaction (success-failure) will be returned or that the external function will be allowed to return values? Thx.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sat, 23 Sep 2017 14:18:06 GMT):<br/>
@JamesKempf Burrow does implement solidity events. I'm not sure which release you are referring to with 0.8, are you confusing Burrow and Sawtooth/seth? Seth is integrating parts of the Burrow EVM.

@stingley Is there anything stopping you from upgrading to a more recent version? I believe we dropped the remote compilers concept in 0.17.0 (of the monax tool), I'd recommend using monax 0.18.0

also would like to mention we are behind a proxy, if you know any ports or interactions that monax pkgs do uses( both local and non-local)
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneGiehll</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 05:40:59 GMT):<br/>
that would greatly help

is there any simple configuration for using any of the recent versions behind a proxy? @silasdavis ... 0.17 or 0.18
</p>
<p><strong>stingley</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 10:33:33 GMT):<br/>
we opened ports 1-12000 on our proxy but still couldnt deploy with 0.18 ..

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=sfJFxfNi2tPegQcn2) @silasdavis Thanks. Could you point me to the documentation that answers to the following questsions:
1. Is it possible to add account/validator to the running chain?
2. Is it possible to disable internal cryptocurrency and gas limit and why it is needed in the permissioned blockchain?

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 10:11:37 GMT):<br/>
@ShaneGiehll `monax pkgs do` uses TCP port 46657, and the javascript libraries use 1337
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 11:01:31 GMT):<br/>
@denis4net 
1. 
a) You can add accounts by issuing a `SendTx` which will create the recipient account if it does not exist and sending a `PermissionsTx`. Both are most readily accomplished with the monax tool at the moment, see: https://monax.io/docs/documentation/pm/#epm-definition-files. But the relevant RPC endpoints are also there to be called

b) The ability to mutate the validator set was relatively recently (re)introduced to Tendermint (validator bonding/unbonding had been a feature of eris-db which went on to become Burrow and Tendermint separately). I have integrated the latest Tendermint in a development branch, once stabilised with some other refactoring I'll be in a position to reintroduce validator set changes.

2. 
a) It is not possible to disable it, but it is possible to largely ignore it if you want - by setting large limits or zero fees.

b) It exists for a mixture of vestigial reasons (it's definition is part of Ethereum and provides some level of compatibility) but also some legitimate reasons. It is the 'working fluid' of the blockchain and you have to have some of it to act as in 1a) above it provides a mechanism to create an account (really we imagine all accounts 'exist' a priori but only some have the value and permissions to act), but it also provides a mechanism to prevent infinite loops in our Turing complete machine and to limit the amount of work a (possibly bad) actor can do by controlling the amount of gas they can buy. Whereas permissions are boolean, an account's value is a tunable integer so we can give less to accounts that have no reason to use a lot, or we can meter it out over time by sending it from another account. Having said that the way Burrow prices gas and deals with fees could be improved (fees just vanish), however should you have a use for the token most of the parameters are settable. It is needed for gas consumption at the very least (so we have some termination guarantees). We could definitely think more about the concept of value/gas in a permissioned chain (how to simplify it or how to make better use of it) but frankly it just hasn't got in the way enough to be a problem for us so far.

3. We plan to support a subset of web3 allowing us to use native Ethereum alternatives to legacy-contracts. However I also plan to pull legacy contracts into a monorepo comprising a minimal set of moanx-keys, legacy contracts, monax pkgs, in order to make working with upgraded Burrow easier in the medium term and so the subset we use ourselves can be maintained.

We are quite resourced constrained at the moment, with only really me working on Burrow, and we are building out our own cloud-based platform using it so it is actively receiving some love but my work is focused on our needs (which it helps hone the code base for a specific - still general purpose EVM). On the other side we are ramping up within Hyperledger - on Friday I am meeting with various people from Hyperledger - in order to get more contributions and really launch Burrow as an lean EVM execution engine that works well as a Tendermint app and a library for other chains. So you find us in something of a transitionary period. If you have an interest in using the code and would like to contribute to the upkeep of things like legacy-contracts then we are looking for maintainers and I would be glad to collaborate .
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 11:10:17 GMT):<br/>
You might find this a useful reference to what you can do with `monax pkgs do`: https://github.com/monax/monax/tree/master/tests/jobs_fixtures
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 11:12:32 GMT):<br/>
it's the actual tests we run against Burrow, with a bit of experimentation you should be able to understand how things work. https://monax.io/docs/getting-started/ is also relevant, but I am afraid not currently maintained. As I say, this is a period of transition for us.

Hi @silasdavis , I wanted to introduce myself. I am Dan Conway one of the founders of www.cubeform.io  A newly forming consultancy firm in the space. We are joining the hyperledger foundation and hope to contribute however we can. I am formerly one of the lead developers of Expanse, a smart contract platform that implemented the EVM on its chain, and as such have a decent understanding of the evm and ethereums internals. I have long been a fan of eris/monax, infact often referencing it to the rest of the expanse team for the kind of project we should model ourselves after. Anyways, I am looking forward to working with you to contribute to burrow and hyperledger as a whole.

Hey guys, question on Burrow accounts. Let's say I generate roughly 3000 accounts. Do all of those have to be validators in the network? Or is it possible to only have 50 of them validate?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:56:31 GMT):<br/>
Validators and accounts are entirely independent concepts so yes
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:56:51 GMT):<br/>
usually we talk about participants and validators

</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:57:06 GMT):<br/>
we would usually expect them to be disjoint too, but this is not a requirement

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:58:31 GMT):<br/>
that is a 'simple chain' genesis that has a single account that is both a validator and a participant
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:59:23 GMT):<br/>
it's not obvious that the validator is the same because you'd have to ripemd160 the public key, but it is, as sort of implied by the unbond_to address 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 15:00:06 GMT):<br/>
BTW, I don't know Tendermint would cope with 3000 validators, i've never tried :)

@stingley could you provide a test case that demonstrates the issue, including what you expect the value to be? I assume that solidity compiler precomputes the value in the literal case. I'd need to take a look at the generated bytecode to understand the divergence
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 16:55:24 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels that should be used by `monax chains start --init-dir <chain dir> <chain name>` as the image that will be used as the node

</p>
<p><strong>stingley</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 05:06:44 GMT):<br/>
there is a contract with a set function and 2 get functions to show the divergence ... the Javascript file prints the 2 hashed values @silasdavis ... we figured out that 0x is being prepended in the memory case so if we add that it matches
</p>
<p><strong>stingley</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 05:07:36 GMT):<br/>
could be a bug in the monax contracts library? since as I said the remix compiler of the same version gives us what we expect

hi Burrow gurus, I'm new to this project and trying to understand some background and history here, particularly I'm trying to understand the relation between Burrow, Monax, Tendermin, erid_db. IIUC, eris_db is *renamed* to Burrow, and it's using Tendermint as underlying bft consensus implementation. Is Monax a commercial distribution of Burrow? please correct me if I'm wrong. Thx!
</p>

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:08:09 GMT):<br/>
@guoger as far as I know Monax (company) originally started under the name of Eris. Burrow was first called ErisDB, MonaxDB and then Burrow when it was moved to the Hyperledger project.
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:32:57 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels thanks! so what's the relation between Monax(the project https://github.com/monax/monax/) and Burrow?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:33:48 GMT):<br/>
Clones I believe.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:33:55 GMT):<br/>
Or mirrors.
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:36:28 GMT):<br/>
the structure looks quite different tho... I'm trying to follow getting-started tutorial https://monax.io/docs/getting-started/, and one of the container it starts actually executes `burrow serve`. So I guess `Monax` is somehow a wrapper/set of tooling to interact with `Burrow`?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:37:58 GMT):<br/>
Yes the CLI is.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:38:08 GMT):<br/>
It generates the configuration for a Burrow node
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:42:33 GMT):<br/>
is Monax is simply a cli tool to interact with Burrow, why isn't it included in Burrow then?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:44:28 GMT):<br/>
That's not a question I can answer
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:44:51 GMT):<br/>
I only know that the CLI to generate Burrow config is named `monax`
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:48:27 GMT):<br/>
That's good enough! thank you sir! I feel `Monax` as a project also comes with some other tools, e.g. `monax-keys`, `compilers` etc that are necessary to build a `Burrow` network and application on top of it.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:49:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes correct.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:50:24 GMT):<br/>
By my knowledge those are used as part of the configuration generation. What they do exactly I don't know.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:50:49 GMT):<br/>
I might not be correct though. Someone from the Burrow team could shed more light on that.

@guoger Monax (formerly Eris) is the company behind Burrow (formerly eris-db) and monax (formerly eris) is the command line developer tooling suite
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 10:17:19 GMT):<br/>
The supporting services/projects of keys/compilers (no longer needed)/legacy-contracts.js/legacy.db are not strictly necessary to run a Burrow chain

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 10:17:43 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 10:18:53 GMT):<br/>
but you'd have to read the Burrow code and sample files to do this (not impossible, and I think @RobertDiebels runs things 'from scratch')
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 10:19:07 GMT):<br/>
the monax tool makes heavy use of docker
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 10:19:21 GMT):<br/>
which gives some nice developer experience benefits, but does obscure certain things
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 10:19:50 GMT):<br/>
Also we have some core functionality in the sub-command `monax pkgs do` which is really the only way to deploy contracts to Burrow
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 10:20:37 GMT):<br/>
You should read my TSC post to understand more, but I am working on a more 'batteries included' experience with just Burrow, and to reduce our maintenance overhead
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 10:21:14 GMT):<br/>
the monax tooling provides some uniquely useful stuff, but the coupling between it and Burrow currently is not ideal, and we would really need some assistance from the community to maintain some of the features
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 10:23:07 GMT):<br/>
One key way to make Burrow more standalone is to provide a web3 RPC layer (so Ethereum tooling will work with Burrow out of the box), and that is on the roadmap - the first step of which - unifying our RPC logic I have done on my branch here, with this service: https://github.com/silasdavis/burrow/blob/bosmarmot/rpc/service.go which I intend to use as the basis for implementing a web3 interface
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 14:44:49 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis yea I use the RPC layer. Btw could you take a look at my previous question?

Hey guys just a quick question.. where do the EVM smart contracts live? is there a scaling plan where the contracts can live on the cloud as opposed to the blockchain and anchored onto the chain? since its permissioned does that mean that data does not necessarily have to be onchain and can be offchain?

@silasdavis Hey! I'm using the npm package @Monax/Legacy-contracts to interact with my Monax 17 deployed contracts and i seem to be having an issue when calling the 'selfdestruct(address)' method in solidity 0.4.4. when calling my method, kill(){selfdestruct([msg.sender | tx.origin | 0x0...]);//i use one of those}, I receive a ''transact and hold" error. what is very odd to me is that every time this happens my chain breaks. Have you ever heard of something like this happening before?
</p>
<p><strong>shaneG</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 21:40:20 GMT):<br/>
have also tried selfdestruct(this)

I'm trying to follow the [getting started guide](https://monax.io/docs/getting-started/) and got a problem. Essentially what I did is:
```
$ monax chains make firstchain --account-types=Root:2,Full:1 --unsafe
$ monax chains start firstchain --init-dir $chain_dir_this
$ monax pkgs do --chain firstchain --address $addr
```
The output of `monax ls` is:
```
SERVICE        ON     VERSION
compilers      *      0.18.0
keys           *      0.17.0

CHAIN          ON     VERSION
firstchain     *      0.17.0
```
However, the `epm.output.json` only contains:
```
{
  "assertStorage": "",
  "defaultAddr": "92D306F1E82E3C16F9CB513402D6A49D38CB2C8A",
  "deployStorageK": "",
  "queryStorage": "",
  "setStorage": "",
  "setStorageBase": ""
}%
```
Whereas I'm expecting tx hash, addr of deployment, per statement in that guide:
>  You should see the output in jobs_output.json which will have the transaction hash of the transactions as well as the address of the deployed idi.sol contract.

Your help is appreciated!

@guoger regarding the documentation claiming you will see transaction hashes then that looks like it is out of date. I for the epm.output.json:
```
{
  "assertStorage": "passed",
  "defaultAddr": "AE930451D830D456C80A14ED4DF6B20582578B1D",
  "deployStorageK": "9C79F0654D7631ED7293A320A5A586DBC3C5C121",
  "queryStorage": "17",
  "setStorage": ""
}
```
Where the deployStorageK value is the address of the idi contract
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:55:11 GMT):<br/>
I'm really sorry but I don't have any time to dig in support our monax tool other than to say it should work and does for me.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:56:10 GMT):<br/>
@shaneG We are not web3 compatible, this is something that is planned and I am expecting to get multiple development resources to help do this. Another place to look is with the sawtooth lake team of have integrated (a slightly older) version of the burrow EVM and have an experimental web3 client.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:56:48 GMT):<br/>
This might help with where I am at: https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-tsc/2017-October/001163.html
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:58:25 GMT):<br/>
Burrow is a state of flux, but I think there is a lot of promise and willing from the Hyperledger community to give us some momentum. But I'm afraid for now you would need to deploy using the Monax tool or our APIs directly. We are aiming for web3 compatibility and to maintain a subset of our tooling. But my priority now is working the Burrow's EVM and the current refactor which i hope to have a version to develop the end of next week
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:00:40 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ the link you posted looks like an idea to provide a better ABI for certain purposes. This is the metadata that tells you how to formulate EVM code to call functions deployed with a language like solidity. This is handled a layer below Burrow, which is not ABI-aware it just runs EVM code. The monax tool uses the existing ethereum ABI code to do that work when formulating transactions. So the answer is 'no', but also perhaps the question doesn't quite apply to Burrow ;)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:01:22 GMT):<br/>
@denis4net ethermint is a bolt-on of Tendermint to go-ethereum. It uses go-ethereum's GPL licensed EVM implementation
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:01:47 GMT):<br/>
Burrow has its own implementation of the EVM which is simpler than go-ethereum in some ways and licensed under Apache
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:02:24 GMT):<br/>
the vision for Burrow is to be a fast single process Tendermint + liberally licensed EVM on the one hand, and a good EVM library on the other hand for integration with other platforms
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:02:49 GMT):<br/>
Burrow also has native permissioning deeply hooked into the EVM and a functionality for calling native code called SNatives
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:03:44 GMT):<br/>
I want to make Burrow a lean library for running EVM code with extensibility for permissioned/enterprise use cases
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:04:27 GMT):<br/>
that also happens to have a standalone mode where it operates as a full stack blockchain on its own using Tendermint if you don't need the flexibility of Sawtooth or Fabric

@denis4net would like to work on deploying burrow without monax, on base install of core client. Does documentation for doing this exist?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 14:46:02 GMT):<br/>
@robertdavid010 I have some code that I am using while I am running the integration tests for Burrow that will help with deploying Burrow here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/657
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 14:47:40 GMT):<br/>
in particular: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/hypermarmot/genesis/spec/genesis_spec.go
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 14:48:19 GMT):<br/>
provides a way of describing a template GenesisDoc (and so GenesisState) and a new 'configure' command will convert that to a Burrow configuration generating keys along the way
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 14:48:48 GMT):<br/>
It has a dependency on running a keys service, our version of which is is still bound up with the monax tooling
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 14:49:45 GMT):<br/>
but just so you are aware, this should be helpful, though the current 'burrow serve' will work standalone with the appropriate genesis.json and priv_validator.json
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 14:50:30 GMT):<br/>
The upcoming version will no longer reads private keys directly from the filesystem but uses the monax-keys interface for signing
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 14:51:04 GMT):<br/>
Here's an example one-liner that create a chain template, configures it, and runs Burrow: `burrow spec --participant-accounts 2 --full-accounts 1 | burrow configure --genesis-spec=- --validator-index 0 | burrow -c-`
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 14:56:22 GMT):<br/>
Though I'm afraid this version is still a work-in-progress and requires an updated version of monax pkgs do or monax/legacy-contracts.js to deploy contracts
</p>
<p><strong>robertdavid010</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 18:37:13 GMT):<br/>
thank you
</p>
<p><strong>robertdavid010</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 18:38:43 GMT):<br/>
I may just start digging in and work up my own ad hoc deploy....

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=ugSjDJHwFPRNzTHPd) @silasdavis I got some time today and looked into this problem. The [doc](https://monax.io/docs/deploying-advanced-smart-contracts-to-a-chain/) needs to be updated. `set`, `deploy` etc should be top-level fields, instead of being nested in `job`. So `epm.yaml` should be:
```
jobs:

- name: deployGSFactory
  job:
    deploy:
      contract: GSFactory.sol
      instance: all

- name: createGSContract
  job:
    call:
      destination: $deployGSFactory
      data: create
      abi: GSFactory

- name:  getGSAddr
  job:
    query-contract:
      destination: $deployGSFactory
      data: getLast
      abi: $deployGSFactory

- name: assertAddr
  job:
    assert:
      key: $getGSAddr
      relation: eq
      val: $createGSContract

- name: setStorage

The logging config provides a fairly powerful way to arbitrarily filter or annotate logs, but is not terribly well documented at the moment, and really needs a mechanism for spitting out presets to use as a basis to write a config to your needs
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 14:00:19 GMT):<br/>
However in the meantime there is a little introduction here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/config/templates.go#L298-L324 and there is a stub command you could edit to your needs here that will help you generate logging config: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/util/logging/cmd/main.go 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 14:01:25 GMT):<br/>
that little command line app is using a sort of fluent logging sink interfaces so if you have auto-completion in a Go editor or IDE you should find it fairly discoverable 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 14:01:55 GMT):<br/>
the example there shows you how to build a filter

Unfortunately TOML is not a particularly nice language for writing down recursive data structures, but here is what it would look like:

        output_type = "stderr"

    [[logging.root_sink.sinks]]
      [logging.root_sink.sinks.transform]
        transform_type = "filter"
        filter_mode = "exclude_when_all_match"

        [[logging.root_sink.sinks.transform.predicates]]
          key_regex = "module"
          value_regex = "p2p"

        [[logging.root_sink.sinks.transform.predicates]]
          key_regex = "captured_logging_source"
          value_regex = "tendermint_log15"

      [[logging.root_sink.sinks.sinks]]
        [logging.root_sink.sinks.sinks.output]
          output_type = "syslog"
          url = ""
          tag = "Burrow-network"

      [[logging.root_sink.sinks.sinks]]

Looking to use burrow as a test-bed for a project. I'm quite fond of the modularity the Tendermint engine provides, and I think is is really great what you guys have done with it  in the Burrow project (as well as the Monax configuration and deployment tool set)!

hi everybody,
i have an issue in starting monax

monax is already the newest version (0.18.0-1).
You can run "apt-get -f install" to fix these problems:
The following packages contain unmet dependencies:
 rocketchat: Depends: libappindicator1 but will not be installed
E: Dependencies not satisfied. Try "apt-get -f install" without package
(or indicate a solution).
root @ abb-HP-ProDesk-400-G1-SFF: ~ # monax init
The command "monax" was not found, did you mean:
 The "mona" command of the "mona" (universe) package
monax: command not found *

any idea please i tried the solution proposed in the "Tutorials | Trouble Shooting Your Installation" page 'https://monax.io/docs/install-troubleshooting/' & didn't work for me !

@AYOUB_HAMIDI I suggest you install directly from the monax repo: https://github.com/monax/monax
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 14:14:13 GMT):<br/>
i.e.
```
go get github.com/monax/monax/cmd/monax
monax init
```

hi is burrow alternative to ethereum
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 19 Dec 2017 18:37:00 GMT):<br/>
From https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/README.md: Hyperledger Burrow is a permissioned Ethereum smart-contract blockchain node. It executes Ethereum smart contract code on a permissioned virtual machine. Burrow provides transaction finality and high transaction throughput on a proof-of-stake Tendermint consensus engine.

Hi all, happy holidays. I am exploring Burrow / Seth at the moment and I am having a little trouble building burrow from source. Glide keeps prompting me for my github information when fetching the tendermint/go-clist package. It appears that this package may have been moved to ```https://github.com/tendermint/tmlibs/tree/master/clist```

Hey @compleatang , I made an issue and a PR (issue #660)
</p>
<p><strong>tommling</strong> (Fri, 29 Dec 2017 18:33:45 GMT):<br/>
It seems that this is more of a problem with v0.9.2 of tendermint, which in a sanity test I tried installing in isolation and I hit the same error
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 29 Dec 2017 18:40:24 GMT):<br/>
Could be. It was around then that they were moving around a bunch of pkgs IIRC. Silas has a tmint upgrade in the works AFAIK. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 29 Dec 2017 18:40:32 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the pr!

<p><strong>tommling</strong> (Fri, 29 Dec 2017 18:43:26 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, i think its moot
</p>
<p><strong>tommling</strong> (Fri, 29 Dec 2017 18:43:40 GMT):<br/>
I was about to propose a new tmint version would be the most elegant fix

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 02 Jan 2018 10:48:08 GMT):<br/>
@tommling you will be able to build master with `make install_vendor && make build` - we have been using glide for dependency management so our dependencies are not checked in
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 02 Jan 2018 10:48:32 GMT):<br/>
the development branch I am referring to is 'hypermarmot' not 'develop', for now I would recommend sticking with master

is it possible to have a light weight client node? Because if I want to develop a dapp, I would like to interact with the light node...
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 12:40:19 GMT):<br/>
This is something I would like to provide. Tendermint has a proof-of-concept for this here: https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/master/lite 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 12:40:38 GMT):<br/>
however we use Tendermint in a more tightly bound way than via its RPC
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 12:44:59 GMT):<br/>
What we generally do now is talk to a trusted full node over our RPCs - so your dapp does not need to run a co-located instance (though I would like to move to this for signing purposes)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 12:45:42 GMT):<br/>
I would consider a proper light client as an improvement to this with the possibility of fetching proofs from multiple validators
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 12:46:35 GMT):<br/>
the light client would act as a special type of cryptographically verifying RPC proxy - I think this might fit into the broader arc of work on the RPC

Hey! I am building solidity smart contracts for buying and storing energy, and I am planning to put them on the hyperledger Burrow. However, I wonder on the scalability of Burrow. How many transactions could Burrow process every second? Assuming an average system with normal bandwidth between nodes, ca. 100 nodes and that a transaction use 21 000 gas.. Do anyone have an estimation? cheers

Hi, I am thinking of using Burrow in my project. One thing I am interested in: does Burrow support `block.coinbase` (I need to know the current validator) and if not, when is it going to be supported?

@mohit.sharma we are in the process of refactoring some documentation. The best resource is still: https://monax.io/docs/ but there may be some out-of-date details
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:27:41 GMT):<br/>
@mohit.sharma that looks like a docker address, if you are working locally try `localhost:1337` that port should be published to host

@silasdavis I am able to communicate with myChain through Monax CLI but unable to connect through nodejs module, can you help me out in that?? 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:33:27 GMT):<br/>
@fredrbl I couldn't give you a good estimate now, other than to say it would almost certainly be network-request bound - it might be worth asking tendermint if they have data for 100 node networks - our scaling will be similar, though with that gas usage (note our gas schedule is a little different to public ethereum - mostly because we don't need to care about it much and it hasn't changed in a while) you might start to see some computational bound. These numbers are something I would be interested in myself, and when I get round to load testing our own networks will have. If you would like to run some benchmarks I can find somewhere to take them as contributions and build on in the future.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:33:52 GMT):<br/>
@mohit.sharma  they are different RPCs

<p><strong>mohit.sharma</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:35:30 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis version 0.17.1
</p>
<p><strong>mohit.sharma</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:37:46 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis  specifically i want to deply contract on burrow and also communicate with the contract as well as with the burrow server, I try to use @monax/legacy-db and @monax/legacy-contracts, but get stuck over the connection url part
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:37:49 GMT):<br/>
@eugene-babichenko as in `block.miner` in https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getblockbyhash ?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:39:17 GMT):<br/>
If so, then I think 'no and never' is the direct answer because our consensus mechanism does not work on the basis of providing block rewards to a miner. We use the proof-of-authority/proof-of-stage round robin Tendermint consensus engine
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:41:02 GMT):<br/>
there is a block proposer for each round (who's turn it is to propose), but I would need to understand what you are trying to achieve before recommending that
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:41:20 GMT):<br/>
@mohit.sharma have you tried using localhost?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:41:47 GMT):<br/>
`curl localhost:1337/network` as a smoke test
</p>
<p><strong>mohit.sharma</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:41:52 GMT):<br/>
yes! I tried..
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:42:01 GMT):<br/>
and you launched using docker?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:42:24 GMT):<br/>
can you send `docker ps` output

@silasdavis I just need to get the address of the validator who signed the last block.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:50:33 GMT):<br/>
ordinarily all validators sign every block - what are you trying to use this information for?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:53:05 GMT):<br/>
@mohit.sharma looks like you are able to contact the V0 (JS) rpc using localhost. I'm sorry but I don't have time right now to help you debug your issue further. I want to provide a more up-to-date hello world/node test case. I have just re-uploaded an out-of-date sample repository here: https://github.com/silasdavis/hello-doug. I'm afraid a lot of it is out-of-date so you'll have to read the code to work out how to update it.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:54:00 GMT):<br/>
the error you are getting looks like you don't have a proper private key set but rather the string `privKey` ... ?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:54:19 GMT):<br/>
I will post a hello world that works against our current libs in the next few days

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=5ifyR3KdwBDQbZBzG) @fredrbl We'd absolutely love community assistance in providing such a benchmarking system. it should not be too difficult to construct and we'd be happy to pull it into the CI/CD system to allow everyone to track performance based on usage patterns like you suggest. This is something the entire ethereum community could leverage to provide strong comparison across permissioned EVM chain designs.

Hello all, I am new and just started building my first blockchain this past week using hyperledger. This blockchain framework satisfies most of my needs for the appliation I want to develop. The only piece I see lacking from what I need is a cryptocurrency component that would allow for value exchange when queries are executed (e.g. I want to transfer value from the participant that is querying the data to the person that owns the data.) Does anyone have suggestions about what I can do to or use to make this happen while still using Hyperledger? 
</p>

@gaurav94 you need to use `Send` or `SendAndHold` on the 1337 RPC to the target account, then you will need to use a `PermissionTx` or the permissions snatives. I'm afraid I do have an example to hand and I do not have the time over the next 2 weeks to create one. However we are in the process of getting some help to revive some old tutorials that show you how to do this with the JS libs.

Hey guys, question. Can the container `monax/monax` [ https://quay.io/repository/monax/monax?tab=tags ] be used to create monax configuration on Windows using the Docker Toolbox? If so, how do I run the image locally? Because I can't seem to get it to boot.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 16:39:43 GMT):<br/>
My goal is to create a  Kubernetes cluster for Hyperledger Burrow. I'd rather not use the container to create the necessary configuration inside the cluster though. As running in Kubernets requires changes to the seed-ips and the moniker and I'd rather change the configuration off-cluster.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=EwdM5oQsPyXd5XaJz) For those interested. I managed to answer my own question. If you're on Windows and you want to generate configuration for Burrow. Simply do the following.  Install Docker Toolbox (or native), afterwards run the following commands: ```docker run --rm -v /windows/hostpath:/root/.monax -it --privileged --name monax-cli -d quay.io/monax/monax:0.18.0-dind /bin/bash
docker exec monax-cli monax init --yes
docker exec monax-cli monax chains make kubechain --account-types=Full:1,Validator:3 --unsafe```

with snak you will have these facilities:

    Easily install and uninstall hyperledger burrow.
    Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment.
    Having interaction with blockchain(Burrow) directly via linux terminal.
    Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai(will be added in future).
    Network management for deploying to many public & private networks.
    Interactive console for direct contract communication(will be added in future).

var myAccount = burrow.accounts();
myAccount.genPrivAccount(accounts.node1_full_000, function(error, result){
if (!error){
console.log('result = ', JSON.stringify(result,null,4));
}
else{
console.log(error);
}
});

I am able to get the address along with pubKey and PrivKey but I cannot see this account is added in blockchain when I run the below code:

function showAccounts(error,data){
if(data){
var str = JSON.stringify(data,null,4);
console.log(str);
} 
else{
console.log(error); 
}
}

var loadAccounts = ()=>{
var burrow = burrowDbFactory.createInstance("http://localhost:1337/rpc");
var accounts = burrow.accounts();
accounts.getAccounts(showAccounts);
}

Neither any file in burrow chain are reflected.
I was going through issue list and found the same issue on github: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/227
As our team is looking for this solution earliest.
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

@gaurav94  I think there is no issue with this function
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 08:11:30 GMT):<br/>
@gaurav94  this function only creates the key pair based on the Ed25519 and does not have any effect on the blockchain 
</p>
<p><strong>gaurav94</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 08:13:16 GMT):<br/>
So it would be helpful for me if any one suggest me the method to create a account using rpc endpoint using node js?
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 08:14:12 GMT):<br/>
@gaurav94  I think you need to do this : Pipe.addAccount(accountData)
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 08:14:56 GMT):<br/>
@gaurav94  it's in legacy-contracts.js  https://github.com/monax/legacy-contracts.js
</p>
<p><strong>gaurav94</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 08:17:31 GMT):<br/>
thanks @pouladzade ..:)  I will try for it n get back :)

<p><strong>gaurav94</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 08:57:40 GMT):<br/>
@pouladzade  I appreciate your help on this, but Pipe.addAccount(accountData) adds account temporary in local catch of DevPipe object but doesn't reflect in blockchain. 
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 09:00:12 GMT):<br/>
@gaurav94 I see, actually I am going to implement create account for Burrow, Whenever I get it done I will get back to u

Hey guys I thought I'd update you on my progress with Kubernetes.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:27:34 GMT):<br/>
I was struggling to get things running for quite some time. Apparently Tendermint has a bit of code that forces `seeds` to be actual IP addresses.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:27:34 GMT):<br/>
I was struggling to get things running for quite some time. Apparently Tendermint has a [bit of code that forces](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/a1a5cb59a70e3075dbfc58614d2f1b83d5ad2a8b/p2p/netaddress.go) `seeds` to be actual IP addresses.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:29:21 GMT):<br/>
I tried using DNS to tell Burrow where to find other validators as this is much easier. Pod IP's are dynamic and they can change at any time.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:29:52 GMT):<br/>
It took me a while to find out that Tendermint doesn't do a lookup for dns.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:30:04 GMT):<br/>
As the error message is really cryptic.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:30:39 GMT):<br/>
This was the message: ` Error in address kubechain-full-000.burrow.burrow.svc.cluster.local:46656: lookup kubechain-full-000.burrow.burrow.svc.cluster.local: no such host`
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:32:28 GMT):<br/>
The address/name is fine. It just isn't an IP address.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:34:23 GMT):<br/>
Right now I'm thinking of writing an init-container which does a lookup for the DNS-names. Then replaces them with IP-addresses in the config.toml.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:34:45 GMT):<br/>
It's a bit hacky though and I'd rather be able to just use dns-names.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:43:53 GMT):<br/>
I just spotted a mistake. They also do a LookupIP to get an IPaddress for a host.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 19:22:08 GMT):<br/>
Ok I think I found the issue. But I would like to check with either @pouladzade or @silasdavis . Am I correct in assuming that if Burrow cannot launch Tendermint for whatever reason, burrow stops running?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 19:22:47 GMT):<br/>
If so, my problem is due to that.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 19:30:02 GMT):<br/>
Since Kubernetes expects a container to keep on running. If it does not it restarts a pod. In this case I have 4 pods and each pod is added as a seed via its DNS name within the cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 19:31:29 GMT):<br/>
My assumption here is that all seeds need to be up at the same time for the lookup to succeed. So my 4 pods need to be up at the same time. Which they are not.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 19:34:20 GMT):<br/>
What I'm seeing is this. 
1. First pod goes up.
2. Second pod goes up.
3. First pod can resolve the second pod.
4. First pod cannot resolve the third pod.
5. First pod crashes and restarts.
6. Other pods come up.
7. They also crash because the first pod is busy restarting.
8. Now we are in a loop where the pods keep restarting and trying to find each other.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 19:35:33 GMT):<br/>
So my request would be to not stop the application if it cannot find all seeds. Instead it should retry and only stop retrying after X amount of time.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 11:14:32 GMT):<br/>
Hi again, I created [a feature request](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1230) in the Tendermint repository. I believe this is something that should be solved by them since Burrow doesn't and shouldn't know what caused Tendermint to crash.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 15:30:02 GMT):<br/>
On the move Robert but sounds like we can do better on this. I'm moving onto deployment stuff next week I'll see how I get on and look into what you're saying here in a bit more detail 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:02:02 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis No problem :D . I just checked the issue I've created in Tendermint and it's been moved into the TO-DO list for Tendermint 0.16.0

Hi All<
</p>
<p><strong>ragu</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 04:41:44 GMT):<br/>
Hi All,
I want to connect burrow server using monax/legacy-db to access burrow chain functionality.
I am using node js for burrow server connectivity.But when i am going to connect with burrow server ,i am receiving following error.I don't have a clear idea to how to resolve this issue.If any body know the solution of this issue ,that will more helpful for my future process.

I am using following code for that process,

var burrowFactory = require('');
let chainUrl = 'http://localhost:1337/rpc';
let accounts = require('./accounts.json');
var burrow = burrowFactory.createInstance(chainUrl);
var myAccount = burrow.accounts();
myAccount.genPrivAccount(accounts.node1_full_000, function(error, result){
if (!error){
console.log('result = ', JSON.stringify(result,null,4));
}
else{
console.log(error);
}
});

Error:

has anyone tried using burrow as a side-chain? any good leads/docs ?
</p>
<p><strong>gaurav94</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 09:41:13 GMT):<br/>
Is there any way to start the chain from the last block height we stopped the chain?? Coz if we stop the chain and try to start again it reads the chain till the last block stopped and then continue to start the chain after that
</p>

@gaurav94 I'm not sure I understand the question. I can't really make sense of:
> Coz if we stop the chain and try to start again it reads the chain till the last block stopped and then continue to start the chain after that

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 12:45:19 GMT):<br/>
When Burrow is restarted it will have Tendermint replay all blocks up to the latest block known to the Tendermint network
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 12:45:53 GMT):<br/>
Burrow will load the nodes local DB on 0.17.0 and then replay any it is missing
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 12:46:05 GMT):<br/>
current develop will actually have Tendermint replay the lot on restart

Hello everyone, I am coming straight from ethereum platform. Was trying to get a better understanding of burrow. Came to know it uses monax. Which should I know first? Both are new to me
</p>

@pouladzade looks interesting, I think the readme could do a brief section on the motivation for writing the library and an idea of the problem Seriality is trying to solve. Also I personally find the `_underscore` naming convention hideously, hideously ugly :) but that might be one of those sectarian unresolvable disputes...

@RobertDiebels great - it would be good for you to have a go deploying develop - what will become burrow 0.18.0 - some fairly significant changes there

@silasdavis could you explain what you mean by: 'it would be good for you to have a go deploying develop'? Did you mean a binary I could run instead of the dind-container? Because I fully agree with that. Would ease the deployment significantly.
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 13:22:24 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis I applied some of your suggestions on Seriality, Thanks again :)

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 14:06:19 GMT):<br/>
@pouladzade I've added the code from your ticket to a test that I will add to  Bosmarmot's test suite: https://github.com/silasdavis/bosmarmot/tree/app39-remix-byte-cast/monax/tests/jobs_fixtures/app39-sign-extension 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 14:07:06 GMT):<br/>
I'm wondering if we could integrate a more complete test case from Seriality
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 14:07:50 GMT):<br/>
They way we do it is to have the solidity files along with an epm.yaml that deploys, tests, and makes assertions about the return results in the same directory
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 14:09:16 GMT):<br/>
If you clone bosmarmot and run `make test_integration` it runs all of them. The one on my branch needs you to run a more recent Burrow though
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 14:16:59 GMT):<br/>
If you want to try the test I have written you'd need to install monax-keys:

```
go get github.com/monax/bosmarmot/keys/cmd/monax-keys

```
 And Burrow from my SIGNEXTEND fix PR then run:

```

cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/monax/bosmarmot/monax/tests/ && rm -rf .burrow && burrow &
monax-keys server --port 48002 --dir $GOPATH/src/github.com/monax/bosmarmot &
boot=false $GOPATH/src/github.com/monax/bosmarmot/monax/tests/test_jobs.sh app39
```

Which will run the test with local keys and burrow
</p>
<p><strong>kevinstr</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 17:21:21 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis I'll ask it here. I've e-mailed your company (Monax) several times to different addresses for premium support for my university. An answer would be nice.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=Exqtqi6pJBSL8PAmR) @RobertDiebels I mean to use the develop branch of Burrow which does things fairly differently - different config, no priv_vaidator file (keys instead). Wat you have there against 0.17.0 unfortunately will not work for 0.18.0, which will have many fixes and enhancements

I've considered splitting my adapters into separate packages and let users decide which versions to use. I think doing that should help with differences per version, like the ones you just mentioned. Right now I'm focusing on getting everything up and running in AWS.

Is it possible to make users able to login using burrow?
</p>
<p><strong>kevinstr</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 15:23:59 GMT):<br/>
for example: a users login, invokes a smart contract, and another user receives a self-made token (I made the token when configuring the blockchain)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 15:25:18 GMT):<br/>
@TanmoyBanerjee yes, you can execute solidity on burrow. cost is an enterprise model .. i.e. gas is finite but free.

Hi team,

Could anyone tell me what a root, participant and full account is? I use them when I invoke the command "monax chains make --acount-types=Root:1,full1,Participant:1
</p>
<p><strong>kevinstr</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 08:37:21 GMT):<br/>
nvm :) I found the definitions in the account-type folder.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 13:28:01 GMT):<br/>
@kakuzu our documentation of the permissions is a little indirect at the moment. I have someone working on producing an up-to-date and reasonably comprehensive tutorial/primer. Until then worth looking at how we manipulate permissions with monax pkgs do: https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/blob/master/monax/tests/jobs_fixtures/app03-basic_and_advanced_permission_txs_and_queries/epm.yaml. You can also see the possible permissions enumerated here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/permission/permissions.go#L28 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 13:28:21 GMT):<br/>
You can also run `make snatives` to generate our native permission contract
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 13:28:37 GMT):<br/>
I'll aim to add some more detailed comments to the permissions code when I have time.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 13:28:53 GMT):<br/>
@kevinstr that's right - how they are defined now
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 13:29:40 GMT):<br/>
I also have some contributors working on documenting the overall design/structure of Burrow
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 13:57:40 GMT):<br/>
@kakuzu to try and answer you question. Permissions are granted to accounts either by values set in the genesis.json or by calling our SNative (secure native) contract that handles permissions (exampe usage: https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/tree/master/monax/tests/jobs_fixtures/app33-evm_connection_edb_permissions_and_roles_layer)

Hello everybody.

I've got a very general question. Is Burrow more mature than Fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>PascalVerlinden</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 21:00:38 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis Hi Silas, we're using Monax / Burrow for a POC and encounter an issue with version 0.17 and 0.18. This can be reproduced with the code in the repo on  https://github.com/pascalverlinden/perfo and the readme contains more information.
Could be related to the version of Tendermint used by Monax, but I'm not sure. 
I would appreciate any help.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 14:01:17 GMT):<br/>
@PascalVerlinden reproduction looks good - though I haven't tried it yet. Can you create an issue on https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/ with a link to that repo and I'll try to get to it. You can copy paste from repo don't worry about proforma 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 14:08:06 GMT):<br/>
@kevinstr It depends what you mean by mature. Burrow (formerly eris-db) is older than Fabric - one of the oldest permissioned ledgers (well before Hyperledger) with the first code written in December 2014 which branched off to become Tendermint. Because of this the codebase has gone through some gymnastics - from consensus engine + EVM, to separate EVM + state + snatives, to its current incarnation as a EVM library and Tendermint harness. It has had quite a few interesting things built on it and I will be putting into production for Monax. It has some dark corners, and some things I would like to change, but I would argue the basics are solid and it has real BFT consensus through Tendermint.

On the other hand

On the other hand Fabric is younger but will certainly be older in terms of developer-hours and number of eyes on the codebase. It has a lot of mindshare, good tooling, good community, and good developers. It has an expansive design and is highly pluggable. It does not provide a BFT consensus (in their model, ordering) service.

Both Sawtooth Lake and Fabric are great projects with broader goals than Burrow. And they are both integrating Burrow's EVM see #sawtooth-seth and #fabric-evm. Burrow's future is being 'in the mix' in projects with pluggable consensus and arbitrary transaction processors. Burrow as a standalone unit provides a fast simple EVM and consensus engine all in a single process and single language. This is how I see Burrow's niche - the 'redis of blockchain'.

PS Glad to see you're carrying on the marmot legacy with bosmarmot even with Preston gone...
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:12:47 GMT):<br/>
Ethermint actually is an Go Ethereum node(application layer) which uses the Tendermint so you can use all the tools which are compatible with ethereum specification like web3.js truffle, remix, mist, ....
</p>
<p><strong>snowy13</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:14:15 GMT):<br/>
Right gotcha...but no permissions right?
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:14:55 GMT):<br/>
and as far as I know and work with doesn't have the permission 
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:16:10 GMT):<br/>
The very important feature of Burrow is to support the permission, so you can have a privileged blockchain   
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:16:59 GMT):<br/>
Burrow handles the permissions withe the native contracts
</p>
<p><strong>snowy13</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:19:04 GMT):<br/>
And of course the burrow fork of web3.js has been refactored to run server side right?
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:20:48 GMT):<br/>
I just know they used the part of web3 codes in Legacy_db and legacy_contracts, if i am not mistaken
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:21:21 GMT):<br/>
but what do you mean the server side???
</p>
<p><strong>snowy13</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:22:00 GMT):<br/>
My bad..not sure
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:24:15 GMT):<br/>
Web3 is a javascript library which provides the interface to communicate with ethereum node
</p>
<p><strong>snowy13</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 19:21:15 GMT):<br/>
Got confused lol, its been a while. legacy-contracts.js would not load client side.
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 19:38:08 GMT):<br/>
legacy-contracts is something like web3 , for communicating with Burrow's node through the rpc-json 
</p>
<p><strong>snowy13</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 20:02:39 GMT):<br/>
Right. Bottom line though, no point in using ethermint for a permissioned chain network right?
</p>
<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Sat, 10 Mar 2018 05:40:59 GMT):<br/>
No pint

<p><strong>pouladzade</strong> (Sat, 10 Mar 2018 05:40:59 GMT):<br/>

Actually I'm trying to make 1000 request to put data in burrow chain in parallel. When my CPU utilisation is 10%-15% it runs normally but after the execution its CPU utilisation come to 50%-60% which remain the same then after and again when I try to make same 1000 request again on burrow chain the chain stops as shown in above image with the CPU utilisation 100%.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=R3ZKCmKdNQtnRYR2e) @gaurav94 I have the same problem on Monax 0.17 & 0.18, and something similar on the latest develop git version (see PascalVerlinden & my comment above). Made a plot that shows CPU usage of burrow as more contracts are created: https://plot.ly/~joeri.exelmans/1/ . As you are experiencing, CPU usage remains high even when you stop creating contracts. When CPU usage comes close to 100%, transactions become slower (from 1000 ms initially to >2000 ms).

Hello everyone, I'm new here! If I understood correctly it's not currently possible to get started with Monax using MacOS or Windows, right? If I am running Linux is it best to try and get familiar with Monax or should I already be looking into the bosmarmot github?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 17:13:28 GMT):<br/>
Bosmarmot still isn't stable, but we're getting there. I'd recommend starting with monax for tooling if you are looking to begin soonish. Bosmarmot won't be terribly different in terms of what it does and it's user interface, but under the hood is greatly improved. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 17:14:30 GMT):<br/>
While we have a disclaimer regarding osx, our smart contracts team all use osx and monax 0.18 along with "native docker" for osx and there do not seem to be any pressing issues.

Alright that's great to hear! I'm trying to see if I can use monax and the burrow Blockchain for an internship research project. And the permission model seems exactly what I need for the use case I've been given. I've been trying to complete the getting started tutorial, I can get everything installed through homebrew. Then I created a monax docker with virtualbox. But after I run eval $(docker-machine env monax) every monax command returns exit status 1. Any chance you know what I'm doing wrong?

@Valveware if you want to just get the network up and running. You might be interested in my Kubernetes project: https://github.com/kubechain/kubechain/blob/master/docs/tutorials/burrow-on-minikube.md
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 12:44:47 GMT):<br/>
It's very very pre-alpha so don't expect advanced stuff to be working just yet.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 12:46:02 GMT):<br/>
Also it's on 0.17.0 of Burrow and Silas told me a lot has changed in 0.18.0.
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 13:07:05 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels I will definitely check it out :smile: . My assignment's goal is to setup a private blockchain. After I have successfully chosen and setup a Blockchain there's the following use case. There are 3 roles: management, HR and employee. As a member of HR I must be able to deploy a file or a hash of that file , the file contains agreements and has to be signed by one of each roles. Only the three people part of said file can view it's contents. So after reading up on different platforms I think I can achieve this by using burrow, put the logic in smart contracts with monax in solidity and use a web frontend with metamask to have a user interface. :thinking:
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 13:11:10 GMT):<br/>
Hmm.. as of yet I don't have a complete framework that would allow you to talk with the network from outside the cluster. Nor do I have the scaffolding ready for you to create your own containers. I think you would need one of those to send messages to the network. Best to not use my setup right now than :D
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 13:14:50 GMT):<br/>
It seems like an interesting project though, I'll follow it :relaxed: but first I'll see where monax/bos can get me 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 13:15:13 GMT):<br/>

@RobertDiebels that's neat. You can also refer to our helm charts which are in the main charts rwpo (for k8s) if that will be helpful to your cause. They're what we use internally at Monax.

Burrow allows members to be validated in a permissioned network but at the same time, everyone else can view the transactions iff you dont setup a private blockchain. Ami Right?

Hi All, new to the blockchain world. Trying to get some hands-on experience using Monax. I followed the multi-node chain tutorial (https://monax.io/docs/chain-deploying/#step-1-create-cloud-machine) to set up a simple permissioned chain on AWS. Now, when I try to deploy a simple smart contract, the output json does not contain any transaction hash. `{
  "assertStorage": "",
  "defaultAddr": "5CE6EED5C61E37E84959F1209318062620672E84",
  "deployStorageK": "",
  "queryStorage": "",
  "setStorage": "",

<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:29:12 GMT):<br/>
@joaofguerreiro I have only just started looking into blockchain technology so my answer may not be correct. But as far as I understand is that in contrast to other Blockchains which use gas to 'pay' for transactions, hyperledger burrow uses gas just to make sure there are no infinite loops. In other blockchain technologies you need the gas to pay for the transaction while in burrow the appropriate amount of gas is distributed to the user so he can complete a transaction as long as he is permissioned to do so. This is how I interpreted it, I hope this source is valid [https://softjourn.com/blog/fabric-chaincode-vs-burrow-evm/]

@Valveware typically it is not ideal to distribute private keys unless one is talking about within a cluster. the name registry is a dead simple key:value storage that folks can use to register things. it's been a feature of burrow for ages but it's not heavily used

<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 06:43:14 GMT):<br/>
So I have now setup my blockchain, it has a full node and three validator nodes running in the cloud. How can I now start adding accounts? Do I add them through a smart contract? Do I need to write one myself or do I call an existing contract? If so, how? :thinking:
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 07:04:51 GMT):<br/>
@gaurav94 I think you need at least 3 validator nodes to run a chain, but I could be wrong. 
 
You need to copy the matching account folders found in ~/.monax/chains/$YOURCHAINNAME/ to each node in the matching path. It contains a config.toml genesis.json and privileged_validator.json and privileged_validator.json
Run this on the full node:
monax chains start $YOURCHAINNAME --init-dir ~/.monax/chains/full_000 --logrotate


On validator node 1:
monax chains start $YOURCHAINNAME --init-dir ~/.monax/chains/validator_000 --logrotate


On validator node 2:
monax chains start $YOURCHAINNAME --init-dir ~/.monax/chains/validator_001 --logrotate

On validator node 3:
monax chains start $YOURCHAINNAME --init-dir ~/.monax/chains/validator_002 --logrotate
</p>
<p><strong>gaurav94</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 07:10:57 GMT):<br/>
This i can do it using monax tooling @Valveware 
But when I use the burrow develop  branch, I get the privilege of creating accounts using burrow command  *burrow spec --participant-accounts=1 --full-accounts=1 > genesis-spec.json* which create the genesis file.
After that I need to run *burrow configure --genesis-spec=genesis-spec.json --validator-index=0 > burrow.toml* to generate toml file. In this toml file I can find my address and public key of generated account, but no where around I could see the private key to access the burrow chain over RPC

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=7yn4AGFEGgfCkPmfj) @gaurav94  Please correct me if I'm wrong but I THINK it should be possible to add accounts when the chain is already running without changing the genesis file. So a system 'admin' can add employees for example. I just can't find any information on HOW to do it though :confused:
</p>
<p><strong>gaurav94</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 11:50:41 GMT):<br/>
Even I'm afraid to do so... alternate to it I wrote my own smart contract to create account.

Hi everyone! I have made an Ethereum application that requires 50 standard Ethereum transactions per second (given that one tx use 21 000 gas). Any idea of the corresponding feasibility of implementing this in a burrow chain? What is needed of computational power and bandwidth in order to achieve this scalability?
</p>

@gaurav94 Hey have you checked out the known chain making tutorial? I know this concerns the monax platform and not the hyperledger burrow directly. BUT as far as I understood an address is the hash of a public key, so if you generate your own pub-priv key pairs you can put the address and the public key in the genesis file, and keep the private key for your RPC calls. Could this be a solution to your problem? :thinking:

@compleatang Thank you for the answer. So it's not possible to view transactions at all in Burrow?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=QWSaDhwkX3EgC7vzh) @gaurav94 burrow develop is in the late stages of stabilizing after it's massive refactor. We are changing how the js libs will connect to burrow such that burrow's connection to the key server will conduct the signing. So when this stabilizes early next week you won't use your private key in the js libs but rather will just send the address to sign from. Give us a few more days to finish stabilizing and it'll all be usable.

Hi everyone! I'm new at this project... I wanted to ask you if you have ever been in this situation:
I'm trying to make rpc-json calls on the blockchain, and when I put the "broadcast_tx" method it gets this error:

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 11:47:03 GMT):<br/>
I'm running into some issues with dynamic provisioning of AWS EBS volumes and I really don't want to create the volumes manually.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 11:48:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm considering using Open-EBS as an alternative. I wanted to use EFS but that would require manual creation and it's not free-tier eligible.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 11:51:10 GMT):<br/>
The reason I'm asking is because I ran into an issue with goleveldb crashing on Hostpath volumes due to some low-level issue.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 11:51:38 GMT):<br/>
And I believe Open-EBS uses a the hostpath `/var/openebs/*` to do it's provisioning on each node.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 11:52:06 GMT):<br/>
If you got it working on AWS I'd love to know.

@RobertDiebels haven't tested on AWS, but dynamic provisioning of the PVCs works without any issue on GCE which we use. What your describing sounds like a problem between k8s and AWS rather than any problem with the charts. Unless you have a range of specialized storage provisioners set up I've never seen the issues that you've described. We migrated from AWS to GCE about 4 months ago, but before that we used prior versions of various charts, including what we eventually open sourced for the burrow charts. Those charts on AWS used dynamic PVC provisioning vis EBS and I never ran into any issues. That said we were pretty stock all the way down in that regard. Admittedly k8s storage provisioning has changed drastically since then as well...

"works without any issue on GCE"
Thank you! I might switch to GCE than for my project.

"sounds like a problem between k8s and AWS"
Correct. More precisely this issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/45726

"Unless you have a range of specialized storage provisioners"
I'm using the default `aws-ebs` provisioner. To date I have no idea what's wrong but the issue I mentioned earlier has existed for almost a year now.

Thanks for the response! Glad to know the charts are ok. I'll give them a try on AWS. Will let you know if I run into anything.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=sZjA3RSXjrdnsbCsG) @Valveware It is typically an anti-pattern to directly connect front ends to the chain. We highly recommend running through a middleware server. In which case it is very easy to connect burrow.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=MhPSEwFvANisfFfeK) @Rekha block creation happens automatically as long as your chain is running. if you want to make a transaction you have a number of options. the easiest is to leverage the monax pkgs do 's yaml interface to set up your chain and then leverage burrow's javascript libraries to build middleware
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 20:12:07 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=hvXWuvGDDPLnrxNcC) @gaurav94 that won't work, you need to either only give it the address or give it the private key. Use monax services exec keys -- monax-keys convert --addr $ADDR to convert the private key into the correct encoding for that json file.
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 05:49:39 GMT):<br/>
@compleatang Could you give an example of such a middleware server? :thinking_face:

@compleatang , Thanks for your suggestion. 

I followed the monax official doc https://monax.io/docs/getting-started/ 
and tried `monax pkgs do` with one chain and output is as follows
```$ monax pkgs do --chain advchain --address $addr

*****Executing Job*****

Job Name                                      defaultAddr
```

The content of output json file is 

```
$ cat epm.output.json 
{
  "assertStorage": "",
  "defaultAddr": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "deployStorageK": "",
  "queryStorage": "",
  "setStorage": "",
  "setStorageBase": ""
}
```
I am unable to see the execution output for the jobs(i.e assertStorage, deployStorageK...) defined in epm.yaml file.

Hey guys, could anyone tell me what the right permission value is for creating a SendTx?

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 19 Apr 2018 19:07:13 GMT):<br/>
Kevinstr, you can use develop branch if you want, if you have a bug you can identify we'd love a report on it, but we're just finalizing and stabilizing for thr next release of burrow now. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 19 Apr 2018 19:08:17 GMT):<br/>
Valve, typically folks build REST API server's in node that use the js libraries and then provide a restful interface for front end apps.

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 19 Apr 2018 19:09:15 GMT):<br/>
Robert, I'm not sure. What branch of burrow are you using? 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 19 Apr 2018 20:25:27 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels it's `Send` which is 2 i.e. the second bit in the binary representation of the permission bitset: 0b10

I am working on monax platform for burrow and I did until `monax pkgs do`. Then  I tried monax legacy-contracts(https://github.com/monax/legacy-contracts.js) to write js file to connect with the blockchain but I am not able call the functions of my contract using `contractAddress`. The output of my contract is as follows. 
```
Contract {
  address: '<path/to/solidityfile>',
  abi: 
   [ { constant: false,
       inputs: [Array],
       name: 'set',
       outputs: [],
       payable: false,
       stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
       type: 'function' },
     { constant: true,
       inputs: [],
       name: 'get',
       outputs: [Array],
       payable: false,
       stateMutability: 'view',
       type: 'function' } ],
  set: 
   { [Function: bound ]
     request: [Function: bound ],
     call: [Function: bound ],
     sendTransaction: [Function: bound ],
     estimateGas: [Function: bound ],
     getData: [Function: bound ],
     uint256: [Circular] },
  get: 
   { [Function: bound ]
     request: [Function: bound ],
     call: [Function: bound ],
     sendTransaction: [Function: bound ],
     estimateGas: [Function: bound ],
     getData: [Function: bound ],
     '': [Circular] } }
```
Will anyone please provide me any links for making transaction in burrow with monax.
Can I see any blocks that are added after making the transaction at REST endpoint http://<IP>:46657/blockchain. Currently I seeing empty blocks

I would like that as well. I'm getting these errors when using `@monax/legacy-db.js`: `"Error broadcasting transaction: Unknown error returned: Duplicate transaction (ignored)"` and `"Error broadcasting transaction: Internal error: Error invalid sequence. Got 1, expected 2"`.

I'm trying to use node to interact with burrow, but I don't seem to get how it works. I've been trying stuff like this:
```
> var burrowFactory = require('@monax/legacy-db');
undefined
> burrow = burrowFactory.createInstance("http://172.17.0.3:1337/rpc");
Burrow {
  server: undefined,
  _unsafe: 
   Unsafe {
     server: undefined,
     _validator: SinglePolicyValidator { _policy: true } },
  _accounts: 
   Accounts {

     _unsafe: Unsafe { server: undefined, _validator: [SinglePolicyValidator] } },
  _blockChain: BlockChain { server: undefined },
  _consensus: Consensus { server: undefined },
  _events: 
   Events {

How can I do it properly? I did npm init and installed both @monax/legacy-db and @monax/legacy-contracts and am executing node from that folder. I made sure the ip was correct running monax chains ip testchain
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:04:17 GMT):<br/>
@Valveware I think that you are doing it properly (I'm doing the same thing and it works for me). The server you're trying to connect to just isn't responding. How did you setup the server? Did you ensure the nodes are functioning properly? Because it might not be available to process transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:07:44 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels it's just a chain made like in the monax getting started tutorial. I wish I could try it on the network I set up on azure but mystudent subscription ran out
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:09:09 GMT):<br/>
@Valveware You might be interested in my project. It uses Kubernetes though. So you might have to learn a thing or two about that first.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:09:52 GMT):<br/>
If you're already using NodeJS you're probably familiar with the code aspect of it.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:10:08 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/kubechain/kubechain
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:10:32 GMT):<br/>
You can pull that and add your own Container in an AccountPod.
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:11:17 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels Kubernetes is an alternative to docker, right?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:11:58 GMT):<br/>
It uses Docker containers to orchestrate clusters.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:12:07 GMT):<br/>
So it's more of an alternative to Docker swarm than Docker.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:12:51 GMT):<br/>
It makes it easier for you to deploy Containerized applications in a network. Would be the main jist of it.
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:13:26 GMT):<br/>
Alright, I'll see if I can understand it and try to set up my network that way
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:13:30 GMT):<br/>
But if you don't know that much about it I'd advice to keep going as you are now. Might be to much learning for the project you're undertaking.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 09:53:06 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis @compleatang @zramsay Guys if I may ask. How long does it take for an Account to update it's Sequence after a transaction has been processed? I've created a setup with 4 validator nodes and I'm hitting these errors: `"Error broadcasting transaction: Unknown error returned: Duplicate transaction (ignored)"` and `"Error broadcasting transaction: Internal error: Error invalid sequence. Got 1, expected 2"`. I've asked over at the Tendermint chat and they said upping the Sequence should be enough to not get the `Duplicate transaction` error.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 09:56:16 GMT):<br/>
So I tracked down the code that processes `SendTx`'s to this [bit of code](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/9c70b8c8f68fce8e6dc9642fae992e9f3bc178b3/manager/burrow-mint/transactor.go#L267) and the actual updating of the Account's index to [this bit](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/9c70b8c8f68fce8e6dc9642fae992e9f3bc178b3/manager/burrow-mint/state/execution.go).
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 09:58:38 GMT):<br/>
I'm outputting 3 Tx/s on 4 nodes, totalling 12 Tx/s, and I was wondering maybe that was to fast? I was at 100 Tx/s on 4 nodes (400 Tx/s) and reduced it to 12 Tx/s but that didn't resolve the bugs.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 10:00:51 GMT):<br/>
The only thing I can imagine is that the first transaction that comes in is stil lbeing validated when the second one comes in and the Account.Sequence isn't updated yet. So it tosses in a sequence of 1.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=2aEfLu6J8Mz5dJAJB) @kevinstr gotcha. Check the docker image then. It will have the version. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 13:09:47 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=N6tWTdYuymYnCECkz) @RobertDiebels this is a solved issue on develop. On older versions you'd need to either wait for the block to process or manually track thr nonce client side. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 13:33:58 GMT):<br/>
@compleatang i'm assuming that's the develop branch for 0.18.x ?

<p><strong>Startoy</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 02:13:36 GMT):<br/>
can I generate a new account and use that do transaction on web api ?

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 12:59:16 GMT):<br/>
To those who are interested I've resolved this: `"Error broadcasting transaction: Internal error: Error invalid sequence. Got 1, expected 2"` error. I ended up getting the error on both `send()` and `sendAndHold()` I traced it down to the following. 
- I had a 1-to-many relation for clients and servers. So, a "client" application had a multitude of servers it would connect to.
- I had a 1-to-many relation for clients and destination addresses. So, a client had multiple addresses to which it would transfer amounts.
- I had multiple clients operating at the same time with the same properties as above.

This resulted in Burrow not updating the `PrivAccount.Sequence` fast enough even if I was using `sendAndHold`.

Currently I have 1 application generating transactions at a rate of about 0.8 Tx/s. It only sends new transactions with randomized Addresses when it receives a result from sendAndHold.
The only way I currently see to improve performance would be to bind  addresses and servers to 1 and only 1 client application. That way I won't get the `Sequence` error because I'm using different Addresses on each Burrow server.
Still that would only amount to about 4 Tx/s.

I also tried tracking the Sequence locally which was easy. However, there is no method to sign transactions client-side. So I decided to use the `signTx` rpc method. This resulted in a bunch of TypeErrors if which I couldn't determine the JSON properties that caused them, since the error messaged returned from the server only states a mismatch between 2 types, not which property it verified.

So I have a few questions: 
- What can I do to increase performance using the NodeJS client?

And a suggestion:

<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 09:27:26 GMT):<br/>
I have setup a chain using monax tooling and started that chain, I also installed the two npm packages that can be used to interact with burrow and smart contracts
The chain's ip is 172.17.0.2 when using monax chains ip testchain.
Then I go to a project which has the two npm packages installed and open a terminal there.
I then do the following:
```
var burrowFactory = require('@monax/legacy-db');
undefined
> var burrow = burrowFactory.createInstance("http://172.17.0.2:1337/rpc");
undefined
```
However the server property stays undefined:
```
> burrow.accounts
[Function]
> burrow.accounts()
Accounts {
  server: undefined,
  _unsafe: 
   Unsafe {
     server: undefined,
     _validator: SinglePolicyValidator { _policy: true } } }
```
What could I be doing wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 09:34:27 GMT):<br/>
Which version of legacy-db are you using and how are you printing this?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 09:35:45 GMT):<br/>
Might want to try `console.info(JSON.stringify(burrow.accounts()));` I believe that plain printing is a bit iffy sometimes.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 09:36:03 GMT):<br/>
Also, have you tried getting something from the server?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 09:37:50 GMT):<br/>

 Can I run that burrow transacter server locally to see if it works with that chain?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 09:54:39 GMT):<br/>
@Valveware Really does seem like the server is not getting defined than.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 09:55:45 GMT):<br/>
Also, you can try to run that code. It expects a few files to operate though and you'll need to add typescript.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 09:56:07 GMT):<br/>
The files it expects are located in the `resources` folder
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 10:39:50 GMT):<br/>
Do I need to use that Dockerfile somehow to set it up? Or can I just run the code?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 11:16:48 GMT):<br/>
@Valveware You'll need to run typescript to transpile to javascript, you won't need the Dockerfile.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 11:16:59 GMT):<br/>
It only builds an image I use in my Kubernetes cluster.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 08:27:30 GMT):<br/>
Why are you using the node command line instead of a Javascript file?

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 08:28:26 GMT):<br/>
I've never done that before and I don't know what the consequences are of doing so.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 08:28:57 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 08:30:22 GMT):<br/>
Also, it appears you're sending an RPC request to the server with the name 'burrow.toJSON'. This doesn't exist in the API.

It's just a single full_node chain as a test_chain
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 08:51:36 GMT):<br/>
But if I have a multinode setup I have to make the vagrant entities communicate with each other, which probably won't work if the host has that issue :thinking: 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 08:55:39 GMT):<br/>
I don't remember telling you about a command :thinking: 
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 08:56:30 GMT):<br/>
I meant this:
```
burrow.accounts().getAccounts(null, (error, result) => { console.info("Error:", error); console.info("Result:", result)});
```
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 08:57:51 GMT):<br/>
The command works afaik. The client just can't connect to the burrow server.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 08:59:10 GMT):<br/>
Did you try running it without vagrant?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 08:59:29 GMT):<br/>
Using `monax chains`
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:00:52 GMT):<br/>
the only scenario I got to work right now:
startup vagrant,
monax chains make test_chain
monax chains start ... 
check the chain ip
run index.js with node from inside the vagrant ssh
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:01:24 GMT):<br/>
Are you on Linux or Windows?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:01:30 GMT):<br/>
your host machine
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:01:31 GMT):<br/>
I am on mac
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:01:45 GMT):<br/>
Ah.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:02:25 GMT):<br/>
Well I don't know a lot about Mac unfortunately. Also don't know if monax supports running on Mac.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:02:54 GMT):<br/>
Might be something really specific with Vagrant as well.
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:04:19 GMT):<br/>
Most of the time it's the same as for linux, and I was told the monax developers all use Mac so 🤷‍♂️
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:04:47 GMT):<br/>
But I also have access to a windows
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:04:56 GMT):<br/>
I'll try to see if I can get it to work over there
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:05:14 GMT):<br/>
Won't work on Windows afaik.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:05:28 GMT):<br/>
I asked because you said you were using Vagrant.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:05:48 GMT):<br/>
And I was going to suggest not using Vagrant and just use Monax's tooling to spin up the chain.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:06:39 GMT):<br/>
If they work on Mac the tooling should work there.
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:07:11 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I can spin up a chain on Mac and the logging shows it's making blocks
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:07:36 GMT):<br/>
I just can't connect to it using the js library as I should :/
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:09:32 GMT):<br/>
Well if it times out the only thing I can think of is that the IP doesn't exist.
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:09:59 GMT):<br/>
I disabled the firewall and added

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=TWGyn3btxWzqW3KJi) @RobertDiebels the javascript libraries use the Transactor which effectively works under the assumption you are communicating with a 'local' instance of Burrow (for some suitable definition of local). The sequence number provides replay protection on signed transactions, and the transaction acts a proxy for signing for you and tries to set the sequence number by looking at the local check cache which is fed by the mempool (on develop now there is the ability to transact by address rather than sending the private key, where burrow will then ask its keys connection to sign for a particular address). The heuristic of looking at the most recent sequence number of the account in the check cache only works when a particular input account is only being used with a single node within a single block.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:16:53 GMT):<br/>
This only applies with 'stacking' transactions within the period of a single block (1-2 seconds)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:17:42 GMT):<br/>
You are right to identify that if you have control over the client you can ensure you send a run of transactions with a consecutive sequence of sequence numbers
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:18:49 GMT):<br/>
however in the general case you could not expect this to work across multiple clients (approximating the network as non-deterministic) because you wouldn't be able to control the ordering between transactions sent from different clients
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:23:54 GMT):<br/>
On some specifics:
> - I had a 1-to-many relation for clients and destination addresses. So, a client had multiple addresses to which it would transfer amounts.
This seems the wrong way round... It should only matter what the 'from' address is not the 'destination' that's where we check the sequence number

> This resulted in Burrow not updating the `PrivAccount.Sequence` fast enough even if I was using `sendAndHold`.
This _ought_ not to be the case. `sendAndHold` waits until a transaction has been committed so the next send should query the freshest sequence number
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:24:24 GMT):<br/>
are you running against latest develop, there are some changes I made about 2 weeks ago that work around various edge cases regarding sequence numbers
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:26:15 GMT):<br/>
Hi Silas, thanks for the response. I'll try to reply to your points. Have to read them thoroughly so I understand. Gimme a minute.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:27:21 GMT):<br/>
To be clear: we run burrow with several hundred transactions per second
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:27:33 GMT):<br/>
perhaps so I can be clearer to

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:28:03 GMT):<br/>
Can you expand a bit on:
> Currently I have 1 application generating transactions at a rate of about 0.8 Tx/s. It only sends new transactions with randomized Addresses
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:28:19 GMT):<br/>
Yes.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:28:24 GMT):<br/>
so you are sending transactions with random input addresses?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:30:00 GMT):<br/>
I created a tiny 'client' which uses `@monax/legacy-db` to send transactions towards Burrow servers. See: https://github.com/RobertDiebels/burrow-transacter
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:30:34 GMT):<br/>
I wrapped it in a Docker container and deployed it to Kubernetes.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:30:48 GMT):<br/>
"so you are sending transactions with random input addresses? ". Yes.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:30:48 GMT):<br/>
 Yes. [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=GNL5ZH8ipsi4Ncawr) 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:31:24 GMT):<br/>
I provide the client with the original genesis file and load the Addresses from there.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:31:50 GMT):<br/>
Then on each transaction I pick a random Address, and a random Server.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:32:32 GMT):<br/>
Correction. I used to pick a random server. Now I just use 1 server.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:32:32 GMT):<br/>
Correction. I used to pick a random server per transaction. Now I just use 1 server which I pick randomly, and use it for all transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:33:25 GMT):<br/>
The Addresses I still pick randomly.

If I understand correctly. Both the definition of 'local' and 'single node' mean that if, I have a NodeJS client it should have a unique relation with an account. The client then sends transactions to only one (local) Burrow Server/Node associated with that account so the sequence used to sign the transaction can be pulled from it's cache.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 10:26:38 GMT):<br/>
Which means that you can't use `send()` or `sendAndHold()` to connect to different nodes using the same privateKey parameter.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 10:29:49 GMT):<br/>
That was exactly what I was doing. As I was unaware that the nodes only handled transactions for 1 and only 1 "from"-account. I'll see if I can crank up the transaction speed with this knowledge.

Alright , thanks @silasdavis :)
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 10:55:07 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis just to summarize:
I am trying to connect to the server e.g. to get a list of accounts. I am not able to do so on my host (Mac). I followed the following steps:
```
monax chains make test_chain
monax chains start test_chain --init-dir ~/.monax/chains/test_chain/test_chain_full_000
```

The chains is running and making blocks, I can see so in the logging
I ask for the server ip using
```
monax chains ip test_chain
```
Then I run a javascript file containing the following:
```
var burrowFactory = require('@monax/legacy-db');
var burrow = burrowFactory.createInstance("http://172.17.0.3:1337/rpc"); // 172.17.0.3 being the ip from monax chains ip
burrow.accounts().getAccounts(null, (error, result) => { console.info("Error:", error); console.info("Result:", result)});
```
Which results in
```
Burrow error:  Call of method "getAccounts" with parameters { filters: [] } responded with "Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 172.17.0.3:1337".
Error: { Error: Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 172.17.0.3:1337
    at values.next.then (/Users/merlijnversteegen/Documents/Truffle/node test/node_modules/@nodeguy/json-rpc/lib/index.js:16:30)
    at <anonymous>
  method: 'getAccounts',
  params: [ { filters: [] } ],
  code: -32300,
  data:
   { Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 172.17.0.3:1337
    at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:1173:14)
     errno: 'ETIMEDOUT',
     code: 'ETIMEDOUT',
     syscall: 'connect',
     address: '172.17.0.3',
     port: 1337 },
  message: 'Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 172.17.0.3:1337' }
Result: undefined
```

When I use monax-vagrant and do vagrant up v0.18.0
It successfully makes a vagrant and when I do the exact same steps inside the vagrant ssh it does get me a resulting list of accounts(0x0 and 1 other account)
So the issue is - I think - with the host not being able to connect to the chain it's running.
I also do not know how I can test if the host can reach the vagrant's chain.

> As I was unaware that the nodes only handled transactions for 1 and only 1 "from"-account.

This isn't strictly true - first of all if you wait for the transaction to be closed into a block - as in *AndHold then that transaction is committed so if you query from another node you should see the same sequence number. If you want to get many transaction from the same input account (i.e. private key as it currently is) in the _same block_ then there is no way to order the sequence numbers between different clients, unless you use a consensus network! In which case the advice is just to run a participant node 'local' to your client. This is effectively what a bitcoin or ethereum wallet is.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 11:08:37 GMT):<br/>
Regarding `signTx` that will only work if you are able to go-wire serialise your transaction locally, which we have no libary in JS to do annoyingly. You can use burrow-client to do this though
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 11:10:21 GMT):<br/>

cool, for a quick and dirty single node chain just run:

```
monax-keys server&

cd chainface
burrow spec -p1 -f1 | burrow configure -s- -v0 > burrow.toml
burrow
```
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 11:41:58 GMT):<br/>
`burrow spec` generates a `GenesisSpec` which is a chain template
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 11:42:35 GMT):<br/>
`burrow configure` uses this template and fills in the gaps where necessary with defaults, and most importantly creates keys in the monax-keys instance where keys/addresses are not supplied

What can you do when you need to deploy a DApp contract which hits you with "'Error when transacting: Insufficient gas'"?
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 11:42:48 GMT):<br/>
One option I can do is to supply the contract with the addresses of the other contracts that it makes in it's constructor so I can deploy them seperately. But I think I am only allowed to give 2 parameters when deploying contracts so I guess I should put them in an array :thinking_face:  
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 12:56:29 GMT):<br/>
Is there a way to change the gas limit, and a way to check beforehand how much gas a deployment would cost?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 13:40:29 GMT):<br/>
@Valveware if you're hitting insufficient gas, I'd highly recommend looking at your solidity code. At Monax, we have some extremely complex solidity suites of contracts which would never be operational on Ethereum mainnet. Whenever we have never hit insufficient gas unless there is an error in our solidity code. You can search the code for the `MaxGas` setting and adjust it and recompile if you really need to, but burrow's default gas limit is set extremely high. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 13:41:23 GMT):<br/>
IOWs we've never come up against the maxGas when there is not an error in our solidity, despite having extremely deep call stacks and extenuated micro-services style smart contracts suites which spend gas like it's going out of style....
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 13:45:59 GMT):<br/>
The max gas is set in the config.js file of legacy-contracts? And it is set to 1000000?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 13:47:13 GMT):<br/>
it's the max Gas setting in burrow that matters.
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 13:47:47 GMT):<br/>
Well it must be an error in my code then since I haven't touched that...
This is the method that seems to be too expensive to execute:
```
contract ContractService {
    // creator of the CMC
    address owner;
    // Mapping of all contracts' names and their addresses
    mapping (bytes32=>address) public contracts;
    // When this modifier is used only the owner can execute that function.
    modifier onlyOwner () {require(msg.sender == owner); _;}
    // Constructor
    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        contracts["igrow"] = owner;
    }
    //Adds a contract to the list
    function addContract(bytes32 contractName, address contractAddress) /*onlyOwner*/ public {
        ContractServiceEnabled(contractAddress).setContractServiceAddress(address(this));
        contracts[contractName] = contractAddress;
    }
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 13:48:09 GMT):<br/>
the addContract method
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 13:48:44 GMT):<br/>
don't work at solidity level so can't help you any further unfortunately.
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 13:49:17 GMT):<br/>
Oh that's alright , I'll keep digging 
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:05:45 GMT):<br/>
It actually goes like this if there's someone else who knows something about Solidity.
I am now successfully deploying 8 contracts, the first seven are services and repositories, the eight one will be the 'api' which the middleware nodes express server wil use to make calls. This eighth contract uses the above contractservice to keep track of all the services. The services use the same instance to track their repo's etc. Now when I call the api with a name and an address of a contract to add, it calls addContract , with that bytes32 name and an address. This is is the method that seems too expensive to complete for some reason although the things it is doing, setting an address to a bytes32 in a mapping and setting an address on a contract doesn't seem that complicated :/
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:21:27 GMT):<br/>
I am adding the contracts one by one so it should be small transactions :thinking_face:

@compleatang @silasdavis I'm looking into coding an extension for Caliper which would add Hyperledger Burrow to their list of supported projects. have you guys looked into that yet? [ https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper ]
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 09:40:15 GMT):<br/>
@Valveware readme on develop should have sufficient instructions now: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/tree/develop we can pick up where we left of. I'm also planning to merge to master today
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 09:53:14 GMT):<br/>
@Valveware I take it you are running with burrow 0.17.1 (i.e. through the monax tool version 0.18.0)?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 09:54:05 GMT):<br/>
If you are compiling with solidity > 0.4.4 and older Burrow you will hit insufficient gas due to a change (EIP-158 IIRC) that is in latest burrow but not the older version
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 10:48:32 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis , great I will check it out asap! I might wait till it's on master later today, but I'll keep you posted, thanks for the help! :)

<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 10:52:00 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis By the way, when I was interacting with the old burrow from monax 0.18 , I ran into some troubles with the legacy-contracts npm library, There seemed to be an issue with the 17.0 standard version, but I was able to fix it by using the 16.8 version instead :thinking_face: 
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 11:12:02 GMT):<br/>
The error happened in dev_pipe, where it called ``` callback(null, data.CallData.Callee) ```, while it should have been        ``` callback(null, data.call_data.callee)```
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 11:12:25 GMT):<br/>
yep there have been a few breaking changes, this ought to have been made clearer, once we release Burrow the latest versions of everything will be compatible
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 11:13:08 GMT):<br/>
Sweet :ok_hand: , just wanted to let you know if it wasn't a known error

How can you get the plain private key from monax-keys? I need them for this:
```
var contracts = require('@monax/legacy-contracts');
var burrowURL = "http://localhost:1337/rpc";
var accountData = require('/some/account/data.json');
var contractManager = contracts.newContractManagerDev(burrowURL, accountData);
```
However it seems monax-keys stores them in an encrypted way at ~/.monax/keys/data
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:20:42 GMT):<br/>
it stores it like
```

And it happens in the devPipe when it is trying to transact a new contract, it's not happy with the given privKey
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:04:03 GMT):<br/>
I found the private key for the node running the serve in a hidden folder created with burrow serve
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 11:13:33 GMT):<br/>
Now I managed to supply a valid private key, but when I am deploying a contract I run into the following error:

The key with address '56E9B4AEBE464B2AB1F6521871A2099FCE8847FD' does not exist on the my system, that address is also not the validator nor the participant of the chain, yet somehow it goes looking for that particular address :thinking:

Hi @Valveware, I'm afraid this is a still a bit of a wringle with where we were at with keys, here is how you can generate the accounts.json that the JS libs are after: https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/blob/master/test/generate-accounts.json.sh
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 12:09:55 GMT):<br/>
as in `monax-keys convert --addr 933A2DE86C7E0F5A58126156D3DFADD0C59D973D`
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 12:10:51 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying it as we speak :)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 12:11:52 GMT):<br/>
I suspect the key you may have found on disk was: `.burrow/config/node_key.json`?
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 12:13:37 GMT):<br/>
Yep that was it
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 12:13:43 GMT):<br/>
But your new method seems to work!
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 12:14:01 GMT):<br/>
I only had to change pub_key and priv_key to pubKey and privKey
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 12:23:27 GMT):<br/>
The json it generated had pub_key priv_key and I know it requires pubKey privKey by now :p , I just hope that doesn't mean I'm using a wrong version :sweat_smile:
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 13:59:40 GMT):<br/>
@mansoor You can still use legacy-contracts.js and legacy-db.js , with v0.18 of burrow you can use the latest versions of both (v0.17)

Hello erverybody. My monax instance crashes sometimes. I have 4 nodes running, on 4 seperate VM's. When I perform a "monax ls" after a couple of days not using the blockchain on the vm where the smart contract was deployed and the chain created, it says the blockchain is down.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 06:46:15 GMT):<br/>
Do the VM's ever shut down or go to sleep? Maybe due to energy savings settings?
</p>
<p><strong>kevinstr</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 06:51:22 GMT):<br/>
they don't shut down or go to sleep

Hard to debug in isolation. Maybe start by looking at log usage and whether VMs disk is full...

Before I was experiencing a "RETURNDATASIZE not yet implemented" error, this might have solved it? I was using the new feature where it's possible to use dynamic arrays..

I am yet to produce a test case, if you are in a position to create one then a PR would be gratefully received, see here for the form: https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/tree/develop/monax/tests/jobs_fixtures/app05-deploy_query_contracts_and_testing_rendering_solc_int_type
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 10:50:36 GMT):<br/>
Would just need to be some suitable solidity, and an epm.yaml file as used by our `bos` tool (are you using bos?)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 10:51:16 GMT):<br/>
Alternatively if you are able to test with some real solidity and confirm or reject it as working I can work that into a test case
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 11:12:55 GMT):<br/>
I'm looking into it right now, I think bos pkgs works the same as monax pkgs. Although I'be been deploying using the js libraries I think I can figure it out that way
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 12:02:09 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis When executing 
```
bos pkgs do --keys="http://localhost:4767" --chain-url="tcp://localhost:46657" --address=6C5D947A9184BA3A376FFABD1AAF24B5AFDA6F8F
```
I get the following error:
```
error deploying contract Driver: error connecting to node (tcp://localhost:46657) to fetch account (6C5D947A9184BA3A376FFABD1AAF24B5AFDA6F8F): Post http://localhost:46657: dial tcp [::1]:46657: connect: connection refused
```
What could cause this? In my Burrow.toml file I do find this:
```
[RPC.TM]
    Disabled = false
    ListenAddress = "tcp://localhost:46657"
```

<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 12:46:09 GMT):<br/>
It seems to have worked, also an array gets returned however I do not know how I can assert if they are equal :sweat_smile: But it seems to be correct

@seanyoung Hello :) I think I made it work, but the reason it failed on CI is because I told it it was ^0.4.23 and I believe it is only capable of doing ^0.4.22? I couldn't figure out how to set an array of strings to a variable in the epm file. So I couldn't get an assert right
```
+- name: assertCarArray
 +  assert:
 +      key: $queryDriverCarArray      relation: ne
     val: ""
```

This value I would like to put $setCarArrayVariable, but I tried to define it in a few ways as a variable, but I couldn't figure out the correct syntax for it. The variable should be equal to a string array like this [ 'Red Car', 'Green Car', 'Blue Car'] But the variable remained empty but I could see the method did return the correct array I set it to

<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 12:39:17 GMT):<br/>
In unsafe.js theres a function Unsafe.prototype.transactAndHold . It makes the parameters and it does give a prove_key, however Burrow expects an inputAccount object, so I gave it one with a privateKey and it seems to work but then I get this error: "error when transacting: call error: REVERT not yet fully implemented"" does this mean I explicitly called revert somewhere in my solidity code?

</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 12:42:15 GMT):<br/>
Newer versions of solidity use the revert opcode, which is not implemented yet.

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 12:51:38 GMT):<br/>
Hopefully we'll have an implementation soon, @smblucker  is working on it. The checkTx will reject any opcodes without executing (as I understand the code)

</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 14:33:23 GMT):<br/>
That would be very helpful to the project
</p>
<p><strong>Valveware</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 14:35:33 GMT):<br/>
That would hopefully make the js libs simpler

@compleatang For the Bachelor paper that goes with my proof of concept I would like to include some diagrams explaining the architecture of Burrow and I wanted to ask are these still valid diagrams(aside from the Eris namechange)? Since it dates from over a year ago: https://www.altoros.com/blog/hyperledger-incubation-burrow-integrates-permissioned-ethereum-virtual-machine/

Hi guys, I've already updated Snak (https://github.com/pouladzade/snack) for burrow 0.18.0 
</p>

It supports Linux  and Darwin for now,  hope it will be useful for you too!

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 21:30:24 GMT):<br/>
are you aware of our address-based signing changes? We should get that in there...
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 21:31:03 GMT):<br/>
we are planning to collapse the current JS libs into a single one
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 21:31:22 GMT):<br/>
and also to replace the current RPC with a GRPC interface
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 21:32:31 GMT):<br/>
I'm wondering if that new library could itself be merged into snak
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 21:33:33 GMT):<br/>
I'm also wondering if you would be interested in the possibility of becoming a Burrow maintainer, in particular owning the JS libs...?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 21:34:14 GMT):<br/>
It wouldn't be a just you thing, but I think given your efforts it would make sense to at least have you in the loop on what we are doing on that side of things

I've been looking at the API and the documentation is incomplete, especially the getBlock return fields (https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/docs/specs/api.md). There are TODOs there without a type which are making it difficult for me to parse the returned value. Any updates on this? :)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 18:59:59 GMT):<br/>
@mansoor: See here for the method definition: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/rpc/v0/methods.go#L387-L397, which gives you this type: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/rpc/result.go#L69-L72 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 19:00:14 GMT):<br/>
probably the easiest thing to do would just dump the returned  JSON to debug

Could it be that Burrow is not threaded? For example: when I'm trying to get data from a smart contract on the blockchain via 2 different threads, it just doesn't return any data and sometimes it gives a TransactAndHold error.

@silasdavis Done. Updated description for getblock. Sent a PR to develop.

Kevin, burrow has channels (similar to threads in go), but the chain itself isn't threaded. What version of burrow are you using right now? We've updated that pipeline significantly in 0.18 and would encourage you to try that.

@Rekha the error is telling you that the burrow local levelDB that is trying to load `now` is different than what is saved to disk. There are two ways around this. (a) if you do not need the previous data then remove the `.burrow` directory, or (b) if you do, then just change directories and start burrow in a different directory which will write a new `.burrow` directory and database to disk.

Hi all, i am working on monax platform for past three months. I am  using @momax legacy contract module for communicate with monax platform.

I am getting this error after completing 50 or 60 transaction.Please provide me the solution. If you need a screenshot of the error console, i will share across you.

Burrow experts:  The Hyperledger T & E WG approved today the following: "•Proposed transaction: Let us select the 15 most essential concepts (is not terms) in Fabric, Sawtooth, Burrow and Iroha, and describe clearly, using illustrating relevant examples, understandable to end users and management, how they relate, overlap and where they are different; look forward to endorsements."

On behalf of the WG I submit to you the first two concepts descriptions:   A blockchain is an append-only data structure; a blockchain (instance) consists at any moment in time of a number of blocks. A block contains a number of transactions. The contents of a block is encrypted and each block contains a hash of major parts. It contains also a copy of the hash of the previous block and this is the reason for the term chain. A transaction proposal is a proposal by a client application or administrator to the blockchain network community. The network community can decide to make the transaction proposal a valid transaction, or is classified as an invalid transaction. Please let us know which improvements you want to make to these two concept definitions. Thanks

Hi All!
I'm running into an issue trying to deploy a smart contract.  The error message: "'transaction timed out TxHash: C643C5683243298AEE10E282129603116A316CA9'" keeps appearing when I am broadcasting my new contract and I can't figure out where the issue is originating from. 
The configuration is as such:
-    network: 'BurrowChain_2A0FC2-E00F59'
 - version: '0.18.0'
- rpc call:
{ jsonrpc: '2.0',

@compleatang As soon as all the reactions are in, or coming Friday, the answers will be processed and the next few basic concepts will be added. If you believe you have a better approach, please be sure that is welcome. Hence I would expect that we have in the first colum the name of the concept, then a definition, then how the Borrow concept relates to this, then the Fabric, then Iroha and then Sawtooth.

Hey everyone!!
does burrow not support address casting to smart contracts?
when i try to cast an address to a contract and run a function from it it throws me this error:

Burrow error:  Call of method "transactAndHold" with parameters { priv_key: '4FA9518F2508F4B00D1C0AF3DD2A8FE1B667DA2B251ABA92C111D483117B518A17DB80818065467CC45839B82D5644062F4A1EC369F398E5C4E5B54D1C0555CD',

  gas_limit: 999999999,
  fee: 1 } responded with "Error when transacting: Insufficient gas".

definitely does not strike you as a gas error so i traced it a bit down the vm.go source and after commenting the original error this new one started showing up

Burrow error:  Call of method "transactAndHold" with parameters { priv_key: '4FA9518F2508F4B00D1C0AF3DD2A8FE1B667DA2B251ABA92C111D483117B518A17DB80818065467CC45839B82D5644062F4A1EC369F398E5C4E5B54D1C0555CD',

  fee: 1 } responded with "Error when transacting: Invalid opcode 4D697373696E67206F70636F64652030783364".

i cant really understand whats going on here
original sol code :  

 function getX(address addr) returns (uint) {
    big b = big(addr);
    return b.x();
  }

does the burrow evm have missing opcodes? because the same snippet runs perfectly on remix

afaik it hasn't been for over a year, and is actually a bit buggy this version 0.16 https://github.com/monax/legacy-contracts.js
i have made some changes to make it work with burrow 0.17 https://github.com/JoeRoumy/legacy-contracts.js
but 0.18 is not coming through with me, they keys generated are encrypted i guess and are not usable within the js code

in the next release of the library we will ship the ability to not use private keys within the library at all, but rather send an address which burrow has in its keys folder and burrow will sign on behalf of the lbirary. all in all this will be significantly safer. We have not removed the old way of signing, but it is significantly more safe to just pass an address and let burrow handle the keys and signing.

hi guys, so I built burrow and bos on a new system yesterday (so, monax-keys is gone and im going thru Bosmamot steps) ... and I am having issues right at the end trying to deploy with bos ... interestingly, I get two different errors with different use of flags. In the first case with the chain flag, keys flag, and address flag I get an error 'cannot talk to the keys instance'.... even tho I can run `burrow keys list`. When I try using only the address flag, I cannot talk to the chain and get and INTERNAL_ERROR 32603. I have verified for certain I am using the proper account ( examined the genesis.json as well as running `burrow keys list` ) ... any idea where I went wrong?

@stingley the grpc keys service in burrow listens on port 10997, not 4767. 
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 08:53:49 GMT):<br/>
also,  grpc wants the url without the http:// prefix. So it should be "bos --keys="localhost:10997 ... " (which also the default argument for --keys)

basilji, the burrow version you have is just in the midst of a bunch of instability between it and bos. please rerun against commit f11bca8961d2013b45ce0c55f46dff975a080eff or greater and let us know if the error persists.

ok. are you trying from a fresh directory with a fresh burrow.toml and/or genesis.json? if so please file an issue in hyperledger/burrow with a way that we can recreate the issue and we'll take a look. we are not seeing this issue at all and our integrations tests are passing

I have taken the privateKey from the .keys/data file
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 09:20:45 GMT):<br/>
you'll need to change the privateKey from base64 encoding to hex bytes if you want to use it. but you shouldn't need to. you should just use the sign with address. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 09:21:02 GMT):<br/>
if you really want to use the private key and the public key then you'll need to transform them. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 09:21:17 GMT):<br/>
here's a "simple" one liner to do that: `burrow keys export --addr=$(cat $CHAIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY/keys/names/server_key) | jq -r '.PrivateKey.Plain' | base64 -d -i | hexdump -v -e '/1 "%02x" ' | awk '{print toupper($0)}'`
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 09:22:01 GMT):<br/>
you'll need to change the fields after the `jq` command as needed for the address and public key to have the same formatting.

All, we've released burrow v0.19.0 with big stability and usability improvement's, better integration capacity with kubernetes, and first implementation of a coherent grpc framework for enhanced integration with external systems. The Monax tools for burrow have also been updated. This should be the final big release where Monax tooling (other than js libraries) are required.

So is it unheard of to run two hyperledger projects together. So if I am interested in Indy, but I want smart contract functionality, can I run them together, or at least have them coordinate in some way if they run on separate networks?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 08:22:54 GMT):<br/>
Not unheard of. Quilt is meant to provide some level of bridging but I'm not totally sure it's compatibility with burrow or Indy. In the short run you'd just need to bridge via oracles. This use case pattern we think would be widely used and we'd love contributions that make it easy as possible to connect...

Basiliji is your chain on and making blocks after the call? Is your node layer still able to connect to the blockchain after the call? Every time this error arises that I've seen it is a connectivity issue or a chain instability issue. 
</p>
<p><strong>basilji</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 11:43:13 GMT):<br/>
   yes all the time chain is on.
</p>
<p><strong>basilji</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 11:43:13 GMT):<br/>
   yes all the time chain is on. This issue will happen if we call the contract function (which is having event) continuously. For example if we call the function in async manner for 20 iteration , it will work as expected but if exceeds more than that it will fail.

okay so that wasnt very clear, my bad @compleatang 
i am trying to implement the five types model, and honestly everything is perfect except for one thing; wei
i am using the legacy contracts (LCs) and i try to call a payable function on the smart contract (SC) to send it some wei 
so the contractFactory uses transactAndHold by default but i see no option to add a "value" attribute to that request so msg.value reads 0 in the SC
another option i tried was to use the sendAndHold method of the txs object from LCs and aim for the fallback method but the sendAndHold does not trigger the fallback even tho wei was transfered succesfully to the SC
so basically the SC has no way to detect that it received

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 11:27:47 GMT):<br/>
@YoussefAshraf so this has been a long-standing omission of Transactor. We basically have it hard-wired to always transfer 0 value. For historical reasons it was kept this way. We have done a load of ugprade work to implement a GRPC-based RPC layer and I have just pushed a change that allows you to set the value to transfer: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/826
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 11:28:22 GMT):<br/>
However on the RPC that current legacy-contracts uses I have maintained the same behaviour and not exposed the value parameter for backward compatibility
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 11:29:37 GMT):<br/>
We are working on a refactored, unified, GRPC-based version of legacy-contract.js and legacy-db.js (we will name burrow.js) that uses GRPC and should be able to expose value for you
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 11:31:24 GMT):<br/>
The change to the GRPC library will be on develop soon (next hour or so I expect) so it would be possible for you to start calling this by using GRPC yourself - though this will require effort to set up JS libs against our protobuf definition. Alternatively you can wait for our next JS release against GRPC - which I think should be able to include this. I think we are pretty close to this maybe 1 week away from a develop release.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 11:31:51 GMT):<br/>
if you can live with non-payable contracts for a little while then this is coming
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 11:32:57 GMT):<br/>
You an also formulate CallTxs with the Go client libraries/bos which has always allowed you to set the value (actually it exposes `amount` where `amount = value + fee` - whereas I have exposed `value` on the transactor RPC from that PR)
</p>
<p><strong>jelbazi</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 12:47:06 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, 

I've been trying to work my way through setting up a burrow chain. I come across all kinds of weird errors and/or lack of direction though.
Also there seem to be multiple (partial) pieces of information and implementations (eris db, burrow, bosmarmot, snak, monax) that make it pretty complicated coming in without knowledge about the project. 

So I have a few questions:
-   Is there any documentation/tutorial on setting up and running a blockchain with hyperledger burrow, while not needing to change parts of the (GO) source code?
-   Would you say burrow is production ready yet (as in, a workable BC solution to run a global business, using smart contracts, on top off)?
-   Is there any company already running a business on top of (a forked version of) burrow?

(Maybe a question for another place, but maybe someone knows more about this) -   What are the main differences between Fabric and Burrow (apart from being able to use the EVM with burrow)?

Thanks!
</p>

@silasdavis Oh, so it was omitted, that makes sense now
first of all thank you for this amazing reply, i have no problem setting up js i have fiddled with it before and am sort of familiar with it
i will give it a try and report back when all is well, again thank you for that effort  :smile:

@jelbazi 
i am not an expert however i will try to answer you afaik and of course if am wrong sbdy correct me 
- you very much can run a chain without changing the source code, check the official bosmarmot github page, and maybe this will help you a bit even tho its outdate https://github.com/monax/legacy-docs
- my personal opinion is that it is near ready, the devs are doing a great job so within a couple of weeks maybe it would be
- no idea at all
- this is a huge question for casually asking, needs some googling ;)

@jelbazi eris-db was the name of the same codebase as Burrow before it joined hyperledger. There is no fork of Burrow, just hyperledger/burrow. Bosmarmot is a single repo containing all of the Monax-built tooling. We are reforming that to provide a better jumpstart but that should be your starting place. 

> - Is there any documentation/tutorial on setting up and running a blockchain with hyperledger burrow, while not needing to change parts of the (GO) source code?
The Bosmarmot README there that talks you through running a single-node chain and deploying some contract: https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot. I'm not sure where you have needed to modify Burrow source code in order to run - that should not be the case.

> - Would you say burrow is production ready yet (as in, a workable BC solution to run a global business, using smart contracts, on top off)?
This is somewhat subjective question which depends on your standards for production ready. For example, I do not think TSB's online banking is production ready but it is still deployed by a global business... We are running it as the backbone for our Agreements Network: https://agreements.network/ (currently in beta testing). It has been used over multiple years for many different projects, most of which were proof of concepts (btw I believe Burrow is the oldest project in Hyperledger and probably the oldest permissioned ledger - citation needed, but it was essentially started later 2014 I believe ;) though developer hours is a better proxy for maturity). I know of a number of companies who are building their production systems out on Burrow, but all are pre-release. Burrow has plenty of work to do, and Tendermint is pre-1.0.0, but I am not really aware of a blockchain project I would call 'production hardened' - 'production readiness' is a function of your capacity for risk, the downside of various types of failure, and your ability to recover from disaster. For Monax I am putting equal effort into fixing things we know are broken and providing robust 1st and 2nd line disaster recovery mechanisms for running systems (things like state rollback via governance primitives)

- Is there any company already running a business on top of (a forked version of) burrow?
We are: https://agreements.network/ :) And it's not a fork. I know of at least two companies that are running off partially forked Burrow, but I'm afraid I'm not allowed to say who they are


> What are the main differences between Fabric and Burrow (apart from being able to use the EVM with burrow)?
This is a good question and I should really put something on the wiki. I usually answer with reference to Sawtooth Lake and Fabric:

- Burrow is a single Go process heavily tied to Tendermint consensus (though we do have some experiments outside of that...) whereas STL and Fabric are multi-process microservice architectures with some form of pluggable consensus (STL) or endorsement (Fabric)
- Burrow uses a full Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism (Tendermint), but Fabric and STL do not offer one yet
- Burrow runs EVM smart contracts (and extensions through SNatives) whereas STL and Fabric run may different types of code through chaincode (Fabric) and transaction families (STL)
- Burrow has a native token but STL and Fabric do not (you could implement one with contracts though)

My one-liner would be 'Burrow is the redis of blockchain' - it doesn't support pluggable flexibility but as a result has fewer moving parts and aims to be fast and light (for a blockchain anyway). This is something of an aspiration/statement of intent as much as an authorative statement of where we are now...

I have a single-node burrow chain running now. The previous attempt was probably an error on my part (through which I got the idea I had to change some source material).

Production ready is indeed somewhat subjective. For me, it specifically means running a permissioned blockchain network with SC's that handle logic (and transactions) of tokens/value/assets for ultimately millions of users(not nodes), while abiding by GDPR rules. Still not enough details for a thorough evaluation probably. But the burrow chain is part of the product core in this sense.

For the last hour I've been trying to deploy a contract with 2 dependencies (BasicToken.sol which imports SafeMath.sol & ERC20Basic.sol --> https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20).

I am using this (see below) epm.yaml (based on --> https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/blob/develop/tests/jobs_fixtures/app27-multiple_imports_and_multiple_constructor_different_factory_types/epm.yaml):

jobs:

- name: deployBasicToken
  deploy:
      contract: BasicToken.sol
      instance: BasicToken

- name: deployERC20Basic
  deploy:
      contract: BasicToken.sol
      instance: ERC20Basic

- name: deploySafeMath
  deploy:
      contract: BasicToken.sol
      instance: SafeMath

</p>
<p><strong>jelbazi</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 14:56:01 GMT):<br/>
After deploying only the ABI for BasicToken shows up. The others are empty arrays. (ERC20Basic I can understand, it is implemented by BasicToken)
</p>
<p><strong>jelbazi</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 14:56:42 GMT):<br/>
(BTW, the pasted yaml above format shifts to the left, but the format in the file is correct)
</p>
<p><strong>jelbazi</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 14:58:37 GMT):<br/>
Or could it be that it's because SafeMath is a library?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=Pr8KPyKr8NvPeLrhz) @Benoit.R At Monax we use Docker and Kubernetes exclusively and have open sourced much of our work. Dockerfiles are available here -> https://quay.io/monax/db (tagged images will get pushed to docker hub under hyperledger/burrow but we still need a bit of work to route that in the CI system). You can find helm charts for running burrow nodes in kubernetes here -> https://github.com/kubernetes/charts  those latter charts need a bit of updating in the official helm charts but I haven't had time to PR to them. the most recent editions of the helm charts are available here -> https://github.com/agreements-network/charts in that repo you'll want to see src/burrow chart. YOu can install those charts to kubernetes by referencing the helm repo -> https://charts.agreements.network

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 13:00:37 GMT):<br/>
@basilji I suspect you're encountering a challenge with some of the system design considerations we've had to take into account in burrow. Namely when working asyncronously the chain will have a hard time certifying some of the transactions if they are not sent syncronously. This is because of the necessity to add the nonce of a particular account into the signed bytes that are needed by the chain. This is meant as a feature rather than a bug and is necessary to guard against replay attacks and other attacks. Functionally what happens sometimes with load tests based on asyncronously referencing a single account is that these nonces get out of order which the chain won't like. Our advice here would be to perform load testing across a range of sending accounts perhaps 20-50. we're working on some updates on both the chain side and javascript side to address some of this, the remainder of it (the hacky websockets coding) will be fixed when we finish the migration to GRPC and release burrow.js

If anyone wants to test burrow.js which is greatly improved but still needs namereg and a few other additions, you can find it (for now) here -> https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/tree/burrow.js/burrow.js

There's currently no docs and its fast moving but if you're familiar enough with js and interested to get increased stability feel free to dig in. But as I said, YMMV and its completely self-service for now.

@PizzaPolice12 no ether is not required. that only operates on the public blockchain network. burrow is a framework for setting up one's own networks. it has a native token which you can use, and we currently set gas cost at 0 because it is not something that is usually used by burrow users.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=TYriFY6uWZMSZiAm3) @ricktobacco Were using Fabric for supply chain data and Burrow for financial transactions. We prefer the later's deterministic behavior for certain use cases, plus solidity is kind of elegant for tokens, despite its flaws.

@all Burrow v0.20.0 is out. And it's a very important release. We've also released a pre-release version of the brand new burrow.js here -> https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monax/burrow the big ticket items are now validator set changes are back in and also everything is using the shiny new GRPC interface. It also "feels" even faster thanks to optimizations on our end and upgrades on Tendermint's end. Current tendermint version for the release is 0.24.4
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 15:39:38 GMT):<br/>
Please note that there's a breaking change in the hashing algorithm for addresses. Tendermint changed on their end and we followed. This will mean that any keys used for testing, deployments, or operations from previous versions of burrow will **NO LONGER WORK**.... please keep this in mind in your upgrade path.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 15:40:01 GMT):<br/>
We hope that this will be one of the final breaking changes to the keys/addresses interface pre 1.0

Hi marmots! I've been trying to get up and running again with Burrow after a few months away. I have been following the tutorial here (https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot). All good until I get to "bos --keys="localhost:10997" \
	--chain-url="tcp://localhost:46657" \
	--address=0A40DC874BC932B78AC390EAD1C1BF33469597AB" . I note that you have to change the --address field, which I have done. Then I run into the error: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = all SubConns are in TransientFailure, latest connection error: connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing dial tcp: address tcp://localhost:46657: too many colons in address"
So I check the localhost addresses in my burrow.toml and compare them to your burrow.toml file. Firstly I note that the address localhost:46657 is in your file at the [RPC.TM] section but it is not in my file at the [RPC.TM] section so I change my --chain-url (I think your tutorial should include a reminder for the user to do this). But then more importantly, I note that your burrow.toml file includes a URL in the [Keys] section, but my burrow.toml file does not have a URL in the [Keys] section, instead it has the following properties: (i) GRPCServiceEnabled; (ii)  AllowBadFilePermissions; (iii) RemoteAddress; (iv)  KeysDirectory.... Any ideas why this is the case, and if it is the source of my original error?

Hi @Luker501 that needs to get updated. Are you working against Burrow v0.20.0 ? If so then just remove the `--keys` and `--chain-url` flags completely. We've now migrated everything to use the GRPC endpoint. If you had a chance, we'd love a PR on that README so others can benefit. We're just a bit underwater with a bunch of things at Monax. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 09:03:30 GMT):<br/>
For 98% of uses the `--keys` flag will now not be needed and the `--chain-url` flag should be defaulted to `--chain-url=localhost:10997` 
</p>
<p><strong>Luker501</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 12:08:45 GMT):<br/>
@compleatang thanks for the info. Yeah I am using the latest Burrow version... I'll go through everything again on Monday, hopefully things will work! If I can see obvious issues with the docs I'll make PRs then. Cheers

@paulransfield a great target for this would be our new RPC layer based on GRPC which I think will allow people to do some interesting things if they new about it and how to use it. For some context see: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/817. My time is pretty tight at the moment but I'd love to see progress here and can find some time to help - just need to make sure my effort gets directed where it can have the biggest multiplier 
</p>
<p><strong>Luker501</strong> (Sun, 29 Jul 2018 13:06:10 GMT):<br/>
Just read through your agreements network paper. Looks good. I'm not sure how/if you can make some aspects of an instantiated contract not fully readable by everyone on your network though (i.e. in the style of something like Fabric) - having some aspects of a contract private between the signers is desirable for legal documents right?

Hi @silasdavis ... just brought a couple of Udemy courses on gRPC (circa 4 hours) and Protocol Buffers  (circa 4 hours) ... US$15 each ... Protocol Buffers a pre-requisite for GRPC ... it'll take me a couple of days to complete both courses ... but then i"m in a better place to help ... so far I've enjoyed listening to the tutor (he has 14,000 learners enrolled across 14 courses) ...

here's the url for each course:  
- Protocol Buffers - https://www.udemy.com/share/100isU/  
- gRPC - https://www.udemy.com/share/100n7i/

i now see that gRPC is a necessary toolset within my own tech skillset

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=RiEzCxrD3vZv6PMmZ) Ok I've sorted this out and corrected the github readme... Now does anyone know of a tutorial that shows how to interact with the chain without using a yaml file? I.e. by broadcasting transactions only or using the API gateway? I cannot find one but this seems to be the next step forward. Even a previous tutorial on an older version could help me get started.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 15:25:52 GMT):<br/>
@Luker501 if you look in our (Monax's) legacy-docs repo you'll see some more tutorials for doing that. You'll likely want to use javascript as it's quite hefty to go to bare metal. Also because now we're on GRPC it's not something you can easily formulate and then add via curl. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 15:29:06 GMT):<br/>
As to your question on the AN, it's really about what you put on chain. I don't personally believe a bag of spaghetti in terms of tons of state channels is operationally viable for a large public network on the one hand. On the other hand, most of the commercially viable information can be kept off chain. As an example, if I want to have a sale of widgets contract then the fact that i'm ordering widgets isn't really commercially important information. the commercially important information typically is how many widgets i'm ordering and at what price. the latter two (if I'm contemplating submitting invoices and payments via traditional systems -- something the AN is explicitly designed for) can be kept in encrypted parameters off chain, referenced by the API when it needs to trigger an invoice to be sent or a payment to be made. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 15:29:39 GMT):<br/>
The workflow that is kept on chain will just be the legally significant event that, e.g., an invoice was sent or the payment was received. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 15:30:36 GMT):<br/>
There is exposure on chain to the fact that I'm ordering widgets (while we can obfuscate what the individual process steps are doing, pattern matching is likely to be relatively easy) and *when* I'm ordering widgets. But there is only so much one can do to get the on chain benefits.

Regarding burrow, I've been playing around with it a bit more. Looks like you cannot deploy a contract with abstract functions thought? :( I've logged this as an issue here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/846). In the mean time I'm going to have to think how I can get around this issue for my dapp.
</p>
<p><strong>Luker501</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 11:50:37 GMT):<br/>
Ah no worries, didn't know you cannot deploy an abstract contract... I will continue my bug searching then...

fyi @silasdavis ...this reply from the hyperledger training working group ... @paulransfield You can definitely let people in the burrow channel that the Hyperledger MOOC on edX has over 104k total enrollments to date, in less than 10 months since it went live. By the way, we are working on a second version of the MOOC, most likely launching at the end of October, and it would be really good if we could add a chapter on Burrow. If there is anybody interested in assisting with that, I would be happy to connect with then and discuss about it. We will be adding new chapters on Indy and Composer, and one on Burrow would be a great addition

I completed this mooc in December ... they used a short video interview of the tech leads to introduce a given toolset ... if they repeated this approach, which has its pros n cons, then it's not much more than being videoed with an existing pitch deck

I have another question, is it possible to create a network of nodes with Burrow? I can't see any insight on the repo!
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 07:58:47 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to set up at least 3 nodes on a burrow network and see how they works in a permissioned way! I tried to see the permissioned stuff above accounts on Burrow 0.19 and does not work (account with no permissions could deploy and call functions of a smart contact using legacy-contracts-js). How is the permissioned stuff over accounts and nodes going on? 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 10:08:18 GMT):<br/>
Yes certainly possible. Just distribute the config, genesis and keys to wherever the three nodes are running. If you're doing it all on a single machine make sure to watch the port conflicts. 
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 10:09:17 GMT):<br/>
Is there any stuff related to peers? which config do you mean? a toml?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 10:09:29 GMT):<br/>
As to permissions each account, when created gets the global default permissions for your chain which are human readable in the genesis spec and machine readable in the gensis.jaon
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 10:09:50 GMT):<br/>
My default global permissions allow for the deployment of contracts. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 10:10:46 GMT):<br/>
Not sure what you mean by anything with peers? And by config I mean the burrow.toml 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 10:11:06 GMT):<br/>
Within the burrow.toml there are fields for peers. 
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 10:11:21 GMT):<br/>

Hey, I would like to try the following scenario: there are 3 individuals (A,B and C). A send a tx to transfer amount to B but C cannot see that tx. Could i make this? I should deal with accounts or nodes?

<p><strong>ds2xor</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 14:21:32 GMT):<br/>
I found burrow use Apache license, and bosmarmot's burrow.js use GPL3.0 or later, but didn't find bos license, when will you update the license? will burrow.js use Apache license too?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 08:57:48 GMT):<br/>
@ds2xor bos is licensed Apache and is currently being merged into burrow itself as the `burrow deploy` command. That will harmonize some of the package use and licenses. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 08:58:38 GMT):<br/>
Burrow.js will remain GPL3.0 for now because we have dependencies on packages that are currently incompatible with Apache. We'd like to make it Apache but have more work to do to duplicate some of the effort of our dependencies before we can finalize the transition to Apache. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 08:59:49 GMT):<br/>
@mmartinez.blocknitive yes, you can modify an account's permissions for an example of how to do this see this test fixture -> https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/tree/develop/tests/jobs_fixtures/app03-basic_and_advanced_permission_txs_and_queries
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 09:01:42 GMT):<br/>
as to "hiding" transactions, burrow does not allow such a feature unlike Sawtooth or Fabric. If it is on chain then all the validators can see the transaction. If this selective viewing of transactions is vital to your use case then I'd recommend that you utilize Sawtooth or Fabric in EVM mode rather than Burrow. In the alternative you could use a level 2 scaling and privacy solution in the vein of the state channel solutions that are getting developed. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:56:24 GMT):<br/>
All, please note that burrow v0.21.0 is out. This is basically a hotfix release after some non-deterministic issues were found in v0.20.0 from one of our upstream libraries (tendermint's serialization library) we *highly* encourage everyone to upgrade ASAP. https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/releases/tag/v0.21.0

Hello,
I am currently trying to deploy a contract on hyperledger burrow (simple storage), I can start burrow, but when I try to deploy the contract with burrow deploy --address=[first burrow.toml address] it says exec: "solc": executable file not found in $PATH, but I have executed this in the direcotry where deploy.yaml and storage.sol is.
</p>
<p><strong>sccburrow</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 12:51:45 GMT):<br/>
So does anybody know what I am doing wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>sccburrow</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 08:04:49 GMT):<br/>
OS: Ubuntu 18.04 64 bit :)
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 08:57:37 GMT):<br/>
if you're trying to compile a contract you'll need the solc binary on your machine. does `which solc` return a path? 
</p>
<p><strong>sccburrow</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 09:07:06 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the response
 no it does not return anything, how can I fix this?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 09:15:58 GMT):<br/>
you'll need to install the solidity compiler -> https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/installing-solidity.html
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 09:16:03 GMT):<br/>
then you'll be good to go. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 09:16:35 GMT):<br/>
for Ubuntu easiest way is:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install solc
```
</p>
<p><strong>sccburrow</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 09:19:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I think it would be helpful if this would be mentioned in the Installation / Getting Started of the readme of https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow

Great it worked, okay I will try.  :)
When I execute make build I only get /bin/borrow but not /bin/burrow-client, do you also know what I am doing wrong here?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 10:20:10 GMT):<br/>
you aren't doing anything wrong. burrow-client has been removed and the key functionality has been combined into the burrow binary.

okk cool, one last question (hopefully):
how can I make a test call from a certain address in an yaml test file, a normal function call looks like this:
- name: [variable to save result in]
  query-contract:
      destination: [instance to send the call]
function: [functionName]

but how do I specify to send a call from a certain address ? (in truffle javascript tests you would write {from: xxx} as a function argument)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=mgbgqYQF3aMAjGFxF) @compleatang Thanks for reply! ,  I mean that we can push the tx merkle tree of multiple blocks regularly  to the main chain to provide proof  of asset in private chain so anybody can audit ?  I'm looking to have an edge to use burrow alternative to closed private chains.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 10:07:22 GMT):<br/>
@puneet yes, you can pass in the appHash into Eth. That's dead simple and the block headers of each block give you the appHash (which is the root of the state merkle tree of the burrow chain); we also have the root of the block's merkle tree in the header as well. We don't currently have a function where a burrow node can do this directly. Currently you'd need a few functions in a middleware, but we are currently thinking through how to more easily help our users that want to interact. We'd love an issue which outlines exactly what you'd like to see from the burrow binary in terms of a user story here -> https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 10:09:54 GMT):<br/>
@sccburrow yes that's possible, just pass in `account: [address]` in between name and query-contract (although query-contract's are simulated calls and are not signed). for the full reference see here -> https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/burrow/deploy/def#Job

@all Is anyone in the community willing to help get burrow working with truffle? We've been looking into this and @dennismckinnon from our team has a bit of time to start it, but we'd love some assistance from the community. From our early explorations it looks fairly doable.

</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 10:18:15 GMT):<br/>
samples of sinking a block header into eth? not that i'm aware of. it's a matter of pulling block_info grabbing the hash you want and sending it to eth. not really complicated.
</p>

Puneet here's a small example:

```
# start burrow chain
burrow spec -f1 | burrow configure -s- > burrow.toml
burrow start -v0
# pull app hash from block header
curl "localhost:26658/block?height=2" | jq -r .result.Block.header.app_hash > header.txt
# send to eth
```
</p>
<p><strong>puneet</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 10:29:32 GMT):<br/>
can we also pass this using rpc ?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 10:32:38 GMT):<br/>
yes. that was just meant to be a simple example. anything that can call http and parse json will do it.

<p><strong>puneet</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 10:32:49 GMT):<br/>
afaik  in  Public permissioned networks  Burrow can be a best pick. can you tell me any info how/where burrow is used in https://agreements.network/ ?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 10:32:54 GMT):<br/>
you don't even need the GRPC layer to do the above.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 10:33:28 GMT):<br/>
burrow is the blockchain client for the agreements.network. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 10:34:08 GMT):<br/>
when the mainnet launches we'll be leveraging burrow's permission layer to provide advanced governance around new smart contracts added to the chain and ensuring that network level terms of service are agreed to by validators. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 10:34:53 GMT):<br/>
otherwise the permission layer will be turned either off (for `sudo` like permissions used on consortia chains, testnets, and local development chains)  or to fully public (for all other permissions).

I'm working on an example where a public permissioned chain with known validators  but without trust ,Issue is  I don't want to use fabric or sawtooth it's best suitable for  private chain use cases , future path for my project to have a "public permissioned " network with interoperable functionality so we can move the assets going forward. would burrow be a good pick ?

That aligns with many of our requirements for the Agreements Network... So I'd say yes 😀

Hello All, I'm new to Hyperledger chat but have a question pertaining to Hyperledger Burrow. Our resource needs the ability to accept / interpret / and disburse per a smart contract. I see many blogs and sites regarding Creating" smart contracts but very little on what technology is needed to accept and interpret. I came across Hyperledger Burrow. Is this the add on / platform that is needed to accomplish my desired results? Thanks. #burrow 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:56:56 GMT):<br/>
@JSchlimmer it sounds like you might be talking our language, but it's a little difficult to understand what level of abstraction you are coming from with:
> Our resource needs the ability to accept / interpret / and disburse per a smart contract
Are you thinking in terms of a legal agreement represented in code (i.e. a smart contract), or making a payment where execution is implemented in code.

> technology is needed to accept and interpret.
Again do you mean systems to do something based on the state of a smart contract?

To give some framework: a smart contract on Burrow is a piece of code - some logical rules (not necessarily a 'contract' of any kind - though it could be used to implement various elements of contract-ness). Certain authorised key-holders can prod that piece of code and have it change its values ('knight to E5', 'perform a 1 to 10 share split', whatever). We can consume the new state of the contract by querying it or by listening for events. If you ignore the way the state is maintain (via consensus on blockchain network) you can think of it as being like any kind of centralised data store - a google sheet, facebook, a cloud accounting package.
</p>
<p><strong>JSchlimmer</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:58:01 GMT):<br/>
yes. based on the legal agreement within a smart contract,
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:58:01 GMT):<br/>
@here we have made another step towards a slightly better documentation situation for our new tooling, here is an example app based on our latest stuff: https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/tree/develop/example/basic-app
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:58:17 GMT):<br/>
feedback welcome
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:58:47 GMT):<br/>
We also recently added documentation on burrow.js: https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/tree/develop/burrow.js
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:59:30 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:00:49 GMT):<br/>
That is concerned with implementing legal agreements - a large part of which is code that runs _on top_ of Burrow rather than being _part of_ Burrow
</p>
<p><strong>JSchlimmer</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:00:57 GMT):<br/>
The part that has me confused is what is software or Dapp is needed to interpret a created smart contract. Example: Part A gets under contract with party B to sell their house. Party A needs to place funds in escrow. Escrow agent recieves smart contract and funds. How do we read the smart contract? lol does that help explain?
</p>
<p><strong>JSchlimmer</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:01:27 GMT):<br/>
i'm watching your video now.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:02:45 GMT):<br/>
yes great - so given that this is the sort of problem we are solving with the Agreements Network I can describe a bit about that, but if you'd like to know more specifically about that you might want to go to our telegram group: https://t.me/Agreements_Network. This channel is focused on general purpose use of Burrow (which I maintain).
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:04:14 GMT):<br/>
The way a legal producer would model the scenario you describe would be produce a bundle, we call an archetype, of legal prose and an a process model (a workflow that sufficiently describes the parts of the agreement that are potentially executable - not all law is, most probably isn't)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:05:05 GMT):<br/>
this process model which is written in a language called BPMN (Business Process Modelling Notation) - it's a computerised flow chart.
</p>
<p><strong>JSchlimmer</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:05:43 GMT):<br/>
heading there now. Am I wrong in saying that the agreement network is the tool needed to interpret executed smart contracts? Sorry, I'm just trying to simplify this for my brain.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:06:14 GMT):<br/>
Can you define what you mean by interpret?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:06:32 GMT):<br/>
As in - like a human lawyer?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:07:04 GMT):<br/>
Or as in a machine that understands a fulfilment event that says 'escrow funds received'?
</p>
<p><strong>JSchlimmer</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:07:29 GMT):<br/>
I prefer option 2. specifically when the smart contracts defines who gets paid what and when.
</p>
<p><strong>JSchlimmer</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:08:04 GMT):<br/>
we need to be able to understand that, have it populate into our system for disbursements
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:08:43 GMT):<br/>
okay good, when we hit certain points in the process (and we can verify that parties that need to agree to move the process along have agreed via digital signatures) the system can emit events to listening system - legal backoffice, banking, whatever
</p>
<p><strong>JSchlimmer</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:08:54 GMT):<br/>
Let me preface, all my focus here is on the sale of real estate.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:08:54 GMT):<br/>
and they can take some action based on that
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:10:05 GMT):<br/>
so the agreements network provide an interface - the integration (which is what I think I would describe as your 'interpret') would need to be built into whatever system downstream needs to respond
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:10:38 GMT):<br/>
but the idea of a stream of 'legal events' is probably what you should have in mind 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:10:49 GMT):<br/>
these can be consumed over our API
</p>

<p><strong>oxae</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 19:36:14 GMT):<br/>
i understand this to be to role of a client
</p>
<p><strong>oxae</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 19:36:40 GMT):<br/>
is every interaction with the chain supposed to be done with the yaml file
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 22:18:00 GMT):<br/>
Typically that is done with middleware. You can check out the documentation for burrow.js which is a middleware library for node based applications here -> https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot in the burrow.js directory. Also there you can see a small example application which will do simple reading and contract calls

@sccburrow you can do this manually currently, but are you looking for something more automated that would run something like `burrow deploy -f deploy.yaml --validator-index 3` and then burrow would use the third key in the index (we currently have this functionality on start for example). Or are you looking for something more specific in the yaml itself? This would likely be an addition as currently we require reading from the genesis.json or burrow.toml and giving `burrow deploy` the actual address. We, e.g., in our CI system often do something like this:

```
addr=$(cat genesis.json | jq '.Accounts[] | select(.Name == "Validator_$index") | .Address')
```

Hello all - 
I have a very introductory question. I am approaching HyperLedger as an Ethereum Developer, but find the documentation too confusing to understand alone.
Can someone please explain to me what Burrow is - separate from a "Blockchain client" - by comparing it to Ethereum? Per instance: 
I can use Geth (the Go-Ethereum client) to create a private Blockchain with as many Nodes as I wish. Can I do the same with Burrow? How about with any other HyperLedger projects such as Composer? 
With Ethereum, I can house each geth Node of the Blockchain in multiple places (Terminal, Raspberry Pi, EC2); can I do the same with the nodes of my private Burrow blockchain?
Additionally, I can deploy Solidity Smart Contracts onto my Private Ethereum Blockchain; can I do this with a Burrow Blockchain?

I apologize if my questions are either too basic or radically misinterpret Burrow. All help is appreciated.

Can any of the nodes I create "mine"/validate transactions/create blocks?

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 22:29:48 GMT):<br/>
@theomarshanti Hopefully all your answers are below:

Can you set up a network with as many nodes as you want? Yes and no, currently there's an upper bound on Tendermint POS of 100 nodes, but below that yes.

Can nodes validate? Yes, if you give them permissions to do so. 

Can burrow nodes run in different places? Yes, however for the same validator key that can only be running on one location currently. Tendermint is working on multi-sig for validators but currently one validator node: one key: one binary instance (running wherever you wish). One thing I'll point out that is a difference in GEth and Burrow is that Burrow has an inbuilt permission layer which makes this much easier if you don't want the whole network to be behind a VPN. 

Can Solidity be deploy? Yes, at Monax we deploy roughly 50k lines of Solidity a day to various burrow based networks. The network works the exact same as any GEth based network in this regard. 

In general burrow is quite similar to GEth from the perspective of an application builder that's focusing on the solidity part. It's different from a network operator that is seeking to setup their network because we have Tendermint based proof of stake rather than POW and we have a permission layer which allows for you to, say, set only particular accounts that can deploy smart contracts, set other accounts that can validate but not send transactions, and whatever else you need to define for your network to operate smoothly.

We (Monax) run our own API service that sits on top of the current Agreements Network testnets. This deployment has its own set of keys to operate on the network and authenticates _its_ users against a central database (postrgres), it then sends transactions on behalf of those users as a delegate.

Some important things to note:
- You can interact with the raw smart contract interface by signing and sending your own transactions
- The API service and associated services will be release as open source in the next month or so as part of the Node Distribution - this will allow you to run the same front end server 'at the edge' whatever that means for you - in a kubernetes cluster like us, or on your laptop, whereby the API server would have access to your private keys
- Each user is (or will be) represented by a user proxy contract that, that relays transactions on behalf of that users - effectively this is like a 'hot wallet'. Using this indirection we can layer various forms of authentication access control on the user proxy - it could only relay transactions for a specific key, it might need a threshold number of keys, the keys it authorised may belong to a web front end or may only reside on a secure HSM
- The T3 test network is currently running with 11/12 validators, the quorum of which belong to us (in the test network stages) the other validators are being run by our network cofounders. As we spin this network out (the testnet series is building towards a production release) we will relinquish quorum (i.e. have less than 2/3 voting power) on the network

To be clear: there is no expectation that _we_ control your keys, but the architecture is multi-layered and there is scope for users who want to interact using a traditional service account model can do so. This lives in layers above the core decentralised network, and the Monax-flavoured gateway is just one - and ultimately will not be given any special status on the network.

Using this indirection we can layer various forms of authentication/access control on the user proxy - it could only relay transactions for a specific key, it might need a threshold number of keys, the keys it authorised may belong to a web front end or may only reside on a secure HSM
- The T3 test network is currently running with 11/12 validators, the quorum of which belong to us (in the test network stages) the other validators are being run by our network cofounders. As we spin this network out (the testnet series is building towards a production release) we will relinquish quorum (i.e. have less than 2/3 voting power) on the network

To be clear: there is no expectation that _we_ control your keys, but the architecture is multi-layered and there is scope for users who want to interact using a traditional service account model to do so. This lives in layers above the core decentralised network, and the Monax-flavoured gateway is just one of what will hopefully be many - and ultimately will not be given any special status on the network.

can we use Web3 Compatibility of ethermint in burrow ? Afaik both runs on top of tendermint.

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:09:58 GMT):<br/>
We're working on a web3 provider so folks can use truffle and such but it'll take some time to finalize that. Burrow does not implement web3 because that's a dumpster fire of handrolled code. But that can be abstracted for users. And we'll start working on a prototype along with truffle folks shortly.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=vCzLHB4MkSZXsErD8) @compleatang Hi, what exactly do you mean by web3 being a dumpster fire of handrolled code? Is that a comment on its organisation or security issues, or anything else?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Sat, 01 Sep 2018 08:17:07 GMT):<br/>
It's a custom json rpc framework which means that implementers need to handroll a bunch of code that's custom rather than using something like gRPC and protobuf which is much more deeply tested across a huge range of production systems and is maintained according to deep engineering principles.

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sat, 01 Sep 2018 12:10:58 GMT):<br/>
@Luker501 haha @compleatang is being a little poetic with 'dumpster fire' - it's at least based on JSON-RPC - but it's perhaps not how you would build an RPC for an EVM all things being equal, it also isn't very modular. We still might try and support a proxy for it against our GRPC interfaces. I'd agree with with Case though - GRPC has a huge amount of testing and generality behind it, and perhaps more importantly forces you to define you domain model aside from you implementation/RPC layer (to some extent). It's also has some efficiency (binary format) and robustness (strongly typed schema) advantages over a typical JSON-RPC implementation - though of course the quality of the implementation matters. I would imagine geth's web3 layer is pretty solid these days really, but using GRPC means we can get solid clients for _free_ across a range of services including our ETL layer, and at the same time we define our public interfaces even when used in code.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sat, 01 Sep 2018 12:14:09 GMT):<br/>
@puneet the data model is more-or-less the same. We have permissions and roles associated with accounts that are serialised and stored in the IAVL tree. When you say visualise do you mean in your mind or literally? For a mental model we have an account tree of `Address -> Account (public key (maybe), balance, code, permissions, roles)` and a storage key `Address -> Word256 Key -> Word256 Value`

@sccburrow and @puneet it's a factor of defaults we give to burrow deploy. if you give it an amount then the assumption is that you will also give a fee and/or gas.

<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 14:48:56 GMT):<br/>
hello @puneet  I believe the error you are getting is due to you having an incorrect payload
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 14:49:19 GMT):<br/>
in particular the "Input" field is not just the buffer of the address
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 14:49:56 GMT):<br/>
its a TxInput object as described here https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/blob/develop/burrow.js/protobuf/payload.proto#L33-L41
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 14:50:19 GMT):<br/>
I wonder though is there a reason you are using the low-level grpc interface for this task?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 14:51:20 GMT):<br/>
You could also use burrow.namereg.set/get as described here https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/tree/develop/burrow.js#namereg
</p>

your payload needs to be an object of the form
```
var setPayload = {
    Input: {
          Address: Buffer.from(account,'hex'),
          Amount: 50000
    },
    Name:"HELLO",
    Data:"WORLD",
    Fee:5000
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 13:39:07 GMT):<br/>
see here where I do it for wrapping the low level interface https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/blob/develop/burrow.js/lib/namereg.js
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 13:39:38 GMT):<br/>
you can access this function as burrow.namreg.set()
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 13:40:00 GMT):<br/>
so you don't have to construct the payload yourself.

@here burrow v0.22 is released. It's a smaller release with some bug fixes, a routine Tendermint upgrade (to v0.24) and niceties around `burrow deploy`. Next release will include some big steps forward in terms of network governance primitives and also token economic primitives.

@here this isn't strictly burrow related, but certainly it is tangentially related to both burrow and a number of blockchains for business use cases. We'd like to let everyone know that our Blackstone project is now released. As part of this project we have a fully-featured business process execution engine and also a high level API which can injest BPMN models and translate those into process graphs in solidity which can be executed by the engine. If you are doing *anything* related to shared processes on a blockchain it's definitely worth checking out. Of course, because it is EVM code it'll also run on #sawtooth-seth and #fabric-evm over time (will need some wrapping to utilize their RPCs rather than burrows but the code itself will run fine). We hope it can be useful to everyone! https://github.com/agreements-network/blackstone

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=uPkLChomvv977984g) @compleatang Why not providing the web3 API as a Protobuf mapping?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 13:06:36 GMT):<br/>
@tglaeser regarding web3, at Monax we've never used it. We're certainly open to community contributions but it's never been high enough priority for us to spend the time given all the other things to build. We are working on providing a burrow web3 provider which would allow web3 tooling that use the provider scheme to integrate with burrow over our GRPC framework rather than the web3 RPC schema. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 13:06:57 GMT):<br/>
That work isn't at the top of our stack right now, but it's fairly high in the stack.

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 13:08:15 GMT):<br/>
best documentation for the GRPC and Info port is via godocs -> https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/burrow/rpc

Thanks @compleatang - I believe that's along the lines I was thinking ... The _burrow web3 provider_ essentially exposing the web3 API as GRPC, which itself is an extension to the Protobuf core; would that be a correct description? What is the timeline? _Fairly high_ sounds almost like there will always be something with higher priority.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:50:32 GMT):<br/>
I can't give a timeline right now. At Monax we don't use web3 so we don't really have a selfish need to put resources behind the effort just now given other priorities. Obviously community help is always appreciated.

Hello @JyotiGoda , are you sure this is about Burrow ? I'm also new to Burrow, but I see no sign of a 'basic-app' (if there is, please link it :D)

I also have a question, where can we find a list of available commands in yaml files ? If you look at the test app23 (https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/tree/develop/tests/jobs_fixtures/app23-save_tx_hash_of_call), there is this save `save: tx` at the `setStorage` call. So, how do you know that the tx value will hash the data ?

Thanks a lot.

@totolouis yes, this is about Burrow...more specifically about using burrow.js to develop a node.js application which can communicate with a solidity contract. The basic-app example can be found at https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/tree/develop/example/basic-app
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 10:39:48 GMT):<br/>
@JyotiGoda it looks like burrow deploy had trouble running the solidity compiler. Do you have solc in your path and is a recent version, and executable? I would recommend at least solc 0.4.24
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 10:43:12 GMT):<br/>
@totolouis the deploy yaml is deserialised into these structures, there is some documentation in the struct definitions: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/deploy/def/jobs.go
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 12:47:24 GMT):<br/>
@totolouis documentation is on godocs; specifically for what you're looking for it's here -> https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/burrow/deploy/def#Call

@seanyoung Thanks you for your reply. I have checked the following: 1. The global $PATH variable includes /usr/local/lib. The solidity compiler (solcjs) resides in /usr/local/lib/node_modules/solc/solcjs I also have a link from /usr/local/bin called solc which links to the solcjs file. The link was initially not executable, I have tried to make it executable and retried but faced the same issue. 2. The solidity version I am using is solc 0.4.24   

I am still facing the same issue and make start_app throws up the same error

Also, I am able to separately compile solidity files and manually deploy them on a separate burrow blockchain from a separate subfolder in the same parent folder. I am also able to use truffle to compile .sol files to deploy on private ethereum chains.

<p><strong>totolouis</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:53:23 GMT):<br/>
@JyotiGoda Maybe it has something to do with some paths in the makefile. Did your paths are the same as the file ?

<p><strong>JyotiGoda</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 19:59:58 GMT):<br/>
@totolouis I have given up trying to get the example app to work and simply deployed my contract onto the burrow blockchain manually. I am now in the process of setting up the javascript app which will communicate with the chain. I also understand that Burrow has an API interface that exposes REST endpoints to interact with the blockchain network and the application state through broadcasting transactions, or querying the current state of the application. Is there any documentation available for this interface?

</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 10:53:11 GMT):<br/>
Cool. A potential project would be to understand the performance implications for various validator set configurations based on a given solidity contract. So for a validator set of 1 node, 4 nodes, 7 nodes, 10 nodes, etc. what is the through put allocation. Have you synced up with the performance and scalability working group (they have a channel in here somewhere)..?
</p>
<p><strong>tahaf10</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:04:39 GMT):<br/>
Right now I'm exploring the possibilities. All of my previous work has been on Fabric so I'll have to study Burrow in detail (Which I haven't yet) This is why I'm asking project leaders if they have any specific areas in mind (preferably related to performance optimization) which can add value to their projects. I've joined the performance and scalability work group but not much activity in there

<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 13:08:32 GMT):<br/>
Hi,  just wondering what is the purpose of gas in Hyperledger Burrow. It has any funcionality except from providing infinite loops? What happen If I spent all my gas and I need more to go on executing smart contract's functions? Could validators give gas to other accounts? When Validators "mine", they earn the term of gas called "Amount" or "Power"? Thanks in advance
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:24:18 GMT):<br/>
infinite loops mainly. gas costs ZERO tokens in the burrow model, so callee's can give as much gas as needed to drive a contractual sequence. 
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:57:25 GMT):<br/>
And what happens if account's gas is equal to zero? How could an account earn some gas to perform txs?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 16:48:03 GMT):<br/>
the question conflates tokens and gas. in the public ethereum model one uses ETH (tokens) to purchase gas at a particular gas price. So when sending transactions one needs to have tokens sufficient to pay for gas at the rate of `gasAmount*gasPrice`. in the burrow model `gasPrice` is `0`. to the concept of an account having or not having gas doesn't matter. if the account has the permission to call a contract then they set how much gas they want to use in our communist :) system and send the transaction.

<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 17:25:52 GMT):<br/>
haha I understand the communism style it is based on, but why we should set an "amount"pastebin
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 17:25:52 GMT):<br/>
haha I understand the communism style it is based on, but why we should set an "amount" (native type) in genesis-spec.json ?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 18:29:44 GMT):<br/>
contracts can still use native token value in the normal ethereum way, it's just no value is subtracted based on the length of the computation. You can use native token to represent value or a bond for incentivisation.

</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 10:52:22 GMT):<br/>
I am having some problems with the permissions. I am trying to set an account which can read  (call constant functions) and cannot write (make txs, change a var for example). What permissions this account should have? I set "name" and "hasRole" but doesnt work. It says I should add "call" permission, but If I do it, this account will be able to write. any idea?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 11:55:42 GMT):<br/>
this is not a level of granularity currently provided by permissions system
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 11:55:53 GMT):<br/>
either you can `CALL` or not
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 11:56:25 GMT):<br/>
however, we are just in the process of implementing `STATICCALL` and the way we are doing it is by providing some state interfaces that provide a firewall against writes
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 11:56:55 GMT):<br/>
so this actually an interesting permission/mode
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 11:57:36 GMT):<br/>
we currently have `CallTxSim` which performs a simulated call that will not make any writes
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 11:58:30 GMT):<br/>
aha, ok that feature could be interesting
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 11:59:08 GMT):<br/>
with that call you could see what would happen with an account that _was_ allowed to call code
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 11:59:10 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to set multiple accounts with differente permissions, like can deploy or not, can write or not, can read or not
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 11:59:38 GMT):<br/>
so the callee would need to know the address of some account that has suitable permissions
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:00:42 GMT):<br/>
The way to think about the baked-in permissions are that they are firm backstop, like unix-style permissions, you often need finer grained permissions and you can use various solidity patterns to achieve that 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:01:25 GMT):<br/>
which can be more like access control list, role-based access controls, something like LDAP or PAM
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:01:56 GMT):<br/>
You can also use the roles system to enforce system wide role-based permissions
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:02:29 GMT):<br/>
since your smart contracts can use the hasRole and addRole snatives 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:03:57 GMT):<br/>
ensuring a particular transaction makes not writes is an interesting idea though. I'm not sure it quite fits as a permission. I don't think we have generally wanted to prevent an account from doing any writes anywhere
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:04:07 GMT):<br/>
at the smart contract level by the way, STATICCALL is probably want you want
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:04:25 GMT):<br/>
which is set by specifying `pure` in solidity
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:04:25 GMT):<br/>
which is invoked on calls by specifying `pure` in solidity
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:05:02 GMT):<br/>
if you contract code attempts a write then that will be an error
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:08:31 GMT):<br/>
well, I think that solidity patterns + burrow permissions can be a great combination
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:09:42 GMT):<br/>
nevertheless, I dont understand why you think a permission for deploy a contract is interesting but not a read permission.
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:11:11 GMT):<br/>
In my opinion, a permissioned blockchain would include at least these three permissions.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:18:12 GMT):<br/>
usually participants need to be able to write to at least some contracts - such as their own proxy or wallet contracts. Also if you have access to a node you do in essence already have 'read' access to account to storage, and as I've said through CallTxSim. I suppose what this doesn't serve is a contract behaving differently by considering the reader in the case of a 'pure function' (solidity pure functions aren't really pure IMV because they depend on contract state even though they can't writ it).
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:18:30 GMT):<br/>
The way to implement this would be to add a `WRITE` permission
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:19:24 GMT):<br/>
which would have some overlap with `CREATE`, depending on how you look at it. You may want to allow 'read-only' creation I suppose.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:19:59 GMT):<br/>
I'd love to see a BIP on it: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/docs/BIPS/bip-X_template.md
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:20:52 GMT):<br/>
unless input accounts have `WRITE` then we can run the VM with a read-only state and event sink
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:21:39 GMT):<br/>
and it would be an error for them to call any contracts that modify state
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:22:24 GMT):<br/>
the idea being that `READ` is just an implicit permission - as I say the other RPCs treat mere access as implicit grant of read
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:23:29 GMT):<br/>
If you don't have time/inclination for a BIP then an issue would also serve as a placeholder for someone who may want to work on it to pick it up
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:25:44 GMT):<br/>
I will create a BIP or Issue for sure. Nevertheless I feel like I am missing some info of the permission layer of the EVM...
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:26:48 GMT):<br/>
btw, As far as I know, hasRole addRole and snatives, are used to change the account's permissions  while burrow is running, am i right?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:27:00 GMT):<br/>
There is some commentary here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/permission/perm_flag.go
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:27:11 GMT):<br/>
we could do with something fuller under docs/
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:27:33 GMT):<br/>
those one just set roles - roles are just a bag of words
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:28:08 GMT):<br/>
the permission flags themselves are set with `setBase`, `hasBase` etc:  https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/permission/perm_flag.go#L40-L46
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:28:57 GMT):<br/>
again if you have any appetite for helping putting together some markdown docs on permission I'd be happy to work with you on that and it would be appreciated
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:30:11 GMT):<br/>
 I will write a light doc about permissioning and feel free to correct it please :D
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:30:58 GMT):<br/>
sure, always easier to correct than write from scratch. Feel free to leave a 'fill-in-the-blanks' type comment if you feel like it's missing
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:31:01 GMT):<br/>
just another thing, the permission settings are uniform for all the smart contracts. are you planning to make it more flexible?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:31:33 GMT):<br/>
writing docs is question of time, but also being too close to the codebase/idiosyncrasies means I'm often not the right person to do some of them 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:32:44 GMT):<br/>
permissions currently apply for input accounts - it would need some careful thought about implementing variable permissions based on callee contract
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:33:03 GMT):<br/>
in particularly we'd want to know that dealing with it in contract land would not be better
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:34:00 GMT):<br/>
one thing that I think we will need is a more powerful namereg that has the notion of namespaces and 'authenticated namespaces' - we might consider extending the permissioning model to include some notion of a 'domain of contracts'
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:34:22 GMT):<br/>
but this is a bit vague now (and needs me to write a BIP)
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:36:31 GMT):<br/>
aha, that's the key thing. Maybe dealing with it in contract land would be enough... but a 'domain of contracts' sounds pretty reasonable
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:36:49 GMT):<br/>
this may be too waffley already - but something we need at Monax is the ability to have contract events that are authenticated - i.e. are emitted from a group or namespace of contracts. That is a kind of permissioning that may or may not be something in the direction of what you are thinking about. 
</p>
<p><strong>mmartinez.blocknitive</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:38:02 GMT):<br/>

@echohtp when you run that deploy command within the docker container it does not have access to your host's localhost. when you run the nc command it is accessing localhost from the host domain rather than from within the container. so basically the container based 127.0.0.1 is completely different from host's 127.0.0.1. you'll need to utilize docker's link command to link to the running burrow chain and then burrow deploy's --chain-url flag to point it to that address. just do a quick google for "docker links" to learn more....

Hi everyone! Can smart contracts in Burrow change the permissions for a given account? I read this on https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/HIP_Burrowv2.pdf : "Roles can be updated via discrete transactions or by smart contracts."

Hi all, where is the list of account permissions? I've found this on another website, is it correct? (If so it looks like you cannot differentiate read permissions by the smart contract - either you have read permissions for all smart contracts or none): root = full permissions. Use with care.
send = permission to send TX.
call = permission to call contracts.
name = permission to add an entry in name registry.
create_contract = permission to create contract.
create_account = permission to create an account.
bond = permission to send a bond TX allowing to be part of the validator pool.
add_role = permission to add roles to accounts.
has_role = permission to query role of accounts.
rm_role = permission to remove role from accounts.
set_base = permission to set permissions.
unset_base = permission to remove permissions.
has_base = permission to query permissions of an account.
set_global = permission to set eris:db network parameters.

@carlosfaria depends on how you setup the network. If you leverage the whitelisting functionality then only whitelisted nodes can connect to a particular network. If you don't then any node connected to your network can sync. We have no particular read permission. All nodes on a burrow network have full access to the state of that network. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 04:03:38 GMT):<br/>

Hey Guys, I have read somewhere, Fabric 1.3 support EVM build-in which is used to run Ethereum Smart Contract. Hope using this, we can do `value transfer`. I would like know where does the `value transaction` happening? Could anyone help me to understand? I am new to burrow.
</p>
<p><strong>carlosfaria</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 15:24:02 GMT):<br/>
When an account is created, which permissions are taken as default? Or we need to set the permissions for every account?
I saw that there is `DefaultAccountPermissions` available:
https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/permission/perm_flag.go#L58 is this the default permissions set when I create a new account?
We really want to collaborate in this project, but first we need to understand how it works.
</p>
<p><strong>carlosfaria</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 16:08:02 GMT):<br/>
I tested and saw when creating a new account the permissions assigned was: `send | call | name | proposal | input | hasRole`. How can I add another default permissions?

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 16:48:03 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 16:48:44 GMT):<br/>
You can add permissions using burrow deploy:
`jobs:
- name: permTest1
  permission:
      action: setBase
      target: $addr
      permission: batch
      value: "true"
`
</p>

(put that into a deploy yaml, make sure addr is replace with the address you want)

Carlos. Yes. You set that in the genesis file (either in burrow.toml by default or genesis.json if you're using a separate genesis file). There's a setting like globalDefaultPermissions or something to that effect. Just change that from the defaults before you instantiate the chain. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 01:45:52 GMT):<br/>
@tranhl  not much to explain. It's an in-built registry which you can use for your use case or not. We typically use it as a DNS like registry for key smart contracts and their addresses. So when we boot an application it can query a specific name, get a contracts address and interact with that contact directly. But it's just a key value storage layer so it can be used for whatever your use case may demand.

Thank you @compleatang I set the `GlobalPermissions` in the genesis and then config a new chain, but now when I create a new account, it does not show any permissions. I think something is wrong setting `GlobalPermissions`:
```
  "GlobalPermissions": [
    "send",
    "call",
    "name",
    "hasRole",
    "proposal",
    "input",
    "CreateAccount",
    "CreateContract"
  ],
```

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=arCF9KXwF7pqLYryy) @compleatang thanks for the clarification. on the topic of contract address discovery, i noticed that to use the high level `contracts` API provided by `burrow.js`, you have to provide the burrow ABI as an argument in order to correctly initialise the contract interface object. this begs the question, 'how do we make the abi discoverable/retrievable by anyone with minimal prerequisite knowledge?'. do you have any recommendations as to how we go about this? could the name registry be a solution to this use case?

I set the `GlobalPermissions`this way:
```
  "GlobalPermissions": {
    "Base": {
      "Perms": "send | call | createContract | createAccount | name | proposal | input | hasRole",
      "SetBit": "send | call | createContract | createAccount | name | proposal | input | hasRole"
    },
    "Roles": []
  }
```
following the tests setup: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/tests/chain/genesis.json
But when I run `burrow configure` I get: `Could not read GenesisSpec: json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field GenesisSpec.GlobalPermissions of type []string`
</p>
<p><strong>carlosfaria</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 13:48:10 GMT):<br/>
It's supposed to be an object, not an array, right? 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Sat, 17 Nov 2018 19:55:21 GMT):<br/>
@tranhl it could be. We've had an issue up to store ABIs Burrow side and to be able to retrieve them based on a hash of the contracts byte code but it hasn't risen to the top of our stack yet. (help always welcome!). 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Sat, 17 Nov 2018 19:57:01 GMT):<br/>
ABI management is frankly not a very easy use case. We publish all ABIs for the Agreements Network (a public permissioned chain we're building on top of burrow) to a git repository via CI and then turn on GH pages to allow easy retrieval of them. Strategies here depend on the use case frankly... 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Sat, 17 Nov 2018 19:57:31 GMT):<br/>
@carlosfaria yes the second way seems correct. Did you get it sorted?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=wWek4giBxQm5nYCp3) @compleatang thanks for the insights! to avoid adding additional CI dependencies, i've gone with using the low-level `burrow.js` API, as it does not require access to the ABI. this leads to another question though, is it possible to register a permanent name in the name registry? i noticed that names registered in the name registry have expiry dates. ideally, if i'm going to use the name registry as a DNS for contract addresses, it would be nice to not have to worry about when the names expire

Not currently, however if you set a really high fee rate it'll practically be there for a long time. This is another area we'd welcome assistance on...

How far along is Burrow? Sorry if I missed this. Basically I'd like to implement a fairly simple solidity smart contract on sawtooth and be able to trigger a smart contract on ethereum from it. basically a hybrid of permissioned and permissionless where we do all the high transaction stuff in sawtooth/burrow
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 10:05:06 GMT):<br/>
Burrow is the oldest permissioned blockchain client. It's coming up on being a four year old codebase. So it's pretty far along we run very sophisticated solidity systems on burrow every day at Monax. Although we do not yet version it at 1.0 as the major dependency we have on Tendermint (burrow's consensus engine) is not yet at 1.0 and we are hesitant to version burrow >= 1.0 until that time. What you are looking to do is certainly doable depending on how you structure your integration between the chains. In any event, you should discuss in #sawtooth-seth room for your use case.

hi folks, i'm ethereum developer and i use a lot web3, my question is, for Event's on web3 there is one thing that is ´PromiEvents´ and for other words i have a setup Node.js with burrow.js i sucessfully can deploy, create an instance of contracts , and call functions on contracts but what i'm try to do is when i call one function wich emits one event i want to capture like in web3. the response and the event. one thing wich web3 does is give me the block and tx hash of this 'contract method call'. how i can get this?

Summoned, I appear
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 16:47:46 GMT):<br/>
We do not currently add that information to the object because nobody has asked for it
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 16:48:06 GMT):<br/>
It can be added though as it should be available in the return object from the grpc
</p>

https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/blob/develop/burrow.js/protobuf/exec.proto#L79
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 16:50:37 GMT):<br/>
this is the grpc spec. If you can tell me what information you want attached to the event object return I can put them in.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 16:51:14 GMT):<br/>
in particular the header section probably contains most of the information you might care about
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 16:52:09 GMT):<br/>
I don't see blockhash included
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 16:52:27 GMT):<br/>
so if thats something important to you we would need to update the grpc endpoint itself
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 16:53:28 GMT):<br/>
Right now I don't return any of this meta data about the event https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/blob/develop/burrow.js/protobuf/exec.proto#L79

Actually no we are passed that
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 15:00:10 GMT):<br/>
the issue is that the input account does not exist in Burrow
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 15:00:27 GMT):<br/>
you have created the key and the signing as been successful using that key
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 15:00:36 GMT):<br/>
but creating the key does not create the account
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 15:07:51 GMT):<br/>
how i can activate my account?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 15:08:04 GMT):<br/>
There are four ways to 'create' an account: 

1. You can create an account at genesis where you can also set its permissions - typically you create a primary account you want to use to deploy contracts at genesis (you have one `BF6B575E6C7CECE899B04EA5D4FA56FD406BC5D2` and looks like you've got this)

2. You can emit a SendTx (using transact.SendTxSync) to the account and it will be created (with default global permissions)

3. You can create an account from a contract that emits a CREATE opcode (solidity `new MyContract()`). But you will not control the key.

4. You can send value with a CALL opcode to contract and it will be created.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 15:08:28 GMT):<br/>
I think we really ought to have an explicit example with 2, which is how you should do this
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 15:10:13 GMT):<br/>
to be honest, the reason it is like this is a little bit historical - the idea that without holding some token you can't act anyway. But in Burrow this is not true - we transact with zero gas fees (we meter gas to bound computation time but we don't charge for the gas run up) and value transfer is optional

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 15:11:56 GMT):<br/>
I suppose the other thing is that as permissioned ledger rather than allowing any key to act as an account we require an existing entity to prod that account into existing by 'doing something' to it.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 15:12:33 GMT):<br/>
we could create an input account implicitly - but by doing that we would convey default chain permissions to it without any existing entity making that explicit.

chain.transact.SendTxSync(sendTx).then(value => console.log(value)).catch(err => console.error(err))

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:11:58 GMT):<br/>
I'm still need to add some documentation but see for context: https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/pull/181/files#diff-ae2ee19565cedca227d9efa3dad88337R71
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:15:59 GMT):<br/>
cool 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:18:01 GMT):<br/>
yeah so the way burrow.js is designed you can't provide options like that to change the sender
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:18:07 GMT):<br/>
though it would be pretty easy to implement
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:18:16 GMT):<br/>
I guess it saves you an object instantiation
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:18:44 GMT):<br/>
there is nothing I can see stopping you from calling `burrow.account = "<address string you want to use>"`
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:18:56 GMT):<br/>
before you call the contact function
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:19:40 GMT):<br/>
which would have the effect of changing the input account, i.e. sender
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:20:31 GMT):<br/>
we also currently send a fixed amount of '1' which is hardcoded in the JS libs
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:20:59 GMT):<br/>
see: https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/blob/develop/burrow.js/lib/contracts/function.js#L23
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:21:20 GMT):<br/>
now this could easily be changed, and should be really to support various use cases
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:21:33 GMT):<br/>
I suppose in our case we do have the separate send functionality
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:24:11 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 09:54:00 GMT):<br/>
Question: from what I can see in the source code of burrow.js and the protobuf spec, accounts are always managed by the burrow keyserver. There's no way to just generate an account keypair locally and use it to send an already signed transaction (a "raw transaction" as it is called in web3) to a burrow node. It may have something to do with the fact that, in Burrow, accounts have these additional permissions. Would it however be possible to implement it anyhow? And would it be hard?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 09:59:11 GMT):<br/>
@tranhl using the grpc interface you can walk the blocks and get the entire history of the chain. Vent uses this to get all the events for the chain, see https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/blob/develop/vent/service/consumer.go#L144
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:00:09 GMT):<br/>
@JoeriExelmans burrow needs to know at least the public key to verify the signatures; so the keyserver  does need that.
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:00:51 GMT):<br/>
And another question :smiley:  How do you estimate the current performance of sending 'simulated calls', that is, just querying the state of the blockchain. For some business applications, it is necessary to query the blockchain state constantly. Can I send each such call to Burrow or is it better build a "cache" (using a DBMS) around it?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:00:59 GMT):<br/>
You can sign a tx locally and send it signed
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:02:13 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=HugrR5Jt2g7Ahqjwp) @seanyoung Okay, can you point me to the right place in the GRPC spec?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:02:29 GMT):<br/>
@JoeriExelmans simulated calls should be bound mostly by CPU, and will scale well on multicore (I think). I think this should be pretty fast
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:04:45 GMT):<br/>
In order to sign you need to that work locally and make sure signatories is filled in https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/protobuf/txs.proto#L25
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:05:44 GMT):<br/>
Also about performance, with plain Ethereum it can be slow to query logs, because transactions must be re-executed to find them. I guess the same situation in Burrow and that's why you developed Vent?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:06:37 GMT):<br/>
In burrow the events are stored in the blocks so there is no need for re-execution
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:07:20 GMT):<br/>
Vent was developed so that we can store the events in a database or trigger other integrations of them
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:07:43 GMT):<br/>

Hi all, I'm revisiting the project after a few months and I can't seem to find the documentation for the JSON-RPC calls, has this been deprecated?
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:47:32 GMT):<br/>
I believe JSON-RPC support was dropped a few releases back, see v0.20.0: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/releases
</p>
<p><strong>mansoor</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:50:29 GMT):<br/>
Oh, thanks @JoeriExelmans . Do you know where I can find documentation for the new RPC interface?

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 11:23:20 GMT):<br/>
@JoeriExelmans thanks for you interesting questions. Vent is there to get you query-side scaling and fan-out for sure, it's worth looking at if you hit bottlenecks with simulated calls or if you want to use it for other reasons. It requires a little bit of smart contract support to emit the events it expects. Of course simulated calls can run smart contract logic - so if you need that they're probably the right solution.

Regarding keys - burrow.js doesn't directly support local signing but it's should not be hard to add - burrow.js relies on delegated signing on a 'local' (for a suitable definition of local - chiefly you must secure the connection to burrow 'ambiently' - VPN, local firewall, etc - since it has your keys) burrow node. There are a couple of advantages of this 1. for cloud usage it can be easier for key management, and 2. it also uses 'mempool signing' whereby burrow tries to assign a series of sequence numbers to incoming transactions sharing the same input account. This isn't always the right thing to do but it significantly increases the throughput where you want to send a large number of transactions from the same sender (input account). Rather than getting one per block you can get hundreds. You could do something like this locally but burrow maintains a locking mechanism so that you can have multiple transaction senders. The main reason this is the default is its exactly what we need and use for our cloud based validator pools (see our work here in http://github.com/agreements-network/charts  and https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/incubator/burrow).

The RPC fully supports the possibility of local signing and you can see this in our integration tests in burrow. A final note is the way we decide whether to sign using mempool is simply when we receive a transaction with no signatories. I'm fairly sure we need to tighten this up.... We definitely need to fix this: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/899 (cc @phymbert - interesting to thing about this perhaps)
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 12:55:12 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis thank you very much for this detailed explanation. Indeed for cloud usage keeping the keys on the burrow node is often what you want to do anyway, and I'm well aware of the difficulty of assigning the right sequence numbers to simultaneous transactions. I think a keyserver with proper locking is a good solution, although perhaps too restricting in some rare cases.
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 13:00:27 GMT):<br/>
The way you describe Vent sounds very much like a similar caching solution that I once developed for Ethereum. Just curious: when sending a transaction to Burrow, is there a way to 'sync', to wait/be notified when Vent's state has 'caught up' with the results of the transaction?

One more question: when sending 1000 simultaneous deployment transactions with the 'contracts' abstraction in burrow.js (which uses SendTxSync), the returned promise resolves almost immediately. But the node process is kept alive for a while after (I guess something in the event loop is waiting for the block to be committed... some sort of buffering mechanism?).

Hi, I've ran a "stability test" with 2 local nodes, deploying 50 contracts every 10 minutes and another 100 regular transactions every 5 minutes. Ran this setup for 64 hours and everything kept running nicely, except that memory usage kept going up (up to 1 GB), in a seemingly linear fashion. After restarting one of the burrow processes, the memory usage of the restarted process is normal again (85 MB), but I'm getting Tendermint error "Cannot add ourselves with address c2415d39937568f915668a78fd21dcc1f243b718@84.22.116.145:30000"

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=9RHi8EHAuahgJzksW) @JoeriExelmans The approach we use is a mixture of a high watermark block height on the client and pg_notify from postgres. The way it works is:

- Every transaction a clients sends synchronously gets the block height the tx was included in as part of the TxExecution return - the client just stores (globally is fine but can be finer grain) the highest block height it has seen in a return from a transactions.
- Vent consumes events a block at a time and each time it atomically inserts events for a block a NOTIFY is triggered for that block height (the latest block height as a payload)
- If the client wants to ensure that that it is querying the database state after the effect of that transaction has come into effect it just has to LISTEN for the notify of the block height from its high watermark (or snapshot of its high watermark at the point it wants to serialise txs between chain and DB

If we want to be very specific we can also query for events at specific heights - the NOTIFY still allows us to subscribe. Effectively we use block height as a sequence number - it works quite well and doesn't really require further dependencies.

(Vent is here BTW: https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/tree/develop/vent)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 10:45:51 GMT):<br/>
@JoeriExelmans we do have various caches included an LRU for the merkle tree/storage but it should not be getting that high. There is an optional profiling service that you can start which makes look at these things quite nice. Not sure how experienced you are with Go, but if you could provide me with a dump of it that would be great
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 10:47:19 GMT):<br/>
if you change `Enabled = true` in the burrow.toml in:
```
  [RPC.Profiler]
    Enabled = false
    ListenAddress = "tcp://127.0.0.1:6060"
```

</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 10:48:06 GMT):<br/>
then if you have Go installed once the memory is ramped up a bit run
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 10:48:11 GMT):<br/>
`go tool pprof -top http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap`
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 10:50:55 GMT):<br/>
it will generate a heap profile which I expect would give me a good clue what's going on
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 10:52:22 GMT):<br/>
@JoeriExelmans thanks, also btw we have a PR open to add burrow support to Caliper: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/246 the hyperledger benchmarking tool
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 10:52:34 GMT):<br/>
it sounds like some of the testing you are doing might be useful for there
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 10:52:46 GMT):<br/>
I could also consider how we could work it into test nets
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 10:56:25 GMT):<br/>
I take it you didn't see any levelling off of memory usage?
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:15:31 GMT):<br/>
It was too soon to tell if memory usage would level off. I'll try to get some useful info with the profiler and post results in the github issue.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:16:02 GMT):<br/>
@dev-d at a glance what you have looks fine, see also our helm charts: https://github.com/agreements-network/charts https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/incubator/burrow

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:16:25 GMT):<br/>
1 GB seems very large - not impossible but not with those contracts
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:16:38 GMT):<br/>
once it is over a few hundred i'd be interested
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:20:16 GMT):<br/>
@carlosfaria gas in Burrow is really a means to ensure that computation halts. We do have some plans to introduce a pluggable gas schedule - but currently note though we meter gas we do not charge for it (we do not deduct gas*gasPrice from the value transferred)! So there is not much point tweaking it.

<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:50:49 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis Perhaps too soon to tell but now with empty blocks disabled, memory usage seems stable at about 160 MB. My day ends now, the "stability test" will keep running and I will update tomorrow if memory usage is indeed stable now. I will still try to reproduce the original problem by re-enabling empty blocks and running the profiler.
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:51:20 GMT):<br/>
All findings will also be posted in the github issue of course
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:52:12 GMT):<br/>
the functionality can be anything you like really provided it is deterministic. You describe a NativeContract and its methods, implementing with a fixed signature in Go and then those contracts can be called as if they were deployed at an address determined by the hash of their name
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:52:25 GMT):<br/>
if you type `make snatives` you can see the generated solidity interface to use
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:53:19 GMT):<br/>
we have plans to develop the SNative functionality in a few ways - to provide all transaction types as snatives, and also to provide pluggability through allowing WASM contracts - this needs to be specced out though
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:53:32 GMT):<br/>

@silasdavis I've updated the bug report. In a new experiment, again memory usage was very high but only on one of the processes. While the experiment was running, at some point new transactions no longer completed (from burrow.js perspective), probably because the experiment kept submitting (too many?) transactions in too small amount of time (also it was running on a shared machine where other people are also doing CPU intensive stuff sometimes). I did not notice this because I left the experiment running unattended. But the results could still interest you. I'm running the experiment again but this time with only half the "load" as last time.

Hello everyone, I'm trying to run through the burrow quick start tutorials and I can't seem to get the seed-nodes example to work. I've run through the example a couple of times now and my seeder node wont advance from block one. Looking into the consensus tab it seems that all the validator nodes are there but the prevotes and precommits show up as 'nil-Vote'. Since I'm pretty new to burrow I'm not even sure what logs would be useful for debugging this issue so please let me know if I can help by providing any other information.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 10:43:21 GMT):<br/>
@DiegoLeal can you illuminate a bit more about your setup in terms of number of nodes, etc.? Also please see the `/net-info` endpoint on each of your nodes to ensure they are able to connect to one another over the p2p layer.
</p>
<p><strong>carlosfaria</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 12:04:15 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis thanks, understood! The SNative only functionality is to manage account permissions, right? Or do you think its possible to use SNative's to do more than that? For instance, we have a use case, where we want the smart contract paying for the gas of a given "pending" transaction, not an account. 
</p>
<p><strong>DiegoLeal</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 15:31:57 GMT):<br/>
@compleatang  The setup is with one seed node and three validator nodes trying to connect to it. The network says the nodes are not connected to each other. Reading through the logs all three validator nodes trying to connect have similar log files saying, "component":"Tendermint", "err":"EOF","log_channel":"Info","message":"Blockpool has no peers"
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:16:43 GMT):<br/>
Diego, that'll explain why it isn't making blocks. You need to point the burrow.toml on the connecting nodes to the IP and port of the first. 
</p>
<p><strong>DiegoLeal</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:53:56 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I did that and it didn't seem to work
</p>
<p><strong>DiegoLeal</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:54:33 GMT):<br/>
Although I turned seedmode to false and ran through the tutorial again and now its working strangely

@efn you can use burrow deploy's library or def.client if you like. you're call.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Sat, 08 Dec 2018 23:01:32 GMT):<br/>
@HaiTranThanh that looks like either an old .burrow folder from a previous deployment or incorrect file permissions on your system. make sure to check that the user you're running `burrow start` from has permissions to create a `.burrow` folder in the `pwd`.

Hi all, are there any docs or examples on how to use the gRPC API? I'm trying to transition old code that used the JSON-RPC API and I can't seem to find any reference material for the new API
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 08:09:09 GMT):<br/>
@compleatang def is inside "compile", so is that the only way to use burrow? basically use the functions in `def.client`. Why is it calling `dial()` every time, that seems very inefficient

hi folks, it's possible estimateGas in burrow?
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 16:03:55 GMT):<br/>
@bd from looking at the code I think everything costs 0 or 1 gas
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 16:31:58 GMT):<br/>
yes but i want to change this "table" of costs and calculate the cost before any transaction that's payed.  
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 16:36:51 GMT):<br/>
the question is, if not exist any method of estimate gas cost, and it's possible to implement, where i need to look on the code to make this?
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 16:53:24 GMT):<br/>
@bd look in execution/evm/gas.go

@efn thx

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 23:24:34 GMT):<br/>
@efn there are more or less three ways to use burrow. 1. from another go program use the abstractions built into the deploy library. 2. use the GRPC and protobuf files to create a client library in any language. 3. use burrow.js from a node program. As to the `dial()` @seanyoung can help clear up the thinking there.

@mansoor the docs for the RPC are here -> https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/burrow/rpc
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:21:46 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @compleatang, I need proving the state by just looking at block headers, I think Burrow cannot do that, right?! :|

hi, it's possible on the final of each transaction call one method of snative passing some values of transaction like gas used and this snative call the service name to get address of other contract to change his state ?  
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Tue, 11 Dec 2018 10:54:55 GMT):<br/>
in other words i want one way to send gas used and the address of tx.origin / caller to store this values in other "normal Smart contract"
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Tue, 11 Dec 2018 10:56:03 GMT):<br/>
on each of payed transaction

Hello again, another question: Is there a way to perform a simulated call against a past (= not the current) EVM state?
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 13:04:57 GMT):<br/>
so in python web3 its possible and ethereum, token_contract.functions.myBalance().call(block_identifier=-2) you need to pass the block but in burrow.js this is not implemented i think, i still exploring this burrow.js :D 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 13:07:51 GMT):<br/>
and in web3.js is not implemented as well https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-contract.html#methods-mymethod-call

hi
i'm working on one solution like truffle for burrow.js

and i get some issues like
`
const accountToCheck = '0x0694A27F6B8B92902CBCEA272946E57FF8A2CF7D';

const initialBalance = await this.burrow.query.GetAccount(Buffer.from(accountToCheck, 'hex'));
console.log('​\n\n\n initialBalance', initialBalance);
`
so for get the account balance i put this
and the result is
` initialBalance { Address: <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>,
PublicKey: { CurveType: 0, PublicKey: <Buffer > },
Sequence: '0',
Balance: '1337',
Code: <Buffer >,
Permissions: { Base: { Perms: '16862', SetBit: '131071' }, Roles: [] } }

`
the account balance using burrow deploy getBalance.yaml is 10
beacause i send 10 to this 0x0694A27F6B8B92902CBCEA272946E57FF8A2CF7D account
why Balance is 1337 ?
https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/execution/state.go#L155
anyone can help on this please ?

@dennismckinnon maybe you can help with this in burrow.js how i can call burrow.query.GetAccount ? 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:46:07 GMT):<br/>
any examples ?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=pdXQJcoscvu6pn6bW) @JoeriExelmans It is possible but we don't have any tooling that makes it easy. If you could dump an issue with what you'd like then we can take a look at making it straight forward for users. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:28:03 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=JujBTjJC5ikPDLgnn) @efn That's corect. The whole state exists within the larger state trie. You can get the information for a specific account from the info rpc (see godocs link via repo readme) or from the grpc port as well.. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:29:36 GMT):<br/>
@bd just for context we're a bit overloaded right now cause its Hyperledger Global Summit in Basel. I'll ask @dennismckinnon to help as soon as he can. 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:37:22 GMT):<br/>
@bd hi
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:37:31 GMT):<br/>
I don't have any examples
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:37:42 GMT):<br/>
but it shouldn't be hard
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:38:08 GMT):<br/>
that function calls the grpc endpoint with this object https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/blob/develop/burrow.js/protobuf/rpcquery.proto#L25-L27
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:39:00 GMT):<br/>
what is the param for the address? `this.burrow.query.GetAccount('0694A27F6B8B92902CBCEA272946E57FF8A2CF7D', (e, a) => {
			console.log("​e,a", e, a)

		});
`
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:39:09 GMT):<br/>
can't be string right?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:39:12 GMT):<br/>
so it should be sufficient to pass burrow.query.GetAccount an object of the form {Address: Buffer of address} and a callback
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:39:28 GMT):<br/>
though the callback is optional, it will return a promise if you don't pass it
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:40:50 GMT):<br/>
{Address: [BufferOfAddress]}
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:41:21 GMT):<br/>
thats the formula for talking to the grpc methods, always pass an object with the named fields according to the spec and a callback
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:42:01 GMT):<br/>
hum ok 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:42:10 GMT):<br/>
`{
			Address: Buffer.from('0694A27F6B8B92902CBCEA272946E57FF8A2CF7D')
		}`
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:42:17 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:42:40 GMT):<br/>

oops
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:43:08 GMT):<br/>
a don't know why my address is translated to 307830363934413237463642384239323930324342434541323732393436453537464638413243463744
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:43:22 GMT):<br/>
you need Buffer.from('address', 'hex')
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:43:39 GMT):<br/>
buffer.from needs to know its hex encoded or it tries to do ascii encoding
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:44:07 GMT):<br/>
finally :D 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:44:09 GMT):<br/>
thx
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:44:12 GMT):<br/>
no problem
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:44:23 GMT):<br/>
you know about snatives ? 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:44:38 GMT):<br/>
in what sense?
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:44:49 GMT):<br/>
i try to make one snative for mint native accounts 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:44:52 GMT):<br/>
like this 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:45:31 GMT):<br/>
Ahh yes i see you mentioning it above
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:45:37 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:45:50 GMT):<br/>
`	state.AddToBalance(args.Account, args.Amount)
	balanceAcc := state.GetBalance(args.Account)`
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:46:02 GMT):<br/>
i get the correct added balance 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:46:12 GMT):<br/>
but not saved in the blockchain 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:46:23 GMT):<br/>
hmmm sounds like a burrow-side issue
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:46:38 GMT):<br/>
silas would be most knowledgable about that
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:46:47 GMT):<br/>
hum ok 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:47:26 GMT):<br/>
its possible one snative call other contract ? 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:47:42 GMT):<br/>
i'm scrolling higher to see if i can be any more help
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:51:21 GMT):<br/>
you are talking about in the smart contracts correct?
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:51:31 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:51:40 GMT):<br/>
It might be a permissioning thing of the contract itself
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:52:00 GMT):<br/>
bacuase you are trying to modify the balances of accounts
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:53:06 GMT):<br/>
yes like my idea is One contract using one Snative contract mint real accounts of burrow
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:53:44 GMT):<br/>
oh so you have a contract calling an snative?
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:54:44 GMT):<br/>
and other question is i can now comunicate with this direction "normal Smart contract " to - > Snative,   and it's possible one Snative call other normal Smart contract via go ? to get like two directions of comunication 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:54:51 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:55:01 GMT):<br/>
i have one Smart contract 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:55:11 GMT):<br/>
calling one Snative method
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:55:15 GMT):<br/>
like this 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:55:30 GMT):<br/>
`func mint(state Interface, caller crypto.Address, gas *uint64, logger *logging.Logger,
    a interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
	args := a.(*payGasArgs)

	accountX := args.Account
	fmt.Printf("||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| %s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", accountX)

	state.AddToBalance(args.Account, args.Amount)
	balanceAcc := state.GetBalance(args.Account)
	// state.writeState.commit()
	
	return payGasRets{Result: balanceAcc}, nil
}
`
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:55:40 GMT):<br/>
this is Snative
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:56:02 GMT):<br/>
and one deploy by burrow.js 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:56:48 GMT):<br/>
my intention is get one way to have like a ERC20 mintable, to native coin burrow
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:57:16 GMT):<br/>
Oh
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:57:26 GMT):<br/>
you are making a new snative from go
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:57:36 GMT):<br/>
not deploying a contract that calls an snative
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:57:42 GMT):<br/>
i see
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:57:56 GMT):<br/>
Ok this is definitely out of my wheelhouse
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:58:35 GMT):<br/>
:D
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:58:38 GMT):<br/>
ok 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:58:50 GMT):<br/>
 @silasdavis will be the person to weigh in on making new snatives. I do wonder however if you might be better served by simply sending the money to an account
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:59:04 GMT):<br/>
He is busy right now though so
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:59:10 GMT):<br/>
ok 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:59:14 GMT):<br/>
you might have to wait a bit for a response
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:01:27 GMT):<br/>
ok, i have some questions for Snatives :D what is really the features 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:03:19 GMT):<br/>
SNatives are supposed to be administrative access-like tasks
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:04:09 GMT):<br/>
so most if not all have special permission requirements for accessing them
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:04:28 GMT):<br/>
hum ok 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:05:14 GMT):<br/>
we generally don't write a new one unless there is deficiency of functionality
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:05:38 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the help @dennismckinnon

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=23DstkFNEjdMS6XdC) @compleatang I need a bit of time to get back to issues in this room. But when we started using a versioned state tree I always had in mind running simulated call against a previous block height. It should be very easy to implement against RWTree and we will at some point, the groundwork is done. 
</p>

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 22:04:03 GMT):<br/>
Height would be an optional parameter for callsim and state query endpoints

1) I can't change the blockchain state like balances with Go Snatives?
2) It's possible on the final of each transaction call one Snative with computation cost's (Gas) ?
3) It's possible one Snative call other one Smart Contract ?

2) Is it possible to call an snative method  at the end of each transaction and pass as a param the computation cost (Gas) of that transaction ?
3) Is it possible to invoke a method on a smart contract from an Snative

BLOCKHASH is fixed already 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 10:36:59 GMT):<br/>
@knkski We're happy to. I just push `seth-fixes` if you PR into that branch we can then get it in there. As @phymbert said, BLOCKHASH is done and is in code review. It's been a bit tied up because it sits at the chain/app intersection and in our work on dump|restore we have had some other niggles and changes along that interface that we want to make sure work with Pierrick's work on BLOCKHASH. Once we're thru that tranche then we should be able to look at 908 as well. In general with the holidays this probably puts us at mid-Jan to get these finalized for you -- so entirely reasonable we keep a branch with your fixes in burrow.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 10:39:32 GMT):<br/>
@bd those are all edge cases we haven't yet explored. we have govTx which is coming along nicely and can affect native token balance. It can be routed through a proposal mechanism for multi-sig level voting. These questions would be better in GH issues because I fear that some of the nuance of what you're looking for is getting lost in a fast moving chat room. What would help us is exactly what you're looking to achieve and what you've done to date that has been blocked. We'd be excited to see a Truffle like tool and will do our best to answer your questions.

If a contract self-destructs, how do you delete all the keys for that contract? As I see keys are stored as (contract addr + key) in the tree. If you don't know the key, how can you clean the state of the contrat?

@compleatang I think what we really want are stable branches of burrow were fixes can be applied for point releases (as opposed to a fork of burrow for seth)
</p>

@amundson moving to #burrow-downstream just to confirm a few details.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=XHcszbYWqvFxaYbsX) @compleatang burrow deploy only creates a connection using Dial() if necessary. This is to speed up build-only deploy files. Once established, it reuses the same connection. See https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/deploy/def/client.go#L50 
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 12:59:54 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=Rtp8xsxi3k2CuPc2R) @efn "burrow deploy" now only makes a connection when it is needed, which makes it possible to run a burrow deploy file with only build jobs without a chain. When a connection is made it reused, so it not reconnect every time. See https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/deploy/def/client.go#L50
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 13:03:14 GMT):<br/>
Cool, thanks for the change :)
I modified the state, so contracts have also a tree of their own. So we can prove storage properties of accounts
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 13:03:21 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=daTMo3j4crM8eYnvp) @bd It would be great to have snatives to access name register, this currently does not exist yet. Patches welcome ;)
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 13:03:40 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if the project is interested in it
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 13:05:57 GMT):<br/>
@efn putting contracts in their own tree would be a useful feature, so duplicate contracts can be stored just once. So contracts can be accessed by contract hash. This is needed to store contract abi in burrow.
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 13:09:58 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=rqQXYCyYh5zw9kTBu) @seanyoung I think contracts having their own state doesn't help with duplicate contracts, cause they will still need their own storage
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=BkPEsRZMiMJndqfs9) @efn This is something we had lost when going under a single IAVL tree (a prefix tree would give you this 'for free') - I'd be interested to see your code
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 13:16:25 GMT):<br/>
Sure, I'd be happy to make it public, probably there are some bugs that I didn't think about :|
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 13:27:04 GMT):<br/>
that's fine - it would be good to talk about the implementation
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 13:27:25 GMT):<br/>

@efn if you are able to push that code just so I can see the approach you have used - I am likely to start working on something related
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:04:52 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis The way I did it was very simple, just created a `map[crypto.Address]*storage.RWTree` for each account. I added a `storageHash` in the `Account` structure as well. So I can prove state variables from there
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:05:25 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:31:54 GMT):<br/>
I think you can take a look in the `Deliver` function, in `call_context.go`, from there you go to `vmach.Call` which executes the vm code in the contract, or just calls

ok thanks, how i can calculate OpCodes to call one VM, like if i had to call vm to change some State in one Smart Contract, like pay(address, amount)??? exist some function to do this ?
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:42:30 GMT):<br/>
for example: 	ret, exception := vmach.Call(txCache, ctx.txe, caller, callee, code, ctx.tx.Data, value, &gas) 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:43:24 GMT):<br/>
i need to calculate code opcodes for pay(address, amount ), right? and the callee is the S. Contract Address
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:44:20 GMT):<br/>
and the evm execute all operations and Save the state on blockchain i think???
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:45:48 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean calculate code opcodes?
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:46:51 GMT):<br/>
code param to VM
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:48:01 GMT):<br/>
i want to do one post hook in each transaction, like if someone call one Contract, i want this transaction call the pay in other Contract
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:49:51 GMT):<br/>
i mean encode signature of pay() + paramters to VM execute
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:50:33 GMT):<br/>
add code after the `Call(` function
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:50:35 GMT):<br/>
 vmach.Call(txCache, ctx.txe, caller, callee, *code*, ctx.tx.Data, value, &gas)
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:51:52 GMT):<br/>
if i call two VM's in one tx all state on both contracts is saved ? 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:53:57 GMT):<br/>
beacause if AccountA "call contract X"-> create vm "Contract X" on the final this, i create/call vm (to pay() method for Contract Z) 
</p>
<p><strong>bd</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:54:22 GMT):<br/>
all state is changed ?

@rsingh you'll have to write the yaml file yourself. There are various examples in tests/jobs_fixtures/

Hi all, could any one tell me what the rpc error:  code = Unavailable desc means when deploying to a multi node setup? Thx
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 15:47:15 GMT):<br/>
@sly514 usually that is followed by more information, like: 
rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = all SubConns are in TransientFailure, latest connection error: connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing dial tcp 127.0.0.1:10997: connect: connection refused"

</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 15:47:43 GMT):<br/>
however from memory usually this means that there was a tcp connection error
</p>
<p><strong>sly514</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 16:13:10 GMT):<br/>
Ok thanks, I get simply, Unavailable Desc = transport is closing.  I am trying to deploy a simple transaction and I think my multi node config is messed up. I have set the ports in my docker .yaml but I have to properly copy the configs for each one of the nodes.  This is done by mounting the partitions right?

@silasdavis Dear Silas. I've gone to JIRA to open a new BUR issue, but I've realized that there are no boards there. I think that it's better that someone that manages well the Burrow code solves the issue. So I describe it here for someone to take it: If I configure my _genesis-spec.toml_ and assign `burrow configure -s genesis-spec.toml -m "burrowChain" > *genesis*.toml` instead of `burrow configure -s genesis-spec.toml -m "burrowChain" > *burrow*.toml`. When I execute `burrow start --validator-index=0` the response is _could not update burrow config: unable to set ValidatorAddress from provided validator-index since no GenesisDoc/GenesisSpec provided_ instead of some point to the genesis.toml file.
</p>
<p><strong>gut</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 14:52:40 GMT):<br/>
[continue] ...`burrow start --help` states that the genesis can be forced through -g option. But `burrow start --validator-index=0 -g genesis.toml` prints the `could not update burrow config: validator-index of 0 given but only 0 validators specified in GenesisDoc` error. The simple solution can be to add a note at the docs where it says that genesis file name must be forced to _burrow.toml_. But maybe I am missing something. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 21:36:53 GMT):<br/>
@gut Burrow team tracks issues on github -> https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues . In any event, to get your node started however use the `--config` flag (short flag `-c` with your `genesis.toml` that you've generated). The `-g` or `--genesis` flag only works on a genesis.json which has been produced by `burrow configure` with the `--separate-genesis-doc` or `-w` flag. Since your `burrow configure` command is not leveraging a separate genesis.json then burrow will consider only the config file so that's why you should use that flag.
</p>
<p><strong>gut</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 10:22:08 GMT):<br/>
@compleatang Thank you for your support. Using -c flag instead of -g it works as expected. My mistake was a documentation and help command misunderstanding. But as Silas said, a little help box at github or a change on explanation (you explained it so clear in your response...) from some expert at --help options could avoid a bad first impression for new developers interested on Burrow.

Hi, working from the docker container for a multiple validator setup I cannot run the command"NODE_0_URL=`curl -s 127.0.0.1:20001/network | jq -r '.result.ThisNode | [.ID, .ListenAddress] | join("@") | ascii_downcase'`" because curl is not installed. I'm about to use the ubuntu 16.04 docker and build things in there, is this the right way or would you suggest something else?

Hi,

<p><strong>phymbert</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 11:27:26 GMT):<br/>
 apt-get install curl in your docker file
</p>
<p><strong>phymbert</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 11:29:00 GMT):<br/>
probably you will also need to install jq
</p>
<p><strong>phymbert</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 11:29:26 GMT):<br/>
you can replace curl by wget installed by default on ubuntu afaik

@sly514 you can easily build a dockerfile via ubuntu, the burrow dockerfiles are based on alpine so you'd run `apk add --update curl jq` in the dockerfile.

Hello, I am looking for an Ethereum based permissioned platform solution and am unsure whether to start with Burrow or Quorum. My understanding is that a key difference is that Quorum has private transactions (i.e. makes transactions visible only to participants) while Burrow does not. Is this accurate and does anyone know if private transactions are planned in Burrow? Is this an limitation imposed through the tendermint consensus? thanks!

@chanwitkepha in your Solidity source code, replace constant with view or pure (dependant on whether the functions reads contract storage or not). You could try both and see if the solidity complains.

Hi, I have been struggling with the multiple validator setup for quite some time and have a few questions regarding my setup.
Is it possible to have the two validators in a docker .yaml file?
for instance, the command:

NODE_0_URL=`curl -s 127.0.0.1:20001/network | jq -r '.result.ThisNode | [.ID, .ListenAddress] | join("@") | ascii_downcase'`
sed -i s%PUT_HERE_NODE_0_ID@LISTEN_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS%${NODE_0_URL}% .burrow_val1.toml

runs in the command line fine but not in the  entrypoint:  because of the "@"

Also wouldn't curl -s 127.0.0.1:20001/network call the container's address and retreive the container's own info?

I have tried creating a static network, this is my first node's config: https://pastebin.com/ANxUs4ad

Question: I understand that an event's Index is relative to the event's transaction Index, which is relative to the block height (right?). Unlike standard ethereum where the log index is relative to the block. Then why does a GRPC response to GetEvents not include the transaction index? When receiving an event this way, it's not possible to know if it happened before or after some point in blockchain (where a "point in blockchain" is a tuple (event index, tx index, block height). My current workaround is to use GetTxs instead of GetEvents.

Another question: I understand accounts in Burrow have permissions (such as: send, call, createContract) that are supposedly checked on the EVM level, but I haven't noticed these permissions actually being enforced. For instance, I was able to deploy a contract with an account that does not have the 'createContract' permission. What is the status here?

Hi all,
Does the burrow have Ethereum JSON RPC compatible endpoint?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 15:37:38 GMT):<br/>
@sly514 communication with the keys server over tcp port 10997. The protocol is grpc, the protobuf file for this here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/protobuf/keys.proto you will need to generate a client for your language of choice.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 15:41:52 GMT):<br/>
@JoeriExelmans check the global permissions on the chain; these set the defaults for new accounts. By default createContract is turned on IIRC. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 15:42:21 GMT):<br/>
@dimchansky no, we use GRPC predominantly. There's an http->JSON endpoint as well for more information. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 15:43:19 GMT):<br/>
Joeri, on your other question probably better to drop an issue on GH with what you'd like from the query endpoint to help your use case. We can take a look at it. Of course PRs welcome :)

Question: it says "Burrow exposes REST and JSON-RPC endpoints to interact with the blockchain network". But where are the endpoints? Are there REST APIs or NodeJS APIs that one can use to write a client to interact with Burrow?

Hi, I have setup my keys server in a separate container and after having exposed and published 10997 I get : failed to list key: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing This is from a command line from another container within the docker network or from my host. Will the command line work remote also or grpc client is mandatory?

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 15:49:35 GMT):<br/>
you need to make sure that the keys server is running in the container, and that it is listening. You can check that with ss -tl

Hi again, I think I am getting closer to where my problem lies. would the EnvVar: "MONAX_KEYS_HOST" and EnvVar: "MONAX_KEYS_PORT" have anything to do with me not being able to connect by any chance?
</p>
<p><strong>sly514</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 14:20:40 GMT):<br/>
I do not have these variables set
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 15:12:25 GMT):<br/>
@sly514 you do not need to have those environment variables set. Most likely your python script is not starting burrow keys correctly. You are starting burrow keys with subprocess.Popen() but you are not reading the output of the popen, so any errors will be lost
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 15:12:41 GMT):<br/>
(if I'm reading it correctly)

So my server is running
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:28:33 GMT):<br/>
does "burrow keys list" do anything in the container?
</p>
<p><strong>sly514</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:57:51 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>sly514</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:57:57 GMT):<br/>
it lists the keys

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 10:16:41 GMT):<br/>
@harishbm34 in burrow 0.23 we changed the permissions field in the genesis doc. It used to be number which was interpreted as bit fields, now it is strings  which is much more readable:
        "GlobalPermissions": {
                "Base": {
                        "Perms": "send | call | createContract | createAccount | bond | name | proposal | input | batch | hasBase | hasRole",
                        "SetBit": "root | send | call | createContract | createAccount | bond | name | proposal | input | batch | hasBase | setBase | unsetBase | setGlobal | hasRole | addRole | removeRole"
                }
        },

</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 10:16:53 GMT):<br/>
you might need to re-generate your genesis doc

@compleatang : I am trying to set up the test - net with two nodes. As a first step, I have run the burrow with the following option "burrow spec -p2 -f2 | burrow configure -s- > burrow.toml " . After this step, "burrow.toml" will have 2 accounts , 2 validators and 2 participants. After this, I have added the address@ip_address of one node to the PersistancePeers="". Similarly, added the address of another node to the "persistancePeer="" of another node. Then, I am trying to run the burrow with the following option "burrow start --validator-index=0". But this is not working. Could you please share the steps to set-up the test-node if you have please.

@harishbm34 you may have an old burrow on your osx machine. make sure you have the same version as that changed between (i think) 0.21. and now.

I have followed the installation instructions on github and I've created the burrow binary. However when I follow the create single node instructions I get bash: burrow: command not found. This is from inside the burrow directory. I'm on macOS Mojave.
</p>
<p><strong>Spar</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 14:55:04 GMT):<br/>
I have also run the burrow binary and I get the start up dialog that shows usage syntax and commands but any burrow command I type gets that error.

@Spar that's a basic path issue. Make sure your gopath/bin is in your path. There's lots of help on google for this. It's a matter of how go deals with things. Or if you ran make build then just call the binary directly. Or move the binary somewhere into your path.

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 13:19:03 GMT):<br/>
@efn Look at the files that match rpc*.proto in https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/tree/develop/protobuf
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 13:19:17 GMT):<br/>
They define the grpc interface burrow provides
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 13:19:27 GMT):<br/>
Do you recommend a different language implementation for implementing a client?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 13:19:37 GMT):<br/>
The server implementation is https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/tree/develop/rpc
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 13:22:18 GMT):<br/>
grpc is pretty well supported in any language, so I'm not sure there is a language we can recommend. That being said, there is an example of a golang client in the source, so presumably it's easier to use that as an example
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 13:29:25 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 09:32:41 GMT):<br/>
@efn the GetBlocks() can be called in a streaming fashion. That's exactly what happens here https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/vent/service/consumer.go#L143
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 09:33:17 GMT):<br/>
That means the connection will remain open and any new blocks will be published as soon as they are committed
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 09:59:49 GMT):<br/>
I need in fact is the signed headers, but I already did the methods to get them, will try to modify them accordingly,
Thanks a lot :)
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 17:15:02 GMT):<br/>
@efn rhe infoRPC is really for simple http based requests that return json whereas the grpc uses protobufs and is much more feature rich in terms of the information it can retrieve, filter for, stream etc. If it doesn't have info you need in either please do let us know via GH issues and we'll see about getting the information added. That said we already expose pretty much all the info.

hello all! i am evaluating sawtooth vs burrow for a project i'm starting at Pueblo.Global
</p>
<p><strong>mossmanpete</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 23:13:40 GMT):<br/>
wanted to know if anyone can tell me why i'd want to use Burrow rather than Sawtooth for any reason other than PBFT security?
</p>
<p><strong>mossmanpete</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 23:15:39 GMT):<br/>
i am not excited about the SGX enclave support for BFT in sawtooth, but everything else about it looks to have more opportunity than Burrow ... though i don't think i'll be able to wait for the PBFT engine in sawtooth to be ready.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 09:12:28 GMT):<br/>
@efn did you find you needed to modify Burrow code? I can see that this is useful data and I'd be very open to adding it to the rpcquery interface. Perhaps you would be able to make a contribution via a pull request?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 09:13:51 GMT):<br/>
@mossmanpete Sawtooth actually have an early version of PBFT support - https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-pbft/. It lacks some of the optimisations and maturity of Tendermint - but it is looking good.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 09:18:52 GMT):<br/>
As for comparison, it is difficult to answer in such broad strokes, but I'll try not to cop out:

For Sawtooth:
- Flexible modular framework
- Nice architecture
- Multiple transactions processors
- More developers
- Web3 support with EVM integration

For Burrow:
- Fast/light single binary with everything included (bootstrapping Burrow can be done entirely with the single binary - deployment, SQL cache generation (via Vent), key serving daemon. The 'Redis of blockchain' (as I dubiously coined some time ago)
- First class EVM support / EVM only (Sawtooth uses our implementation)
- Extensible as a Go library (always trying to improve this

- Focus on running public permissioned processes (contrast the consortia focus of other Hyperledger projects - though that is historical more than fundamental)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 09:22:08 GMT):<br/>
The scope of the Sawtooth project is in some ways more ambitious than Burrow, but because of that they do have more moving parts
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 09:22:41 GMT):<br/>
Also for what it's worth Burrow is an older codebase (though several refactors deep) than any other project in Hyperledger 
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 10:27:15 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis Is really not well done right now, when I have more time I'd try to understand better how the `Query` works for matching things. Thanks

Hi, 
Hi

</p>
<p><strong>DJEMOA</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:20:28 GMT):<br/>
Hello everyone,```

```  please, I would like to know if it is possible to generate abi ans bytecode from a chaincode ? ```
In fact as we can use burrow to run solidity smart contract in Hyperledger fabric, I wanted to know if we could run chaincode written in go in Ethereum by generating ABI and ByteCode.```
Thanks a lot in advance and best regards
``` 
``` 
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:24:14 GMT):<br/>
@DJEMOA there is no golang compiler which can target evm bytecode/abi.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:25:25 GMT):<br/>
golang can target wasm and wasm would be a great to have supported in burrow. This is why I've started the solang project: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:26:50 GMT):<br/>
With all of that in place we can have chaincode written in rust, golang and solidity. But it is not finished yet
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:27:25 GMT):<br/>
Ethereum also have plans to move to wasm but there is not much code written to make that possible
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:27:40 GMT):<br/>
(again solang would help here too)
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:28:41 GMT):<br/>
evm bytecode is awful and could never be a target of a golang/rust compiler
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 17:49:05 GMT):<br/>
to add to what @seanyoung said @DJEMOA in terms of directly connecting existing fabric chaincode to EVM contracts within a fabric-EVM system you'd need to ask over in the #fabric-evm room as that is really on their end rather than the burrow end.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 21:21:30 GMT):<br/>
@efn btw if you are after commits then you will want the rpcinfo endpoint, in particular `http ':26658/block?height=7' | jq '.result.Block.last_commit'` will get you the commit for height 6 (note the query is for height 7). SignedCommit doesn't really buy you anything over block since it needs to have block n+1 to get you the commit for block n (it comes from last_commit), so it is really just a helper around that. We provide block headers from the GRPC because they have a protobuf definition. Commits don't and so it is easier to provide them as JSON over HTTP. Casey is right to say there is much richer information on GRPC regarding the execution - i.e. 'our side' rather than Tendermint's
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 21:22:33 GMT):<br/>
I'd be interested to know what you are trying to achieve - perhaps there is something we might include in the execution events
</p>
<p><strong>mossmanpete</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 22:19:35 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis thank you for that info! looks to me like burrow would be easier to get setup and running... whereas sawtooth will have more flexibility and complexity
</p>
<p><strong>mossmanpete</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 22:27:49 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis all i can tell from the sawtooth-pbft github is that "there is still a long way to go" ... guess we'll launch with CFT and hope for the best while contributing to the PBFT algo.
</p>
<p><strong>mossmanpete</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 22:52:37 GMT):<br/>
it is looking like we may have use for multiple blockchains, and the ability to boot up a blockchain on demand, so some uses for burrow on non-central systems may be best for our situation. tahnks!

</p>
<p><strong>mossmanpete</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 01:51:13 GMT):<br/>
doing more research, i think i may launch with Burrow, and use OTX [ http://opentransactions.org ] for a cross-chain/off-chain application layer i was planning to work with.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 09:48:50 GMT):<br/>
Sawtooth also have no squirrel support...
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 09:49:44 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mossmanpete</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 20:48:31 GMT):<br/>
i'm really excited to be working with Burrow now, at first i thought "more features, good!" but Burrow does everything i want it to, and is a better fit. Seems that with all the open source Solidity contracts, DApps,  and off-chain channels that have been designed, this is at least a superior blockchain without the downfalls of the Ethereum network.

i'm trying to find anything about hardware requirements for Burrow though... i remember when i could no longer mine ETH on my GPUs due to mempool exceeding my physical memory. this is obviously lightweight in comparison, but can i run it on a RasPi?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 23:48:27 GMT):<br/>
we routinely run nodes in containers which have less compute and memory than a RaspPi would so resources wise it *should* be ok. AFAIK there are no current issues compiling to arm (but if there are we'd like to know). to be clear, we're unlikely to ship full WASM in Q1. We do intend to begin our experimentation in that area. If WASM is of interest, there is also a Hyperledger Labs project headed by @seanyoung to work on compiling solidity into WASM which may be of interest to you as well.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=5BcRKuN9F2d6HBZC4) @compleatang I'm looking at the starter issues but I'm still not sure how to approach them.  This is my first open source project and I'm just learning go. I'm tired of doing programming exercises (exercism.io.) and would like to start building something. I have burrow in my gopath. I have some knowledge of git. I understand blockchain. I'm not a programmer. I'm an attorney that is excited about the potential of smart contracts. I guess I'm having problems understanding the code base. Would you mind explaining how I should approach understanding it? Thanks!

Hi i'm sahan. I'm an undergraduate who are working on a blockchain project as my final year project. It's about creating a remote e-voting application. I'm currently struggling with finding a good approach for my application. I've tried ethereum but having pay gas price for each vote(each transaction with blockchain) seems not a good option for me. Since i already worked on solidity. I'm planing on going with hyperledger burrow. But i'm still worried that i will be able to overcome my problem with hyperledger. Thank you

Hi,
From the `MutableForest` I need to get a merkle proof from a tree inside it, let's say an account. Any idea how can I do this now with this new design?
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Wed, 13 Feb 2019 15:42:58 GMT):<br/>
Was thinking about getting a proof from the `commitsTree`, but before the keys were more simple, "a" + address, now, "a" itself is a tree, if I understood correctly, and I need a path that goes from the top of the `commitsTree` down to the key inside "a"
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Wed, 13 Feb 2019 16:17:58 GMT):<br/>
I think I understand now, I need two merkle trees, one that says the hash for the prefix "a" from commitsTree is X, and one that does the address -> account, with root X
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Wed, 13 Feb 2019 16:24:21 GMT):<br/>
Why is the accounts handled in this way but the storage still keeps its keys at "s"+key?

Hello again, I'm trying to implement signing transactions without the burrow key server. So far not much success, my own generated signatures give `Error: 13 INTERNAL: grpc: error unmarshalling request: proto: illegal wireType 7`. So now I'm investigating the behavior of the 'SignTx' function of the keys service, but I've noticed that the signature returned by SignTx is 68 bytes long instead of 64 bytes. If I strip the first 4 bytes (leaving 64 bytes) it is a valid signature according to the ed25519 NPM package. What are the first 4 bytes for?

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 12:33:45 GMT):<br/>
@efn for the ProposalTx we need addresses which we can predict, so when proposal is ratified, we know what the addresses for the deployed contracts is going to be. So, the way the nonce is calculated is different than ethereum. In general the EVM should match ethereum though, and it seems unlikely that code depends on how the address is calculated. What problems are you encountering?
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 12:43:24 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung I need a more deterministic way to create new contracts from other contracts, but I can do that with create2 now. Was just curious about this modification.

@JoeriExelmans the error you have is from grpc. It is trying to protobuf-decode the message and failing. 

The return value from Sign() method in the keys server is https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/protobuf/keys.proto#L108

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=TDEyQ2QA6JP7uhnpQ) @jayapalreddy @jayapalreddy this could mean a few things, accounts on a Burrow network can act as hot wallets for our internal token, and our key signing service is effectively a wallet, and anything behind the burrow keys interface could act as this.

 Support for public wallets such as metamask are something I have thought about, would like in the abstract, but have not had the impetus to build - this relates to the subsequent question on web3 support which I am about to get to answering...

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=7zEZfuJFWfowe4thW) @seanyoung That's not my question. Meanwhile I managed to get local signing with ed25519 keys (in JavaScript) to work, it seems the Signature (https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/protobuf/crypto.proto#L30) really is a Buffer of 68 bytes. The last 64 bytes are the actual signature and the first 4 bytes are always (in hex:) '08011240', probably the uint32 field "CurveType", but a strange 4 bytes those are!
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 08:34:15 GMT):<br/>
If you're interested I'll upload the 76-line TypeScript module that I use for local signing so you can have a look at it. The reason I developed it is because transactions need to be signed on an end-user device (smartphone) that cannot be expected to run a burrow keys server.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:01:06 GMT):<br/>
Hi @JoeriExelmans our signature type is described by protobuf, you can use https://www.npmjs.com/package/protobufjs in javascript. I would be very interested to see what you are working on and if you are interesting in contributing to Burrow it is something we would be pleased to add to burrow.js
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:10:13 GMT):<br/>
The byte you see are `0x08 0x01` == field number 1 (curvetype) is a varint and equals 1, `0x12 0x40` == field number 2 (signature) is length prefixed (bytes) and has length 64. The first byte for each fields encodes the wire type (last three bytes) and the field number with the rest of the bytes.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:10:51 GMT):<br/>
You could parse this yourself but I don't recommend it, since it will break if we every change the signature type - whereas by design protobuf will not
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:12:54 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung I note that the KeyClient has a lot of methods for generating keys and whatnot - there used to be a more minimal one - the minimum you need for signing - I think just Sign - do we need PublicKey?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:14:18 GMT):<br/>
@JoeriExelmans like I say we should talk about this - signing transactions locally with burrow.js is very much in scope (though not currently supported0 - are you able to use that library?
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:21:37 GMT):<br/>
We are not using burrow.js because I don't like the design decision to keep one account in the 'burrow' object that is used for all transactions. On each node, possibly multiple accounts are kept in the keystore and for each transaction, a different account could be used. Also I've built my own abstraction library already that encodes calls according to the Ethereum ABI and can use both Burrow and Ethermint as a backend. From that library, it's simpler to just use GRPC directly. I like the GRPC interface and I think effort should be mainly be directed at improving it and its documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:23:44 GMT):<br/>
Right now the bytes '08011240' are hardcoded in my solution, I'll look into protobufjs for properly encoding the CurveType and signature length

Is the library you have written open source? Do you use web3 for ethermint? 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:36:51 GMT):<br/>
Reading on a bus, but your signing code looks on the right tracks 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:37:56 GMT):<br/>
Are you using grpc lib? Because that will handle encoding of signature etc 
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:40:47 GMT):<br/>
No web3. For Ethermint plain JSON-RPC is used, the NPM package `ethjs-provider-http` handles connection with the backend there (the most lightweight solution I could find). For both Burrow and Ethermint, `ethereumjs-abi` does the ABI encoding.
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:41:48 GMT):<br/>
The `grpc` and `@grpc/proto-loader` NPM packages are used for GRPC
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:45:18 GMT):<br/>
I specifically like GRPC for its use of Node native streams when subscribing to events. In Ethereum's JSON-RPC, subscribing to logs is a disaster. Web3 does some really awful things under the hood (and so do I).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=abef413b-e7a3-49c9-942e-e3c3210fe4f0) @silasdavis I think the problem is that the signature is type 'bytes' in the spec (https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/protobuf/txs.proto#L34) where it should be crypto.Signature
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:48:00 GMT):<br/>
Your issue with signature is that you are using a buffer rather than the signature type

but gogoproto has a custom serialisation feature I was using to make Signature a named type although it was just bytes. Because of this Burrow is protobuf encoding into a  protobuf message, which makes you do the dance you are doing

@thameursaadi presumbly burrow has been installed but it's not in your path. If you did `go install ./cmd/burrow/` then burrow should be in `$GOPATH/bin`. See if you can find burrow here and you can execute burrow from  there using `./burrow --version` or add it to your path using `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`

Hello fellow Bugseekers, 
I would like to connect to a Burrow-node from and Android device. Unfortunately I cannot find Documentation for the REST/JSONRPC API of burrow, can anyone maybe help me? Thank you for your time in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonSchuler</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 13:51:34 GMT):<br/>
It would be a big help to just have an Example with curl or sth, i can probably work out the rest by myself.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 17:44:06 GMT):<br/>
@SimonSchuler Unfortunately for your use case the REST/JSONRPC isn't highly interactive. Indeed it is mostly meant for pulling high level information out of burrow. For interactivity from other devices you'll need to leverage the GRPC port. All the RPC is self-documenting via goDocs -> https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/burrow/rpc
</p>
<p><strong>SimonSchuler</strong> (Wed, 13 Mar 2019 09:04:26 GMT):<br/>
@compleatang Thank you for your answer, maybe I understood something wrong? But when I was working with Ethereum it was real easy to setup a JSONRPC and connect to. Maybe it would be better if I ran a node (not validator) on my smartphone and used this to communicate to the other nodes? I am not really familiar with how Burrow is supposed to work concerning Nodes and the permissioned part of it. Dose documentation on this exist (apart from the readme from github)? Thank you for your time.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 13 Mar 2019 14:14:32 GMT):<br/>
@SimonSchuler Burrow doesn't have a web3 JSONRPC currently. The way most people handle this is to implement burrow.js on edge devices and use that to connect to blockchain nodes in other locations.

Hi everyone. I am new into Hyperledger burrow. I have a question about it. So I know that for burrow we are using Smart Contract instead of Chaincode in the Burrow EVM. So is that possible that we can run the Chaincode and the Solidity Smart Contract Simultaneously?
</p>
<p><strong>leowu</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 17:39:32 GMT):<br/>
I have successfully installed and run the fabric-chainode-evm and the vote-hyperledger-ethereum and the web3-fabric-voting-dapp. But I just wondering that is it possible I can deploy the Chaincode instead and run Chaincode and Smart Contract simultaneously.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 19:59:47 GMT):<br/>
Hi @leowu  and welcome. What you imply isn't possible. Burrow is a dlt framework as is fabric. The fabric evm system uses burrows evm as a library. But to accomplish what you want you would use fabric rather than burrow as a standalone dlt. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 20:01:39 GMT):<br/>
As far as I know, you can run chaincode and evm contracts on the same fabric network but I am pretty sure that they cannot interact with one another m however you would need to confirm that in the #fabric-evm  room just to be sure.

<p><strong>SimonSchuler</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 10:00:35 GMT):<br/>
Hello everyone. I have a question regarding keys/keypairs: When I run 'burrow deploy --address ABCD... -f deploy.yaml -u myip' how is the transaction signed? I know there is the .key directory, but as far as I can tell there are only public keys stored there? 
Next question: Is there a way to generate a raw transaction (unsigned or signed) that I could send over the network and then deploy on a different machine?
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 10:13:37 GMT):<br/>
The .keys directory of burrow contains the public and private keys for all the keypair in your keystore. The keystore is a service that by default is part of your burrow node, but can also be run separately.
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 10:19:53 GMT):<br/>
Yes you can "get" raw transactions that you can broadcast later on (signed or unsigned). If they are unsigned, you can only broadcast them on a node that has the keypair in its keystore because the transaction will have to be signed at some point. One way that I'm aware of is the 'rpctransact' endpoint of burrow's GRPC interface has a function 'FormulateTx' for getting an unsigned transaction, and there's 'SignTx' which will give you a signed transaction (both you can broadcast with ' BroadcastTxSync')
</p>
<p><strong>JoeriExelmans</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 10:22:37 GMT):<br/>
If you want to sign a transaction not on the node itself (e.g. you want to use a keypair that was generated and kept on a mobile device), you can try to run a standalone burrow key server and request it to sign the transaction for you, or you can manually sign in e.g. JavaScript code or whatever you are using. I've posted a TypeScript example a while back in this thread.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonSchuler</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 10:23:36 GMT):<br/>

Does Burrow's permissioned EVM have restrictions compared to a public EMV implementation? Trying to test some contracts that include ether transfers. Will it work as expected? Or I shouldn't even dream about this?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 13:10:06 GMT):<br/>
(I know ether is meaningless in a permissioned settings, but since the `gas` concept was kept, I hope the `value` was kept as well. So it's kind of a technical question, not a production use case of course)
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 17:40:35 GMT):<br/>
yes, we have native tokens and `value`. if they do not work as expected we would be very surprised and hope for a test case.

When I create a contract, the hash stored in the commit tree with key `"s"+addr`, is not deterministic, is this by design? What are the source for this non-deterministic behaviour? I cannot see where does it come from.
Thanks 
</p>

Hello,
I'm trying to prove some things in the commit storage of `rwt` forest.
I recreate the same storage in another machine, with the same key-value pairs, but the root hash is different.
Any hints why?
This is a snippet that I was trying to debug: https://pastebin.com/zNnrwk04 put in `rwtree_test.go`
Why if I save twice (line 15 of the snippet) the hash changes?
Thanks a lot


</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 17:40:30 GMT):<br/>
That looks like the path in the 'forest' to the storage tree for `addr`. Hopefully we are talking about the same thing (think we are). When you say non-determinism do you mean running establishing the same  I suspect what you are interpreting as non-determinism is the effect of the version being part of the tree
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 17:40:42 GMT):<br/>
ah yes.. that was typed earlier
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 17:43:27 GMT):<br/>
yes so I believe I have a test that helps describe this: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/storage/rwtree_test.go#L79-L99
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 18:27:55 GMT):<br/>
I agree that this is surprising behaviour - it is is essentially down to the fact that our merkle tree library includes the version in every node: https://github.com/tendermint/iavl/blob/master/node.go#L20 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 18:33:38 GMT):<br/>
However if you make the same writes at the same version (do the same operations between each commit) then you will get the same hash
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 18:33:54 GMT):<br/>
so for the purposes of Burrow's transaction integrity this is not an issue
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 18:36:51 GMT):<br/>
however it does seem to me that IAVL doesn't really need to store version in every node - it helps them to track orphaned nodes from deleted tree versions (not a feature we currently use). It could have been done differently. It depends whether you want the state hash to be path dependent or not - I can see uses for both. In a sense IAVL encodes the blockchain history into the hash, but if you just want comparison over the final data you might prefer to not have the version mixed into the hash
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 18:37:38 GMT):<br/>
incidentally the mapping between block height and version is 1-to-1 but for _reasons_ there is an offset of one between version and height. Tree version is an implementation detail for us though.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=7LsjhKtFwTZ9DSKRQ) I'm trying to reconstruct the storage in another instance of burrow, and prove it!

I believe that was the main problem, I overlooked the version inside the node.
So far I removed the version in the hash construction, but that somehow messed with the proof system
Thanks for the answer.

I'd recommend you look at our dump/restore functionality that does exactly this
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 08:57:21 GMT):<br/>
See: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/execution/state/dump.go
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 08:57:54 GMT):<br/>
there is also command line tooling for this, but if you want to see the entry point to the code responsible

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=w4KMQRoB3EY4FBqCB) @silasdavis It worked, I removed the version from the hash both for proving nodes and constructing the graph :)
I don't know all the consequences of tbh
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:35:19 GMT):<br/>
what are the benefits of doing the forest and not doing a huge tree for everything? Is it to allow writes that don't touch the same state happening concurrently?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:37:34 GMT):<br/>
We previously had a big tree for everything
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:37:56 GMT):<br/>
The reason for having multiple is that with AVL it is the only way to have a hash for sub-states
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:38:07 GMT):<br/>
for example the storage hash of a single account
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:38:47 GMT):<br/>
this actually isn't exposed right now but there are number of uses for this, for example a simple check to see if contract state has not change between blocks
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:40:14 GMT):<br/>
also being able to provide independent proofs on our separate state sub-spaces - like name reg, and possibly in the future WASM or other executor state
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:41:08 GMT):<br/>
I also have some ideas about burrow multi-state-tenancy - for a kind of authenticated side-channel or cross-chain communication use case
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:41:20 GMT):<br/>
for that I wanted to be able to have hierarchical state roots
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:41:29 GMT):<br/>
With prefix trees you get this for free
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:42:11 GMT):<br/>
AVL has some nice properties but I do have a side project that was a musing on replacing it:  https://github.com/monax/trieste
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:42:28 GMT):<br/>
which is a prefix tree - where you get sub-tree hashes more naturally
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:43:12 GMT):<br/>
@efn when you say you removed the version - you did this in IAVL?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:45:56 GMT):<br/>
> Is it to allow writes that don't touch the same state happening concurrently? 
That is also a rather interesting idea... Currently we don't assume independence between any of the state trees - because EVM code can generally hit other state. Though this would kind of work for namereg (unless we expose it through snatives).

The main concurrency feature is provided by RWTree. We route all reads to the previous (last committed) immutable version - where we can have concurrent reads and long-running iterations without blocking commits which happen on the working 'write' tree.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:51:31 GMT):<br/>
BTW @seanyoung just added some docs on dump/restore: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/docs/dump-restore.md

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=yCQaXDqu7Lo93mhXa) @silasdavis Yes, did it in the IAVL
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:55:14 GMT):<br/>
I see. Could it be like each account has its own AVL for the storage?

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 10:23:26 GMT):<br/>
Currently all account fields are in a single tree, but I did consider whether they should each have their own. We need to keep an eye on any performance issues, but it seems to work fine for storage - so less the could - I haven't done that yet though
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 10:23:48 GMT):<br/>
If we did that it would probably make sense to merge the storage and account tree though
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 10:24:01 GMT):<br/>
otherwise the individual account trees would barely contain anything
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 10:24:35 GMT):<br/>
it would also mean you would not be able to differentiate a change to an account's balance from a change to it's storage

Hi guys, we want to deploy burrow network as a service which can run at background without the streaming log. Is there a way to do that? Besides, how can I deploy contract to a remote burrow network which not reside in my local laptop? Thank you for any instructions!
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 11:38:56 GMT):<br/>
Nice,
I want to confirm something:
Let's say I am at block N, and the commit hash at the moment is C(X), this would be the commit for block N-1 right?
Now, I move to block N+1, the Commit votes are for block N. So if I want the commit votes for commit tree N, I need to check the commit votes for block N + 2, right?


</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:00:54 GMT):<br/>
@Emma_Zheng as to the latter question, use `--chain-url` flag when you run burrow deploy. if you want to run that with transactions signed on the machine that's sending the deploy transactions then you will need a key signer running somewhere and use the appropriate flag on burrow deploy. if you want to sign the transactions with keys that the nodes already have then you just need the `--chain-url` flag. we have a relatively sophisticated logging configuration which enables a range of options. see the godocs int he logging package linked from the repo's readme. 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:24:06 GMT):<br/>
@Emma_Zheng  `burrow configure --logging minimal` will give you a config for a much less chatty log. If you want (almost) complete silence you can delete the `[Logging]` section altogether
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:29:47 GMT):<br/>
@efn we have to be a little careful because 'commit hash' is a little overloaded, we have at least: the tendermint `LastCommitHash` (the hash of the commits from the last block - set of signed votes), a collection of other state hashes (consensus, validators, results) all after the previous block was applied, and the `AppHash` we control. This is how tendermint sees things: https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/types/block.go#L369-L377
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:30:47 GMT):<br/>
Now given the context of your previous questions I will assume you mean the hash that comes from `execution/state/stage.go` `commit()`
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:31:17 GMT):<br/>
which in turn comes from the `MutableForest` and is what we pass as the `AppHash` to tendermint when we get asked to ABCI Commit
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:34:30 GMT):<br/>
exactly, I was referring to that
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:34:30 GMT):<br/>
exactly, I was referring to the `AppHash`
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:35:10 GMT):<br/>
If block N has not been committed, but block N-1 has been (I assume this is what you mean by 'at block N' - i.e. accumulating transactions to go in block N) then when you call `State.Hash()` you will get the state hash after applying all transactions in block N-1
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:35:40 GMT):<br/>
In generally any reader methods will be routed to already committed/saved state across RWTree, and Forest implementations, and so also state
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:36:09 GMT):<br/>
Now that `State.Hash()` is actually the `AppHash` that will appear in block N
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:36:25 GMT):<br/>
which I thin can sometimes be slightly confusing - though logical if you think it through
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:36:25 GMT):<br/>
which I think can sometimes be slightly confusing - though logical if you think it through
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:38:02 GMT):<br/>
But the commits for that are going to apper in block N + 1? 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:38:05 GMT):<br/>
Though if that is not confusing for you, please ignore me. I think I have found it confusing because at the point at which burrow is commiting block header N to state - you already know what the `AppHash` will be for the _next_ block
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:38:32 GMT):<br/>
again... when you say commits are you talking about votes, or basically what I just said above?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:38:50 GMT):<br/>
but I think either way... the answer is yes
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 12:39:34 GMT):<br/>

Hi folks,

Can someone point me what was changed with height generation for smart contact in previous 2 releases? 
It worked on 0.23.x, but seems not working on 0.24.x/0.25.x

When I'm using burrow.js to interact with simple smartcontract, seems I'm receiving height as 0: https://gist.github.com/g3d/e646c5573a91fb3843be2b6f3d13fcb9#file-burrow-js-publish
But when I try to perform manual test transaction (according to https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/docs/quickstart/send-transactions.md), I'm receiving BlockHeight: https://gist.github.com/g3d/e646c5573a91fb3843be2b6f3d13fcb9#file-test-yml-publish

I've checked the library sources, seems there were changes https://github.com/molfaras/bosmarmot/commit/f848ce89fa992d4d36544869b372f671a786a0ec, part of them were related to v0.24 release.

is it possible to manually modifying the peering when the network is started? Like if I have 4 nodes (1,2,3,4), can manually say 1 is connected to 2, and then after some time, say that 1 is connected to 3 and not 2 anymore? And that without stopping the network or stopping the validator? (Like the admin.addPeer fct of Ethereum)?

Hi, I'm trying to run burrow with 100 validators in a cluster, I find blocks arriving very late, takes +-7s to do. (configured latency is 1s) is that normal?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 13:17:46 GMT):<br/>
@efn that sounds about on par with what we've heard from other tendermint based networks. see, e.g., https://forum.cosmos.network/t/governance-adjustment-of-blocks-per-year-to-come-aligned-with-actual-block-time/1682 .... cosmos is currently limited to 100 validators so the numbers seem to be roughly on par with expectations. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 13:18:48 GMT):<br/>
the latency is due to the amount of p2p messages which increase dramatically with larger validator pools the configured latency will have little to do with your actual blocktime with larger validator pools. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 13:18:48 GMT):<br/>

Another issue I have is that `BroadcastTxAsync` is taking a long time to put the tx in the pool.
I'm still trying to figure out why, in some cases it takes 1s to send 100 tx. I already implemented a method to send in batch and parallelize sending from different clients, with no success. If you have a hint on how can I tackle this I'll appreciate

We've had some optimization to look into in our stress tests around the iavl tree which has been slowing some things down but I'm not sure that would impact too much if you were doing simple send transactions. Are you talking to contracts or raising events with those transactions or just sending tokens around. 
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 18:06:40 GMT):<br/>
Hi @compleatang. I'm doing contracts, but does the `BroadcastTxAsync` waits the tx to execute? I don't think so right? Is just checking inputs. I wonder why it takes so long

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 25 Apr 2019 11:42:39 GMT):<br/>
i'm not 100% clear if it's related without some profiling information. if the node that receives the transaction is backed up modifying the IAVL tree it could be slower. is it consistently showing you 100TPS or inconsistently? what are you seeing as "normal" throughput if hte latter? 
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 25 Apr 2019 12:32:23 GMT):<br/>
with 1 validator and 1 client, I try to send 100 txs, it takes a long time, sometimes 1s to call `BroadcastTxAsync` on the 100 txs, I did a method to call them all at once in the server, still takes a long time.
The txs are already signed
</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 25 Apr 2019 14:26:32 GMT):<br/>
I see what the problem is, the problem happens when I have a lot of accounts, namely 90k, there is one tx that takes a lot to respond, I think because is trying to use the disk, or something like that, I'll check it further. Is there a way to maintain a larger cache or something similar?

Can I run a burrow node that is not a validator?

<p><strong>efn</strong> (Thu, 25 Apr 2019 15:44:20 GMT):<br/>
The problem is in Tendermint's mempool, `CheckTx` blocks trying to acquire the mempool lock
Can I run a burrow node that is not a validator?

Found it:
Imagine my genesis account has a lot of accounts, and you encode this all the time in here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/7c363eec08ba477e9a8fa287767cf038bcc3563c/bcm/blockchain.go#L179
That is called in the `Commit()` for each block.
Kinda sucks :)

Hello everyone. I was wondering if it is possible to pass data(like in yaml format for deploying things) instead of a file to the burrow executable. I am running a server task with python and I use subprocess to call burrow executable from python. It would be nicer to just dump data instead of creating a file and then passing this file to the executable. Is there a way?

@SimonSchuler in the error message it is executing job _get_times but n your example yaml you have _get_score. I suspect you're looking at the wrong yaml, since the yaml looks fine

@mikeburrow usually those are created in the genesis block. are you looking to create tokens post genesis? if so can you let us know a bit more about what you're trying to achieve so we can guide you.

it's an incentive to stake, and stay staked, as not staking would dilute the size of your ownership

Hello!
I've just accidentally found that ecrecover precompiled smart contract is disabled.
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-evm/blob/master/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/burrow/execution/evm/native.go#L75

Is it a permanent decision?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 12:52:57 GMT):<br/>
@fastchain not permanent and always looking for help/contributions. -> https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/436

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=GQHdXTaRbtMPzJ2er) @mikeburrow Hi @mikeburrow first off welcome! Currently, we have strongly discussed implementation of the Cosmos SDK, but up to now have not had time to develop sophisticated token economics primitives in particular with relationship to validator bonding. We'd always welcome contributors in this area at a minimum in terms of outlining your design requirements in a GH issue, or perhaps code level assistance in bringing in the Cosmos SDK. _Some_ of what you're trying to achieve is doable within EVM smart contracts, but it would likely be relatively hacky.

@compleatang  aha.. so the root of the problem that there is no "compressed signature" for  ed25519, which would work tha same ways as for secp256k1 , right?

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:00:37 GMT):<br/>
Fastchain, I'm not deep in the cryptography primitives but I do remember that it was something around the difference between ed22519 and secp. 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:01:57 GMT):<br/>
Since we use ed22519 keys in burrow (as does tendermint) I remember we turned it off for something to do with that. Although there's no reason it should be off for all curve types we just haven't gotten around to it in terms of our (monax) contributions.
</p>
<p><strong>fastchain</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:02:35 GMT):<br/>
@compleatang  got it.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:03:43 GMT):<br/>
Fast, I'm just seeing your bug noted in #fabric-evm 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:04:26 GMT):<br/>
can you describe a bit here the problem? and if so can you dump an issue in burrow so we can take a look?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:04:42 GMT):<br/>
That doesn't feel like we should throw on a simple factory with constructor pattern.
</p>
<p><strong>fastchain</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:09:43 GMT):<br/>
So the problem is following, I have a contract  1 which creates another contract 2 on function call and contract 2 creates  contract 3 in constructor. In ethereum EVM it works.  In burrow I get this (RPC dump from FAB3 proxy):

you mean create an issue in jira in burrow project?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:10:47 GMT):<br/>
Hmm. We test a very similar pattern..  https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/tree/develop/tests/jobs_fixtures/app26-factories_single_constructor_and_overwriting_testing

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:11:06 GMT):<br/>
Are you sure it's not a permissioning problem?

FWIW we use GitHub issues not Jira.

I'm sure. I've spent last week fixing the permission issue :)

Oh cool. 
</p>
<p><strong>fastchain</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:14:03 GMT):<br/>
@compleatang  there is a difference with your pattern: in your teste you create just one contract on, in my case I create two (the first created  creates second one in constructor).  
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:14:26 GMT):<br/>
If you can give us a test case on a GH issue we'll definitely take a look. Our tests follow the pattern linked above.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:14:46 GMT):<br/>

@compleatang  ok, I'll open an issue on github.   Buy the way, how can I get a version of burrow if I use it as a part of the evm-chaincode  ? 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:18:58 GMT):<br/>
Just download the binaries from our releases. Although I'm not sure exactly the version fabric currently uses.
</p>
<p><strong>fastchain</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:22:41 GMT):<br/>
They keep in vendor folder 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-evm/tree/master/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/burrow so it looks like 0.24.4
</p>

if you install burrow by downloading our binary then save this yaml:

```
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:18:45 GMT):<br/>
if you install burrow by downloading our binary then save this yaml:

</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:19:35 GMT):<br/>
with your base contract as `contract.sol`
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:19:52 GMT):<br/>
then run this script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

rm -rf .burrow
burrow spec -f1 | burrow configure -s- > config.toml
addr=$(cat config.toml | grep "ValidatorAddress"| sed -e "s/^ValidatorAddress = //" -e 's/"//g')

burrow start -v0 -c config.toml &> burrow.log &
sleep 1
burrow deploy -a $addr deploy.yaml
pkill burrow
```
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:20:21 GMT):<br/>
you will see that it all operates without a problem on burrow.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=Y59GvwDAfDf3fYmr7) @efn Yes that does kinda suck...

@seanyoung there is really no good reason for us to store the genesisdoc - we can just store the hash in PersistedState - we'll need to rework a couple of things, but we are not relying on the genesis being stored in state - we expect it to be on disk anyway

</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:39:00 GMT):<br/>
it's passing on CI; see #1102 which would be current develop branch. i run v0.25.0
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:39:49 GMT):<br/>
didn't test against 0.24.4 but we haven't really touched the evm in there so it's hard for me to see that it's a problem. if you want to verify static binaries are downloadable here -> https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/releases (it should take you less than 5 minutes to confirm with the above information)
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:39:57 GMT):<br/>
(plus you'll have burrow installed :D )

@seanyoung I am really sorry to bother You again, unfortunately it is still not working with the same error.

@SimonSchuler  you are right, on v0.25.0 it does not work but it does work on the develop branch. This is strange..
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 18:34:40 GMT):<br/>
@SimonSchuler I'm sorry, I think it's a different problem. get_score() returns uint; however, there in data returned by this function. Note the message:
log_channel=Info message="No return result value"
Then it tries to decode the value and cannot since there is nothing to decode
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 18:40:23 GMT):<br/>
If I replace the query-contact with call, it works fine. However, solidity says the function is constant in the abi so I don't know why it's not working

Hi, I have a couple more bottlenecks in my experiment, I'm running 80 validators.
The problem is that the client takes a long time to send the txs, I try to send 200tx over 5s blocks.
Blocks are produced with around 7-9s latency.
In the beginning, the performance is good, but as the system progresses it gets very erratic, like the file above
X axis is blocks (0, N) and Y is Tx/s in that block


</p>
<p><strong>efn</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 08:59:33 GMT):<br/>
this experiment can take around 18tx/s on average

@fastchain to answer your last queston on the PR before moving here, yes you can give the deploy.yaml a binary. just save the binary as a .bin and change the name of the contract in the deploy.yaml `deploy` job.

Hello everyone, I was running out of space (on my server) the other day. So I looked into block generation rates for burrow and found that around every half a second a new block is generated. For my purpose it would be sufficient to have like one a minute :) Is there an easy way to achieve this?

@fastchain execution reverted can have multiple causes. 
1. If you call assert(), require() or revert
2. Problem ABI decoding the constructor/function arguments 
3. Calling another contract which does not exist

@fastchain it could that fabric doesn't like creating contracts in constructors too. I don't know about debugging fabric but I would turn on debugging in the evm vm https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/execution/evm/vm.go#L84 and see what it is executing. I'm happy to look at a trace if you can get one

Hi All! Can someone confirm that the Burrow EVM (or something in an upper layer) performs an Account update after every TX even if nothing changed (or maybe changes are not checked)? 
Context: Burrow EVM and Fabric integration through the EVMCC project.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 14:27:08 GMT):<br/>
For every tx the sequence number for the account has to be increased
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 14:57:50 GMT):<br/>
@SimonSchuler I'm not sure there is much documentation.  First you run "burrow snatives" to get the solidity interface. The actual implementation is in go, so none of the functions have any bodies. You should write the output to a file and import it into your own solidity files using import.  Permissions can also be managed from deploy yaml, see https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/tests/jobs_fixtures/app03-basic_and_advanced_permission_txs_and_queries/deploy.yaml

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=QzSTLnStr5JvGneJe) @seanyoung Ah, I didn't know that, thanks for the info! So this greatly increases the probability of mvcc conflicts during a fabric integration, if there are only a few contracts 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 09:46:53 GMT):<br/>
@klenik note that only the input sequence number is increased by Burrow. Also IIRC I think we changed our EVM interface specifically to help you guys out with this: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/commit/81e6682c9586dbcb3d4123492deadf17967320b3

</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 12:01:36 GMT):<br/>
@nikolay what exactly are you trying to achieve? Just to run a single burrow node to develop against?
</p>
<p><strong>nikolay</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 12:01:53 GMT):<br/>
no, a production system
</p>
<p><strong>nikolay</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 12:02:20 GMT):<br/>
but based on the tendermint requirements, the validators have to be protected by centric nodes
</p>
<p><strong>nikolay</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 12:02:33 GMT):<br/>
so they are not directly exposed to the network for security concerns
</p>

yes you can run a node in non-validating mode. It can send transactions to the validator nodes.

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 18:25:46 GMT):<br/>
You are in non validating mode when you are connected to the network and your are not a Validator. All Burrow nodes have a Validator Address whether or not they are a Validator that serves as their primary signing identity, and is used if ever they have Validator power bonded. We are working on some network introductions that will rely on this primary identity being available. It means we can always associate an account with a node which has some applications.

We do expose all of Tendermint's configuration by default but have expose groups of config that make sense for Burrow sometimes providing meta parameters that control several tendermint parameters at once. The idea is to provide nice defaults and make things tuneable where there is demand. I'm not against providing it as an option though we use block production as a heartbeat mechanism so have not really wanted it off. It might be convenient for testing, but we no have no consensus mode which helps that. Feel free to open an issue.

<p><strong>nikolay</strong> (Sat, 11 May 2019 13:22:55 GMT):<br/>
The issue comes from the fact that after this change the commits are stored in a forest and each save on the forest creates a new hash even if there is no change on the tree, the hash changes. Is this expected behaviour or I should file an issue?

Block chain state did not use to be in the merkle tree state so that is a change. But we have always stored empty blocks some I'm not sure hwl this relates to that. When you say like crazy it may be related to the change in default block timings. If empty blocks are an issue please open an issue and we'll make this configurable. I suspect the block storage in state may mean that a simple approach of passing the no empty blocks to tendermint will not be enough. In your case we may want to disable block storage on our side. Either way we can look to a solution if you open an issue.

</p>
<p><strong>mohor32</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 18:11:23 GMT):<br/>
I have a question regarding deployment of smart contracts in hyperledger burrow..if i have more than one contract do i need to create separate deploy yaml file for all of them?like if i have three contracts three separate deploy yaml files???
</p>
<p><strong>mohor32</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 18:11:41 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 08:35:34 GMT):<br/>
@mohor32 you can have many contracts in one deploy yaml. In fact that's why the deploy yaml exist. See https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/tests/jobs_fixtures/app54-static-call/deploy.yaml and also https://github.com/agreements-network/blackstone/tree/develop/contracts/src

Can someone explain vm.Call parameters (https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/execution/evm/vm.go#L143)? I cannot understand why there are 2 fields of type []byte (_code_ and _input_). I thought, _code_ is something to be executed, and _input_ is a hash of function and parameters to that function. But I was confused with this line: 
`contractCode, err := ourVm.Call(cache, NewNoopEventSink(), account1, account2, code, code, 0, &gas)`
(https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/execution/evm/vm_test.go#L996)
There is the comment about code initialization at account2.  Why parameter _input_ is not empty (since there is no code at account2 before the call)? It seems I did not understand the semantics of the parameters for vm.Call.

<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 23:17:30 GMT):<br/>
but what has gas to do with time?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 23:20:22 GMT):<br/>
In the context of EVMCC. On one hand, Fabric's clock is ticking, on the other hand, Burrow's gas is evaporating. We needed to increase the gas to allow Fabric timeouts, and it was strange that we needed so many gas, but the cost explains it
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 23:21:21 GMT):<br/>
interesting. the gas could be tunable, and the values in there are definitely not what is defined in the white paper.
</p>

It opens up some possibilities, yes, I'll dive into it once our current experiment is done

Hi @silasdavis , @compleatang (picking on you because I know you, but obviously everyone is welcome to answer)...

I'm elbow-deep in implementing support for `eth_call` in Seth-RPC.  It's almost entirely working but there's one thing left to satisfy the Ethereum spec that I'm struggling with.  eth_call() allows you to specify a TAG|QUANTITY that specifies the block level at which you wish to execute the call, which may be "latest", "earliest", "pending", or "0x{explicit_block}".  

"latest" is obviously fine, and that's lucky because it's what's usually wanted, but I can't see how the call machinery in Seth in general (which is essentially just a call to NewVM() ) can support operating on other, arbitrary blocks/block heights.  Do you think this can be possible?  Is there an existing call or config or state param I'm missing
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 27 May 2019 22:40:23 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>gregdhill</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 08:46:48 GMT):<br/>
@mohor32 it doesn't look like you're executing burrow in the same directory you created the genesis / config. 
</p>
<p><strong>gregdhill</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 08:48:41 GMT):<br/>
If you used the one-liner, you can also specify the config as part of the start command: `burrow start --validator-index=0 --config=burrow.toml`

I have this stub PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/1112/files that I opened in an effort to provide a useful seed around which some better docs could crystallise
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 03 Jun 2019 15:29:19 GMT):<br/>
The idea was to include technical topics that are much more efficient for us to write than someone new to the project which includes:
- Genesis and chain-making
- Permissions
- Governance
- Consensus and state (concepts)

On these topics I was going to try and give a broad and selectively deep coverage, but I think what I or other maintainers produce could be improved a lot by someone trying to understand what is written (and have a clearer idea than us on what is confusing) as well as expanding for style and coverage.

Other areas that need documentation but I think lend themselves more easily to being written from scratch by someone interested in technical writing would be:
- Our SQL mapping/projection layer 'Vent'
- Our Go-based 'precompiled contracts' called 'SNatives'
- Our various RPC services (info, query, transact, names)
- Our NameReg
- Dump/restore

For these items someone who is able/willing to play bit on command line, maybe read small amount of definitions from source, I think could produce better documentation for newcomers with relatively less orientation from us (though of course we can help), since they are more self-contained or already partially documented (sometimes in command-line help).
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 03 Jun 2019 15:31:59 GMT):<br/>
I also think there are some areas where we could be lead on the best solutions for:
- Overall structure of docs (explainers vs tutorials vs reference material)
- Maintenance of docs 

Another thing I think we could/should do is use to bind any example code into our integration tests so that it will always compile and work correctly (i.e. fail our tests if examples embedded in docs don't work. This would be achievable with a small amount of templating in doc source and some scripting in CI but we could discuss this
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 03 Jun 2019 15:32:33 GMT):<br/>
Oh we also have some example apps that are a little out of date (and along with the js library itself need to be move to Burrow repo): https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/tree/develop/example
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 04 Jun 2019 08:26:04 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis if you have some PoC docs, I'd be happy to read it through as a Burrow newbie (plus hopefully it'd help us to improve the Burrow adapter in Caliper)

Hello, just a quick question. I'm just looking to confirm that Burrow's implementation of the Ethereum EVM and smart contracts means that the smart contracts are actually on chain as in Ethereum ? So that any new node that joins the network and synchronizes to the chain will have all available contracts present on chain to be executed? It's been hard to find verbiage anywhere that clarifies this point that the contracts are on chain and therefore protected in the distributed ledger. Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 10:12:15 GMT):<br/>
@rjortman they are stored on chain, absolutely. When the code is deployed, it is part of the transaction so it is part of the burrow block.

If one program, written in Go, is the only program that wants to talk to a burrow node, is it advisable to run a burrow node directly from that program (importing packages from the burrow project) or would it be better to just run burrow as a separate process and talk to it over GRPC?

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 00:07:00 GMT):<br/>
@JoeriExelmans in general I'd personally suggest running it out of process and talking to it over GRPC because there are a lot of configuration variables that go into starting the kernel and a lot of assumptions the runtime makes about where it is and how it's storing files that may or may not be suited to it's use as an overall library. pieces of burrow are built to be a library but the core runtime isn't.

I'd agree with @compleatang suggest, but also far be it for us to say not to embed - that's exactly the decision we take with Tendermint. The fairly recent kernel refactor does make it quite usable as a library - and we have deliberately kept it open code-wise for extension. I would recommend only using us this way if you have a good reason to - e.g. you need low level access to execution, P2P, want to implement your own transaction types. But I'd much rather support this usage modality than have you fork us!

The downsides to be aware of would be:
- Initialisation and supervision of the Kernel and node are not totally straight forward

- We make no guarantees about the exported API, it is exposed to support extension, but pre 1.0.0 (at least) it is subject to change - we will prioritise improving the code over compatibility, this is not the case with the GRPC interfaces where we value stability more

The downsides to be aware of would be:
- Initialisation and supervision of the Kernel and node are not totally straight forward

- We make no guarantees about the exported API, it is exposed to support extension, but pre 1.0.0 (at least) it is subject to change - we will prioritise improving the code over compatibility, this is not the case with the GRPC interfaces where we value stability more

I'd agree with what @compleatang suggests, but also far be it for us to say not to embed - that's exactly the decision we take with Tendermint. The fairly recent kernel refactor does make it quite usable as a library - and we have deliberately kept it open code-wise for extension.

@bamboo the simplest way to check on the command line is over the info RPC:

Another thing @JoeriExelmans - you probably are already - but I would definitely import us for GRPC client code rather than, for example, rebuilding the protobuf yourself. There is useful clientside functionality in various Burrow packages, and you only pay for what you import.

worth a lok in particular is `execution/exec` if you are interested in execution events - we have some primitives there for processing txs, and blocks, from our StreamEvents, which vent uses heavily for instancew

@silasdavis  Thanks, for now I'm just communicating over GRPC. I'm not doing complicated things with Burrow. I'm indeed importing a bunch of packages from the burrow repo because I need many types that are declared in packages like txs, payload and crypto, seemed easier than building the protobuf myself. At this time 99% of what I use burrow for, are rpctransact's  `BroadcastTxSync` and `CallTxSim`, although I should learn more about the permissions stuff. Documentation is indeed very limited but perhaps even a short abstract description (1 page, without demo code) of new features like governance and permissions would be really helpful.

Hi @bamboo. best place to start is here -> https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/docs/permissions.md with the burrow permission model. Then you can review the genesis docs -> https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/docs/genesis.md and finally if you need to have more questions answered the "actual" docs are here -> https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/burrow/permission#AccountPermissions On the markdown files we're always looking for help documenting things so if anything is unclear please feel free to send over a merge request! :)

Hi all, when I run "_make build_" on the install instructions the build fails with "_Makefile:42: recipe for target 'check' failed
make: *** [check] Error 2_" after several lines of "diff" results (the last one being from "_postgrest_adapter.go_" ... when i downloaded using "go get ..." it did result in the following print statement at the end of the download: "package github.com/hyperledger/burrow: no buildable Go source files in /home/rortman1/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/burrow" not sure if that's a problem ? Thank you to any who are able to help! (as an aside, i do believe my GOPATH is set correctly using source ./~bashrc and some exports, but maybe that's not correct at the end of the day?)
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 11:46:55 GMT):<br/>
@rjortman that is probably due to a mismatched go version. go 1.12 should do the trick
</p>
<p><strong>rjortman</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 15:51:44 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung ok, thank you for the idea. I will try that. I did confirm that i am on Go 1.11 like the instructions said, but I can try 1.12.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>rjortman</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 15:53:29 GMT):<br/>
literally just stepping through the "install" instructions from here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/docs/INSTALL.md

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 15:55:52 GMT):<br/>
ok, that should default to the develop branch
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 15:59:26 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure if that still works with go 1.11. The docs should probably say go 1.12. Let me check this
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 15:59:26 GMT):<br/>
go 1.12 is what we use anyway
</p>
<p><strong>rjortman</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:01:44 GMT):<br/>
ok, thank you very much. i will try this. Seems unlikely that i'd be the only person running in to this if it doesn't work on 1.11 doesn't it? since the instructions have said 1.11 up to this point and no one else has said anything ?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:13:25 GMT):<br/>
I agree. I just tried go1.11.11 and it works fine. Which exact version are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>rjortman</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:18:10 GMT):<br/>
uhhh, apparently i must have multiple versions installed, because when I run "go version" I get "go version go1.6.2 linux/amd64"
</p>
<p><strong>rjortman</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:18:27 GMT):<br/>
is 1.6.2 gonna be a problem ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjortman</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:18:49 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:23:52 GMT):<br/>
burrow uses go modules which is a go 1.11 feature. Also the the output gofmt has changed a few times which is the problem you're running into.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:24:09 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing go 1.6 is still somewhere in your path
</p>
<p><strong>rjortman</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:24:41 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjortman</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:24:57 GMT):<br/>
sounds like the instructions still maybe need an update then though

Hi! Is it possible to extend the role-permission model for an existing network? It seems that because the sets of permissions are set in genesis block, it will not be possible to add new permissions to existing users.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 09:15:53 GMT):<br/>
@LHK7 this is what the burrow deploy command is for. You can specify what contracts you want deployed in a yaml file and deploy all of them in one command line `burrow deploy -a $account deploy.yaml`
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 09:17:50 GMT):<br/>
@lebdron permissions can be changed via `burrow deploy`. You'll need write a burrow deploy script with some jobs to do this. Here is an example https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/tests/jobs_fixtures/app03-basic_and_advanced_permission_txs_and_queries/deploy.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>lebdron</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 09:26:47 GMT):<br/>
I am not sure if that example covers that case. What if a new permission flag is added, for example there is `Call` flag now, and `CallCustom` is added sometime in the future?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 10:05:36 GMT):<br/>
that would be a more complex migration needed. in general you'd need to add the permission, scope it out, recompile all the clients, dump the old state, restore the old state as the genesis block of a new blockchain, then modify the permissions in the same way. (this is, if you needed to add a custom permission and keep an old blockchain state). 
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 10:06:02 GMT):<br/>
but in general can you explain a bit more about the use case you are needing to solve?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 10:22:32 GMT):<br/>
@lebdron as Casey alludes to there is no configuration-based way to introduced a permissions. These are hard-coded constants. We do however have space in the bitfield of the current implementation for another 47. We do occasionally add a permission flag such as `Proposal` when it is needed. This requires a code change, most of which is likely to be concerned with for what purpose and where we look at the new permission.

Adding a new permission does not necessarily break the state of an old chain, so you could potentially run a new version of Burrow with a new permission without doing a dump/restore - though then you would need to manually grant this permission to accounts or change the global default permissions.

What did you have in mind for `CallCustom` or the like?

>though then you would need to manually grant this permission to accounts or change the global default permissions.
@compleatang @silasdavis 

I would like to get more details on this, because it seems to mean that some account has "superuser" ability in some way to grant the permission which was not mention in the genesis block.

To be honest, I am asking the question because we faced the issue I have described in Hyperledger Iroha while adding new commands which require their own permission, which were not present before. I have checked your documentation, seen the similar role based access control model and thought that you might have already solved the "extending permission types" problem.

<p><strong>lebdron</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 11:03:09 GMT):<br/>
Now our "CreateRole" and "AppendRole" commands check that the role you are trying to create and you are trying to give someone has a subset of users' permissions who is trying to issue such command. The idea was to introduce a new permission, which will allow to "override" this restriction, therefore allowing to create roles with new permissions in runtime without recreating the block store with a new genesis block.

Users with `root` permissions on the chain can change the global default permissions or the permissions of any account on the chain. They effectively have sudo on the chain. There are lower levels of permissions for more discrete permissions adjustments -- albeit currently we do not have an idea of account based "namespacing" where you could set up an admin for "our users".... That would be interesting for consortium chains but we don't currently have that AFAIK.
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 21:11:12 GMT):<br/>
we also have, via our proposal mechanism, an ability to change default permissions and/or individual account permissions via more collaborative means (e.g., agreement by multiple parties to do X).

burrow also has, via the proposal mechanism Silas mentions, an ability to change default permissions and/or individual account permissions via more collaborative means (e.g., agreement by multiple parties to do X ). this allows, effectively, for say a 5 of 5 vote to change something fundamental about the chain (like it's default permissions)

In Ethereum there are two types of contracts — for users and for contracts. I try to run smart contracts on Burrow VM. I use an analog of the FakeAppState struct (https://github.com/IvanTyulyandin/HL_Burrow_EVM_caller/blob/master/iroha_app_state.go). After smart contract execution I see only users accounts details, but without contract account (https://github.com/IvanTyulyandin/HL_Burrow_EVM_caller/blob/master/main.go#L141). Is it possible to get an address of the contract account?

Its the same in Ehtereum. The difference between "users" and "contracts" is simply whether the account has code attached to it.

Thank for replies @compleatang and @seanyoung . I tried to print EVM code for each account but seems that there is no attached code.
`	evmState.CreateAccount(toEVMaddress(C.GoString(caller)))
	evmState.Sync()
	fmt.Println(appState.accounts)
	fmt.Println(appState.storage)
	//VmCall(code, code, caller, callee)
	output, _ := VmCall(code, code, caller, callee)
	output, _ = VmCall(output, set, caller, callee)
	for _, acc := range appState.accounts {
		fmt.Println(acc.EVMCode)
	}
	fmt.Println(appState.accounts)
	fmt.Println(appState.storage)`

My output is:

Thank for replies @compleatang and @seanyoung . I tried to print EVM code for each account but seems that there is no attached code.
`	
evmState.CreateAccount(toEVMaddress(C.GoString(caller)))
evmState.Sync()
fmt.Println(appState.accounts)
fmt.Println(appState.storage)
output, _ := VmCall(code, code, caller, callee)
output, _ = VmCall(output, set, caller, callee)
for _, acc := range appState.accounts {

}
fmt.Println(appState.accounts)

@IvanTyulyandin I just had a look in your repo.  Your implementation of Call is incorrect. During deployment, the return value of the call is the code which should be assigned to the acc.EVMCode (or acc.Code in earlier versions).
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 08:42:47 GMT):<br/>
See https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/execution/contexts/call_context.go#L228 how this is done in burrow
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 08:44:10 GMT):<br/>
So output defined on https://github.com/IvanTyulyandin/HL_Burrow_EVM_caller/blob/master/main.go#L70 should be assigned to the account if you're in a create call

Hi all,
When I get block in burrow, it returns: ```"txs": [
                        "CoIBChQCxUUpBvsCNDUQtaNcvs9QzmZcaxIkCAESIKGkfhDULzIHTGh53Ja/ofiQACukVr7ZxgqTxj00YsmgGkQIARJAYY2B32dE5xzGdpd0h60oCPCIfMnaHUpOV5TN7+P4XBVCMk7DeENRWpl9HmIA5pwurfbh0GcnKIMIrqRL/6zaAxJRChJ4ZWstbmV0d29yay0yQUFERjISO9SkoM0KGwoUAsVFKQb7AjQ1ELWjXL7PUM5mXGsQARi3ARIYChTWNx5jXBFUPNHLI74ANQFIEcHuGRAB"
                    ]```
How i can decode that to json or structure?

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 10:14:54 GMT):<br/>
@Macondo that is the global permissions address
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 10:15:03 GMT):<br/>
which by historical convention is the Zero address...
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 10:15:03 GMT):<br/>
which by historical convention is the zero address...
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 10:15:50 GMT):<br/>
It's permissions define the global fallback permissions for all accounts
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 10:16:48 GMT):<br/>
which is to say for a particular permission either it is set for an account or it is unset. If it is 'set' it may be true or false and that value takes precedent. If it is 'unset' then whatever the value for the global permissions account is is used.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 10:18:25 GMT):<br/>
the global permission can itself be updated by transactions, provided the input account (transaction sender) has the `SetGlobal` permission

What is the difference between ethermint?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 11:48:30 GMT):<br/>
Network framework: burrow uses tendermint for p2p connectivity. 
There is no difference within the EVM itself between burrow or any other EVM blockchain we know of (well, if there is that's a bug). The permissioning happens in a layer of the stack below the EVM. The permission layer checks things before the transaction is exposed into the EVM. The EVM smart contract themselves can, of course, add additional permissioning as folks do routinely with ERC721, ERC20, etc. 
As to ethermint? You'd have to ask them. Previously it was a geth fork over tendermint base, lacked permissioning, and wasn't very well maintained.

Similar idea in the sense of tendermint + EVM, but burrow is much more full featured and heavily used (as far as we know).

Hello, I have a small problem: When I deploy a contract, only the actual deployment is done with the address specified by me when calling 'burrow deploy' and every subsequent job uses the general permission account '0000.....'. Is that normal behaviour? And if not, how can I tell my playbook file to use the address I specified during the deployment?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 09:30:05 GMT):<br/>
if you set the address via command line that is what the jobs should use UNTIL you change that address via an address job. 
</p>
<p><strong>nhbrown</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 12:38:54 GMT):<br/>
@compleatang sadly doesn't happen that way on my end, the address I set via command line is only used for deployment, every other job in the same playbook file uses the general permission account, checked it again today with another contract. Heres a quick example of what I'm doing, complete with playbook file and output: https://github.com/nhbrown/burrow_msg.sender_example
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:45:58 GMT):<br/>

@nhbrown  Oops didn't finish that thought... It doesn't actually need an input in order to work (on a real transaction it would in order to verify sequence numbers and signatures) which is why it still goes through. However it ought to be using the address provided (the zero address is what we set in the absence of address - awkwardly this is also global permissions address, something I have thought about changing for this reason, but never quite wanted the disruption). 

Anyway the bug fixes this

Hi, In the function IsRegisteredNativeContract https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/execution/evm/vm.go#L859, the registered contract are the precompiled contract of ethereum? I saw that the 2,3,4 are supported, but I didn't see the 7 https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-196.md and 8 https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-197.md, So... they're not supported?

how is tendermint achieved when hyperledger is a private network?

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 07:56:17 GMT):<br/>
The bug fixed above was quite specific to querying a contract, msg.sender does and always has worked properly on contracts

@Hyungsuk Kang you say 'EVM chaincode' - are you using fabric-evm-chaincode?

If you are using Burrow directly could you raise an issue on https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues ?

It sounds like a number of assumptions are tied up here, but Hyperledger is not a network it is an organisation. Not sure if you are saying Hyperledger deals exclusively with private networks.

Tendermint is a consensus engine it can be used in a private or public context. Burrow is a permissioned ledger and can be used in a private or public context.

Ok! So,  It is ok to just use some code from the go-ethereum project? https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/777/files seems to use  go-ethereum/crypto, and math snippets. And what are the import restrictions? like the C dependency issue.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 21:08:12 GMT):<br/>

at some point we will probably overhaul gas to make it configurable, right now all it does is bound computation, we don't even charge for it

<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 14:31:54 GMT):<br/>
I've checked Burrow wiki but was not able to figure out. If there are any guides how to start standalone burrow instance, please let me know.

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:48:19 GMT):<br/>
Yes and yes! https://hyperledger.github.io/burrow/#/tutorials/1-run-full-node
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:48:34 GMT):<br/>
no docker required

@samurai please try a newer version of go. I use go 1.12, go 1.13 will work too.  Alternatively you can try and remove the check dependency in the top level Makefile however I think it better  to upgrade your go version

hey all, wanted to heck here before I made an issue, but it seems that there's an issue running burrow on Windows due to directory structures.  for example when trying to run the simple command from the basics tutorial I get this.  everything looks OK up until the / instead of \ for the path

=>  code burrow spec -v1 | burrow configure -s- | burrow start -c-
Sourcing config from first of: Config from STDIN then defaults
Sourcing config from Config from STDIN
could not generate GenesisDoc from GenesisSpec using MockKeyClient: could not create Account from template: file C:\code\.keys\data/15DC3ED72C510B3AAB53F8CDDC32C486167E9245.json should be accessible by user onlycannot continue with config: could not finalise address - please provide one in config or via --account-address

Hi all, I have been looking to get a better understanding of the Burrow project and its goals. From my reading it's unclear whether Burrow is striving for compliance with the EEA spec in the same way Hyperledger Besu is (and to a lesser extent, I suppose, Quorum). Is Burrow positioning itself as a competing permissioned Ethereum blockchain to other permissioned implementations such as Fabric, Sawtooth, Corda, Besu and Quorum? What differentiating features if any does Burrow offer compared to the other platforms? On the other hand, is Burrow mostly an experimental project with the goals of porting the EVM as a smart contract engine to the DLT implementations?

Finally getting a chance to read the wiki and its looking really good. Thanks again for all the effort. I really love the direction of this project and have for a while. Impressed with the progress in the last few months yall. Hopefully now that its cold here in CO I will have more time to put into it.

<p><strong>d3cline</strong> (Sat, 09 Nov 2019 14:10:30 GMT):<br/>
have actually had a few good conversations with some big investors in cannabis about storing IoT data on a burrow chain, I think its going to gain traction. 
</p>
<p><strong>d3cline</strong> (Sat, 09 Nov 2019 15:23:05 GMT):<br/>
binary releases are also very neat addition 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 10:32:12 GMT):<br/>
@dileban hopefully the link Kelly posted gives a broader context and helps on the question of differentiation, on some of your other points:

EEA spec compliance is currently a non-goal of Burrow. However we did recently add support for the web3 JSON RPC which opens us up to Ethereum tooling. There are groups of users of Ethereum-using projects (some of whom I met here: https://runevm.com/) who see more value in implementing unbundled components from Ethereum and do not wish to sit directly on mainnet. Burrow is more aligned with this - we want to offer core EVM language compatibility but also be open to extension without dragging along the worst bits of Ethereum architecture. We also do our consensus and p2p through Tendermint - so supporting DEVP2P is unlikely to be something we'd ever want to do. 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 10:36:15 GMT):<br/>
> a competing permissioned Ethereum blockchain to other permissioned implementations such as Fabric, Sawtooth, Corda, Besu and Quorum

Yes, if you like, we are a fully-featured permissioned blockchain. Also, while appeal to seniority has no technical merit, I would point out that Burrow's original code predates all of them, and Hyperledger itself. I am not aware of permissioned blockchain project started before eris-db...
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 10:43:14 GMT):<br/>
@d3cline great to hear that there may be some budding projects (arf) on Burrow. Interested to hear more if you are able to share. We did have a build on ARM set up a few years ago by an intern which would be possible to resurrect if that is useful for IoT devices for example. I don't know much about the state of the Go runtime on embedded hardware other than people are doing it. The other thing that we want to get out there is as light-client RPC layer - like what we have now but that transmits a proof with results. That will require a bit of a work to set up but means your clients at the edge can get the verified state without running a full node - it's always been in the backlog pretty much forever, just needs the impetus from someone wanting to use/build it.

There might be an angle with the Avalon here - as a distribution means for the state hash for example - though no collaboration has started yet.

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 11:33:48 GMT):<br/>
burrow compiles fine on arm. It needs at least 2GB of ram to build, armv6l (with hardfloat). I'm building it on debian buster for armhf, on this http://www.banana-pi.org/r2.html using the go tools for armv6l.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 11:47:32 GMT):<br/>
actually there isn't much in the way of float processing in burrow, apart from some stats. It might work fine without hardware float support. Presumably the crypto side is where most of the cpu is spent, which does not use floats (again, I guess).
</p>
<p><strong>d3cline</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 14:34:10 GMT):<br/>
thanks guys. I actually built it a few months ago on a pi I had laying around, but I don't think the nodes will be using it, they will be publishing their data via RPC to a distributed setup on the web. I plan on doing this via the blocktwine project I announced a few weeks ago. In the past I spent a ton of time writing a project before talking to people about it and wasted a bunch of energy on software no one really cared about until much later. This time I am talking about it a lot more before I get my hands dirty with the code. I have a single node deployed now I play with and am about to re-design some of my hardware which will start talking to it. Should be an interesting winter. Once more of a body of work is done I plan on publishing all that on github and I think it will be more interesting then. Keep up the good work tho, I really think its great.

Hi guys. When listening an event, how can I retrieve the data emitted by the solidity code?

@lcfsjr1980 how are you listening for the event? You can use `burrow vent` for example to insert the event into a database.

        if (error) {
            socket.emit("error", error);
            console.log('Event %j error', error);
        } else {
            console.log('Event %s emitted: %s', "SomethingUpdated", JSON.stringify(event));

@seanyoung the burrow vent is interesting but in my case would be overengineering because I just need to emit the event values to the clients listening the websocket.

What is the relationship between Burrow and an Ethereum network?  I was under the impression Burrow was basically a smart contract execution environment for EVM based languages.  But how does that smart contract play in a blockchain network such as Ethereum?

Hi folks, question to you: we had to modify burrow.js library and change the structure of the returnObj (https://github.com/molfaras/burrow.js/commit/f76d09ce9fe041e6d31f6ab5d3fed035de07f1c8#diff-e71d3a046f10d64d825ecdba1c7fd833R144)

Is it possible to have something like decorator/or formatter for returnObj now or in the future? Should I open issue for this?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 13:49:08 GMT):<br/>
Hi @g3d, I think the answer is yes to both questions but it's a bit difficult for me to see the wood from the trees from that commit because it is not clear what the ancestry of that change is because of the rebasing.

Could you open an issue specifying what you are trying to do, why you can't get what you need currently.

Incidentally it is on my list to convert burrow.js to typescript, kill the cruft, and provided more integrated SQL database synchronisation ala https://github.com/agreements-network/blackstone/blob/feature/deletion/MP-1163/api/common/VentHelper.js.

The typescript conversion is something I'd ideally do on the next significant touch of the library so maybe this is it. If you raise an issue I'll try and cover your use case with the refactor.

Another feature I'd like to see is batching of multiple external calls into a single (atomic) transaction using a lexical (function) scope on the JS side, if that happens to be of interest to you too let me know.

Also always interested to here what brought you to Burrow and what we can do to keep you here.

@lcfsjr1980 this is not very well documented. What `query` are you using?

For a smoke test use `burrow.events.listen('', {}, (error, event) => { ... ` that will give you everything

What you probably want to do is just call the event function from the contract object directly which hides all of the details of doing this. See this test: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/js/test/event/index.js#L33

If you have the burrow contract object then just use:

```
myContract.SomethingUpdated((error, event) => { ... })
```
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 14:07:04 GMT):<br/>
sorry re-reading it sounds like you are getting _raw_ events. The call above will decode them for you, so yes using the low-level listen you would have to decode yourself, using the helper above you should see the values.

Here is where the bodies are buried: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/js/lib/contracts/event.js#L47-L74

Hi guys, I'm trying to configure 3 nodes and connect them using a seed node, according to this documentation: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/docs/tutorials/6-seeding.md
I've configured the ChainName with the same value for both seed and validator nodes:
[GenesisDoc]
  GenesisTime = 2020-01-06T13:35:45Z
  ChainName = "LedgerChain"

But after starting the seed and validator 1 the following errors has been displayed:

seed:
incompatible: Peer is on a different network. Got LedgerChain-992E3C, expected LedgerChain-69C17C

node 1:
incompatible: Peer is on a different network. Got LedgerChain-69C17C, expected LedgerChain-992E3C

@silasdavis  I am performing research, which databases are used within various blockchain project... and because of the documentation of the project is not so well documented in that area, I was forced to dig into the codebase to get some findings of a database. For the Burrow project, my findings are followings: Databases: PostgreSQL (event&log data), SQLite (event&log data), LevelDB (state). Can you please verify if my findings are correct or not.

<p><strong>g3d</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 11:13:46 GMT):<br/>
Hi folks, as far as I see from tendermint consensus documentation, there is no maximum amount of validators, but the bigger amount of validator we have -the bigger amount of rounds it may take to vote. Is that correct?

What is optimal balance in that case?

According to interview here (https://docs.tendermint.com/master/interviews/tendermint-bft.html) there are some researches, that indicates 7 nodes. Is that valid assumption? 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:26:21 GMT):<br/>
@podgostar maintainer here, don't ask to ask :) Go ahead and I'll get back to you when I can, fairly regularly.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:27:22 GMT):<br/>
@g3d it depends what you are trying to optimise. Optimal throughput is 1 node :)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:36:14 GMT):<br/>
There are some magic numbers in terms of fault tolerance
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:36:39 GMT):<br/>
these are the the minimum number of nodes that can tolerate f faults
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:42:34 GMT):<br/>
partially synchronous byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithms can survive at most 1/3 byzantine faults (see https://www.scs.stanford.edu/17au-cs244b/notes/pbft.txt) 

For `n` nodes we can survive `Math.floor((n-1)/3.0)`
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:42:47 GMT):<br/>
the smallest n allowing 2 faults is 7
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:42:47 GMT):<br/>
the smallest n allowing 2 faults is 7, so that is probably why you may have heard 7 described as being a 'good' number. FWIW we (Monax) run our production validator pool on 7 nodes - it is convenient to be able to take two nodes offline. If you are running with <20 nodes you should also reduce your `TimeoutFactor` from defaults in burrow.toml:

```
...
[Execution]
  TimeoutFactor = 0.33 # or 0.25, 0.1 - depending on network
...
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:43:01 GMT):<br/>
6 nodes can survive only 1 fault
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:44:01 GMT):<br/>
so in terms of resilience 6 nodes gives no benefit of 4 nodes
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:44:33 GMT):<br/>
however you do get improved gossip throughput and resilience from having more nodes
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:45:12 GMT):<br/>
The next 'sensible' number of nodes after 7 is 10
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:45:35 GMT):<br/>
Tendermint can handle a few hundred notes, in the large n limit things get a bit smoother
</p>

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:46:45 GMT):<br/>
If you are using Burrow as a 'zookeeper replacement' you could run with 4 nodes
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:50:42 GMT):<br/>
If you want to run a public permissioned proof-of-stake network you probably want to have 100 or so validators and hope/engineer for a cartel resistant distribution of voting power
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:51:24 GMT):<br/>
if you want to scale to thousands or millions of node then you need to set up connected networks using Cosmos - which is on Burrow's roadmap in the sky

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 29 Jan 2020 10:50:17 GMT):<br/>

Yes, but note SQLite and Postgres are options for our SQL event stream - they are optional and are only used when running `burrow vent` as a separate process.

The core persistence library we use is GoLevelDB - note this is embedded there is not distinct database you need to run.

If you have useful summary information not found elsewhere I would welcome a PR into https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/tree/master/docs or adding it to the wiki if more appropriate.

Hi guys, Does Burrow allow doing things such as deploying smart contract, invoking smart contract functions, listening to events using web3 JSON RPC ?
</p>
<p><strong>gregdhill</strong> (Fri, 06 Mar 2020 16:33:39 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Jemal, yes Burrow is able to do most of the above. To listen for events I would recommend that you use our client library however.

@seanyoung  Thank you brother.  I think your client library is written in Typescript. I have a Dapp written in Java based on Web3j. I  want to use the same API (web3j) to  connect to Burrow. Do you think that would work?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Sun, 08 Mar 2020 16:17:34 GMT):<br/>
@gregdhill wrote the web3 interface; I'm not sure what its limitations are.
</p>
<p><strong>gregdhill</strong> (Sun, 08 Mar 2020 16:24:18 GMT):<br/>
we should be fully compliant, if you happen across something that does not work it is likely a bug

HI guys, i want to start multiple instances of Burrow node on a single high capacity Computer for the sake of research. I want to start up to 50 nodes and variable number of validators. I was thinking to insert my own code to the main class in the project source code so that i can do that automatically. Is it possible do that ? if so, can you tell me the entry point to the code and where i can insert my own code? If that is not possible, is there any other way to do that? Thanks

Hi ! 
I'm currently trying to evaluate the usage of Burrow regarding IBC. I saw there was a PR opened 20 days ago that ( https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/1343 ) with a few commit aiming to implement this communication using the transaction `InterchainTx`. Is there any update or ETA on this functionality if that's ok to ask ? 

And if I understand this correctly, it would mean that communicating with other blockchains part of the Cosmos Network would simply be done by emitting and receiving those transactions ?

Thanks !
</p>
<p><strong>gregdhill</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 20:46:38 GMT):<br/>
@Jemal `burrow spec -v50 | burrow configure -s- --pool`
</p>
<p><strong>gregdhill</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 20:47:00 GMT):<br/>
that will create all the configurations and keys for 50 validators

Hi @gregdhill and @Kvykv , I run the following commands to start burrow node but receiving different errors: I think i didn't get the right step to configure and start burrow nodes. Can you tell me the steps i have to go through from configuring to running Burrow node? I read the documentation. But it is confusing.

This might be a windows specific issue, Burrow is complaining that your keys do not have the correct permissions.
</p>
<p><strong>gregdhill</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 10:41:18 GMT):<br/>
See: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/keys/key_store.go#L336
</p>
<p><strong>gregdhill</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 10:42:46 GMT):<br/>
The easiest fix would be to add the following to each config generated by `burrow configure`:
</p>
<p><strong>gregdhill</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 10:42:51 GMT):<br/>
```
[Keys]
  GRPCServiceEnabled = false
  AllowBadFilePermissions = true
```
</p>

@gregdhill thank you. I have another question related to web3j. I am using web3j to listen for new Blocks as they are created. The network creates blocks every 2 seconds. I can see that the listener receives and prints new block every 2 seconds most of the time. However, sometimes it arrives late like after 15 seconds. Am i missing something? Here is the code i am using:                                                                                                                                                                          public void listenForNewBlocks(){
         subscription = (Subscription) web3j.blockFlowable(false).subscribe(block -> {
             size++;
            CustomBlock customBlock = new CustomBlock(block.getBlock(), System.currentTimeMillis());
            blockList.put(customBlock.block.getNumber(), customBlock);
            System.out.println("Block Number: "+customBlock.block.getNumber()+" Time Received: "+customBlock.timeReceived);
        });

Could you take a look at the output from our RPC and compare the timestamps in the block headers?

i.e. `curl -s "http://localhost:26658/blocks?id=1"`
</p>
<p><strong>gregdhill</strong> (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 09:10:29 GMT):<br/>
There is nothing tailor-made, but we are compatible with most Ethereum tooling, see: https://hyperledger.github.io/burrow/#/reference/web3?id=blockscout

Turns out that burrow isn't following the ewasm spec correctly. I had to make a similar change in solang: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/commit/00aa928882ac673f6d7ffd53ca855887e702598b
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 11:51:14 GMT):<br/>
I'll fix up burrow once I finish create contract and call external contract, so I can test all of them in one go.

Hi! My startup TryCrypto has a SaaS product DappStarter which makes blockchain app development easy, especially for web developers. 

Our platform is blockchain agnostic and I am here because we are exploring adding Burrow as a supported blockchain on DappStarter. We are partnered with Truffle for framework and Sia for decentralized storage. Excited to join the Burrow community.

Hi! groking the code, it appears to me that SSL/TLS is not being used in GRPC service.  Is there any document I need to readup for TLS setup? Neither did I find any message level enryption. Am I missing something?
</p>
<p><strong>AshishBanerjee</strong> (Sat, 06 Jun 2020 14:46:32 GMT):<br/>
Burrow uses tendermint for consensus, which in turn, uses  STS https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/0.1/docs/sts-final.pdf  (tendermint/p2p/conn/secret_connection.go) , thus the nodes would not be needing TLS. As for Burrow RPC not using TLS, it would be the case if the assumption is that these RPC will be node local and not exposed to the external world.
IS The above assumption correct??

Hi, I'm new to hyperledger projects and burrow. So I started reading the docs but seems like the examples for basic JS API (https://hyperledger.github.io/burrow/#/example/basic-app/README) is missing some file. When I tried to read the files like "makefile", "burrow.js", it redirect me to a broken URL. Is there any other way to continue on this JS API other than the provided document?

<p><strong>kennystone</strong> (Fri, 31 Jul 2020 19:36:48 GMT):<br/>
ok, I found it.  Since the docs live on the web, maybe we could reference where the code lives?  Or make the first step to checkout the entire burrow source tree, then CD into docs/example/basic-app

Hello

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 12:21:09 GMT):<br/>
That's exactly what vent is for. In Solidity, you have to emit events to get vent to pick them up and send them to postgres. vent will needs some definitions of tables and filters to make this work.

This page explains how to set this up https://hyperledger.github.io/burrow/#/reference/vent

Hello,
I'm new in Burrow and I want to know if there are any more triggers than listed here: https://hyperledger.github.io/burrow/#/reference/transactions I'm looking for time triggers - it is possible to trigger something e.g. every day at 8 p.m.?

Hi team, I am working with DAML smart contract that is using Immudb (cryptographically verfiable database) as ledger. I want to replace DAML with Burrow so that it can support solidity and in-contract sign verification. I am qurious to kow if it is possible to integrate Burrow with immudb (verifiable database) i.e can we use different ledger as a plugin? Can we run burrow as an independent network?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 12:54:35 GMT):<br/>
@annant what would you like to use immudb for? Storing solidity contract storage variables?

Also what do you mean by in-contract sign verification? Are you thinking of `ecrcover()`? Note that ewasm support is nearing completion, and then with solang we can add any function you need to Solidity.
</p>
<p><strong>annant</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 14:07:58 GMT):<br/>
#seanyoung immudb will basically store all the data for a contract...contract will automate the process and data will be stored in the immudb. So that it can be verified by anyone as it is cryptographically verfiable. Is it possible to integrate immudb with burrow?

In my project all the users are not given authoriy to write on contract. It is written by their onwer on contract, We are thinking the end owner will encrypt and sign the data and send it to its owner and the owner will write the data in contract. Contract(will be written in solidity) will verfiy the signature of the enduser using its public key and then modify accordingly. We are doing in-contract sign verification to make sure that data has not been tempered.

Is integration with immudb possible or we can go for inbuild burrow ledger.

Thanx in advance
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 16:58:17 GMT):<br/>
@annat what's the advantage of using immudb? burrow already uses a merkel tree for state, and the hash of this is present in each block. So, it is already cryptographically verifiable.

Having said that, you can replace the state database in burrow. This will require some surgery in the code though.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 16:58:39 GMT):<br/>
The hash is the application state in each block.

Hey everyone. We have built an application on Hyperledger Sawtooth (checkout www.forestcoin.earth - a cryptocurrency where the coins are created by users planting trees). We want to enable EVMs ontop of the Forestcoin cryptocurrency. It looks like Burrow / SETH is the framework for doing this? Is SETH working ok? Is anyone aware of active projects with EVM's on Sawtooth? Any tips before I get my development team onto it? Thanks!

Hello, I am trying to upgrade to latest release, I was using quite old version and have some tests with providing permissions from within a contract. Now these tests are failing and I am having hard time catching up with all the changes, so maybe someone can give me a hint. The error is "UpdateAccount called in a read-only context on account  ....". I can see there is a ReadOnly option which checks for this error, but I had no issues using the Native Permissions Contract SetBase before and the stack trace leads to: execution/native/permissions.go: 129

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 06 Apr 2021 16:18:43 GMT):<br/>
@betbeb.com I'd like to be nice about this, but that issue is more of a stream-of-conciousness than a bug report. There is neither enough information to understand exactly what you have done or any reproduction. For interactive debugging sessions chat is a much better option but bear in mind we all have full-time jobs and limited times so you really need to isolate things better if we are going to be able to help.

Ideally provide a test case as part of working project that can be run with a single command, say what you expected, say what you got, explain why this is likely to be a problem with Burrow.

I can see it would be useful if we had a test case/example running against metamask, if this is something you would like to contribute then that would be great. Perhaps you could distil what you are trying to do into a minimal node js app against metamask that I could run. The easier that is for me to convert to example code to help others the more likely I am to allocate time to it.

Also please do not email me directly personally when making issues - I am aware of issues and look at them when I have time.

hey there! I'm playing with burrow for the first time and I have some doubts. I'm unable to run "burrow explore blocks". I get the following error:

`could not create BlockExplorer: %!w(*fmt.wrapError=&{could not create BlockExplorer: failed to initialize database: resource temporarily unavailable 0xc0012389a0})`

From what I could understand from the docs and code, burrow will get block data from tmdb. It seems that the default tmdb backend in my system is not available for some reason, but I can't find where and how to control my default backend db or how to debug this further. Could someone guide me? Tks a lot!!

<p><strong>ivarec</strong> (Sat, 10 Apr 2021 19:05:23 GMT):<br/>
ah, it must be some kind of lock from burrow start: if I shutdown burrow's server and run `burrow explore blocks`, it works - could someone provide some details about burrow <-> tmdb relationship?

Hi all. Apologies for using this channel to find prospective talent. I am the founder of Damascus Mile, and am looking out for folk who might have an interest in joining our team, later on in July, to help us build out a logistics platform using Burrow. It includes building a module for integrating Galileo satellite constellation GNSS signals into the blockchain records for a proof-of-location. We're funded by UK Cabinet Office. I've discussed the project with Silas, who has provided further validation of our choice of HL Project. See video that explains what we're up to: https://youtu.be/siBFd0cORwo  Please PM me if you can help.

1) Is possible to integrate burrow with indy decentralized identification blockchain?
2) Is burrow the right tool to create a voting system that uses no gas cost at all?
3) Can a smart contract be designed to allow a user that has an identification record in indi blockchain to execute certain smart contract?
4) Can I assign execution permissions to an identities hosted in indi, to execute certain smart contract?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=J7ox6YZqFWqs6MELB) 1) It depends what you mean by integrate. You can use Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) in smart contracts the same way you could use them in any other software. Take a look at: https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry/blob/develop/contracts/EthereumDIDRegistry.sol which is not Indy but implements a registry in solidity, resolver: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver

2) We currently do not charge gas (though we do set a limit to bound computation) so yes, but typically people are worried about gas on Ethereum because it costs real money. You can distributed tokens/charges as you see fit on a Burrow network, so there needn't be any practical scarcity if you prefer

3) A smart contract cannot itself make an 'external call' to another services, whether that is an API or another blockchain. You can certainly integrate them either with some middleware running as a service or via a client/user-agent that talks to both Burrow and an Indy chain. This would be the case with most (all?) other chains though.

4) Again I think the answer is 'yes' but I wonder from your questions if you are asking for some specific support of Indy in Burrow - there is no specific support, but our ed25519 keys that sign transactions are naturally DIDs so there should be a good level of inherent compatibility with Indy's identity model and Burrow accounts - which are the same concept as Ethereum accounts.

wow @silasdavis amazing... is really everything i was looking for. may thanks... I'll study a bit more from this point so I first design the general architecture and then, maybe I'll make some other questions. thanks a lot @seanyoung for pointing to  the right direction.

@silasdavis about the 3th question, I'm worried about the legitymation of the operations, the blockchain is public, the smart contracts also are,. but not sure if you can safely store data without being compromized, let's say, I create another operation in the blockchain that indicates an external service that needs to validate this operation in order to run itself, like an observable of blockchain transactions, so, if a different kind of transaction is created it means it was validated by all nodes so, the other program is sure it has to run and no one else forced the operation to run... maybe that way we can make sure a 3rth party service is running due to a legitimate blockchain transaction.

<p><strong>hackerunet</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:40:30 GMT):<br/>
middlewares, I think is not the right approach because I will still need to validate the authenticity of the requester which has to be the blockchain itself.

Hii! I'm new to burrow. I was working with burrow.js but the examples in the documentation don't seem to work. The methods in `IQueryClient` and `IQueryClient` take a class parameter as `request` but the constructors aren't exported at all and apparently there's no way to initialize request objects to pass to those methods as far as I have understood so far. Is there anything I am missing here? Really appreciate some help, thanks!

@ApoorvSingal if you take a look here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/6920af567489843bef4f515b126271915af2810c/js/src/client.ts#L116
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 15:42:38 GMT):<br/>
you can see a canonical use of the QueryClient
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 15:43:03 GMT):<br/>
the parameters are little GRPC generated objects, like `StatusParam()`
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 15:43:45 GMT):<br/>
The way to get hold of them is to import them from the proto package in the standard distribution (of burrow.js)  instantiate an instance with `new`
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 15:43:49 GMT):<br/>
does that help?

@silasdavis  Can secp256k1 reside alongside ed25519 on the same network? if yes, then can they participate in one smart contract, say ERC20 token transfer? Thanks in advance.

Hello! Is there any way to automatic create accounts with some default permissions on web3 call?
Right now i have errors like `Error 23: invalid address: CallTx to an address (44691B39D1A75DC4E0A0346CBB15E310E6ED1E86) that does not exist`

Hello Marmots.  Do any of you have strong opinions on the chat platform Hyperledger uses?  The TSC is re-examining the chat platform policy and is looking at issues reflected by this questionnaire - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TF/Community+Chat+Interview+Questions.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:30:10 GMT):<br/>
It would be great to have your opinion represented!

One more thing: the TSC quarterly report is many weeks late. Are any maintainers working on it?

Hello, did someone used the docker image of burrow and managed to connect Metamask to it ? I'm trying to use the docker image and deploy some contracts on it but RPC endpoint 127.0.0.1:26660 isn't recognize by metamask...

Hello,
I saw status of Burrow that it is dormant (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/burrow/Hyperledger+Burrow), so what would be future of the project? Will the development stop, or it is temporally?
