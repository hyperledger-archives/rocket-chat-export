{"msg":"@denis4net \n1. \na) You can add accounts by issuing a `SendTx` which will create the recipient account if it does not exist and sending a `PermissionsTx`. Both are most readily accomplished with the monax tool at the moment, see: https://monax.io/docs/documentation/pm/#epm-definition-files. But the relevant RPC endpoints are also there to be called\n\nb) The ability to mutate the validator set was relatively recently (re)introduced to Tendermint (validator bonding/unbonding had been a feature of eris-db which went on to become Burrow and Tendermint separately). I have integrated the latest Tendermint in a development branch, once stabilised with some other refactoring I'll be in a position to reintroduce validator set changes.\n\n2. \na) It is not possible to disable it, but it is possible to largely ignore it if you want - by setting large limits or zero fees.\n\nb) It exists for a mixture of vestigial reasons (it's definition is part of Ethereum and provides some level of compatibility) but also some legitimate reasons. It is the 'working fluid' of the blockchain and you have to have some of it to act as in 1a) above it provides a mechanism to create an account (really we imagine all accounts 'exist' a priori but only some have the value and permissions to act), but it also provides a mechanism to prevent infinite loops in our Turing complete machine and to limit the amount of work a (possibly bad) actor can do by controlling the amount of gas they can buy. Whereas permissions are boolean, an account's value is a tunable integer so we can give less to accounts that have no reason to use a lot, or we can meter it out over time by sending it from another account. Having said that the way Burrow prices gas and deals with fees could be improved (fees just vanish), however should you have a use for the token most of the parameters are settable. It is needed for gas consumption at the very least (so we have some termination guarantees). We could definitely think more about the concept of value/gas in a permissioned chain (how to simplify it or how to make better use of it) but frankly it just hasn't got in the way enough to be a problem for us so far.\n\n3. We plan to support a subset of web3 allowing us to use native Ethereum alternatives to legacy-contracts. However I also plan to pull legacy contracts into a monorepo comprising a minimal set of moanx-keys, legacy contracts, monax pkgs, in order to make working with upgraded Burrow easier in the medium term and so the subset we use ourselves can be maintained.\n\nWe are quite resourced constrained at the moment, with only really me working on Burrow, and we are building out our own cloud-based platform using it so it is actively receiving some love but my work is focused on our needs (which it helps hone the code base for a specific - still general purpose EVM). On the other side we are ramping up within Hyperledger - on Friday I am meeting with various people from Hyperledger - in order to get more contributions and really launch Burrow as an lean EVM execution engine that works well as a Tendermint app and a library for other chains. So you find us in something of a transitionary period. If you have an interest in using the code and would like to contribute to the upkeep of things like legacy-contracts then we are looking for maintainers and I would be glad to collaborate .","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2017-10-04T11:01:31.494Z"}

But as far as I understand is that in contrast to other Blockchains which use gas to 'pay' for transactions, hyperledger burrow uses gas just to make sure there are no infinite loops. In other blockchain technologies you need the gas to pay for the transaction while in burrow the appropriate amount of gas is distributed to the user so he can complete a transaction as long as he is permissioned to do so.

We migrated from AWS to GCE about 4 months ago, but before that we used prior versions of various charts, including what we eventually open sourced for the burrow charts.

A block contains a number of transactions. The contents of a block is encrypted and each block contains a hash of major parts. It contains also a copy of the hash of the previous block and this is the reason for the term chain. A transaction proposal is a proposal by a client application or administrator to the blockchain network community. The network community can decide to make the transaction proposal a valid transaction, or is classified as an invalid transaction. Please let us know which improvements you want to make to these two concept definitions. Thanks ","username":"SjirNijssen","ts":"2018-06-04T20:07:26.030Z"}

{"msg":"@basilji I suspect you're encountering a challenge with some of the system design considerations we've had to take into account in burrow. Namely when working asyncronously the chain will have a hard time certifying some of the transactions if they are not sent syncronously. This is because of the necessity to add the nonce of a particular account into the signed bytes that are needed by the chain. This is meant as a feature rather than a bug and is necessary to guard against replay attacks and other attacks. Functionally what happens sometimes with load tests based on asyncronously referencing a single account is that these nonces get out of order which the chain won't like. Our advice here would be to perform load testing across a range of sending accounts perhaps 20-50. we're working on some updates on both the chain side and javascript side to address some of this, the remainder of it (the hacky websockets coding) will be fixed when we finish the migration to GRPC and release burrow.js","username":"compleatang","ts":"2018-07-06T13:00:37.680Z"}

Firstly I note that the address localhost:46657 is in your file at the [RPC.TM] section but it is not in my file at the [RPC.TM] section so I change my --chain-url (I think your tutorial should include a reminder for the user to do this). But then more importantly, I note that your burrow.toml file includes a URL in the [Keys] section, but my burrow.toml file does not have a URL in the [Keys] section, instead it has the following properties: (i) GRPCServiceEnabled; (ii)  AllowBadFilePermissions; (iii) RemoteAddress; (iv)  KeysDirectory....

As an example, if I want to have a sale of widgets contract then the fact that i'm ordering widgets isn't really commercially important information. the commercially important information typically is how many widgets i'm ordering and at what price. the latter two (if I'm contemplating submitting invoices and payments via traditional systems -- something the AN is explicitly designed for) can be kept in encrypted parameters off chain, referenced by the API when it needs to trigger an invoice to be sent or a payment to be made.

{"msg":"The workflow that is kept on chain will just be the legally significant event that, e.g., an invoice was sent or the payment was received. ","username":"compleatang","ts":"2018-07-31T15:29:39.134Z"}
{"msg":"There is exposure on chain to the fact that I'm ordering widgets (while we can obfuscate what the individual process steps are doing, pattern matching is likely to be relatively easy) and *when* I'm ordering widgets.

Certain authorised key-holders can prod that piece of code and have it change its values ('knight to E5', 'perform a 1 to 10 share split', whatever). We can consume the new state of the contract by querying it or by listening for events. If you ignore the way the state is maintain (via consensus on blockchain network) you can think of it as being like any kind of centralised data store - a google sheet, facebook, a cloud accounting package.","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2018-08-29T16:56:56.050Z"}

{"msg":"@theomarshanti Hopefully all your answers are below:\n\nCan you set up a network with as many nodes as you want? Yes and no, currently there's an upper bound on Tendermint POS of 100 nodes, but below that yes.\n\nCan nodes validate? Yes, if you give them permissions to do so. \n\nCan burrow nodes run in different places? Yes, however for the same validator key that can only be running on one location currently. Tendermint is working on multi-sig for validators but currently one validator node: one key: one binary instance (running wherever you wish). One thing I'll point out that is a difference in GEth and Burrow is that Burrow has an inbuilt permission layer which makes this much easier if you don't want the whole network to be behind a VPN. \n\nCan Solidity be deploy? Yes, at Monax we deploy roughly 50k lines of Solidity a day to various burrow based networks. The network works the exact same as any GEth based network in this regard. \n\nIn general burrow is quite similar to GEth from the perspective of an application builder that's focusing on the solidity part. It's different from a network operator that is seeking to setup their network because we have Tendermint based proof of stake rather than POW and we have a permission layer which allows for you to, say, set only particular accounts that can deploy smart contracts, set other accounts that can validate but not send transactions, and whatever else you need to define for your network to operate smoothly.

Using this indirection we can layer various forms of authentication/access control on the user proxy - it could only relay transactions for a specific key, it might need a threshold number of keys, the keys it authorised may belong to a web front end or may only reside on a secure HSM\n- The T3 test network is currently running with 11/12 validators, the quorum of which belong to us (in the test network stages) the other validators are being run by our network cofounders. As we spin this network out (the testnet series is building towards a production release) we will relinquish quorum (i.e. have less than 2/3 voting power) on the network\n\nTo be clear: there is no expectation that _we_ control your keys, but the architecture is multi-layered and there is scope for users who want to interact using a traditional service account model to do so. This lives in layers above the core decentralised network, and the Monax-flavoured gateway is just one of what will hopefully be many - and ultimately will not be given any special status on the network.","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2018-08-31T09:41:17.537Z"}

We still might try and support a proxy for it against our GRPC interfaces. I'd agree with with Case though - GRPC has a huge amount of testing and generality behind it, and perhaps more importantly forces you to define you domain model aside from you implementation/RPC layer (to some extent). It's also has some efficiency (binary format) and robustness (strongly typed schema) advantages over a typical JSON-RPC implementation - though of course the quality of the implementation matters. I would imagine geth's web3 layer is pretty solid these days really, but using GRPC means we can get solid clients for _free_ across a range of services including our ETL layer, and at the same time we define our public interfaces even when used in code.","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2018-09-01T12:10:58.161Z"}

You can emit a SendTx (using transact.SendTxSync) to the account and it will be created (with default global permissions)\n\n3.

{"msg":"Question: from what I can see in the source code of burrow.js and the protobuf spec, accounts are always managed by the burrow keyserver. There's no way to just generate an account keypair locally and use it to send an already signed transaction (a \"raw transaction\" as it is called in web3) to a burrow node.

{"msg":"@JoeriExelmans thanks for you interesting questions. Vent is there to get you query-side scaling and fan-out for sure, it's worth looking at if you hit bottlenecks with simulated calls or if you want to use it for other reasons. It requires a little bit of smart contract support to emit the events it expects. Of course simulated calls can run smart contract logic - so if you need that they're probably the right solution.\n\nRegarding keys - burrow.js doesn't directly support local signing but it's should not be hard to add - burrow.js relies on delegated signing on a 'local' (for a suitable definition of local - chiefly you must secure the connection to burrow 'ambiently' - VPN, local firewall, etc - since it has your keys) burrow node. There are a couple of advantages of this 1. for cloud usage it can be easier for key management, and 2. it also uses 'mempool signing' whereby burrow tries to assign a series of sequence numbers to incoming transactions sharing the same input account. This isn't always the right thing to do but it significantly increases the throughput where you want to send a large number of transactions from the same sender (input account). Rather than getting one per block you can get hundreds. You could do something like this locally but burrow maintains a locking mechanism so that you can have multiple transaction senders. The main reason this is the default is its exactly what we need and use for our cloud based validator pools (see our work here in http://github.com/agreements-network/charts  and https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/incubator/burrow).\n\nThe RPC fully supports the possibility of local signing and you can see this in our integration tests in burrow. A final note is the way we decide whether to sign using mempool is simply when we receive a transaction with no signatories. I'm fairly sure we need to tighten this up.... We definitely need to fix this: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/899 (cc @phymbert - interesting to thing about this perhaps)","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2018-11-29T11:23:20.609Z"}
{"msg":"@silasdavis thank you very much for this detailed explanation. Indeed for cloud usage keeping the keys on the burrow node is often what you want to do anyway, and I'm well aware of the difficulty of assigning the right sequence numbers to simultaneous transactions. I think a keyserver with proper locking is a good solution, although perhaps too restricting in some rare cases.","username":"JoeriExelmans","ts":"2018-11-29T12:55:12.835Z"}
{"msg":"The way you describe Vent sounds very much like a similar caching solution that I once developed for Ethereum.

While the experiment was running, at some point new transactions no longer completed (from burrow.js perspective), probably because the experiment kept submitting (too many?) transactions in too small amount of time (also it was running on a shared machine where other people are also doing CPU intensive stuff sometimes). I did not notice this because I left the experiment running unattended. But the results could still interest you. I'm running the experiment again but this time with only half the \"load\" as last time.","username":"JoeriExelmans","ts":"2018-12-05T14:17:05.197Z"}

In any event, to get your node started however use the `--config` flag (short flag `-c` with your `genesis.toml` that you've generated). The `-g` or `--genesis` flag only works on a genesis.json which has been produced by `burrow configure` with the `--separate-genesis-doc` or `-w` flag.

{"msg":"Question: I understand that an event's Index is relative to the event's transaction Index, which is relative to the block height (right?). Unlike standard ethereum where the log index is relative to the block. Then why does a GRPC response to GetEvents not include the transaction index? When receiving an event this way, it's not possible to know if it happened before or after some point in blockchain (where a \"point in blockchain\" is a tuple (event index, tx index, block height). My current workaround is to use GetTxs instead of GetEvents.","username":"JoeriExelmans","ts":"2019-01-14T09:18:22.426Z"}

{"msg":"@dileban hopefully the link Kelly posted gives a broader context and helps on the question of differentiation, on some of your other points:\n\nEEA spec compliance is currently a non-goal of Burrow. However we did recently add support for the web3 JSON RPC which opens us up to Ethereum tooling. There are groups of users of Ethereum-using projects (some of whom I met here: https://runevm.com/) who see more value in implementing unbundled components from Ethereum and do not wish to sit directly on mainnet. Burrow is more aligned with this - we want to offer core EVM language compatibility but also be open to extension without dragging along the worst bits of Ethereum architecture. We also do our consensus and p2p through Tendermint - so supporting DEVP2P is unlikely to be something we'd ever want to do. ","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2019-11-11T10:32:12.584Z"}

We did have a build on ARM set up a few years ago by an intern which would be possible to resurrect if that is useful for IoT devices for example. I don't know much about the state of the Go runtime on embedded hardware other than people are doing it. The other thing that we want to get out there is as light-client RPC layer - like what we have now but that transmits a proof with results. That will require a bit of a work to set up but means your clients at the edge can get the verified state without running a full node - it's always been in the backlog pretty much forever, just needs the impetus from someone wanting to use/build it.\n\nThere might be an angle with the Avalon here - as a distribution means for the state hash for example - though no collaboration has started yet.","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2019-11-11T10:43:14.689Z"}

In the past I spent a ton of time writing a project before talking to people about it and wasted a bunch of energy on software no one really cared about until much later. This time I am talking about it a lot more before I get my hands dirty with the code. I have a single node deployed now I play with and am about to re-design some of my hardware which will start talking to it. Should be an interesting winter.

Is there any update or ETA on this functionality if that's ok to ask ? \n\nAnd if I understand this correctly, it would mean that communicating with other blockchains part of the Cosmos Network would simply be done by emitting and receiving those transactions ?\n\nThanks !","username":"Kvykv","ts":"2020-03-09T13:36:46.106Z"}

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=J7ox6YZqFWqs6MELB) 1) It depends what you mean by integrate. You can use Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) in smart contracts the same way you could use them in any other software. Take a look at: https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry/blob/develop/contracts/EthereumDIDRegistry.sol which is not Indy but implements a registry in solidity, resolver: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver\n\n2) We currently do not charge gas (though we do set a limit to bound computation) so yes, but typically people are worried about gas on Ethereum because it costs real money. You can distributed tokens/charges as you see fit on a Burrow network, so there needn't be any practical scarcity if you prefer\n\n3) A smart contract cannot itself make an 'external call' to another services, whether that is an API or another blockchain. You can certainly integrate them either with some middleware running as a service or via a client/user-agent that talks to both Burrow and an Indy chain. This would be the case with most (all?) other chains though.\n\n4) Again I think the answer is 'yes' but I wonder from your questions if you are asking for some specific support of Indy in Burrow - there is no specific support, but our ed25519 keys that sign transactions are naturally DIDs so there should be a good level of inherent compatibility with Indy's identity model and Burrow accounts - which are the same concept as Ethereum accounts.","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2021-07-19T07:42:48.247Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=J7ox6YZqFWqs6MELB","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow?msg=J7ox6YZqFWqs6MELB","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

{"msg":"middlewares, I think is not the right approach because I will still need to validate the authenticity of the requester which has to be the blockchain itself.","username":"hackerunet","ts":"2021-07-19T13:40:30.103Z"}

{"msg":"Hii! I'm new to burrow. I was working with burrow.js but the examples in the documentation don't seem to work. The methods in `IQueryClient` and `IQueryClient` take a class parameter as `request` but the constructors aren't exported at all and apparently there's no way to initialize request objects to pass to those methods as far as I have understood so far. Is there anything I am missing here? Really appreciate some help, thanks!","username":"ApoorvSingal","ts":"2021-08-15T17:35:03.396Z"}
