I removed the github action, that we anyway don't use
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:46:20 GMT):<br/>
added one to delete old non-protected branches (older than 2 month)
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/actions/runs/304605830

fine?
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:51:35 GMT):<br/>
There are quite some protected branches , mainly from me when I worked with the github UI. But I don't have the right to unprotect them... any idea @choeppler ?
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:48:37 GMT):<br/>
Morning @vi-fu , I just talked to @domwoe
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:49:45 GMT):<br/>
He will set-up a meeting for tomorrow with the three of us...
Meanwhile  you could look at this issue

</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:58:33 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>choeppler</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 10:13:22 GMT):<br/>
I'll ping Ry and ask him how he wants us to deal with such issues. 
Just to clarify the specific case at hand: you'd like to un-protect all branches but the master branch, wouldn't you?
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 10:22:31 GMT):<br/>
ok cool, thanks

<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 11:54:41 GMT):<br/>
do we have to configure this on our test ledger to be able to test it?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:00:14 GMT):<br/>
I'd rather spin up a local ledger with the appropriate config (https://github.com/bcgov/von-network)
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:19:37 GMT):<br/>
looks  a bit complicated 
why not adding taa but with "taa_required": false
would this do any harm?
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:20:03 GMT):<br/>
I meen to our test ledger

@tkuhrt Hi Tracy , could you helm us with something please?
I'm trying to add a github action which automatically deploys a helm chart to the git hub page if our repository.
(see also https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action)

This is currently failing because of these errors
```
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/gh-pages.        
remote: error: Required status check "DCO" is expected.   
```
See https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/runs/1354012638?check_suite_focus=true

Could you configure the `gh-pages` branch to allow pushes from the CI user without "DCO", please?

The CI user is using the secret "secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN"  which contains a GitHub  access token with repo scope.
I can also create one from my personal account and send it to you, if that helps

Thanks in advance!
</p>

Hi - I think it should work now. I also enabled "allow branch deletion" so someone could clean up all of the old branches. https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/branches
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 08:11:03 GMT):<br/>
Thanks guys for your quick help :-)
Will try it out later...

@rjones , the release action seems to work now.
I configured it do a helm chart release on pushed to release branches (release/**)

What is not yet working is the URL to the git hub page for our repo.
The default URL is this one. 
http(s)://<organization>.github.io/<repository>
...in our case:
https://hyperledger-labs.github.io/business-partner-agent/index.yaml

If I try thus URL , there is a redirect happening, because Hyperledger labs has  probably some other URL configured.

Could you check what is configured in the settings of business partner agent repo under "GitHub Pages", please?

TAA is fixed now... yeah. UI looks really nice , thanks to @vi-fu
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Fri, 06 Nov 2020 14:23:10 GMT):<br/>
there is still one small thing:
if the frontend is open and the backend is reloaded with a new endpoint -> in this case without reload the popup asking for the TAA and triggering the endpoint change will not appear
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Fri, 06 Nov 2020 14:23:44 GMT):<br/>
I assume that's fine for you, because you anyway love reloading , correct ;-)

<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:53:15 GMT):<br/>
Hey. I see that the compose files are now in a separate directory. How is this supposed to work now? Also the paths in the Dockerfile are still the old ones, as Docker cannot access files that are outside the directory structure like ../something this looks broken to me now.

</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:21:21 GMT):<br/>
We saws this on vitalys machine as well
i move the Dockerfile to the root of the repo again. And change the build context in compose files to ".."
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:23:23 GMT):<br/>
It's also possible to use docker, docker-compose from the root and specify the file with -f. The context is then relative to where you started the command not where the file lives
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:24:10 GMT):<br/>
but the scripts won't work
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:24:37 GMT):<br/>
or ?
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:25:34 GMT):<br/>
Let's move it , not?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:27:02 GMT):<br/>
mh the env file also needs to be in root I think
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:27:27 GMT):<br/>
I don't think so
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:27:44 GMT):<br/>
the env file should be there where you start the scripts
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:27:47 GMT):<br/>
not?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:28:34 GMT):<br/>
you need to start the scripts from the root. Otherwise you get the problem @etschelp described
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:29:02 GMT):<br/>
not if I move the dockerfile and change the context

<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:30:11 GMT):<br/>
mh ok, feels also a bit strange. I'd suggest we look at few well known projecrs an look how they handle it :)
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:34:16 GMT):<br/>
I also renamed the docker folder to "scripts" , then it make totally sense to me
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:35:01 GMT):<br/>
Docker build should be anyway independent of the compose-stuff
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:17:12 GMT):<br/>
ok. now we have to have our .env in the scripts folder?
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:18:28 GMT):<br/>
yes. it belongs to the compose scripts ,not?
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:19:33 GMT):<br/>
we can also call the folder docker-compose-plus-shell-scripts-setup :laughing:
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:20:19 GMT):<br/>
yes, fine. Does it make a difference if I do cd scripts && ./start-with-tunnels.sh or ./scripts/start-with-tunnels.sh ?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:20:36 GMT):<br/>
alos https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/tree/master/scripts still has "docker" folder in README
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:21:50 GMT):<br/>
yes it makes a difference, the "context"
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:22:40 GMT):<br/>
the readme I can fix if we agree - at least for the time beeing - on the structure
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:24:52 GMT):<br/>
./scripts/start-with-tunnels.sh   does not make much sense if the related readme is in ./scripts, not?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:25:42 GMT):<br/>
For the first time usage yes, then no :) But I'm fine with it
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:29:59 GMT):<br/>
OK, I change the context to "." again and check the docu.
all fine
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:43:50 GMT):<br/>
It does not work  like that @domwoe

Maybe you where not in the mail... The new infra is up and ready, but the domain is not yet pointing to it
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Mon, 16 Nov 2020 09:04:54 GMT):<br/>
meanwhile you can reach our stuff via another domain ,

@etschelp @domwoe , do we have to redeploy the bank?
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Mon, 16 Nov 2020 10:39:32 GMT):<br/>
it probably needs the uniresolver currently only on https://resolver.eot.cardamom.ninja/

<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Mon, 16 Nov 2020 11:04:34 GMT):<br/>
@etschelp  Is there an easy fix to this? The Agency UI does not allow to change the resolver

<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Mon, 16 Nov 2020 11:05:54 GMT):<br/>
the dependency on the uni resolver really sucks

I have pushed my current state to the custom documents branch. One of the biggest changes is that the only place where there is a credential type is when creating documents. There are only two types ORGANIZATIONAL_PROFILE_CREDENTIAL and SCHEMA_BASED. e.g. post a new document:

{
  "type": "SCHEMA_BASED",
  "schemaId": "M6Mbe3qx7vB4wpZF4sBRjt:2:bank_account:1.0",
  "isPublic": true,
  "label": "Foo",
  "document": {"iban": "FR7630006000011234567890189", "bic":"AGRIFRPP"}
}

I also added validation that checks the document against the schema, also schema based documents always need to have a schema id. Instead of a type I added a typeLabel field to the response so that you already have a human readable type in the UI.

 {
    "id": "b82acc4a-aaef-4f09-a880-431d02ae8ed9",
    "createdDate": 1606400408197,
    "updatedDate": 1606400408197,
    "type": "SCHEMA_BASED",
    "typeLabel": "Bank Account",
    "schemaId": "M6Mbe3qx7vB4wpZF4sBRjt:2:bank_account:1.0",
    "isPublic": true,
    "label": "Foo",
    "documentData": {
      "bic": "AGRIFRPP",
      "iban": "FR7630006000011234567890189"
    }
  }

I have pushed my current state to the custom documents branch. One of the biggest changes is that the only place where there is a credential type is when dealing with documents. There are only two types now ORGANIZATIONAL_PROFILE_CREDENTIAL and SCHEMA_BASED. e.g. post a new document based on a bank account schema:

{
  "type": "SCHEMA_BASED",
  "schemaId": "M6Mbe3qx7vB4wpZF4sBRjt:2:bank_account:1.0",
  "isPublic": true,
  "label": "Foo",
  "document": {"iban": "FR7630006000011234567890189", "bic":"AGRIFRPP"}
}

I also added validation that checks the document data against the schema attributes on the ledger, so it is not possible to send attributes that do not belong to a schema. Also schema based documents always need to have a schema id set. Instead of a type I added a typeLabel field to the response so that you already have a human readable type in the UI.

 {
    "id": "b82acc4a-aaef-4f09-a880-431d02ae8ed9",
    "createdDate": 1606400408197,
    "updatedDate": 1606400408197,
    "type": "SCHEMA_BASED",
    "typeLabel": "Bank Account",
    "schemaId": "M6Mbe3qx7vB4wpZF4sBRjt:2:bank_account:1.0",

    "documentData": {
      "bic": "AGRIFRPP",
      "iban": "FR7630006000011234567890189"
    }
  }
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 26 Nov 2020 14:53:10 GMT):<br/>
The next step would be that I also add the typeLabel to credentials. With a default to the schemaName when no matching schema was found locally. Also I noticed that the uniresolver now returns a did document in a different format ,so public profile validation is currently broken, but I fixed the verification method in the public profile.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 26 Nov 2020 14:53:50 GMT):<br/>
The next biggest change is that the rest api now uses schemaId instead of credential type, e.g. when filtering partners that can issue a credential.

@etschelp @vi-fu I've an issue with the typeLabel for VCs. I'm not totally sure if this is an issue because I'v legacy data in my BPA, but I've VCs with schemaId 8faozNpSjFfPJXYtgcPtmJ:2:commercialregister:1.2 and I've registered that schema with label "Credential Registry Entry" but the typeLabel is set to "commercialregister". Unfortunately I can't issue a new commercial registry entry at the moment because Open Corporates API blocks us currently...
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 14:39:22 GMT):<br/>
currently the following schema id is configured for the commercial register: 3gLVpb3i5jzvZqWYyesSB3:2:commercialregister:1.2. if the schema is not configured the fallback is to use the schema name.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 14:40:31 GMT):<br/>
you can always register a new schema in the settings
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 14:46:16 GMT):<br/>
As written, I've registered it in the settings. But the schema and the VCs already existed in the database before I switched to the custom documents branch. So I guess the issue is related to this.

Hi folks, I've just built & started up the business partner demo on my local as per the docker compose steps (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/tree/master/scripts) and I was wondering if there were any other docs about setting up multiple business partner agents and connecting them?  I'm not sure what is the next step once I have a business partner agent running?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 20:48:02 GMT):<br/>
Also I was wondering about the mechanism used to share public documents between business partners?  Is it using a shared database, or messaging protocols between agents, or ... ?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 07:43:48 GMT):<br/>
Hi @ianco setting up multiple business partners is better done using k8s and the provided helm chart. See https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/tree/master/charts/bpa#install-multiple-bpa-instances

@choeppler Regarding docker image , I mailed with @rjones . We will use github docker image registry.
There are already some examples in hyperledger projects.
I will probably  switch our build engine from azure devops to to github actions which we anyway use already for some other things.
Not sure if I find time today, but next week this is on my agenda

I managed to get 2 business partner agents running locally, with a local universal resolver (pointing to the BC Gov bcovrin ledger), scripts and configs are on this PR:  https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/pull/333

Curious about how to setup schemas and so forth ...
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 18:41:14 GMT):<br/>
For example this demo scenario is relying on a previously setup "bank" with some kind of "account schema":  https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/blob/master/demo.md

What are the steps to setup new schemas for a BPA?
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 19:57:01 GMT):<br/>
how do we change the business partner application to use a different schema id? I tried editing the application.yml file, but I cannot build the docker image. is there a way to do it with the existing docker image?
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 19:57:10 GMT):<br/>
the error I get is ```[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:3.1.2:go-offline (default-cli) on project business-partner-agent: org.eclipse.aether.resolution.DependencyResolutionException: Could not find artifact org.hyperledger:aries-client-python:jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT -> [Help 1]```

<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:40:56 GMT):<br/>
The easiest way to add schemas is to do this over the UI. You can add them under Settings/Schema Settings. Concerning the error, that one should not prevent the image from building. Is there more in the logs? But whats probably easier is to use the images we have available on GitHub and directly set -> image: ghcr.io/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent:edge in the compose file.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:50:32 GMT):<br/>
The second way to add schemas is to bootstrap them via property overwrites. So you could add them as JAVA_OPTS like this:

`-Dbpa.schemas.myschema1.id=Schema id like it is on the ledger
-Dbpa.schemas.myschema1.label=UI label
-Dbpa.schemas.myschema1.defaultAttributeName=Default values that should be displayed toplevel in the UI. e.g if your schema has a attribute foo then you could set foo here`

@etschelp thanks for the tips. I was able to get the schemas I wanted into my running app (through the UI), I do like the JAVA_OPTS, easier to document for other devs. I was using the ghcr...edge image, but that doesn't take into account changes I make to local code, so I needed to build an image with my local code.  The error didn't seem to prevent the image from running.  But is concerning that building the docker image didn't work (100%) for me.  Is there a better way to integrate changes from my local code to the compose file?
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:16:35 GMT):<br/>
I could not use the JAVA_OPTS to override the bank-account or credentialregistry ids, and I also tried adding new ones in as suggested, but slightly different failure.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:17:32 GMT):<br/>
Using `-Dbpa.schemas.bank-account.id=myschemaid` get this: `Error: Unable to access jarfile Account`
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:18:21 GMT):<br/>
Using `-Dbpa.schemas.mynewschema.id=mynewschemaid` get this: ```bpa-2_1             | Error: Could not find or load main class Account
bpa-2_1             | Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Account```
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:19:13 GMT):<br/>
So I've had to rebuild locally to change the bank-account schema id - I am using an env var to set it.  ```  schemas:
    #test ledger schemas, can be overwritten / extended when e.g. working with other ledger
    bank-account:
      id: ${BPA_SCHEMA_BANK_ID}
      label: "Bank Account"
      defaultAttributeName: "iban"
```
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 14:17:31 GMT):<br/>
you could try building the jar without docker and then building the container from it afterwards. so on the cli this would be:

cd backend
mvn clean package -Pbuild-frontend
mvn docker:build

After that you would switch the image in the .env file:

BPA_DOCKER_IMAGE=bds/business-partner-agent:latest

Generally the failure you mentioned earlier should not break the docker build. But hopefully the root cause can be spotted better like that.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 15:30:15 GMT):<br/>
The first one happens if there is a space somewhere in the property like "Bank Account". Unfortunately docker-compose behaves strangely here so escaping  the yaml way does not work. The only workaround is to write "Bank_Account" or "Bank-Account" instead.

I can not reproduce the second error, but it seems related to the first one.

Adding a new env var is a workaround for the bank account schema. If you want to set different schemas -D java opts are more flexible.

Hello, I'm working with @usingetechnology on a neighbouring issue. 

When establishing a connection two agent register their didâ€™s on the ledger, and BPA1 gets BPA2â€™s public did out of band and tries to initialize a connection. That connection invitation has a my_did and their_did, neither of which are the public DID (they are private to that one connection)

BPA1 saves a controller level entry in postgres that has the targetâ€™s public DID because itâ€™s coded to do that (i think).

However BPA2 only has the connection invitation to work from, and saves the connections private DID in the same way that BPA1 saved the public DID.

so the Initiator (BPA1) properly holds the targets public did, but the responder incorrectly saves the connection their_did as the public DID , which appears to be causing some issues. 

Is this a known issue, is there something that would help find the Public DID of the initiator as the responder?
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 09:37:10 GMT):<br/>
Hey. Yes this is a known "issue". The initiating controller knows the public did of the other agent through the rest call and can store this information. On the aca-py level the connection is based on (private) peer did's only. We also asked on the aca-py channel if it is possible to display public did's in the agents connection information, and it will be implemented sometime in the future. 

Currently we implemented two workarounds in the controller:

1. You can set the did in aca-py's label e.g. --label did:sov:xxx:123:MyLabel Then this information becomes theirLabel in the connection event and the receiving controller can use this information to resolve the public profile of the initiating agent.

2. We have a special credential type called commercial register that has a did attribute which we will then use to resolve the partners public profile. This is something the initiating controller would do. Meaning after establishing the connection it would send a commercial register presentation. This is currently not automated so one has to do this via the UI.

Hello again, thanks for the support getting this up and running. Have you been able to setup remote debugging inside the docker container? 

I've added the following java_opt (and exposed the port) to the docker-compose and have been trying to remote connect with jdb `$ jdb -attach localhost:1044` or VSCode's `Debugger for Java` extension. (launch.json config)
```
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "java",
            "name": "Attach to Remote Program",
            "request": "attach",
            "hostName": "localhost",
            "port": 1044
        }   
    ]
```

The option appears to be recognised properly as the application is waiting for the debugger to attach 
```bpa1_1            | Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 1044```
but I haven't had success yet.

I'm wondering if you guys have. Thanks so much!

I got it to work with the following three steps:

in docker-compose.yml add the following to java_opts:

-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:1044

ports:
  - 1044:1044

Then run 

jdb -sourcepath ./src/main/java -attach 1044

Have you set address=*:1044? As this is for Java version > 9. Just setting the port works, but you wont be able to connect.

I've got the helm templates generating the acapy wallet seed as a secret and having that consumed as an environment variable, it also auto registers it self on the indy ledger on first startup. Do you have interest in that behaviour?

It was great to watch those helm charts in action today.  Seeing a new BPA start up in ~20seconds during a live demo was very cool.
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 11:33:57 GMT):<br/>
what came to my mind: 
would be great to generate the password for the BPA login as well, same way.
I just have to check if that also works with GitOps (we use Flux 2 here for our demo deployments)
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 11:42:50 GMT):<br/>
I think the Gitops way would be something like this:
1) generate the secrets with a commandline tool or so (seed, password)
2) encrypt secrets with commandline tool, e.g. SOPS
3) check in the encrypted secretes in git
4) reference the secrets in the helm release or in the templates

Registering the agent on the ledger on first start would be anyway great.

That sounds great my only hesitation is that a secret with the seed is created and it works great.
.
However when `helm uninstall` is run. The PVC is left behind on purpose, but the secret is destroyed. If `helm install` is run again, a new seed is generated, but the wallet has the original seed. Which causes the app to crash on startup
.
Do you have an idea of resolving this? Can you configure the helm charts to NOT uninstall a certain item?

Hi, we discussed updating Aries cloud agent wrapper(https://github.com/boschresearch/aries-acapy-clients/tree/main/java), then integrating that updated library into BPA before we begin adding new features. Some changes are already happening, with the addition of multi-tenancy and `/present-proof/records/{pres_ex_id}/credentials` endpoint. I guess the first thing to decide is what version of ace-py will be run and what this library will be wrapping.  I don't know all the changes that have happened between 5.6 and 6 (hopefully none of the requests and/or responses have changed, just new calls and functionality added). From what I can see documented as implemented, I have listed out the act-py 6.0 api calls that are not implemented in the wrapper. I think we can prioritize them fairly easily, and focus on any deal with connections, credentials, proofs and schemas. I suppose we can stay with issue-credential 1.0 for now unless advised to migrate to 2.0?

Concerning the v2 protocols. I'd actually think this would be worth  putting on the roadmap because I think JSON-LD Credentials are very useful in B2B settings. Also I think it would be useful to be able to "request a document", i.e. self-attested data following a specific schema. I think https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange which can be used with the v2 protocols would better fit this use case in comparison to in the indy proof request format
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 16:16:03 GMT):<br/>
no, we don't need all the apis implemented yet, certainly all the credential and issue-credentials. and present-proofs are top priority. i think it would be worthwhile for all the methods to be implemented so that there is a java interface for other developers (not just in the bpa app)

I have created the endpoints with the highest priority. The long term goal is to switch this manual process to swagger-codegen, but as aca-py's swagger.json is not always up to date this can not be done so easily. I therefore created a ticket in the aca-py repo to collect all discrepancies that i find. When I have the time I will setup codegen and will continue with the endpoints of lower priority while collecting issues in the ticket. I hope there will be some help from the community, because this is more work than one can handle alone. On Monday I will merge my changes to the client and then start the BPA upgrade.

quick update before you start your week. we've put in a few small pull requests, no significant functionality changes except I put in a PR that allows editing the DID of a business partner in the application. This is expected to be removed when we can sort out a proper way to have both sides of the partner connection work. There is another PR that is only in our fork for my local development, if you want it, I can make a PR into the hyperledger repo. https://github.com/bcgov/b2b-credential-manager/pull/6

Looking forward to the meeting tomorrow (morning for BC, afternoon for EU). we've addressed some changes to PRs. I've closed one of mine and added a new one that contains only that feature (the frontend/backend paths). Still not sure about the DID update one, couldn't quite figure out your workarounds, that is something we can touch on tomorrow. I started in on create schema (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/tree/feature/create-schema) that is based on phillip (much appreciated) PR with the updates to the acapy client.

So I've added an issue (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/issues/385) and we will be working on that in parallel with bring a few of our custom features into the HLL repo.

The reason we pivoted was because connecting to a personal wallet is being talked about a lot by a number of key stakeholders. So this capability would be very timely to be able to demonstrate soon.

<p><strong>matthewhall78</strong> (Fri, 16 Apr 2021 17:15:34 GMT):<br/>

@etschelp and maybe @ianco 

I'm working on connecting my phone, with a trinsic wallet to the BPA.

I'm generating a connection-invitation through the bpa's acapy admin api, turning into a QR code, and scanning it in the app (setting the service name to be the url of the ngrok tunnel).

First issue i ran into was this line expecting a 'theirLabel' from the ConnectionRecord? Is this connectionRecord in line with an aca-py artifact or is it custom? https://github.com/boschresearch/aries-acapy-clients/blob/main/java/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/aries/api/connection/ConnectionRecord.java

2nd blocking issue is that there isn't a did resolver on that ledger (http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io), which i am forced to use because the trinsic app has a fixed list of ledgers. I am getting the connection-request from the phone to the BPA, but it's sitting in 'invitation' and won't complete because the BPA can't find a public profile. 

It is also assuming that there is going to be a public profile for it to look at. which will not be the case for other aca-py wallet applications, we will need to make that not required for connection. 

a) we could make these 'Business Partners' a different data object, that behave differently

b) We could also add some application.yml flag of 'allow_all_acapy_connections' or something like that, that doesn't make the did resolution/public-profile a requirement for connection. 

Still investigating and work in non-bpa connection into the handlers, just want to raise this incase there is background knowledger that would help. 

Have a great weekend, I'm off Monday, so first thing i'll do is see you guys early Tuesday morning.

have started in on issuer code, added in create schema/cred def, currently found under the Settings. When we have a little more issuer functionality, we will move that to specific area of the application (like Partner or Wallet).

<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 15:57:44 GMT):<br/>
I might not totally be getting all these questions, but...

1. There is a field theirLabel on the ConnectionRecord https://github.com/boschresearch/aries-acapy-clients/blob/fc3db20787d09da1c572da6c560643f0e192bfe8/java/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/aries/api/connection/ConnectionRecord.java#L33

Usually I'm creating the invitation like ```aries.connectionsCreateInvitation(
                CreateInvitationRequest.builder().recipientKeys(List.of()).build(),
                    CreateInvitationParams.builder().autoAccept(Boolean.TRUE).build());```

So there is no need to set an additional endpoint, because aca-py already uses the one that was provided as the startup parameter, and i then simply convert the invite url into the qr code.

2. bpa should already be able to open aca-py to aca-py connections (without a public profile) in both directions. especially the incoming side does not care. The only time it does a lookup is if the partners label is a did. If it is then this might be the issue, then the only thing that is needed is an exception handler in the lookup.

Does the Bosch team have a team page that I could refer to when tell other folks in BC Gov who we are working with?  I got a few questions, like, "which Bosch? Thee Bosch?".   Also do you have a Product Vision document?  I got a question, "What is Bosch hoping to achieve with this BPA software?"

Hi @matthewhall78  , good question
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 08:23:47 GMT):<br/>
we started to create a website for BPA. I will get back to Moritz asking how far we are with that.
In general we work in a Bosch Project called "Economy of Things", where SSI / BPA... is one topic but there are others as well like "Decentralized Marketplaces" , and so on.
Will get back to you
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:17:32 GMT):<br/>
some config in the bpa is strange not. 
I was not able to push to a branch from @Jsyro  and even not to one created on my own ( feature/helm-agent-secrets )
seems to be protected?

@frank-bee OK I changed it a little
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 22:05:03 GMT):<br/>
quick update, using trinsic and bpa, can connect (agent can connect just fine), and iâ€™ve sent a credential from bpa to trinsic - all good. seems like trinsic either doesnâ€™t fully follow the protocols or is on a different version of aca-py? example. connection is ok on phone, but agent says it is state=received until i send a message from my phone to the agent (which is accepted just fine), after that, agent connection state=active. similarly, when i issue a credential, then trinsic asks me to accept or decline, when i accept, the agent cred exchange stays at credential_issued - it doesnâ€™t get the credential_acked back from the phone. now, some of this could be the wacky networking right now (seeing a lot of unprocessable message errors on the phone), but perhaps not. anyway, progress.

<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 22:47:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm tired after IIW so don't take my word, but this might be because ACA-Py expects a "Ping" after creating a connection to change the state to established. Probably Trinsic does not send a ping and so it stays in "received" until another message is received
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 22:49:34 GMT):<br/>
yes, makes sense. the state was active after i sent a message from phone to agent.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 22:50:25 GMT):<br/>
the credential not getting acked is strange.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 10:10:22 GMT):<br/>
yes. if --auto-ping-connection is not set the connection will not become active.

One thing I realized : Do we always assume the bpa and the acapy is reachable from outside via http*s* only?
This is hard-coded right now I assume:
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/blob/master/charts/bpa/templates/bpa_configmap.yaml#L14
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 12:32:02 GMT):<br/>
at least for the acapy
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 12:33:05 GMT):<br/>
@etschelp , for the bpa is this figured out at runtime ?
in the config we only give the hostname , no protocol for the public profile
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/blob/master/charts/bpa/templates/bpa_configmap.yaml#L20

yes - it is protected for DCO signoff
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:21:40 GMT):<br/>
ah ok, I thought the DCO signoff check is only running when merging / pushing to the master branch .
This would allow to create feature branches with missing signoffs ( which seems to happen in some situations) and do the signoff when merging the PR
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:23:14 GMT):<br/>
DCO signoff basically has to be in each commit, right? what about auto-generated merge messages ( maybe we have had one of those in the branch)?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:27:26 GMT):<br/>
each commit - auto merges don't need signoff
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:29:06 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks for you help. we'll ensure /observe this
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:29:48 GMT):<br/>
sure. it's easier to fork the repo to your account, then you can force-push or whatever, and your PRs will auto-update
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:32:12 GMT):<br/>
good hint , we'll discuss this with our friends from BCGov . maybe either they can give us access to their private repo or vice versa ( in case we work together on a feature branch)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:33:40 GMT):<br/>
if you fork the public one to your account, you don't need anyone's say so

The DCO check doesn't not appear to be working for me at all, i branched, made a commit, pushed one commit,  success. Make a second commit, can't push because of expected DCO.

No auto-merging, same git client, same settings.

Have PR for issuing credential. This is kind of a placeholder, as we build out the issuance functions, a lot of the components will be built out to support that.  For now, just putting it under Partner and basing the components on existing ones (re-use where possible). I've tracked the issuance in a new table `bpa_credential_exchange`, i know there is a `my_credential` table but that seems to be more about what is actually in the wallet and profile.  https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/pull/389

Quick update about the Issue Credential and persistence of Credential Exchange records. We had discussed not duplicating data that is available through aca-py. By default, aca-py (wallet) does not persist credential exchange data once a credential exchange is terminated (the credential is issued), so, if BPA wanted to review the credentials it issued, that needs to be stored in our BPA database. There is no redundancy. We could turn the flags on to store permanantly, or a limited amount of data (which would be useful for revocation), or the default (store nothing).  I think we stay with BPA storing the data so we can easily track what was issued etc. The bonus of that is the relationships to Partner and Schema and Cred Def objects, so we don't have to query aca-py, then for each cred ex, lookup the schema, cred def, and partner in the database. I will be making the other changes @etschelp suggested in the PR, but will keep with persistence in the bpa db.

@etschelp @domwoe  - when we commit to the repo, there are a lot of jobs running (pmd, license check, spotbugs) and some external ones (lgtm) - how are you running those locally? do you have anything setup on your local development machines to replicate what happens on push to github?
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Tue, 11 May 2021 10:37:27 GMT):<br/>
Before pushing I usually run ```mvn clean install``` which runs all those checks locally.

Does anyone at Bosch know if this project (https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/hotel-check-in-kuenftig-per-id-wallet-moeglich-1914612) was done using the BPA?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 18 May 2021 06:02:59 GMT):<br/>
We are participating in this project as an employer issuing corporate IDs to employees. We currently don't use the BPA since currently only issuer capabilities to personal wallets are used and we needed a self-service for employees with Azure AD integration. However, it's a service built of the same pieces (ACA-Py, Java Client, Micronaut, Vue).

After many of edits, PR 407 is ready for review. I was never able to find a way of writing tests I was happy with and I think we should look into build better testing infrastructures around factories so object creation is as easy as possible.

we can reference another repo at least by including the repository before the name like kneath/example-project#42

but seeing the issues of the other (helm) repo in our backlog / project would be better

We should find  some kind of release process and agree on some versioning , maybe tonight.

Proposal:
- we have to used semantic versioning for charts anyway
- we could  use minor changes for "releases") the time being : 0.1, 0.2,....  (because we are still are in a general alpha environment where e.g. APIs change)
- for untested releases we could e.g. add `-alpha.XX`

will document it when  working on the issue...
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 15:19:49 GMT):<br/>
I  bumped the current chart version ( which is somehow tested ) to 0.3.0
And asked @usingetechnology to use 0.4.0-alpha01 for the changes in his  PR ( and ideally create a new bpa docker image with 0.4.0-alpha01 and use that in appVersion).
As soon as we tested  0.4.0-alphaXX a bit we can release 0.4.0 (latest at the end of this sprint)
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 18:06:48 GMT):<br/>
i've updated the chart version, but didn't update the appVersion, wasn't sure when we were ready to create a github release.
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 02 Jun 2021 13:35:08 GMT):<br/>

Versioning is now simpler , even the git tags for the bpa a just x.x.x ( semantic versioning)
So we can do it like this for chart and bpa image / appVersion:

`0.3.0-alpha04` (current version)
`0.3` (first "stable release")
`0.4.0-alpha01` (untested new version)
`0.4.0-alpha02`
`0.4` (new release)
`0.4.1` (urgent bug fix)

as discussed in our weekly meeting. here is a demo video that i put together.  this is for a non-technical person that wanted to understand their role in the overall flow. they would be acting strictly as a verifier, and wanted to see what they would do to connect to a mining company and then get proof that the mining company meets certain criterion: is a BC registered business, has a BC mining permit, the mine has a verified TSM (Towards Sustainable Mining) certificate from a 3rd party (Pricewaterhouse Coopers).  There are some times when there is no english audio, but that is because the Japanese audio would still be running. https://www.dropbox.com/s/mw2qlsg22u80eus/mitsubishi-demo-english.mp4?dl=0

<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 15:47:58 GMT):<br/>
@usingetechnology one idea:
maybe you can add your value files ( examples ) to be linted 

see [docu](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing/blob/main/doc/ct_lint.md)
```
Charts may have multiple custom values files matching the glob pattern '*-values.yaml' in a directory named 'ci' in the root of the chart's directory. The chart is linted for each of these files. If no custom values file is present, the chart is linted with defaults.
```
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 16:22:17 GMT):<br/>
ok, frank, just reviewing, trying to see impact on our deployments.  i will run it against openshift and see how it goes.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 18:08:28 GMT):<br/>
looks good @frank-bee, just rolled out a couple of instances in one of our namespaces. One thing that I noticed was that `helm upgrade` will set new values and configuration but will not redeploy. I don't know how you are planning to handle this through kubeapps, and we do not have a pipeline yet, so unsure how we will do it in the future... but I used the following commands to install a BPA, then change some configuration and redeploy only the BPA (not the agent).  ```helm upgrade kc2 bpa -f bpa/values-kc.yaml \
--install \
--set schemas.enabled=true \
--set "bpa.podAnnotations.timestamp=$(date)" \
--set "acapy.podAnnotations.timestamp=$(date)"
```
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 18:09:01 GMT):<br/>
So that installs if not exists, and sets some timestamps for the agent deployment and the bpa deployment.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 18:09:21 GMT):<br/>
```helm upgrade kc2 bpa -f bpa/values-kc.yaml \
--install \
--set bpa.config.name="Keycloak Two!" \
--set schemas.enabled=false \
--set "bpa.podAnnotations.timestamp=$(date)"
```
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 18:10:00 GMT):<br/>
then this will do the upgrade and change values in the configmaps, remove the schemas config, then redeply the bpa because the timestamp annotation changed.

Prepared a [Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) action / workflow which helps managing the releases.
The draft for the next release (kind of our first release: 0.6.0) looks like this: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/releases/tag/untagged-a9baaf8e5f9bc8b885d2

What about having a release every three weeks? This would fit to our sprint cycles.
A good date for us would be the 23.6. for the 0.6.0 ( three weeks later 0.7.0 and so on)

<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 16:03:53 GMT):<br/>
yeah, i saw that, but we don't necessarily change a file, so the checksum won't work, and i don't think we should have a random num either. I think we would lose control over what is rolled out, I think we will deploy the BPA more frequently than the AGENT. And for us, we will have a property overrides using `--set X`, and if we changed one of those values we would want to deploy only what is affected. We can discuss tomorrow.
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 16:11:42 GMT):<br/>
hmm, my feeling is we might have overengineered the way we parameterize the bpa or even the acapy deployment.
In general the deployment "should know when to do a new roleout"
the only case it does not , is when a value in a referenced configmap changes, not?
and for that purpose it is fine to create this hash over the configmaps.
Which scenario do you have in mind where a) a configmap won't change plus b) the deployment doesn't change either ?
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 16:15:05 GMT):<br/>
does that checksum work against the result of the configmap  or the actual template file? because the template file may not change frequently, but the values we pass in will.  so if a value changes and it redeploys, then that works for us.  and if it deploys when we change a value using `--set` then that is good to.  If it doesn't deploy on changes via `--set` then the caller can force a deployment using the pod annotations as described above. so i think what you
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 16:15:45 GMT):<br/>
have done will cover most (hopefully all) situatations.  and if not, then the caller can "force" deployment.

Hi @matthewhall78 !
Our sprint cycle is 3 weeks ;-)
If we do every week , I think  there is not much time to stabilize.
If find it better to have always a version in advance which can be roughly tested (e.g. 0.6.0-alpha01) 
Maybe you can discuss it tonight with my collegues (I cannot join tonight)

I was wondering whether I need to rebuild every time I change some frontend setting in `frontend/.env` like the title or logo URL. Would it be possible do read those variables at container-runtime from the environment?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 15:39:56 GMT):<br/>
What's your goal? If you need that you probably should serve the frontend separately from the backend
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 15:45:07 GMT):<br/>
ah, you want to change title/logo. This shouldn't be handled there.
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 15:45:07 GMT):<br/>
ah, you want to change title/logo. This shouldn't be handled there. That's related to https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/pull/477
</p>
<p><strong>echsecutor</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 15:48:31 GMT):<br/>
slightly related, yes. There are already options that you can set in the frontend .env, namely `VUE_APP_TITLE` and `VUE_APP_LOGO_URL`. Those are sufficient for me in terms of white labeling. ;) But afaik you can add e.g. an imprint via an .env variable at runtime, which saves rebuilding the whole container. So I was wondering whether you can do the same for the variables in frontend .env
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 15:50:26 GMT):<br/>
Currently you'd need to serve the frontend separately e.g. with npm run serve, then the VUE_APP_X Env variables can be accessed during runtime.
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 15:55:10 GMT):<br/>
But we could add it to the settings similar to the imprint URL. If that helps you, you can write an issue
</p>
<p><strong>echsecutor</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 16:07:56 GMT):<br/>
Ah, I see, there is quite some effort forwarding the imprint through the application.yml in the backend to the UserController to the frontend... never mind. I will just rebuild the container. ;)

@etschelp I configured VS Code launched by Gitpod for java development. Works quite nice , also debugging.
I could also add some configuration to the .gitpod.yml so that it works for every developer without even the need to configure anything.
my question is:
should I add 2 VS Code launch configs: one for backend and one for frontend? Or one combined one ? For the latter I'm not 100% sure how this works. Any help / hints wellcome

<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 16:15:13 GMT):<br/>
maybe I try the following:

1) for the backend I provide a gitpod  init task which pre-builds the dependencies (basically a `mvn clean install`).
Acapy and DB I start via docker-compose , also in the background.
Plus a vs-code launch config to have a run / debug configuration.

2) For the frontend I have a gitpod init task which installs the npm dependencies, basically an `npm install` as pre-build.
I start an npm development server in the background (`npm serve`),  in a gitpod task where I can open it also in the browser or preview.

Hmmm , but this has the downside, that for frontend development always the backend has to be started.
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 16:16:18 GMT):<br/>
This seems to be not ideal. 
@usingetechnology  and @Jsyro , didn't one of you develop fronend and backend at the same time ? how?
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 16:20:16 GMT):<br/>
I do basic development using a separate backend and frontend. The main issue is security is disabled.  This allows you to run the backend and have it work with a frontend on a separate server.  I run the backend and frontend through my IDE (IntelliJ) and I can debug with breakpoints in both.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 16:25:59 GMT):<br/>
it's a bit awkward, but i have full debugging.  I use docker compose to stand up two agents and 1 bpa, then use my ide to run the second bpa (which has no security and i can debug using an Application configuration) and then i just do `npm serve` to run the frontend for my 2nd bpa, and I can launch a Javascript debug session against that frontend.  Again, I am using IntelliJ, but I think the same could be done with VS Code.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 16:28:05 GMT):<br/>
I think that is fine. We have no pipeline yet.
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 17:04:33 GMT):<br/>
Cool, I thought of configuring something similar @usingetechnology .
BPA1 is anyway good for testing.
but BPA2 I wonder if I can run frontend and backend together but run the frontend in debugging mode (npm serve) , if I change this stuff here:
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/blob/8f1bec60eec1475a065e06fae133f01972796e3c/backend/business-partner-agent/pom.xml#L404

But hot reloading probably won't work if started with maven? @etschelp
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 17:06:11 GMT):<br/>
@usingetechnology could you share this docker-compose file? I want to make sure that you can used the same file in your setup

</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 17 Jun 2021 07:42:40 GMT):<br/>
A couple of things. To setup the pod in the background i would simply use `mvn clean compile` as this does not run any checks it should speed up things.

To do reloads on changes i would propose you take a look at the micronaut maven plugin https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-maven-plugin/latest/examples/run.html 

This is already in our poms and works for java.

If you want to server the frontend via the backend and have hot reload on both you have a couple of issues. First: npm serve needs to copy everything it compiles into the backends resource folder. and second the backend then needs to hot reload the jar. I do not know if this is doable, but it might work. maybe with also with symlinks or mounts.

An other discussion might be breaking up be and fe, but this changes the security setup, especially if you want to serve from multiple domains.

I wanted to write a @MicronautTest, where i mock `org/hyperledger/bpa/impl/aries/config/SchemaService.java` by this
`    @Inject
    SchemaService schemaService;
    @MockBean
    SchemaService schemaService(){
        return Mockito.mock(SchemaService.class);
    }`

But I get an ambiguity error for an inner class for my mock and the actual singleton of some aspect
` Multiple possible bean candidates found: [org.hyperledger.bpa.controller.api.prooftemplates.$ProofTemplateTest$SchemaService0Definition$Intercepted, org.hyperledger.bpa.impl.aries.config.$SchemaServiceDefinition$Intercepted]`

How do I mock that correctly?

Solved it. Instead of `@MockBean` I had to specify the class of the bean I want to replace `@MockBean(SchemaService.class)`

Hot-reloading works I think if the java debugging is used.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 18 Jun 2021 07:49:09 GMT):<br/>
Yes thats how you replace an existing bean from the context with a mocked one. Or if you do not need the full context you can do it with plain mockito like:

```
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MyTest {

    @Mock
    private DependencyOfFooService dep;

    @InjectMocks
    private FooService foo;
```
Like this you can mock the dependencies behavior.

When I opened a new workspace, `mvn clean compile` doesn't make the jar, so the backend never starts.  i had to run `mvn clean install`.  perhaps we can create a new task that creates the jar but does not run the tests.

 For dev purpose `docker-compose.yml` plus `docker-compose.override.yml` are merged and launched if you just run `docker-compose up` (But the do not contain code duplication)
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 08:18:15 GMT):<br/>
Examples of usage:

1) launch one agent
` docker-compose up`

2) launch 2 agents
`docker-compose --profile second_bpa up`

3) overwriting with dev values
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`

<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 08:18:15 GMT):<br/>
Examples of usage:

1) launch one agent for development
` docker-compose up`

2) launch 2 agents for development
`docker-compose --profile second_bpa up`

3) for "prod" usage the compose files are explicitly  mentioned
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 08:20:23 GMT):<br/>
Open point:
1) we could also get rid of `docker-compose.dev.yml` and consider dev setup as the default ?

2) make used of the new compose file(s) in the local setup.

**Open points**:
1) make used of the new compose file(s) in the local setup.
@Jsyro or @usingetechnology , could one of you fix that? 

2) write a proper developer docu which guides more nicely through the different options (local setup, gitpod, debugging,...)

3) Does anyone need 
`docker-compose.custom-acapy.yml` or `docker-compose-backend-webonly.yml`?

4) Does anyone need the 2 additional Dockerfiles? @etschelp , maybe at least not in our repo root ?

@channel after attending the Hyperledger Maintainers meeting this morning, it was suggested that we could have a wiki page on the Hyperledger Labs confluence site. So I reused the template and set up one for us.  Please feel free to contribute to it. and I'd appreciate if someone did a quick review to make sure I haven't left anything from the boiler plate template. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/labs/Business+Partner+Agent

<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Fri, 25 Jun 2021 06:57:25 GMT):<br/>
Awesome!
Here we recently had the idea to create a user docu for the BPA using https://readthedocs.org/ and host it via github pages. Jared  is working on that.
Question would be , do we need both , WIKI and Readthedocs?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Fri, 25 Jun 2021 07:18:05 GMT):<br/>
Did a few small changes.
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Fri, 25 Jun 2021 12:53:33 GMT):<br/>
BTW, I changed the handling of env vars in the gitpod setup.
Before you start a new gitpod workspace, please clean up the variables here: https://gitpod.io/variables  (the seeds you can keep)

I'm nearly done with the aca-py 0.7 migration and the uniresolver dependency is now gone. If you want you can have a look on the PR to check if something is missing. https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/pull/467 
Whats left is a PR in the helm charts repo to do the necessary changes there. When we merge this PR the implication is that everything is now did:sov or did:web, and the prefix is only needed to switch between indy and web modes.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Fri, 25 Jun 2021 19:19:05 GMT):<br/>
i'm off for the weekend, I did not have enough time to review @etschelp PR or @domwoe PR. Hopefully @Jsyro can do it, or I will make it a priority Monday morning.

@frank-bee thanks for touching up that PR, that will keep it consistent. And thanks for looking into that chart deployment/test issue. Yes, I was very confused why there was that node not being ready.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 17:29:33 GMT):<br/>
@etschelp just downloaded and ran the latest code. :clap: Ran @frank-bee docker-compose and connected to BCovrin DEV and the 2 partners resolved!  Great work you guys!  I will be updating my local dev scripts to use these same docker compose files.
</p>
<p><strong>matthewhall78</strong> (Thu, 01 Jul 2021 00:39:35 GMT):<br/>
maybe readthedocs is for a different purpose than the wiki.  and we can link to the readthedocs source from the wiki.  I just thought it was important to have at least a pointer from the hyperledger labs wiki to our stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Thu, 01 Jul 2021 05:28:10 GMT):<br/>
Indeed confusing! This problem still exist  I fear. Will keep an eye on that.
I tested the modified chart against our cluster ( IDU config) and  was able to install it. Will do some more tests today
</p>

Up and running @usingetechnology :-)

-> Browser name is shown ( "Title")

-> Did not test the changes regarding Acapy 0.7 @etschelp 
-> In the bottom status bar the link text seems to be not set. @usingetechnology does this have to do with internationalization?

Jared prepared a nice concept on how we could do our technical documentation.
Would be great if you can review it: 
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=54657774
Just leave a comments there (inline or on the bottom).

<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 01 Jul 2021 08:47:07 GMT):<br/>
@frank-bee What seems odd is that the frank agent still has the did:sov:idu prefix. The only way that can happen is if this is set via java opts and not environment variables. In the chart I only see the environment variable. So this must be something that is specific to our setup.
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Fri, 02 Jul 2021 08:24:24 GMT):<br/>
I did not delete the database which is typical for upgrades
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Fri, 02 Jul 2021 08:28:26 GMT):<br/>
@etschelp Would be cool if you can test this. Install the chart in our kubeapps env.  Ideally first install the latest  release and than upgrade to the new alpha.

@frank-bee i'll take a look monday morning but yes, that appears to be with that localization PR.  in the `locales/en.json`, the property is named incorrectly... change `imprintUrlText` to `imprintUrl`. I'll do a PR on Monday if that isn't fixed by anyone else

<p><strong>echsecutor</strong> (Sat, 03 Jul 2021 05:53:39 GMT):<br/>
I have used the `docker-compose.dev.yml` in order to build + run my local changed version. If you want to change trivial things such as the Logo through `frontend/.env` having such a build container is quite convenient
</p>

<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Mon, 05 Jul 2021 07:41:36 GMT):<br/>
@echsecutor not sure if I get you righ. dev configuration you would do in `docker-compose.override.yml`, this is what is recommended / described in the docker-compose docu. 
I  you call `docker-compose up` , both files `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml` are merged .

<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Tue, 06 Jul 2021 17:40:50 GMT):<br/>
Having an issue actually issuing a credential to the Trinisic Wallet though... will have to dig in to that.  Probably a mismatch between Trinsic version and acapy version?

Further update, Trinsic was just very slow to receive the credential (~30 minutes) but it did get there. I also connected and issued to esatus Wallet (and that was very quick).  :rocket:

Is there a reason we use gson and jackson? Which one should I prefer? I am trying to build a more generic org.hyperledger.aries.api.present_proof.PresentProofRequest.ProofRequest.ProofRestrictions using a Map<String,String> for attribute value restricitons. That class uses GSON to serialize it to JSONObject. I know how to achieve my goal  right away with some jackson annotations.

Hi team!
I added a little milestone overview document [here](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/blob/gh-pages/MILESTONES.md). Linked it in our main readme.md.
The document is automatically updated several times a day based on issues labeled with `epic` and assigned to a [milestone](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/milestones)

We could use the milestones to do some kind of release planning!?
If you wanna try it , @MoritzKa and @Jsyro kindly create some issues labeled with `epic` -  maybe for the next 3 milestones .
You could  just take the most important headlines from your roadmap documents (description not important).

For the [milestones](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/milestones) I created some with 3 weeks iteration cycle ( current bosch sprint cycle: 0.7, 0.8,...). But we can change this for sure at any time.

I removed the project, deleted the .idea folder, then reimported the project.
Finally I added manually `$HOME/.m2/repository/io/micronaut/micronaut-inject-java/2.5.7/micronaut-inject-java-2.5.7.jar` to the Annotation Processors, and IntelliJ runs the tests fine now with the integration and mvn and the standalone mvn is working as expected now too.

<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 09 Jul 2021 15:52:02 GMT):<br/>
Hi folks, I'm (finally) starting to tackle adding Endorser support to the BPA.  (Thanks to @Jsyro and @usingetechnology for giving me a walkthrough of the backend code yesterday).  First steps - I'm going to:

- add some configuration to specify whether the BPA is an Author, Endorser, or *none* (i.e. current behaviour, just writes stuff to the ledger)
- add an API to the backend so the client can get this configuration (or is there an existing api I should update?)
- take a look at the connection support to see what I need to update (Endorser/Author connections need to be configured with meta-data)

... and that's it to start.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 09 Jul 2021 18:32:52 GMT):<br/>
Aha:
`/profile.jsonld`
or:
`/api/admin/config`
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Fri, 09 Jul 2021 19:52:37 GMT):<br/>
Awesome! The second one. I think at some point we'll get this config from ACA-Py itself if I understood @esune's plans. So the approach would probably the same as Frank did with the tails server config https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/pull/536

OK I'll take a look thanks
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 09 Jul 2021 20:50:39 GMT):<br/>
I think we *also* need to include Endorser info in the `/profile.jsonld` endpoint, because Authors need to include the Endorser DID when they sign the transaction (before they send to the Endorser for endorsement), so would be helpful if this was part of the profile
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 07:15:37 GMT):<br/>
This was working fine before and stopped working after the last IntelliJ update. The annotation processor config should be read from maven, because this is where micronaut-inject-java is defined.
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 11:41:47 GMT):<br/>
ah, interesting thought! Would be good if we could talk about the flow tomorrow. To get the profile you'd already need the public DID. 1) If the TA starts with adding the endorser as a partner we already have the public DID

ah, interesting thought. Would be good if we could talk about the flow tomorrow. To get the profile you'd already need the public DID. So this would only help if you want to crawl the ledger for endorsers. 

If the TA starts with adding the endorser as a partner we already have the public DID

If we want to start the process with an explicit invitation from the endorser we might need to add additional functionalities
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 13:26:32 GMT):<br/>
Ah right you already have the public DID
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 13:27:09 GMT):<br/>
I won't be able to make the call tomorrow unfortunately as I have a conflict now on Tuesday mornings
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 13:50:08 GMT):<br/>
I think this is a bit tricky. If we think about what can happen in the UI, there we have:

1. Existing connections
2. New incoming connections
3. New outgoing connections

What all cases have in common is that we want to add the endorser capability to it. This step will then make the aca-py call to assign the metadata to the connection. 

If we add this capability to the profile we could make this step dependent on this information. But then there are many places where we need to add this. So maybe to keep things simple we could start with the functionality to assign the endorser capability to an existing connection?
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 13:55:49 GMT):<br/>
For the authors side of the API I do not think that there is the need for new endpoints. The only switch that is needed in the backend is to add the endorser related info. 

As we have now pending author and endorser tasks I would build upon parc-json's PR https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/pull/523
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:01:02 GMT):<br/>
Re adding connections - I suggest for the first cut, for the Endorser side, when a connection is added it is automatically set as an "Author" connection (i.e. the partner is a Transaction Author).  For the Author side, we add a checkbox to "make this partner an Endorser" and provide this option when the connection is added, or to add Endorser capability to an existing conection.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:01:22 GMT):<br/>
For the transaction endorsing workflows, I agree to base on parc-jason's notifications PR
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:06:37 GMT):<br/>
For the authors side: Do we want to support multiple endorsers? If not I would suggest to set the endorser in the settings and not have a set as endorser checkbox for every partner
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:07:47 GMT):<br/>
So in settings you can select the endorser from your partners (with a public DID and endorser rights)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:08:05 GMT):<br/>
In the next aca-py update we will probably set the Endorser as a configuration (for the Author aca-py), so there will be only one.  This work isn't done yet so we don't know exactly what it will look like.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:08:43 GMT):<br/>
... it will likely require changes to whatever we have implemented in BPA, so I suggest we just keep it simple for now.
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:13:35 GMT):<br/>
Agreed. I don't think we need support for multiple endorsers. And because you probably set it only once (or its even preconfigured) I don't want to bother the user in every partner (add) view

I'd say this one of the docker-compose files we should get rid off :) if you really want to start the BPA in web mode, i.e. with a did:web you have to wipe the database (docker-compose down -v) and set the env variable BPA_WEB_MODE=true

While running an instance of BPA I made a connection to a trinsic wallet, issued a credential, and all was fine.  But after a few minutes the State of the connection now shows "abandoned".  But on the other connections we have with other BPA instances that are running the connection state still shows as "active".

<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Fri, 16 Jul 2021 06:46:10 GMT):<br/>
Hi Matth!
For me me this is clearly something we should document in the user documentation  - which we currently do not really separate from developer documentation.
Let's wait until Jared is back from vacation, he will do the initial separation of user docu. And than there should be a chapter about partner handling ( adding, being added, "states",...)
If you connect to a trinsic wallet this is technically pure aries / didcom communication I assume . I'm not sure if connection handling is 100% the same as if you would connect to a full BPA. Maybe our experts here can answer that...

This is related to this issue: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/issues/548 There BPA tries to performa a trust ping with every active connection and currently sets the state to abandoned if the trust ping is not answered (for a specific period?) I think we should give this state another name, because "abandoned" is a state defined in RFC 0023

I can reproduce this, with the esatus app. No issues with trinsic. Its either the mediator or the wallet. I can not see anything in aca-py's logs. issuing works. the app probably cannot handle the format.
</p>

We should distinguish between what the user needs to see and the aries connection states that we display to debug the states. Active/inactive states are probably enough. In the backend I have to set something. I do not care what. I can add the inactive state again or set the connection to error.
</p>
<p><strong>matthewhall78</strong> (Fri, 16 Jul 2021 19:34:56 GMT):<br/>
For a mobile wallet connection, this seems more like a presence indicator. e.g.  Online, Away, or Offline.  But I'm not sure that what the point of the status was for.  In my mind there are at least two separate sets of states.  (Just brainstorming here...)
1. invitation to connect received, invitation to connect accepted, connection established, connection deleted
2. Connection active, connection away or idle, connection offline

@usingetechnology  @Jsyro  how you doing?
I plan you fix our docker-compose docu in the next days. Let's have it really clean and clear (KISS) ! @domwoe asked me to
Will add some sentences on how to launch with 2 agents ( default will be one agent).
Do you still need the local set-up folder? I can also delete it, currently it still has a lot of code duplication.
Ideally I'd ask you to "merge it" with the main compose file -> optionally launch a local agent.
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 11:39:32 GMT):<br/>
docker-compose.custom-acapy.yml I will also delete - if there is no veto here?

<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 11:55:01 GMT):<br/>
Would be great to not have different docker-compose files for the local network setup. Should be just an additional step to lunch the network and change the ledger in the env.
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 12:02:45 GMT):<br/>
yup, basically the refactoring would be:
- [start_infra.sh](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/blob/master/scripts/local-network/start_infra.sh) could be moved up to the scripts folder
- small chapter in the compose readme on how to start local setup

I think @ianco is working with the local network if I remember correctly. Also @jaredweinfurtner liked the approach of having no remote dependencies when developing.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 22 Jul 2021 10:30:57 GMT):<br/>
I see a lot of interesting challenges with this task, but first some general thoughts.

1. I'm inclined to move decisions on the event state into the event classes itself e.g. connection.isIncoming(), connection.isInvitationRequest() etc. otherwise we will have the same checks all over the place 
2. any code that is called from the activities event handler should never call business logic that is not event related e.g. update a Partner. therefore we should move this into an own package and really be careful about what is public/private. 
3. Currently the BPA has no user concept. Open tasks have no issue with that, as they are either open or done, but things like new connection, new credential might be tricky
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 22 Jul 2021 10:42:02 GMT):<br/>
The more specific issue is the event handler design and how to track states. As events are plentiful they can cause performance and storage issues quickly. So filtering is key here. Also I would never store the whole event payload only types and references. 

Another question is, if everything is event based only events can update the state of a task right? This can get hard to track. But anyhow, my first naive approach would be to split up incoming events into tasks and notifications  and store them in one or two big collections where you can easily order by state and dates (here I strongly recommend indices)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 22 Jul 2021 13:12:21 GMT):<br/>
I've been working with the `local` setup.  I can refactor/merge with the parent to remove the duplication.  FYI I don't use `start_infra.sh`, I just start my local von-network manually.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Thu, 22 Jul 2021 14:12:18 GMT):<br/>
great, thanks for all those points. really need the input to shine light on all the possible issues and tricky areas.  hmm, i hadn't thought about about something like `connection.isIncoming()`... will have to think about that for sure - like you, a concern was having logic scattered about too much.  one thought i had was to create a more BPA event model that the backend would raise to the frontend. Basing it around `ApplicationEventListener`, so any of our code would fire an event like `partnerAdded` and the Event listener would handle that, do whatever needs to be done as far as storage and then send a message over the socket.  Just to isolate all the logic for building the activity/task lists and sending to the frontend.

that would open up the backend/frontend notifications to non-aca-py events, like anything we want to raise that is strictly a BPA mechanism (not sure what yet... maybe like public profile changed)
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 22 Jul 2021 15:45:09 GMT):<br/>
The application events are a great idea as they give us another design option. The first option would be to fire all frontend events in the webhook handler. Whereas application events could be triggered in the managers. Firing events in the managers might be better in scenarios where you want to be sure that something is in a defined state. As the event handlers are run simultaneously and you cannot rely on the state of the other thread.

I'm trying to add query parameters to the authentication URL that is sent to the oauth2 (keycloak) so they can be forwarded to the identity provider. Has anyone done this before. First pass through the docs (https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/1.2.3/guide/index.html#io.micronaut.security.oauth2.configuration.OauthClientConfigurationProperties$OpenIdClientConfigurationProperties$AuthorizationEndpointConfigurationProperties) only shows a full override the url. i'd rather just add the query param to whatever it does by default.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Mon, 26 Jul 2021 07:43:42 GMT):<br/>
I guess you would have to add your own implementation of io.micronaut.security.oauth2.endpoint.authorization.request.AuthorizationRedirectHandler. But i would rather extend DefaultAuthorizationRedirectHandler than add a completely new implementation.
</p>

are you looking to add `kc_idp_hint=BLAH` to the login url?

<p><strong>Jsyro</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:28:06 GMT):<br/>
i need to add a query param `pres_conf_req_id` to the `authorization_url` redirect that micronaut sends to for authentication... 

Is `kc_idp_hint` a query param as well?
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:28:52 GMT):<br/>
kc_idp_hint is a query param for the login url, saying which provider to prefer
</p>
<p><strong>Jsyro</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:29:16 GMT):<br/>
ok, then i might be able to use/re-use/modify that. i'll look for that.
</p>
<p><strong>Jsyro</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:30:16 GMT):<br/>
i don't see `kc_idp_hint` in our repo at all.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:36:06 GMT):<br/>
maybe you can implement `OauthClientConfiguration` that implements the `Optional<EndpointConfiguration> getAuthorization();` that adds in the `pres_conf_req_id`.

I've got a PR (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/pull/561) that persists the tasks/activities (still reliant on partner existing - not sure if we want to handle when partners are removed), and re-work of the backend events -> front end notifications.  In the backend, the managers publish events as their logic dictates (partner added, partner/connection requested, presentation requested etc), the event handler will then use the message service to push those to the front end (and initiate logic to persist tasks/activities as needed). All the frontend events/notifications are stored in 4 buckets for now (task, partner, presentation, credential) and those are used to show badges on the left hand side navigation and also in tables and the partner screen itself (ex. which presentation request/exchange has been updated).  Once we have all used if for a bit, we may want to adjust what frontend notifications we actually need to surface to the users.  The chat/messages will get re-worked next sprint as we put persistence in.  I am off tomorrow (Friday) and Monday.

We've got two repos which are affected:
- hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent
- hyperledger-labs/acapy-java-client
The two chart repos already use `main` as the default branch.

We discussed this morning to rename the screen/navigation and remove the schema maintenance block (so all schema/cred def is done in settings).  So we want to name the navigation and the screen as Issue Credentials and leave the Create/Import schema in Settings. Thoughts?

I'm currently refactoring the issuing part in the backend to also support issuing and receiving indy credentials via the v2 api. See https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/pull/574 I did a lot of cleaning up there.

thanks for letting me know @etschelp.  my pr will not change any functionality. just remove/move some UX pieces.  i was going to rename the actual vue files from CredentialManagement to reflect that it is just issuance. But I think I will hold off on that to make it easier for your PR, we can come back and do a small file rename PR afterward.

I've kind of been ignoring this locally, but deployed to openshift today and it doesn't work? What is missing? ```19:09:23.683 [default-nioEventLoopGroup-1-2] ERROR AcaPyAuthFetcher - aca-py webhook authentication failed. Configured bpa.webhook.key: changeme, received x-api-key header: null

I am just using things out of the box, so the BPA is configured with it's webhook value of `changeme` so is this the agent not setting the header correctly?

are you using the latest chart version 0.8.1?
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 08:25:46 GMT):<br/>
There was a typo in 0.8.0
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 08:26:24 GMT):<br/>
Both deployments use the same property. https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent-chart/blob/e69a787854ba2fe9f65cc1f380e9740afe32aab9/charts/bpa/templates/acapy_deployment.yaml#L43
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:09:36 GMT):<br/>
yes, am using the latest. i found this didn't work using the docker compose files either.  how is the agent adding the value to the header? i can't figure it out. also, you cannot set BPA_WEBHOOK_KEY to "" or empty, because that still triggers the class that the bpa.webhook.key is set and it won't load the AcaPyAuthFetcherAllowAll class.  So a few things, on the helm charts we can add a conditional flag to add the BPA_WEBHOOK_KEY to the configmap only when needed. But that doesn't really help on the docker compose... I'll take a look today to see if i can change the compare logic for empty values to just let those pass through... still concerned about the x-api-key header.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:18:13 GMT):<br/>
have you updated your .env file?
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:22:24 GMT):<br/>
i guess the issue happens when you do not set the key
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:14:10 GMT):<br/>
by default, the env file has 'changeme' (both the docker compose and the helm charts), the bpa gets deployed with BPA_WEBHOOK_KEY env var of 'changeme' and the aca-py start up has the `--webhook-url` set with the same value.  but the acapy agent can never successfully connect to bpa webhook, i always get the 401.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:21:29 GMT):<br/>
can this be an environment issue? where the url gets overwritten because fragments are not allowed. 

I got 401 when the value is not set, because then BPA_WEBHOOK_KEY= gets translated into "". I added a fix for that case.

https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/pull/582/files
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:22:35 GMT):<br/>
We have deployed the 0.8.1 helm chart with all the defaults and it works.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:25:13 GMT):<br/>
When  the PR is merged and it is still not working you can set the property to "" and then everything is allowed.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:45:12 GMT):<br/>
so, when i set it to "", it triggers the  AcaPyAuthFetcher class and it fails because the header and key compare fails (which looks like your above fix will correct). the real issue is why isn't the agent setting the header?
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:46:30 GMT):<br/>
my preference would definitely be to just leave it all set and have it work, but i haven't been able to get it to work with a value. :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone:
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:59:45 GMT):<br/>
its a aca-py bug as the header is not set any more. i tried this with an older version and it works
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 16:01:37 GMT):<br/>
but i do not get it why its working when we deploy it from the helm chart. for now i propose to not set the property or set it to ""
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 16:04:50 GMT):<br/>
ahhh, ok. we don't need that security, so we will set to "", thanks for that fix!

Yes, BPA now uses the resolver capabilities of aca-py. All dids implicitly belong to the ledger against aca-py is configured. This will change once did:indy is implemented. For now everything is did:sov though.

<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 01:46:59 GMT):<br/>
i've been working on passing in a receive invitation url to the BPA and allowing it to connect. Been using BPA to BPA, Trinsic Studio to BPA. The BPA can receive an invitation url from another BPA and Trinsic Studio and connect. Although in both cases it kind of reverts to our old way of connecting, so the DIDs are the private ones.  A bigger issue is trying to receive an OOB invitation, using the BPA to generate a OOB invitation, I can receive it in BPA and get up to the point where I need to turn it into an InvitationMessage and pass to Aries Client (call outOfBandReceiveInvitation). Issue is that the generated oob invitation returns a string array for services (which is valid according to aca-py), but our InvitationMessage.services is a list of InvitationMessageServices which is a complex object.  That is also valid according to the aca-py spec, but since our java class can only use the complex object I can't build the message from the generated invitation.  We should discuss tomorrow.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Tue, 24 Aug 2021 15:27:39 GMT):<br/>
should be fixed now see https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/acapy-java-client/commit/a1a6b3019959246e39e99862fc48328d73f97039 the invitation is now typed, and depending on the type the service list is either a array of strings, or an array of complex objects.

Just a quick follow up, got that all working, except now there is another one... but i think simpler? The handshake protocols don't get serialized (doesn't matter if string or rfc0067)```                                InvitationMessage<String> im = gson.fromJson(decodedBlock,
                                        InvitationMessage.STRING_TYPE);
                                // update aries client invitation message to use
                                // @SerializedName("handshake_protocols")
                                if (im.getHandshakeProtocols() == null || im.getHandshakeProtocols().size() == 0) {
                                    im.setHandshakeProtocols((List<String>) o.get("handshake_protocols"));
                                }
                                invitation.setInvitationMessage(im);

i do not know if we have the permission to delete old packages. but we already have like 164 packages. what would make sense anyway is to set up a cleanup action that removes all the packages that are not released and are not latest.

btw. i fixed one of the issues from yesterdays presentation were it was not possible to add the same trusted issuer to a second schema.

Topics so far:

- Upcoming team changes on the Bosch side
- Upcoming stories: e.g. Manual credential holder flows, v2 flows etc. any conflicts here?
- Any preferences on how to merge PR's (squash, vs. keeping the history)?
- Any ideas on how to fix/workaround the broken push to github packages action?
- If time permits. What is missing in the BPA to make it more production ready? e.g. distributed sessions, user roles, audit trail

Hey, just out of curiosity, why is there a edit button on the partners public profile when adding a new partner?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 29 Sep 2021 15:15:23 GMT):<br/>
ha, good find. the org profile / public profile component is reused here. This recent PR added the possibility to edit (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/pull/636https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent/pull/636) but needs to be removed in this context
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 09:06:13 GMT):<br/>
the only reason this button would make sense to me is if it would replace the pen in the partner details. or is this new functionality we want? correcting something in the partners public profile. this can have some unwanted side effects and we should discuss this first.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 12:13:04 GMT):<br/>
btw. I added -new to the package name and now it works again. this makes no sense at all.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 13:51:04 GMT):<br/>
Can someone post the link to today's BPA meeting? We can discuss the above or put a ticket in to make the button available only where it makes sense. The issue was users going to change their Org Name (or other org data) after the profile was created were getting lost. They expect that going to Public Profile would allow them to change it. So this was a compromise that they could immediately jump to the edit page. This button would/will be protected by appropriate roles/permissions. But should be hidden in the above case at all times.

@etschelp - i rolled back that bad merge in the chart repo.  i will be making some changes later today more related to ux configuration (I am simplifying the agent logo set up and removing some extra stuff we put in place for bcgov look and feel).
</p>
<p><strong>MoritzKa</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 10:33:23 GMT):<br/>
The description of the BPA in the GH repo mainly refers to the masterdata use case. Shouldn't we change it to a more general description: e.g 
e.g. "The Business Partner Agent allows to manage and exchange company data between organizations in the form of Verifiable Credentials"?
</p>
<p><strong>Jsyro</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:32:36 GMT):<br/>
How do we demonstrate the Credential Offer functionality? we have set the `auto-respond-credential-offer:false` but don't see anything in the holder's FE.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 10:17:26 GMT):<br/>
This is the holder side, and what's not implemented yet, but also  what I will do next. To see this you have to set: `auto-respond-credential-proposal: false` Then the flow is:
1. Holder: wallet/document/request verification
2. Issuer: New exchange pops up state proposal-received
3. Issuer: Clicks on the exchange accepts it or sends counter-offer
Denying the proposal is implemented in the backend, but missing in the frontend.

I have merged my latest changes. Issuer and holder exchanges are now using the same table. This should not cause any issues except that the wallet will be empty after the upgrade as I did not add a migration script to merge the tables.
</p>
<p><strong>usingetechnology</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:56:11 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks @etschelp we will get that into our builds and wipe out our current instances.  quick question, i can't seem to find any handling for the holder to accept or decline a credential offer? if i turn off the auto flag for respond to credential offer, as a holder the exchange just ends?
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:59:38 GMT):<br/>
yes. i have just started working on the holder side :) only the  issuer side is implemented atm. So it is:

`auto-respond-credential-proposal: false
auto-respond-credential-offer: true`
</p>

Hi everyone, in our current sprint we are adding language settings and want to properly internationalize/link all the texts in the entire frontend. For now we won't touch the bcgov.json locale, but it might need adaptation afterwards.

Hi guys , after rebooting my vps , can not get the platform working again.
after running the docker-compose up , I got stucked at:
"aca-py not ready yet, reason: Failed to connect to bpa-agent1"
How can I fix this ?
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 08:33:30 GMT):<br/>
This means that either aca-py did not start up, or that the controller can not access aca-py's endpoint because of a routing issue within docker. Hard to tell without more information. Are you using the top level compose file? Are you running from a tag or the main branch? Do you have any log outputs?
</p>

Can you provide the full log? There are multiple services defined in the compose file and this service depends on aca-py which is started beforehand and that one probably did not start. If aca-py starts up successfully you will see something like:

<p><strong>leostereo</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 14:52:28 GMT):<br/>
Im testing "demo scenario" and have some doubts.
</p>
<p><strong>leostereo</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 14:57:53 GMT):<br/>
my BPA_WEB_MODE=false so it means im running indy mode.
after reading documentation , it is not clear for me the differenci between both modes.
also , 
when starting demo scenario , it mention as pre requisite to run "aries" mode .... (please explain)
also  Agentâ€™s endpoint should be publicly available  (does it means I need to launch it using the "start-with-tunnel.sh" script ? 
thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 15:52:34 GMT):<br/>
First, the start with tunnel script is for local development where you want to test connections to other bpa or aca-py instances that are not running in your local machine. If you run this on a cloud server for days it's better to expose the endpoints via a proxy (apache, nginx, caddy, traefik, haproxy etc) If this is to much of a hassle you should be aware that ngrok has a 2h limit on the tunnel and you need an account to work arround that.

Second, the docker-compose filr already starts two agents so you can test agent to agent connections locally.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 15:57:27 GMT):<br/>
The web mode is a speacial flavor where there is no write access to a ledger needed and connecting to the bpa happens via did:web and not did:sov. This means this is great for all usecases where you do not have the endorser role, but still want to be able to hold credentials that are bound to a certain ledger. And yes, publicly available means exposed to the www and not to the host only docker network.

Hi guys , 
I successfully ran both agents doing:
docker-compose  --profile second_bpa up
Now I can notice that:
1 both agents share same login (if I login on first gui I got disconnected from the other and viceversa).
2 After creating an invitation on agent1 and paste its url in agent2 (adding partner), the invitation is accepted but it stays in "invitation" state.
3 When checking invitation details ,  I can see two strange things:
a _ div:sov:unknown
b _ Partner does not share a public profile.

Any ideas ? can you helpme checking my setup  ? ... please ...
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 09:49:11 GMT):<br/>
To answer your points:
1. This is how session cookies work, they are shared by domain and if both agents run for example on localhost they overwrite each others cookies. If you are running locally you can turn off security or open your browser tabs in incognito mode or use two different browsers to work arround that.
2. If you are using the start with tunnels script you need to be aware that only the first agents endpoint is exposed. I do not know on how many servers you are running where, but my guess is that now one endpoint is docker private and the other one is running on ngrok and hence both agents wont find each other. If you are running only the second bpa this is definitely the case. If you are running both agenty locally without start with tunnels there is another issue. If you are running on multiple servers you need to start the first bpa on both. But for debugging you can post me both invitation urls then we can have a closer look. And also some more details on your setup would be helpful.
3. These are the intricacies of the different flows. If you want full information you have to connect the agents by did:sov:111. You find the agents did in the settings section, only then the did exchange protocol is used and the bpa can resolve all the endpoints that are on the ledger and this also means resolving the public profile. By using the invitation url the connection protocol is used and only peer dids are exchanged. I can reproduce the unknown did issue on the receiving agent. I will have a closer look, but this should not cause any issues as it is only missing information to display.

Good; 
1 ; you are right , issue is gone when running from incognit session.
2 ; Let me describe my scenario:
a Both agents are running on same centos vm.
b Centos vm does not have public ip (I wanted to test if  agent to agent comunication is possible using local ips)
c Ngrok tunnes are NOT runnin for any instance.
 I can set any scenario you sugest, just let me know wich should be the best setting to test bpa functions.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 15:45:15 GMT):<br/>
I think I see whats wrong. In the .env-example everything is set to localhost. This is of course relative to the container and hence the agents will not find each other. Can you set the following in your .env file?
````
BPA_HOST=bpa1:8080
BPA2_HOST=bpa2:8090
ACAPY_ENDPOINT=http://bpa-agent1:8030
ACAPY2_ENDPOINT=http://bpa-agent1::8040
````

<p><strong>leostereo</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 15:57:08 GMT):<br/>
I got it working !!! 
I ran one agent on sepÃ rate servers and using the ngrok tunnels.
</p>
<p><strong>leostereo</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 16:00:35 GMT):<br/>
I will test it:
now it is as follows:
[root@monitoreo_wiber scripts]# grep ACAPY2_ENDPOINT .env
ACAPY2_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8040
[root@monitoreo_wiber scripts]# grep ACAPY_ENDPOINT .env
ACAPY_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8030
</p>
<p><strong>leostereo</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 16:00:50 GMT):<br/>
I will change and let you kow.
</p>
<p><strong>leostereo</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 16:00:58 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>leostereo</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 16:01:34 GMT):<br/>
I will finish with the playlist you recommended and make more test, then come here again.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 16:02:48 GMT):<br/>
the ngrok script overwites the environment variables above, so they are not localhost during runtime in this case.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 16:04:14 GMT):<br/>
glad that it is working now. also you found two bugs, what is much appreciated.

Hello Business Partner Agent friends.  Is there a recommended / endorsed wallet that is fully compatible with the Business Partner Agent based on the following ledger configuration: BCovrin test network or Sovrin builder network?

`What apps have I tried?`

1. Lissi Wallet
2. Trinsic Wallet
3. Connect.me

`My initial result`

1. Agent to Wallet Connection:

Given a user that uses the `bpa` client application,
And the user initiates a partner connection, 
And the user uses the qr code method,
And the `bpa` client generates a qr code,
When the user scans the qr code using an android wallet,
Then the following happens:

i. If Lissi, connection is successful.  However, no DID is passed from wallet to bpa so subsequent communication is impossible.

ii. If Trinsic, connection fails. Trinsic Wallet receives bpa wallet data displaying agent name and intention to connect.  However, when user chooses "approve", wallet warns of error interpreting connection request.

iii. If Connect.me, connection is successful without errors.  `Bpa` initial trust pings are successful.  Future trust pings aren't although communication is still successful.

2. Issue Credential:

Given a user that has successfully connected a `bpa` application agent with a connect.me wallet,
When the user issues a credential from bpa to Wallet,
Then the following occurs:
i.  Credential is sent to Wallet successfully for approval

ii.  Wallet displays credential to user for approval

iii.  User chooses "approve"

iv.  Wallet informs user that it is receiving the credential and it will take some time

v.  Bpa errors to user that it has issued an "illegal" credential.

vi. Wallet informs user that credential receipt failed.

Other notes:
1. Lissi and Connect.me do not display what ledger they are connected to. I tested both sovrin builder and bcovrin test ledgers and my experience where as described above. Connect.me is somehow able to connect without preselecting the ledger used.
2. Trinsic gives the option to choose which ledger to use.
3. None of the wallets display user DID so that one can connect to bpa using the DID lookup method.
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 13:11:04 GMT):<br/>
I initially posted this question on the Aries Cloud Agent Python channel but subsequently discovered this channel.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 13:49:02 GMT):<br/>
First of all there is no recommended app, all apps that use indy/aries as a basis should basically work but. 

But for this to work both the app and the bpa need to be on the same ledger. The bpa uses a test ledger that we host and that is not known per default by any app. It could be that the Lissi app has it pre configured but the other two definitely not. 

To switch the ledger of the bpa you have to point the ACAPY_GENESIS_URL property in the .env file to the genesis file of the desired ledger. Connecting and issuing might work even if both are on different ledgers but the app will never be able to save the credential as it can not verify it.

Also the wallet apps do not work with public dids, only with peer dids behind a mediator so the only way to connect is by way of invitation.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 13:51:39 GMT):<br/>
The Lissi app comes with a array of pre configured ledgers see https://lissi-id.medium.com/the-lissi-wallet-supports-multiple-networks-ledgers-3f46657e0652. Connect.me only is on sovrin main or sovrin builder. With the trinsic wallet you can either import a genesis file or select from a list.
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 13:52:02 GMT):<br/>
I will also add that the Trinsic Wallet has a feature that allows a user to generate a connection link.  When that link is input into the bpa `add partner by connection url` an error is also generated. The url appears to be redirect url
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 13:53:12 GMT):<br/>
From what you are describing it sounds like you did not switch the bpas default ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 13:53:40 GMT):<br/>
redirects are not supported.
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 14:15:00 GMT):<br/>
@etschelp thanks for your reply.  I missed it before my follow-up comment.  In my .env configuration, I set the `ACAPY_GENESIS_URL` to point to the desired ledger as described in my tests. I am not aware that there is an unknown test ledger.  I assume from your comment that the test ledger's value is replaced when `ACAPY_GENESIS_URL` is set?
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 14:16:26 GMT):<br/>
@etschelp thanks also for pointing me to that link with Lissi's ledger connections
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 10 Dec 2021 14:22:31 GMT):<br/>
I will troubleshoot again and report back
</p>
<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Tue, 14 Dec 2021 14:48:35 GMT):<br/>
I tested today with the Lissi, Trinsic and connect.me apps on sovrin builder net. Connecting works with all three apps. Issuing only with Trinsic and Lissi. The connect.me app behaves odd on the protocol level and sends a credential offer instead of a credential request, so the exchange fails. Btw. I fixed the invitation redirect with the trisic app, so it works now both ways.

Thats what I have set for the ledger:

````
ACAPY_GENESIS_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_builder_genesis
````
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 07:44:51 GMT):<br/>
Late reply here sorry.  I noticed a while back that the Trinsic redirect invitation url works and I just assumed that I was doing something wrong.

I still can't connect with the Trinsic app.  I get the following error which suggests issues with their servers:
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 07:47:50 GMT):<br/>
```aries_cloudagent.transport.outbound.manager ERROR >>> Error when posting to: https://streetcred-mediator-agent.azurewebsites.net/; Error: (<class 'aries_cloudagent.transport.outbound.base.OutboundTransportError'>, OutboundTransportError('Unexpected response status 405, caused by: Method Not Allowed',)```
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 07:52:30 GMT):<br/>
As a work around I have tried to "connect" using the `BPA` - `vc-authn` login feature.  All three wallet applications fail to respond to the presentation request as expected
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 07:55:39 GMT):<br/>
Please enjoy your weekend and should you have time during the weekday next I would really appreciate any assistance / guidance you can offer me
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 24 Dec 2021 00:22:15 GMT):<br/>
Hello all.  Can anyone that have successfully connected BPA to the Trinsic Wallet using the Sovrin Builder Net please kindly share the following configuration:
1. Environment configuration
2. Agent docker-compose configuration
3. BPA docker-compose configuration

I have had no success connecting the two. I want to use Trinsic specifically because it has the messaging functionality which BPA has as well. In all my attempts I either get an error from Trinsic when reading the BPA QR code connection invitation. Or I get a different error when I input the Trinsic connection invitation into the BPA application.

Below are my current configurations:

<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 16:41:05 GMT):<br/>
Your config looks definitely weird as all your endpoints point to the same url and all the ports are missing. So my very first guess is that no endpoints are exposed and also the wrong endpoints end up on the ledger which will break any connection attempt. Or do you have another script that overwrites the environment variables again? If you are proxying with diode you need to have two tunnels, one for the BPA_HOST and one for the ACAPY_ENDPOINT. see start-with-tunnels.sh.
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 14:29:35 GMT):<br/>
My configuration have real values.  I removed them before posting due to privacy concerns.  As for BPA not connecting to the Trinsic Wallet, I have concluded that the issue is likely on their side due to my ability to connect bpa to other wallets
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Wed, 05 Jan 2022 14:30:53 GMT):<br/>
You mentioned in your previous post that you were able to connect to Trinsic.  Please test again with an updated trinsic Wallet to see if this is still the case

  Then I include token in bpa docker container like so: -Dbpa.acapy.bearerToken=${TENANT_TOKEN} under JAVA_OPTS env variable. I also tested as it's own variable like so TENANT_TOKEN: ${TENANT_TOKEN}
  When I run the container I get an unauthorized error.  Please assist if you can.

Please be aware that the bpa itself is not multi tenant ready. There is a story for that that we did not start so far. If you want to connect the bpa's Java backend to a aca-py instance that is running in multi tenant mode, then your first two changes above should be enough. Touching the auth fetcher is not necessary as it checks if aca-py is allowed to call the bpa's webhook not the other way round. Also be aware of all the changes that need to be done to the aca-py configuration and everything that changes in aca-py's behaviour when running in multi tenant mode - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/Multitenancy.md

I can confirm that you're right that the first two changes was all that was needed for multitenancy to work.  My error was due to not supplying the TENANT_TOKEN  variable with an actual token.

What are your concerns about the readiness of BPA for multitenancy?
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 12:27:09 GMT):<br/>
For my setup to work, I created a separate postgres database instance to handle BPA concerns.  So far everything seems to work just fine

<p><strong>etschelp</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 16:04:44 GMT):<br/>
No concerns. I just wanted to say that currently the bpa backend is always bound to a single aca-py wallet and did. But of course it is possible to use a single aca-py instance in multi tenancy mode with multiple bpa backends.

A happy new year to you too. There are no big news from our end as most people just came back from their holidays this week. But I think having a quick synch makes sense, so yes we are back on :smiley:
