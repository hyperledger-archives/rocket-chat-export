That connection invitation has a my_did and their_did, neither of which are the public DID (they are private to that one connection)\n\nBPA1 saves a controller level entry in postgres that has the targetâ€™s public DID because itâ€™s coded to do that (i think).\n\nHowever BPA2 only has the connection invitation to work from, and saves the connections private DID in the same way that BPA1 saved the public DID.\n\nso the Initiator (BPA1) properly holds the targets public did, but the responder incorrectly saves the connection their_did as the public DID , which appears to be causing some issues. \n\nIs this a known issue, is there something that would help find the Public DID of the initiator as the responder?","username":"Jsyro","ts":"2021-03-01T22:19:37.413Z"}
{"msg":"Hey. Yes this is a known \"issue\". The initiating controller knows the public did of the other agent through the rest call and can store this information. On the aca-py level the connection is based on (private) peer did's only. We also asked on the aca-py channel if it is possible to display public did's in the agents connection information, and it will be implemented sometime in the future. \n\nCurrently we implemented two workarounds in the controller:\n\n1. You can set the did in aca-py's label e.g. --label did:sov:xxx:123:MyLabel Then this information becomes theirLabel in the connection event and the receiving controller can use this information to resolve the public profile of the initiating agent.\n\n2. We have a special credential type called commercial register that has a did attribute which we will then use to resolve the partners public profile. This is something the initiating controller would do. Meaning after establishing the connection it would send a commercial register presentation.

I am getting the connection-request from the phone to the BPA, but it's sitting in 'invitation' and won't complete because the BPA can't find a public profile. \n\nIt is also assuming that there is going to be a public profile for it to look at. which will not be the case for other aca-py wallet applications, we will need to make that not required for connection. \n\na) we could make these 'Business Partners' a different data object, that behave differently\n\nb) We could also add some application.yml flag of 'allow_all_acapy_connections' or something like that, that doesn't make the did resolution/public-profile a requirement for connection. \n\nStill investigating and work in non-bpa connection into the handlers, just want to raise this incase there is background knowledger that would help. \n\nHave a great weekend, I'm off Monday, so first thing i'll do is see you guys early Tuesday morning.","username":"Jsyro","ts":"2021-04-17T00:05:47.744Z"}

{"msg":"Quick update about the Issue Credential and persistence of Credential Exchange records. We had discussed not duplicating data that is available through aca-py. By default, aca-py (wallet) does not persist credential exchange data once a credential exchange is terminated (the credential is issued), so, if BPA wanted to review the credentials it issued, that needs to be stored in our BPA database. There is no redundancy. We could turn the flags on to store permanantly, or a limited amount of data (which would be useful for revocation), or the default (store nothing).  I think we stay with BPA storing the data so we can easily track what was issued etc. The bonus of that is the relationships to Partner and Schema and Cred Def objects, so we don't have to query aca-py, then for each cred ex, lookup the schema, cred def, and partner in the database.

Basing it around `ApplicationEventListener`, so any of our code would fire an event like `partnerAdded` and the Event listener would handle that, do whatever needs to be done as far as storage and then send a message over the socket.

In the backend, the managers publish events as their logic dictates (partner added, partner/connection requested, presentation requested etc), the event handler will then use the message service to push those to the front end (and initiate logic to persist tasks/activities as needed). All the frontend events/notifications are stored in 4 buckets for now (task, partner, presentation, credential) and those are used to show badges on the left hand side navigation and also in tables and the partner screen itself (ex. which presentation request/exchange has been updated).  Once we have all used if for a bit, we may want to adjust what frontend notifications we actually need to surface to the users.

If you run this on a cloud server for days it's better to expose the endpoints via a proxy (apache, nginx, caddy, traefik, haproxy etc) If this is to much of a hassle you should be aware that ngrok has a 2h limit on the tunnel and you need an account to work arround that.\n\nSecond, the docker-compose filr already starts two agents so you can test agent to agent connections locally.","username":"etschelp","ts":"2021-12-01T15:52:34.908Z"}
{"msg":"The web mode is a speacial flavor where there is no write access to a ledger needed and connecting to the bpa happens via did:web and not did:sov.

{"msg":"To answer your points:\n1. This is how session cookies work, they are shared by domain and if both agents run for example on localhost they overwrite each others cookies. If you are running locally you can turn off security or open your browser tabs in incognito mode or use two different browsers to work arround that.\n2. If you are using the start with tunnels script you need to be aware that only the first agents endpoint is exposed. I do not know on how many servers you are running where, but my guess is that now one endpoint is docker private and the other one is running on ngrok and hence both agents wont find each other. If you are running only the second bpa this is definitely the case. If you are running both agenty locally without start with tunnels there is another issue. If you are running on multiple servers you need to start the first bpa on both. But for debugging you can post me both invitation urls then we can have a closer look. And also some more details on your setup would be helpful.\n3. These are the intricacies of the different flows. If you want full information you have to connect the agents by did:sov:111. You find the agents did in the settings section, only then the did exchange protocol is used and the bpa can resolve all the endpoints that are on the ledger and this also means resolving the public profile. By using the invitation url the connection protocol is used and only peer dids are exchanged. I can reproduce the unknown did issue on the receiving agent. I will have a closer look, but this should not cause any issues as it is only missing information to display.","username":"etschelp","ts":"2021-12-03T09:49:11.372Z"}

Is there a recommended / endorsed wallet that is fully compatible with the Business Partner Agent based on the following ledger configuration: BCovrin test network or Sovrin builder network?\n\n`What apps have I tried?`\n\n1.

Agent to Wallet Connection:\n\nGiven a user that uses the `bpa` client application,\nAnd the user initiates a partner connection, \nAnd the user uses the qr code method,\nAnd the `bpa` client generates a qr code,\nWhen the user scans the qr code using an android wallet,\nThen the following happens:\n\ni. If Lissi, connection is successful.  However, no DID is passed from wallet to bpa so subsequent communication is impossible.\n\nii. If Trinsic, connection fails. Trinsic Wallet receives bpa wallet data displaying agent name and intention to connect.  However, when user chooses \"approve\", wallet warns of error interpreting connection request.\n\niii. If Connect.me, connection is successful without errors.  `Bpa` initial trust pings are successful.  Future trust pings aren't although communication is still successful.\n\n2. Issue Credential:\n\nGiven a user that has successfully connected a `bpa` application agent with a connect.me wallet,\nWhen the user issues a credential from bpa to Wallet,\nThen the following occurs:\ni.  Credential is sent to Wallet successfully for approval\n\nii.  Wallet displays credential to user for approval\n\niii.  User chooses \"approve\"\n\niv.  Wallet informs user that it is receiving the credential and it will take some time\n\nv.  Bpa errors to user that it has issued an \"illegal\" credential.\n\nvi. Wallet informs user that credential receipt failed.\n\nOther notes:\n1. Lissi and Connect.me do not display what ledger they are connected to. I tested both sovrin builder and bcovrin test ledgers and my experience where as described above. Connect.me is somehow able to connect without preselecting the ledger used.\n2. Trinsic gives the option to choose which ledger to use.\n3.

I also tested as it's own variable like so TENANT_TOKEN: ${TENANT_TOKEN}\n  When I run the container I get an unauthorized error.  Please assist if you can.","username":"LedgerXYZ","ts":"2022-01-08T22:12:33.588Z"}
{"msg":"Please be aware that the bpa itself is not multi tenant ready. There is a story for that that we did not start so far. If you want to connect the bpa's Java backend to a aca-py instance that is running in multi tenant mode, then your first two changes above should be enough. Touching the auth fetcher is not necessary as it checks if aca-py is allowed to call the bpa's webhook not the other way round. Also be aware of all the changes that need to be done to the aca-py configuration and everything that changes in aca-py's behaviour when running in multi tenant mode - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/Multitenancy.md","username":"etschelp","ts":"2022-01-10T08:45:25.538Z"}
