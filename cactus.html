Hi Denis
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:40:05 GMT):<br/>
Mostly I would say #6 is about input validation. There isn't a single input validation / state validation line of code in there so for example if any of the input parameters are in an incorrect format, it will still try to do it's thing which is a bug at best some sever security vulnerability at worst (not saying it is, just that it's possible).
I would write checks for #6 that enforce the contract between method and it's caller, verify that all method parameters are exactly what we expect them to be and if anything else comes in then just throw it right back.
</p>
<p><strong>glotov</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:41:20 GMT):<br/>
ok, will look what to do there then

ah, this `Unhandled rejection Error: invalid config key requested: error` again (https://travis-ci.org/denis-yu-glotov/blockchain-integration-framework/jobs/621601200#L811). Can be fixed by updating all `package-lock.json` files, but do you know a better way?

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 16:16:30 GMT):<br/>
Should be fixed once we can update to NodeJS 10x, but I'm still working on that (when I do upgrade, CI script  fails, so have to investigate it why). 
This is the branch (WIP): https://github.com/petermetz/blockchain-integration-framework/tree/feat/support-nodejs-10x

I don't have permission to it either because the repo settings don't even show up on the main repo where I could see the configuration of the bot.

Idea: Maybe we can use the new GitHub actions feature to install/use the bot instead of the old GitHub Apps way?

It's the same bot but made accessible through the actions feature and I'm hoping this to improve the situation because I *can* see the 'actions' button on the main repo which makes me assume that we wouldn't have to depend on Tracy for small time configuration changes on the bot.

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 19:58:22 GMT):<br/>
I know earlier we put down the identities design principle as aspirational, but thinking through the use-cases that I had in mind I came to think that there's a lot of the real-world scenarios where permissions/access control has a crucial role (which is why we also see a lot of permission-ed DLTs being developed for enterprise use-cases) and permissions/ACLs are useful when we deal with identities as well. So, IMO dealing with identities should also be at the core of what we intend to do instead of being on the wish list. Note: I don't mean for us to be a standalone identity framework or identity provider of some sort, just that we focus a little more on the ability of being able to correlate identities cross-chain, supporting especially the framework(s) that are being developed by the identity WG here at Hyperledger. Thoughts?

<p><strong>glotov</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 20:38:36 GMT):<br/>
ah, about `lgtm`, this changelist is not ready for review, Travis VM cannot handle all 3 repos and fail in different places.

@peter_somogyvari , how do you mark a PR as work-in-progress?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 21:05:40 GMT):<br/>
What did you have in mind?  I'm hoping we can make this as pluggable as possible in that we define some common interfaces around identity so that we can use different identity management interfaces.  As you (in my opinion, correctly) point out, we don't want to have to implement an identity framework ourselves.

peter_somogyvari , how do you mark a PR as work-in-progress?

I agree mate, that's what I meant as well: it looks good to me, but first the CI and commitlint issue has to be green :-)

You can set the PR to be a "draft" : https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/
The link shows how to do it when opening a new PR but I believe you can also modify the status of an existing PR to make a draft instead of a "ready for review" PR
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 22:14:17 GMT):<br/>
Still reading other's papers to get a better grasp of the implementation details (and what I *exactly* want to do). 

BUT the vision is that whatever the identity WG comes up with from that big consolidation process of theirs should be something that we are aligned with.  Two reasons for the latter idea:
1) It would be nice if different Hyperledger projects fit/worked together like legos (so long as they don't constrain each other of course). Don't know if this has ever been an explicit goal or not but I just made it up myself that I think it should be.
2) From what I understood based on the recent meeting minutes of the identity WG is that they are trying to come up with something uniting DID, DIF, Sovrin/Indy and that's basically the heavy lifting done (if they succeed) for us in terms of how we should approach identity.

I know it's vague, but even just talking about it helps me seeing the bigger picture (at least it feels like it)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 22:54:19 GMT):<br/>
What the identity WG is doing is really cool, but I suspect we will want a workable solution before they are done.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 22:54:57 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it would be awesome if LH projects fit/worked together like legos.  This form of modular design has been a goal since the beginning of Hyperledger.  Unfortunately, it has not been widely realized.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 22:55:20 GMT):<br/>
Oh. I guess I was making the assumption that they are close to being done. Back to the drawing board then. :-)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 22:55:30 GMT):<br/>
And yes, the identity interface is something we need to figure out.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 22:55:40 GMT):<br/>
I would love to see what you had in mind, or what you needed.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 22:56:01 GMT):<br/>
The best thing to do is to probably start with a list of things we want an identity service provider to do and then go from there.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Sun, 15 Dec 2019 00:10:58 GMT):<br/>
Agreed, 100%. I'm working on an IdentityProvider interface definition file, but it's a very iterative process (I throw away ideas a lot because I realize I wasn't getting the bigger picture).
Just realized that I should also be looking at Aries as well.

What I know for sure I'd need from the StorageProvider plugin implementations so far: 
1) Ability to prove that a wallet is associated with a given identity (cross-chain).
2) Provide access control lists of any kind of on-chain or even off-chain entities (wallets, smart contracts, identities, etc).

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 16 Dec 2019 19:23:37 GMT):<br/>
The difficulty with all of this is that there is unlikely to be one identity provider we can use for all of this, since different chains will use different identity providers and we probably do not want to implement our own provider.  Hence why I think we should focus on a functionality and then try to shim over existing providers to our functionality interface.

Hi @peter_somogyvari, I tried to run our Corda under Circle-CI, here are my (unsuccessful) results so far https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/issues/90. Maybe you have some ideas about that?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 19:41:17 GMT):<br/>
Hi Denis, I would look at the corda documentation/source code and try to figure out where all that memory goes (e.g. why do they need so much of it) and then try to tweak configuration parameters in a way so that maybe it gets reduced. Maybe it's not even possible because potentially the authors of Corda already optimized it so much that the current RAM usage is the absolute minimum but I doubt it because it would be strange for any piece of software to be needing several gigabytes of RAM just to basically run idle unless there's something funky going on.
I'll take a deeper look today just trying to finish up some documentation first
</p>
<p><strong>glotov</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 19:42:58 GMT):<br/>
why do you think it if because of memory?
</p>
<p><strong>glotov</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 19:43:31 GMT):<br/>
on my vm, our Corda mostly works
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 22:14:33 GMT):<br/>
I saw it use up 7-8 GB RAM on my VM so I figured the RAM gets filled up and then it starts swapping hard which slows everything to a halt. 
Could be wrong and instead could be just CPU bound of course, I don't yet have evidence either way.

Hi Hart, sorry for the slow response, I wanted to come back with something concrete.
I would love some feedback on a few ideas related to identity/authentication. Much more details on the link (chapter 5 of the document), but here are the key points:
* For browser based apps that cannot safely store private keys: We need a server side keychain.
* We need our own authentication service so that said web app users users can interact with the server side keychain if need be
* All this enables both client and server-side signing of transactions that a user wants to submit to a ledger through BIF.
* Make it possible for end users to associate their BIF identity to wallets on other ledgers that they own
* Registry of identities, credentials and other metadata so that a search/discovery feature can be implemented that maps a name of a person or organization to their digital identity, wallets, etc. (only what they choose to make public/discoverable)

I meant this: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/blob/master/packages/core/tools/ci.sh#L102. But for your case (Corda+Fabric) you need to specify `noquorum` as a parameter instead
</p>
<p><strong>Abhishek2700</strong> (Mon, 06 Jan 2020 09:46:42 GMT):<br/>
So do i need to run script like this ? ./ci.sh --noquorum

I have initialized the fabric and corda using https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/blob/master/docs/tutorials/simple-asset-transfer.md document. I am able to run the blockchains but not able to run the validators.

</p>

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Mon, 06 Jan 2020 23:22:23 GMT):<br/>
Hi @adityasingh177 no finalized docs just yet, there's a few of us working on the design/architecture on separate documents (all of which will get eventually merged into one single document with cohesion in mind). Personally, my plan is to have a unified REST API with websocket support and a client side SDK that works in browsers and NodeJS as well. The API documentation will be done most likely with a tool, something with automation in mind such as Swagger (but we are not there yet). Also, you could take a look at the ConnectionChain REST API documentation but keep in mind that these will change as we mature and reach the first stable release (1.0).
Also take a look at this if you are interested in higher level documentation and won't mind reading an early draft: https://github.com/petermetz/blockchain-integration-framework/blob/docs/peter.somogyvari/whitepaper/docs/whitepaper/whitepaper.md
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 00:19:04 GMT):<br/>
@adityasingh177 sorry for my delayed response, really hectic first day back after 2 week holiday 😅  
As Peter mentions we don't have much in terms of a setup; your best bet frankly at the moment is the CI script where you can piece together the deps for an Ubuntu install (Docker, NPM, JDK, etc).  https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/blob/master/packages/core/tools/ci.sh
getting this documented is important and we will definitely welcome PRs, but as Peter also mentions our small team is right now focused on getting to the to-be arch (which then will likely require new setup docs)
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 00:20:45 GMT):<br/>
sorry don't want to be discouraging on contributing, there are many good first issues tagged that would not require the full setup. 
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 00:21:21 GMT):<br/>

Can you try running the CI script (if not already)? That's the current gold standard for verifying issues. `./packages/core/tools/ci.sh` If that script fails then something is very likely to be causing it specific to your machine. If it succeeds, then please double check the steps for running the scenarios just by reading the commands in the ci.sh script.
</p>
<p><strong>Abhishek2700</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 07:46:22 GMT):<br/>
Isn't it to setup fabric and quorum blockchain?? I wanted to try asset-tranfer between corda and fabric. I am following the doc at https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/blob/master/docs/tutorials/simple-asset-transfer.md  
</p>

<p><strong>glotov</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 10:28:14 GMT):<br/>
hi, you need to run all commands from `ci.sh` except those that mention Quorum. And also change `nocorda` to `noquorum`.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 18:30:37 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 18:30:37 GMT):<br/>
@Abhishek2700 The CI script does basically the same thing as the simple asset transfer example, but also includes corda, which you can exlude as Denis was saying, but you don't have to unless you are RAM bound (you need 16GB RAM freely available on your system to run the full CI with Corda)

@Abhishek2700 It's part of the ChainCode written for the example: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/blob/eaa5a3796e6cfd59fd24fe55454491b7cea2a6b6/packages/core/examples/simple-asset-transfer/fabric/contracts/src/mycc/mycc.go#L161

@glotov , @peter_somogyvari  . I also wanted to ask about the working of the validators.
1.) Are they the same as the peer nodes or
 are they different nodes specifically made for validating requests for cross blockchain requests or
are their functionality defined by the chaincode .

2.) How many peer nodes do we need? The simple-asset-transfer example here shows 4 peers and 4 validators. Do we always have to have the same number of validators as the peer nodes? What is the minimum number of recommended validators required for a cross blockchain asset transfer?

I figured out that the code for verifying signatures by fabric connector is mentioned in the chaincode. But what about asking for signatures by corda in this example ?? Its code just shows that we send a request to the validator node of the corda to ask for signatures. Could someone tell me where is the code written for the validators and how do they process these requests for signatures. Is it mentioned in some chaincode as well ?

@peter_somogyvari , @JHamilton , anyone ?? could you please help me in knowing how the validators are working while simple-asset-transfer ?? For example in transferring assets from corda to fabric  , when corda assets have been created and locked , then it asks for signatures from cordaValidators who verify that the assets have been locked. How does it do that exactly ? Where is the code for the validation written ?? What i found in the code is only us sending requests to one of the validators and we get the signature back.

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 15:36:07 GMT):<br/>
@Abhishek2700 
1 They are specifically made for validating, so they are different from peer nodes.
2 As many as you need for HA (assuming that you do). The number of peer nodes are up to the network operator and depends on the chain you are deploying and has no real relation to the number of validator nodes. Minimum recommended validator node count for now: 3. 
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 15:39:47 GMT):<br/>
@Abhishek2700 The client communicates with only one validator but that validator will make sure that the rest of the validators have signed off internally before giving the go-ahead.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 15:45:56 GMT):<br/>
@Abhishek2700 That's because the design isn't finalized yet so methods may be moved around to core or out of core.

> All these methods are using the chaincode to create and get the assets right ? Since we can interact with the blockchain only using chaincodes right ?
Yes, correct.

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 01:44:51 GMT):<br/>
@Abhishek2700 They should be in the logs of the DLT node running the chain code container, maybe double check the log levels? We reduced them recently to increase performance by default

3) We will collaboratively work on design using Github, including organizing tasks in GH project and design content on GH wiki / markdown.  Peter had started on a copy https://github.com/petermetz/blockchain-integration-framework/blob/docs/peter.somogyvari/whitepaper/docs/whitepaper/whitepaper.md and Fujitsu will share their updates post refinement.

I just need to confirm a few more things if you don't mind. I was checking docker logs for the vaidators to see how they are working. Correct  me if i am wrong, according to me here is how it works.

For this transfer suppose corda is sending assets to fabric.
1.) Corda creates and locks asset.
2.) Then it asks corda valdators for the confirmations for this locking of assets by passing in assetId and destination ledger for this asset.

 3.) There are 4 validators which are always competing in an election. At one time among validators , there is one leader and 3 followers. Whenever the first validator gets the signing request , it notifies the leader which uses the getAsset method  and the assetId passed in to the validator to check that the transsaction is valid and that the given asset is locked. 

 Then it gives its approval by signing the message which contains the asset details. 

4.) Then the leader asks the follower validator nodes to check that the asset is locked and further sign the message. Then each follower node individually checks that the asset is locked by using the getAsset method and sign the message and gives it to the leader node for acknowledgement.
  
5.) Then the leader node gets all the signatures as a mark of approval  and when we get these signatures, we give it to the fabric connector which verifies these signatures by using the verify method in the chaincode. RIGHT ??

 
 What i want to know is this

(i) IN step 3 above , when the leader node uses the getAsset chaincode method to see  if the asset is locked. What if i need to call some other method for validating the request the validator gets? Where do i specify it ? Is it something that we set while setting up the validator nodes ??
I just need to know how do i change how the request given to the validator node is processed by the validator node because you said that the validator nodes are specifically made for validation. Where do i need to specify the new validation process if i need to change the given default behaviour it has.?

(ii) What happens if in step 4 , if a follower validator becomes corrupt and is not able to sign the request?  Does the asset transfer still go through if the majority of the validator nodes validates the request?

(iii) What happens if in scenario (ii) above , majority of the validator node gets corrupt and is unable to validate the transfer? Does the asset transfer process stop right there ? Won’t it be a problem , since now the asset has been created and locked in the sender chain but not recreated in the receiving chain .

5.) Then the leader node gets all the signatures as a mark of approval  and when we get these signatures, we give it to the fabric connector which verifies these signatures by using the verify method in the chaincode. RIGHT ??

 
 What i want to know is this

(i) IN step 3 above , when the leader node uses the getAsset chaincode method to see  if the asset is locked. What if i need to call some other method for validating the request the validator gets? Where do i specify it ? Is it something that we set while setting up the validator nodes ??
I just need to know how do i change how the request given to the validator node is processed by the validator node because you said that the validator nodes are specifically made for validation. Where do i need to specify the new validation process if i need to change the given default behaviour it has.?

(ii) What happens if in step 4 , if a follower validator becomes corrupt and is not able to sign the request?  Does the asset transfer still go through if the majority of the validator nodes validates the request?

(iii) What happens if in scenario (ii) above , majority of the validator node gets corrupt and is unable to validate the transfer? Does the asset transfer process stop right there ? Won’t it be a problem , since now the asset has been created and locked in the sender chain but not recreated in the receiving chain .

@peter_somogyvari  ,I just need to confirm a few more things if you don't mind. I was checking docker logs for the vaidators to see how they are working. Correct  me if i am wrong, according to me here is how it works.

For this transfer suppose corda is sending assets to fabric.
1.) Corda creates and locks asset.
2.) Then it asks corda valdators for the confirmations for this locking of assets by passing in assetId and destination ledger for this asset.

 3.) There are 4 validators which are always competing in an election. At one time among validators , there is one leader and 3 followers. Whenever the first validator gets the signing request , it notifies the leader which uses the getAsset method  and the assetId passed in to the validator to check that the transsaction is valid and that the given asset is locked. 

 Then it gives its approval by signing the message which contains the asset details. 

4.) Then the leader asks the follower validator nodes to check that the asset is locked and further sign the message. Then each follower node individually checks that the asset is locked by using the getAsset method and sign the message and gives it to the leader node for acknowledgement.
  
5.) Then the leader node gets all the signatures as a mark of approval  and when we get these signatures, we give it to the fabric connector which verifies these signatures by using the verify method in the chaincode. RIGHT ??

I just need to know how do i change how the request given to the validator node is processed by the validator node because you said that the validator nodes are specifically made for validation. Where do i need to specify the new validation process if i need to change the given default behaviour it has.? Because , right now , it just uses a docker imagee to run the validators.

(ii) What happens if in step 4 , if a follower validator becomes corrupt and is not able to sign the request?  Does the asset transfer still go through if the majority of the validator nodes validates the request?

(iii) What happens if in scenario (ii) above , majority of the validator node gets corrupt and is unable to validate the transfer? Does the asset transfer process stop right there ? Won’t it be a problem , since now the asset has been created and locked in the sender chain but not recreated in the receiving chain .

@Abhishek2700 1-5: Sounds correct, yes.

(i) Right now we are still in the design phase with the plugin architecture so the only way at the moment would be sub-class (or write from scratch) your own connector implementation for the given ledger. I'm literally working on the plugin architecture right now for making this easier to customize as we speak so would love to hear what is the exact use case you are evaluating BIF for! (or as much as you can share).

(ii) Transfer should still go through as long as there is at least one trusted validator alive, but I believe the current code to be buggy when it comes to this: a validator node being dead incorrectly causes the verification to fail. Not tested this just based on what I read in the code it looks like it doesn't tolerate any validators being down.

(iii) Per design the transfer should succeed as long as at least one validator is alive. We don't yet have a rollback safety mecnanism in case all of the validators went down so the transaction would stop there with current codebase, but the assets are also can be unlocked so eventual consistency can be guaranteed with some improvements (that are coming). 
Locking an asset in our current contracts is NOT irreversible the way sending coins to a dead address on one of the permissionless ledgers is (locking is reversible by the contract itself). 
The design idea here is to have a persistent transaction state storage for BIF that survives downtime. Going back to the plugin architecture again: said transaction storage backend should be pluggable so that if you deploy BIF you can pick what you prefer (maybe you want some p2p storage, or just pay a cloud provider to have an RDBMS do synchronous replication to different regions)

@peter_somogyvari , thanks a lot , really appreciate it . I got the file Validator.js at package/core/src where the getAsset method is being called to validate the transaction and then it is using the response  from that method  which is being signed. THis was the thing i was looking for , now if i wanted to change the criteria for validation , i would just have to make some changes here . Thanks

dear community, regarding the new contributors sessions, i made the judgement call to start from Jan 20th US / Jan 21st eastern time zones.  this is because i want us to stick to our goal of closing design principles by Mon 20th and also because Peter is drafting a spec for the plugin archihtecture (whats in core vs what is a plugin, as well as interface and perhaps some other goodness if he is inspired ;-) ).  so want to promptly get your feedback! please also bring ideas about how we can parallelize the design, with different people owning different modules / capabilities.  thanks and have a great weekend!

Hi @peter_somogyvari , i have a few more doubts regarding the validators.

1.) The validators present in the example are running in dockers on the same server, will the code change if the validators are different nodes present on different servers in a real life example or do i have to just change the ips in the code for the validators to work.

2.) All the validators right now use etcd1,etcd2,etcd3 as services when they run in dockers. I looked into it and its a key value store. So are they being used for database for the that we are setting in the chaincode or are  they just being used for the election purpose.

3.) If i have a few validator nodes that are set up on different servers, will the etcd services be running on each validator or will there be a central server where we will run the etcd sservices and it will be shared  by all validator nodes/servers.

[design principles]

Hi, everyone!
I make a new proposal of design principles based on the current version.
I would like to explain about it on tomorrow phone meeting.
The proposal is as the attached slide.

(c.f.) the current version of design principles:

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 00:35:12 GMT):<br/>
@Abhishek2700 

1.) As the operator of a cluster you are responsible for making sure that there is network connectivity between the nodes. Whether it's a software defined networking environment (like what Docker Compose gives us) or a physical network it doesn't matter: as long as there is connectivity to the addresses/hosts you supply in the config, it should work. There is a caveat with cross data center or cross region deployments that I noted down here for reference: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/issues/63

2.) They are strictly just for leader election at the moment. In the future (long term) we intend to re-design the system so that leader election for validators is either a) not needed at all or b) it is embedded in the validator codebase itself (e.g. a Typescript Raft algorithm implementation)

3.) It's up to the person who performs the installation. Etcd servers don't need to be on the same machine as the validators and their numbers don't need to match the number of validators either. Etcd works best when it has an odd number of nodes in a cluster.

What i want to do now is to remove the election functionality among validator nodes and make the validation process sequential.

1.)  I Have tried removing the follower and leader  properties from the yml file of the federattion. 

2.) I have also tried stopping the election process by commenting out 
  this.setupLeaderElections();

</p>
<p><strong>Abhishek2700</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 06:32:07 GMT):<br/>
But when i rebuild the federation image and restart the fabric validators , i still see the election happening in the fabric validator node logs
</p>
<p><strong>Abhishek2700</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 06:34:15 GMT):<br/>
I just want to turn off the election process and just want to request public keys and heartbeat , sequential .

So if i want to ask for a public key of a validator , i just wantto create a socket connection with it and send a request and based on the request type , i want to send the response. Could you please help me with this
</p>
<p><strong>Abhishek2700</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 07:49:48 GMT):<br/>
I just tried removing the etcd service and ow its not running and i also stopped the setupLeaderElections method to be invoked in the validator.js file.  But the election is still going on. Each validator node is tryingto be the leader but since etcd service are not working , we are getting an error there. 

 What i want to do is stop the parallel validation altogether.
</p>
<p><strong>Abhishek2700</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 10:00:39 GMT):<br/>
I did try some more things to remove the etcd dependency of the validators but the logs still say that the validators require etcd . 
  
So my question is ,
Does the validator nodes right now require the etcd service internally or is it optional and we can remove it?

 If it is optional , can you please tell me what changes do i have to make to make it work without etcd?

 Also , whatever changes i am making in the Validator.js file. It is not being reflected in the logs for the validators.
  
 I also restarted the fabric peer nodes and remade the  image for the validators. It is still not showing the additional console.log line i am putting in the file Validator.js at packages/core/src/Validator.js .  
 
 I also tried stopping the election in the constructor but it is still not working. Is there anything i am missing?

<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 04:10:17 GMT):<br/>
@Abhishek2700  to clarify, right now the leader election is mandatory, not optional.  we do have a desire to make this optional in a future version so it will be helpful if you create a feature request to describe how you would like this to work and we can have this context in a ticket https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 04:12:06 GMT):<br/>
it also looks like you are trying to modify the code but the changes are not making it into the validator node container... perhaps an NPM or docker caching issue?  can you explain a bit the  commands you are using to update?
</p>
<p><strong>Abhishek2700</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 04:21:04 GMT):<br/>
@JHamilton , i wanted to remove the election process and confirmed from here that etcd is being used for this. So tried to remove etcd from the yml file that is being used for starting the federation servers. 
 
This starts the dockers but the logs say that it needs the etcd functionality. SO i tried stopping the election in the  Validation constructor that according to me is being used to initialise the validators. Then i restarted the validators but the logs still say that the election is still going on and the nodes are trying to be the leader but since  the etcd service are removed from the yml file , it cannot find it and after 25 attempts to be the leader , its logs gives error that etcd hosts not found.

  I also tried rebuilding the image after i made the changes in the yml file . In fact  i restarted the whole network and restarted the whole thing but the election is still going on. So what i wanted to confirm was if the elction process ca be stopped for now
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 04:30:35 GMT):<br/>
i'll let @peter_somogyvari chime in with more details, but my guidance is we take an approach to define how we want it election feature to work (e.g. configuration option) and the use that to drive a solution.  i'm still learning the ropes of working in open community but would like to do that in the context of a GH ticket so it's there for posterity.  so would appreciate your help in defining via feature request ticket.  what do you think?

	1. No news on project proposal.  Hart please respond if anything the group should be aware of
	2. Discussed Fujitsu feedback that Peter will start applying.  Requested that going forward Fujitsu team provide feedback directly on PR and that if any use case scope they could own (e.g. non-financial exchange).
	3. Reviewed Hart's PR feedback and plan to address
	4. Confirmed intention to setup a meal or drinks at the Hyperledger Global Forum (Shingo, Takuma, Hart, Mic, & Peter will be intention)
	5. Given the contributors session on Mar 2 will be during contributors forum, will move that session up by a week (Feb 24 same time)

Hi everyone!

This is a feedback to the Whitepaper draft which is found at pull-request: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/pull/98 .
(especially, topics about use-cases and interworking patterns)

I prepared my comments in the attached presentation, and I will add some explanations at next conference call.
I'd like to hear other participants' opinions on the meeting.

Best regards,
Takuma

Key takeaways from today's session Feb 17 / 18th; please clarify anything I have missed / misstated:
* Whitepaper feedback from @sfuji822  & @takeutak will be incorporated / merged
* Then whitepaper will be published to master as "WIP" with open request for feedback
* Request to divide & conquer as much as possible over next week
* @hartm  will start drafting project proposal, in order to start getting TSC / community feedback

Hart, you probably already know this, but there is a template on the wiki and a place for proposing new projects : https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/createpage-entervariables.action?templateId=3112984&spaceKey=HYP&newSpaceKey=HYP&fromPageId=2392298
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 14:46:47 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt Yep!  My google doc is based on that.  I figure it's easier for everyone to comment/edit in google docs for a while before we move to github.

Just created a new draft PR on the whitepaper: added a list of people with names and email addresses who helped making it this far. If anybody feels like they don't want to be on that list please let me know (or just change it directly). And of course if I forgot anyone, apologies and please let me know or just add yourselves (please keep the alphabetical ordering in place)

I'll wait a few days to make sure that everyone gets a chance to look at it.

FYI: Opened a 'frequently asked questions' page on the github wiki of BIF, added a couple of entries => https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/wiki/FAQ
If you have ideas on what else should be added either add it or just throw me a message with the idea and I can hash it out there. Would be nice to have a bunch of answers there related to first time contributions, build system and other mechanical things that aren't design related but still help people consume the big picture faster.

I have a request.
My correct name is "Takuma Takeuchi" ("Takuma" is my first name, "Takeuchi" is my family name). That is NOT "Takeuchi Takuma".
Would you mind if you revise my name on the people list on the whitepaper draft?

Meeting minutes from our BIF contributors call on the 24th of February, 2020:
-Everyone's excited about HGF
- We'll have a technical collaboration session on Thursday at 9 AM or Friday at 9 AM - subject to room availability. Action item for Peter to book the room and notify the team of the outcome.
- Hart will work on the project proposal, the plan is to be ready for HGF
- We agreed that the latest whitepaper pull request is approved, action item for Peter to merge it in.
- We'll start working on the code base integration after the architecture design is finished (currently some of the sections are still short on details or just outright 'TBD')
</p>
<p><strong>sfuji822</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 11:14:45 GMT):<br/>
Question. Regarding HGF, should we reserve a table at BOF session ? or we can get another breakout room to draft white paper and proposal document ?

Hi Peter, thank you very much on hosting F2F meeting at Phoenix. I believe all of participants had great time with getting fruitful result. BTW, as par conversation on the meeting, can you request to give Takuma (takeutak) Maintainer privilege on BIF's github repository for starting actual coding ?

Hello all. Could I use this framework to integrate HL Indy features into HL Fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:38:52 GMT):<br/>

I received confirmation that we can have the conference room in our hotel Thursday morning (right now it's open all day Thursday and Friday). Will send a map showing which one it is (Westin)

Hey @doomguy we are planning on adding support through plugins to as many ledgers as possible, but there isn't one for Indy as of right now. Also depends on your use-case so I'd love to hear what is it that you mean by integrating Indy features into Fabric because it could help influence our plugin design in a meaningful way. 
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 18:55:19 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, figured it out after my first coffee of the day kicked in. :-) You meant the BIF session of ours.
I'm happy to stay at the convention center as well, but if we need it, I have the reservation for us in the Westin:

ROOM 1:  Cobalt Room, 12th floor:  Large client meeting space for 30ppl.  Boardroom-style set.
Chairs, table, power, basic beverages (coffee, tea, water).
Also asked them to provide a large screen monitor or projector so that we can collaborate without having to huddle over a single laptop.
</p>
<p><strong>doomguy</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 07:43:17 GMT):<br/>
Hi @peter_somogyvari  !
I mean something like https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/cordentity OR https://github.com/Luxoft/cordentity

These projects combine HL Indy ledger and decentralized identity features with Corda Platform.

I'm looking for a similar thing but with Fabric instead of Corda.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 08:24:01 GMT):<br/>
Checked it out and the answer is a definite yes. Down the line, we want to be able to authenticate people with their identities on any indy ledger, sign attestations, etc.
I do have to say that we are at the design phase, so it will take some time before it gets added, but my personal opinion is that it's a must have to support it in a very similar fashion (but through plugins of ours) as cordentity does.

I've put in some more work on a tentative project proposal document, and I think a first draft is ready.  It's not perfect, but would probably suffice if we wanted to propose the BIF for project incubation status.  Let me know what you think!  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kxylkfVKG_zdNfuzhrmhnYAM_eROwLsoLgIp3XjKNr0/edit?usp=sharing  Thanks!

@RahulDesai Which directory are you in and what command did you execute? Is it possible that you were not in the docs/whitepaper directory? I assume you were trying to build the pdf version of the whitepaper with the make task.

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 05 Mar 2020 06:31:10 GMT):<br/>
@RahulDesai  Oh sorry, misread the question. You are in the examples folder. :-)
Looked at it, we recently added an extra step to build the containers so you need to also run:

npm run fabric:api:build

Sorry I didn't catch that earlier. We merged in a PR on Sunday for containerizing the Fabric API and the documentation wasn't updated 100% yet

*Contributor Meeting Minutes - 2020 March 16th*

- Hart will initiate conversations about the proposal to test the waters before a potential TSC vote. We will decide next actions according to the initial feedback from this.
- Shingo-san and Takeuchi-san will work include the project names in the proposal document
- Shingo-san and Takeuchi-san will work on the forth section of the whitepaper hashing out design details
- Peter will try to consolidate the code base and make the first time user experience more pleasant
- Peter will add a use-case to the whitepaper related to migration (which was already contributed by Rafael in separate PR)
- We will ask Mic to help out with the PDO specific parts of the design in the whitepaper. Peter will do a code level POC on us supporting the PDO.

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 18:17:06 GMT):<br/>
The code consolidation now has an initial draft PR link below. Still very much work in progress so don't have high expectations, but regardless I wanted to put it out here so everyone can see what's happening:

Hi everyone!

The next BIF meeting is scheduled on April 13.
As my previous assumption, our proposal to TSC was scheduled on April 9, then
we should have discussed about countermeasures about TSC meeting on the next BIF meeting.
But our proposal to TSC has been rescheduled on TSC meeting at April 16.

Then, I'm sure that we should reschedule the next BIF phone meeting from April 13 to April 20, which makes us more speedy to discuss about the countermeasures.

Would you mind if you postpone BIF meeting 1 week later (April 20)?
If you have any other idea, could you share with me?

@takeutak I think it's fine to go ahead and have the meeting on April 13th.  We should probably discuss our plans for presenting to the TSC in advance, and that meeting is a great time to do it.  If we need to have a meeting to discuss revisions on the 20th, then we can schedule it after the TSC meeting on the 16th.

Re: [Hyperledger TSC] Blockchain Integration Framework--Project Incubation Proposal and Dan Miiddleton's question: How are rollbacks/forks in either network resolved? The answer "some kind of outside verification setup seems to be required.  If anyone has more elegant ideas, then we would be more than open to suggestions." I've been reading Alberts for elegant ideas from microbiology. BIF seems to be mimicking genetic transcription.

Good presentation on rational for plugins design for BIF. Federated Wiki also uses plugins and node. To help make plugins trusted wiki uses Miller's Caja https://github.com/fedwiki. Deno version is just underway https://github.com/joshuabenuck/seran-wiki

Making blockchain integration easier could go a long way to helping HL projects gain adoption. 195,518 decentralized facilities have registered with FDA for Food Safely Modernization Act (FSMA). Next up is, the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) 2023 that pushes the pharmaceutical industry to quickly improve upon supply chain traceability in an interoperable manner to address supply chain logistics in at least 17 countries. https://diginomica.com/critical-role-it-assuring-food-safety-pandemic-times

Thanks Clive, we do our best. :-) This federated wiki project looks cool, especially the deno port. I have high hopes for Deno one day becoming the de-facto runtime the way NodeJS is today, especially on account of the security enhancements which will only become more important each year. In a perfect world I would also push for BIF to run on Deno, but resources must be prioritized. :)

Key outcomes from today's BIF Contributors; please respond if I missed / misstated anything
1. Hart & Peter have prepared answers to questions raised in Arpil 16th TSC, including those on Identity
2. Takuma has also prepared sequence diagrams to address question raised on use cases
3. Takuma will share deck and Peter will send this along with #1 by EoD US 21st
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 02:49:18 GMT):<br/>

Hi everyone!

I created a pull-request in order to reflect the enhanced use case of asset transfer (section 2.1: Ethereum to Quorum Asset Transfer) in our whitepaper, which was agreed at BIF phone meeting (April 20).
Would you mind if you confirm the following one?
pull-request(#125): https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/pull/125
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 22 Apr 2020 13:42:09 GMT):<br/>
Done, thank you very much!
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 15:01:41 GMT):<br/>
another step!  is it worth making visible recurring maintainers call?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 15:28:10 GMT):<br/>
We have our regular call this Monday.  We've advertised it, but yes, it's probably useful to point it out.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 15:28:39 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to start a google doc with answers for the questions that were brought up today.  I'll send it out once I make some progress.

</p>
<p><strong>cliveb</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 17:51:53 GMT):<br/>
Could a developer create a domain specific plugin for BIF to transport data to HL projects. e.g. for FDA traceability above? 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 19:05:42 GMT):<br/>
@cliveb If you look in the whitepaper, food traceability across multiple blockchains is a featured application.  Presumably tracing drugs would be a very similar application.

Re: "traceability (section 2.6) when “supplies” move across different...   Could BIF be used as a transporter between disparate ERPs used by food/pharma manufactures and HL Fabric. i.e. any roadblock to developers (like me) creating BIF plugins that transport from SQL databases to HL blockchain?    
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 24 Apr 2020 20:03:15 GMT):<br/>
@cliveb That's a great observation.  I presume it would work (I can't be 100% certain), although you would clearly need to write your own BIF plugin for your SQL database and your SQL database would need to have some kind of cryptographic identity. 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 24 Apr 2020 20:04:09 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to add in @takeutak and @sfuji822 who have worked on this application (I haven't worked with this one specifically).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 24 Apr 2020 20:04:28 GMT):<br/>
It might be a while until you get a response from them, though, unfortunately, because next week is Golden Week (a big holiday in Japan).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 24 Apr 2020 20:05:24 GMT):<br/>
I guess it should work if your database can handle general blockchain logic, which should be the case.

@hartm and I were discussing next steps. I can move the code easily, but creating the wiki before having a name is problematic. Mailing lists as well.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:55:44 GMT):<br/>
I propose moving the code and punting on everything else until the name is decided
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:56:16 GMT):<br/>
@rjones That sounds good to me.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:56:32 GMT):<br/>
OK. Next question: are you moving to Azure Pipelines for CI/CD? Please say yes.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:56:33 GMT):<br/>
We need to go through marketing approval to get the name anyways, so that could take a bit.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:56:55 GMT):<br/>
oh wait, I see you're on circle CI, we're good.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:57:28 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 16:13:08 GMT):<br/>
CI is sort of a moving target at the moment for us, will definitely look into AZP because CircleCI has this issue that it cannot trigger builds for PRs, only actual branch commits... :/

Off-topic: @rjones Is the code move just a one to one copy from the labs GH org to the main one or is there something else that you are changing along the way as well? (I know the name will have to be changed later)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 16:13:47 GMT):<br/>
it's a direct move. GitHub also silently fixes up your remotes for a while
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 16:19:18 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to get this merged, in some form, before the move. https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/pull/126

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 15:20:21 GMT):<br/>
Yes, will do.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 17:47:00 GMT):<br/>
in the architecture working group meeting today we talked about how to provide an authoritative description of a distributed ledger that might include descriptions of consensus algorithms, transaction commit rates, etc... this information could be used to create (in theory) a more formal description of the characteristics of a multiple-chain transaction. @hartm  @peter_somogyvari would you be available to come into the AWG meeting in two weeks to help us figure out what your requirements might be?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 17:50:51 GMT):<br/>
I'd be happy to come and talk then, sure.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 17:51:05 GMT):<br/>
What kind of preparation would we need to do?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 17:51:17 GMT):<br/>
(I would have come today but had a VDF meeting I needed to attend).
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 18:03:30 GMT):<br/>
I'm happy to show up as well (and apologies that I haven't so far, I'm still working on the schedule).
The first thing that comes to my mind that we need 100% is some enum/boolean (I prefer enums even when there's only 2 possible values to begin with) property describing whether the ledger with the given consensus algorithm has transaction finality. A lot of modern ledgers have pluggable consensus so it's probably wiser to actually have the transaction finality property specified for consensus algorithms and the ledger instance should describe the algorithm it's running on so one could retrieve information about transaction finality with a reference chain like this: 
`ledger.consensusAlgorithm.transactionFinality == TransactionFinality.GUARANTEED` or `ledger.consensusAlgorithm.transactionFinality == TransactionFinality.NOT_GUARANTEED`

And then for a BIF transaction proposal one could write code that examines the to-be participating ledgers transaction finality and take action if there's a mismatch.

`Transaction commit rates`: Do you mean from a performance/throughput perspective or specific to the algorithm's configuration (like block size, number of transactions per mined block, etc?)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 21:58:09 GMT):<br/>
@hartm no preparation, i think we want to talk about the general problem of how to build self-describing ledgers such that we could reason about applications built on those ledgers... 
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:00:57 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari i understand the boolean on finality as a first step, but remember that even ledgers with finality "are not all the same"; they may have the same semantics but have very different trust (e.g. you might trust a ledger with multiple organizations participating in the ordering and validation of transactions more than you trust a ledger with an ordering service provided by a single organization)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:01:42 GMT):<br/>
and... then we have the question about why we would believe a ledger that makes a claim about itself
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:02:43 GMT):<br/>
or... by what authority does a ledger claim that a transaction has been committed
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:03:44 GMT):<br/>
some of these questions are ones i've had for a while & are consistent, i think, with some of the concerns that angelo asked in the review
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:07:29 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman Yeah, I remember these coming up. Have you seen the response we provided regarding trust/authority on the TSC list? It's possible that it fell through the cracks because I haven't had time yet to include it in the whitepaper or anywhere else for that matter (hoping to add it soon though).
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:08:46 GMT):<br/>
The answer on the TSC list was just an anecdotal one, there wasn't any formal specs included there, but I agree we should work towards that.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:19:28 GMT):<br/>
yes, i saw the response. i think we need to keep separate what is "useful" and what is "provable"... "useful" works well with out of band information between a small set of parties; "provable" will be necessary in a world where there are "many" ledgers and out of band trust is not sufficient
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:27:11 GMT):<br/>
We'd be happy to discuss these things in two weeks.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:27:17 GMT):<br/>
To answer some of your questions:
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:27:59 GMT):<br/>
If you don't believe a ledger making a claim on itself, then there's no reason to believe anything about the ledger period--so if this is the case, there's no value in doing a transaction on the ledger at all.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:28:44 GMT):<br/>
You can have a ledger perform a consensus validation of a particular state to verify that a transaction has been committed.  Alternatively, you could simplify this a lot using threshold signatures, but this is a lot to ask.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:29:03 GMT):<br/>
We'd be happy to field questions like this.  In fact, it'd be very useful for us.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:29:07 GMT):<br/>
So let's plan on two weeks then.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:57:29 GMT):<br/>
for a security guy you sure are trusting! :grin: 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:57:52 GMT):<br/>
Ouch!
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:58:20 GMT):<br/>
point is that a ledger is a collective and as a collective may be trusted, but individual validators may lie through their teeth
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:58:43 GMT):<br/>
Right--that's why you need some collective ledger validation.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:59:02 GMT):<br/>
And why I said threshold signatures are an ideal primitive for this.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:59:18 GMT):<br/>
so i think all of these issues... what can we say about a ledger become very interesting
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:59:42 GMT):<br/>
who has the right to sign? how do you know who the current set of validators is?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 00:00:08 GMT):<br/>
again... very trusting. i'm disappointed in you hart! ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 00:01:37 GMT):<br/>
fwiw... i think we again need to think about useful and provable as two different things... where useful is "acceptable risk" and it is defined in terms of what my application is willing to accept as "truth"
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 00:03:24 GMT):<br/>
for BIF (or whatever its called now), in the short term i think "useful" dominates and we should be able to do something fairly straightforward, when the "trust" has to be automated, things get more interesting
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 00:09:49 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's a great point.  Right now we are "hardcoding" trust into use cases, so everything is pretty simple.  If you want to do things dynamically, then it gets really complicated.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 00:11:52 GMT):<br/>
This is a great topic for further discussion.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 00:12:03 GMT):<br/>
We'd be happy to talk about at at the arch meeting or also at the BIF meeting.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 00:34:47 GMT):<br/>
Is the name decided now?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 00:35:09 GMT):<br/>
If so, I will start turning the crank for the wiki and the like post-TSC call
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 00:47:31 GMT):<br/>
It's been narrowed down but haven't been finalized still from what I understood based on the emails.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 00:48:22 GMT):<br/>
I'm hoping we can finalize this tonight, @rjones 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 01:01:56 GMT):<br/>
 I just sent out an email on this.
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:02:03 GMT):<br/>
@sfuji822 @takeutak can you please weigh in on the proposed name of Cactus?  if we have alignment from maintainers then we can bypass time to vote
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:02:22 GMT):<br/>
Peter and I are good with the name
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:02:49 GMT):<br/>
as is Brian Behlendorf 😎
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:03:06 GMT):<br/>
 @JHamilton They did in a meeting last night, and they are good with it.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:03:10 GMT):<br/>
I thought my email expressed that.
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:03:21 GMT):<br/>
apparently not, i will respond to Jessica
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:03:37 GMT):<br/>
@takeutak even suggested the name to begin with!
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:05:27 GMT):<br/>
👏
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:55:07 GMT):<br/>
should I rename this channel or start a new one?
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:56:22 GMT):<br/>
i vote rename so history retained
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:57:53 GMT):<br/>
@here when do you want me to rename and move the repo?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:59:29 GMT):<br/>
Rename for sure.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:59:56 GMT):<br/>
I guess we just need some kind of official approval?

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 18:35:59 GMT):<br/>
(just curious)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 18:37:14 GMT):<br/>
your call. I think you have the ability to rename this channel as you please - I'm not stuck on the name
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 18:39:17 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we need two channels, not for now at least, but at the same time I'd first just call it 'cactus' so that nobody gets the feeling that they are not welcome on the channel unless they are a 'contributor'. So, I'll probably propose to rename it to just Cactus.

Did we lose the commit lint bot with the repo migration? Just wondering because it should've been complaining that the commit message wasn't in the required format (I know, I'm a stickler, but we need that for the automated change log generation)
</p>

#cactus   hope all are keeping well.  

one of the things we ran out of time for in this weeks call (with 0.2 vs. 0.3 agenda item) was about hygiene of ensuring PRs are tied to issues.  this helps the maintainers and the broader community have visibility on the work in-progress and the desired work.  https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/issues

with our project status we have access to Jira but for now suggest we continue using GH issues, which has a nice template feature tied into contributing.  https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

we can use this as a way to structure our work remaining for 0.2 vs. objectives for 0.3 and better enable async collaboration.  https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/projects/1

any concerns about this approach or better ways to tackle?

It would be great if one or more of you could present on cactus on the Identity Working Group- especially the digital identity usecase that you outlined, or how management of multiple identities (from the same holder) on different chains can help interoperability. It can be as early as this Wednesday 12 pm. EST. This could drive some identity experts to participate in Cactus.  The cross-chain identity conundrum should be addressed.

At the last Cactus meeting (May 18 USA time), I heard that the Cactus meeting on May 25 USA time would be canceled due to the holiday in USA.  Is this correct?

I found that the meeting on May 25 USA time still remains in Hyperledger public schecule.

@VipinB I'm working on a PR for our first identity related plugin that (when plugged in) basically gives you an Open ID Connect Identity Provider and authorization server so that what's in the whitepaper's `2.7` use case (direct link below) is slowly but surely becomes achievable. 

Use case from whitepaper: 
https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/master/whitepaper/whitepaper.md#27-end-user-wallet-authenticationauthorization

My fork's branch for the OIDC plugin (frequently changes and gets force pushed so watch out!) => 
https://github.com/petermetz/blockchain-integration-framework/tree/feature/open-id-connect-web-service-plugin

Regarding presenting this Wednesday: a little early because I myself still have a lot questions about how this or that would work *exactly* in the implementation so it might not be too stimulating for the audience just yet, BUT definitely sign me up for the following meeting (e.g. first one after the one this Wednesday). :-)

Hi @amalcs23  Yes! We have explanations with detailed diagrams in the whitepaper use cases section here (link below) and actual code level demonstrations I can point you to some automated tests that we have but those only cover the most basic of things like deploying contracts on different supported ledgers via the plugins written for said ledgers. The tests are enforced by CI to always pass so in theory you can clone the project yourself and just run the `./tools/ci.sh` script on your machine and see the tests in action or even attach a debugger to them and just step through it to see it all. And please keep in mind: this is all work in progress. :-)

Whitepaper, direct link to the use cases section:

Hi @peter_somogyvari 
What is mean by BIF?
Is it Blockchain Integration Framework or Blockchain Interoperability Framework?
How HL Catcus is defined?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 06:32:08 GMT):<br/>
@amalcs23 BIF is the old name of the project before it was approved to be in the greenhouse. It stood for `Blockchain Integration Framework`.
Cactus came to be by way of being picked from a list of potential ones and got approved by the relevant Hyperledger teams (marketing and legal I believe). Is that what you mean by `How HL Catcus is defined?` ?

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Sat, 30 May 2020 02:22:25 GMT):<br/>
@dmproof Glad to hear that! Welcome to the community! There's a million things that needs doing, but you should work on something that you enjoy instead of consider menial. Do you prefer hands on code or design+diagrams? If you have a specific ledger that you are a fan of and would love to see it supported (and it isn't yet) then creating all-in-one docker images for that ledger is the way to start then you can write the connector plugin for it (and prove that it works with automated tests via the CI script) 
If that's your fancy there's always test coverage that needs increasing, but usually people are not stoked about working on that. :-)
So just let me know if there's a particular topic that interests you and we can narrow it down from there.

<p><strong>dmproof</strong> (Sat, 30 May 2020 05:42:51 GMT):<br/>
hi peter, i prefer to code initially to learn more about how everything works. test coverage to get familiar with things never hurts either. is there any type of voting, request or in demand list for porting certain ledgers/block chains? and is there a list of currently supported blockchains/ledgers or ones being worked on? to me vechain or corda might be two interesting candidates. Are there any criteria for determining compatibility matrix of a ledger? Or just have to look at current example? . Id prefer to work on something code related that would benefit the project the most from a code perspective.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Sat, 30 May 2020 06:05:57 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good. There is a process for getting changes approved, yes, there has to be at least two maintainers in approval of any given pull request. With that said, adding a new ledger to the list of supported ones is a very low-key change (thanks to the plugin architecture which we invested into heavily from early on) so adding support for new ledgers is not something I would expect to be opposed by any of the maintainers. With that said of course, you can always open a github issue with the feature request issue template and write it down there that you wish to add this contribution and before you invest any of your time and effort (which we very much value!) you would like to get preliminary confirmation that nobody has any problem with the idea/feature on a high level. This is just an optional step in case you want to be extra sure. I personally can tell your right now as one of the maintainers that I'd love to get new ledgers added. Corda is being worked on as we speak, but we can talk about vechain for sure, but here I also have to be honest and upfront about the fact that we are not yet production ready (we are a top level project within Hyperledger, but with a status of "incubation"). So at present when we add a supported ledger we only go as far as contract deployment through the plugin implementing the ledger so if you are looking to contribute a fully featured implementation and expect to use it to interop vechain with other ledgers right after the fact, that will have to wait a little longer (we'll definitely get there, but I'm trying not to over-promise or hype anything because we'd rather get the trust of people long term than get everyone excited and then disappear). Regarding the criteria for ledger compatibility: we want to support every ledger that at least has the capability to read and write block data and the ability to have smart contracts deployed on it. It's a pretty low bar that we set like that intentionally because the goal of the project is making as many ledgers as possible work together even if certain cross-ledger operations have to happen in some downgraded way because one ledger has a feature that the other does not (e.g. transaction privacy). The currently supported list of ledgers is evolving all the time (and note that by support I don't yet mean full support just that we've laid out some ground work and started working on it). Right now, the latest is this: we have besu and quorum ledger plugins set up with automated tests deploying contracts and making that functionality available through the API server as well through REST calls which  are conveniently callable through the SDK which runs on NodeJS and browser as well. (I'm happy to show you around the relevant code components for all of this by the way, just let me know). What's in the works is corda and Fabric 1.4 (for both of those we start with an all-in-one docker image for enabling scalable test automation). So, circling back to code... if you want to get started with a vechain integration then my first question is, can you make an all-in-one style docker image that -upon the launching of the container- pulls up a testable  (but not production ready by any means) ledger implementation? The requirements would be basically the same as for any other ledger, as an example you could take a look at what I wrote down for Jacob who is working on the exact same all-in-one image just for Corda: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/issues/143

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Sat, 30 May 2020 06:08:03 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for putting us out there! :-)
</p>
<p><strong>dmproof</strong> (Sat, 30 May 2020 07:14:35 GMT):<br/>
for the all in one docker image id have to see if I can do it, whatever ledger it would be. I am familiar with docker and most languages that nothing should be too far out of reach. I am not using any ledger currently outside some occasional fabric testing. corda and vechain were just two that I knew of and am somewhat more familiar with corda. Are there any popular or other interesting options you might have in mind to look at? or would vechain be a good place to start? 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 30 May 2020 13:13:49 GMT):<br/>
you're doing the work!
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Sat, 30 May 2020 20:13:26 GMT):<br/>
If you ask me, for popular/interesting ones, personally, I would look at Burrow because that's the one I know of, but looking at Vechain (now that you brought it my attention) it does also look like a potential good candidate because they seem to have made good effort on containerization => https://github.com/vechain/thor#docker Not sure if that docker image of theirs meets all our requirements (no host binding of ports/volumes of any kind) but its definitely a good start when a ledger already has a single image that you can use to pull up a working/testable node of theirs. For some more interesting stuff (again just personal opinions) I would also want to explore how/what kind of integration could we do with DAML (which is a smart contract language not a ledger). I can imagine us being able to deploy smart contracts in both the ledger-native language and also in DAML (where the ledger is DAML-compatible). This could actually turn into a bigger piece of work because if it works then some or all of our existing ledger plugins could also be updated with DAML support. This one is sort of a wild card instead of just being about development one would have to also delve into the architecture/design first to make sure it all makes sense at the end of the day. Lastly, if you happen to know any ledgers that are out there and popular among developers, that's always a good candidate for us to have support for just based on the popularity. Anyway, bottom line is: If you look into adding vechain I think that's a great start.

@amalcs23 documentation is still being worked on but if you want to look at the code specifically, then I can recommend taking a look at one of the higher level test cases (can also run them).
One like this for example: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/master/packages/cactus-test-plugin-ledger-connector-quorum/src/test/typescript/integration/plugin-ledger-connector-quorum/deploy-contract/deploy-contract-via-web-service.ts

You can also run the CI script to set everything up as long as you are in an environment that can run shell scripts, on Windows it should work through WSL.
CI script can be executed just by doing
`./tools/ci.sh`

Hi
</p>
<p><strong>DOBEN</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 13:25:06 GMT):<br/>
It might be a bit too early to discuss here how Cactus will implement escrow contracts for token/coin transfer, since Cactus seems to focus on non-fungible asset transfer between ledgers by locking the assets and then releasing a representation of it at another ledger at the moment. Nonetheless, I wanted to share some thoughts. My current understanding is that cactus wants to achieve an atomic inter-blockchain transfer of tokens/coins with escrow contracts in the future. That means that either the complete transfer is conducted or all participants are completely refunded and no partial transfer is done if an error occurs. I want to talk about this last step when an escrow contract is supposed to refund its locked up tokens to the original owner if the atomic inter-blockchain transfer failed for whatever reason. In case the escrow contract is written in solidity on the Ethereum blockchain and locks up Ether, I am not sure if this last transaction can always successfully refund the Ether (even after retrying to send the transaction several times). I am not referring to the problem that permissionless blockchains might fork and hence some transactions might not end up in the best chain. The problem that the Ether refund might fail forever is that the address where the Ether is sent to might be a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain which has a malicious or accidentally malfunctioning receive() or fallback() function.
</p>
<p><strong>DOBEN</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 13:25:25 GMT):<br/>
In more detail, if the original address (the address used for locking up the Ether in the escrow contract) is an externally owned account (EOA), then it should be possible to always send Ether to that address. But if the original address is a contract account (CA), then there are several reasons why this external call could fail. If the receiving address is a contract, it could have a fallback()/receive() function implemented that simply throws an exception, once it gets called. Another reason for failure is running out of gas.

https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html
https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common-patterns.html#withdrawal-from-contracts

People recommend using the pull-over-push pattern to shift the risk associated with transferring Ether to the user or at least making sure that a failed Ether transfer does not block any code in the escrow contract after the failed Ether transaction has thrown an exception and every state change is reverted. This pattern is safer but it does not solve the problem that the escrow contract is unable to refund the Ether locked up.
Since we cannot influence or check the code at the contract account (CA) before sending the Ether. We have to expect that some refund transactions will not be possible. That means that some Ether might end up being locked up forever in the escrow contract.

It could be argued that it is the responsibility of the receiver to make sure that the address is able to receive the money back but there are also disadvantages on the escrow contract side and reasons why somebody might behave like this even though they loose money.
</p>
<p><strong>DOBEN</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 13:25:39 GMT):<br/>
1. We cannot guarantee that the inter-blockchain transfer is atomic which was the goal of cactus.
2. Somebody might just send very small amounts of Ether and does not care if the address is able to receive Ether back. The transaction still costs gas which might prevent such spamming in Ethereum but in other protocols with no gas cost this might be possible. It is a kind of spamming attack and the escrow contract ends up being a garbage collector.
2. There will be at least one person who accidentally locks up 100000 Ether and then cries and ask us for help.
3. People are curious to see how cactus or the other connected blockchains are behaving in such a scenario and playing around/ testing the limits of this feature.
4. It would be good to at least donate such money rather than locking it up.

There might be some workaround to only allow EOA to lock up assets with “require(tx.origin == msg.sender)” but is it really that we want to disallow any CA to interact with the escrow contract. There are also very big warnings to use tx.origin in require expressions because of security issues.
My second workaround that I though of was creating an escrow contract for every two parties that want to transfer the value among them and then use selfdestruct() (ether sent cannot be blocked in this function) to refund the ether but this also causes probably new issues.

Additional comment: If the inter-blockchain transfer is successful and the escrow contract is supposed to pay out the locked ether to its new owner. The same problem occurs that some ether might be locked up forever.

In Fabric: The escrow pay out might also have problems if the certification authority revoked the credentials of the user or if its certificate has been expired meanwhile or if the organisation of the user left the network. The user might be already removed from the user database when the refund transaction should take place.

@DOBEN My understanding, the initial goal of Cactus is not to guarantee that the inter-blockchain transfer is atomic. Rather, Cactus design principle is to prevent double spending where possible. Cactus is in charge of the inter-blockchain bridge not the blockchain databases on either of the blockchain integration framework. An analogy, Leonhard Euler proved there was no way to solve the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg, the mathematical rigor laying the foundation for graph theory underpinning networked systems today. Unlike other areas of blockchain, few are building resilient secure blockchain integration frameworks. Cloud databases use Web 2.0 technologies to interface databases, built with native software components and native APIs, typically requiring layer security in depth, because native code fails on storage reclamation and can expose private keys, making integrations easy to hack. Creating a far greater gap for inter-blockchain transfers to solve moving forward with Web 3.0 technologies. Making all the world of difference to resilient secure inter-blockchain reliability.

Hello Cactus team,
Thank you very much for all the hard work done so far and making the project open source. There are some more thoughts/questions that I want to share. I apologize if some of these issues have already been discussed. Thank you. If I can help in any of these tasks, please let me know.

I was wondering if people would like to have an “emergency break feature” in cactus. In case the livelihood of one of the connected blockchains reduces below a specific threshold, the emergency break can be activated to prevent any further asset transfer out of this blockchain to keep all blockchains alive. The emergency break can be deactivated if enough assets have been returned to the affected blockchain.  The emergency break could be either activated/deactivated by a trusted external party or could be hard coded and automatically activate in case a specific threshold is reached. How to define and measure the livelihood of a blockchain that I am not really sure about. If all tokens/assets of the total supply value are tradeable/spendable in the network, then the livelihood of the network is 100%. But we don’t know how many of the tokens are locked up/ burned in addresses that nobody has access anymore because e.g. the private keys got lost. Should the livelihood of a blockchain be defined with respect to how many transactions are done per second with that token?
</p>
<p><strong>DOBEN</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 02:04:08 GMT):<br/>
Another topic: Do people have other incentives to lock up things (in particular data) in an escrow contract without actually being interested in inter-blockchain transfers? I am not a lawyer, so please ask an expert on this topic. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, the “controller “ not the “processor” of sensitive data is liable for it and might be punished in court for any non-compliance with GDPR. Under the “Digital Millennium Copyright Act” in the USA, the possession of some data is illegal e.g. cases of illegal primes. There might be laws and regulations in some countries that if people lock up data in escrow contracts, they are not in control of this data anymore and hence, avoid legal punishment if they were in the possession of such sensitive/illegal data beforehand. Some people might therefore try to lock up such data in escrow contracts. This is a problem nobody can solve and applies to probably every distributed immuatable ledger, I assume.
</p>
<p><strong>DOBEN</strong> (Wed, 03 Jun 2020 02:04:33 GMT):<br/>
Another topic: There was this discussion about “burning of tokens” in one of the cactus papers. I agree that in general it is not advised to do so if connected to the cactus network since cactus does not want to jeopardize the “livelihood “of any of the connected chains (If  all the tokens are burned of one chain and no new tokens are mined in that protocol of that chain then the chain is literally dead.). Nonetheless, if someone is still using this pattern to interact with cactus, what would be the recommended implementation to “burn tokens”? Should there be some recommendations in the white paper in the future? I saw at least two different implementations, so I was wondering what are the pros and cons and which is the recommended one when interacting with cactus?
	1. Implementation: Tokens are sent to the address of the coinbase/generation transaction in the genesis block (the address of the miner that mined the genesis block, this is the address where the reward for mining the block is sent to). 
		1.1. Additional comments with respect to Bitcoin:
Since most people in the bitcoin community assume that Satoshi does not know the private key of the address of the coinbase transaction in the genesis block, all coins collected in that address are burned since nobody has access to the private key to reclaim them. It is not proven if or if not Satoshi has the private key of that special address.
		1.2 Additional comments with respect to Ethereum: I think it is proven that nobody knows the private key of the that coinbase address in the genesis block because it was set to the special address “00000.......000000”.
2. Implementation: Tokens are subtracted from the user account as well as from the total token supply value.

Hello cliveb, fair enough point and yes I agree that cactus is for now probably focusing on building the link/bridge between the blockchains by locking/unlocking assets to prevent double-spending (meaning preventing that a representation of the same asset exists in several blockchains and potentially been spent in several blockchains). It is already a quite difficult task and probably won’t get easier in the future as you mentioned. Let's see where it will develop to in the future because if token/value assets/fungible assets are include, things like escrow contracts might become important. I quite personally like the reference to the Seven Bridge of Koenigsberg problem so.

Hi @DOBEN , first of all thanks for your feedback.I believe the issue raised in your comment is  not easy to solved by generic solutions. As one of core contributor of Cactus, I want to keep a room for implement escrow transaction  which was introduced in my paper DOI: 10.1109/IOTSMS48152.2019.8939267 or https://www.google.co.jp/url?q=https://www.fujitsu.com/global/documents/about/resources/publications/fstj/archives/vol55-5/paper11.pdf&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi2weTpivHpAhUQyYsBHUx_Bo8QFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw1pEtaW-3bqrSdQXXenHMye . We design Cactus architecture to allow Business Logic Plugin  to provide escrow trade service by interacting with Ledgers . Fujitsu'prototype system showed feasibility and acceptace from real market in some PoCs in Japan. Iwould like to continue such deep discussion in mailing list.
</p>

Slightly off-topic because it does not affect Cactus/NodeJS (I believe) but it's still worth mentioning as a good example/reminder why we need the `secure by default` design principle so much. :-)

Hello Peter, does secure by default design principle mean making the P in the Cactus CAP secure by default? Or more specifically, implementation making the Cactus/NodeJS plugins have no ambient authority; can interact only with the objects to which they have been granted access explicitly?

Hi @peter_somogyvari 
I am try to run the simple-asset-transfer example.
I have some doubts regarding the setup.
Is there any OS( Ubuntu 18.04) dependency for running this example?
From the documentation, "Note: Fabric SDK has stricter engine requirements (npm < 6.0 & node < 9.0)"
Which Node and npm version is required for running Fabric SDK?
Thank you

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 18:52:38 GMT):<br/>
Hi @amalcs23 
That one should definitely work on Ubuntu 18.04 (we used to have CI coverage for it).
On the other hand, things have moved on fast from the simple-asset-transfer example and now we are working on the merged architecture with a codebase that's new and improved compared to previous codebase.
I'm working on the documentation right now, but to get things going I would ask you to first just try to pull the latest master branch contents and then run the CI script under `./tools/ci.sh` and if that fails with something then paste back the error here.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 20:32:00 GMT):<br/>
@amalcs23 Check this out: https://github.com/petermetz/blockchain-integration-framework/blob/docs/partial-issue-46-build-md/BUILD.md

It allows you to get going with the setup and run the existing tests related to different ledgers. 
Note: in the new architecture the asset transfer example is not yet in existence but you can already see how contract deployment will work on a per ledger basis for example.

Is there any way for me to customize the way the LOC metrics are calculated?
It says that I added ~80k LOC, but most of that will be generated package-lock.json files for NodeJS (which we must store under version control for stable builds despite them being generated).
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 18:26:39 GMT):<br/>

@peter_somogyvari 
I thought the way to pass arguments to docker run was through the startupOptions object passed to docker.run, but it gives me  (HTTP code 400) unexpected - starting container with non-empty request body was deprecated since API v1.22 and removed in v1.24.

Any thoughts on those?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 20:51:53 GMT):<br/>
@RafaelAPB To clarify, are you working with the `dockerode` library?

<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 20:53:29 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 20:55:53 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 21:05:04 GMT):<br/>
Oh I see now. I think you want to use the cmd array (second parameter of the run method).
That's how you can inject the args after that deprecation that the error message mentions as well.

Off-topic: If you reply through the thread it will be much easier for others (or yourself) to follow the discussion later. Not mandatory of course, but it does make it easier in my personal opinion to scan the chat for information historically

@amalcs23 Yeah about that. The new version of the fabric  connector is still under development unfortunately. We are waiting on this to be resolved and then it can be added: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/issues/132

@rjones  I just need to know if there's any specific image registry mandated by the org (HL) or can we go with DockerHub/Github Image Registry? If we are free to go with one of those, then I have all I need (I know how to do it just wanted to make sure whatever we do is compliant with guidelines)

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:25:17 GMT):<br/>
Could be, I'm not sure either TBH. If I hit a permission snag I can just ping you asking for the admin, not a problem.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:25:36 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:26:31 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:27:04 GMT):<br/>
OK. If you need multiple images - I can do that. It's unclear to me if you need a bunch of images, or only one.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:27:53 GMT):<br/>
It will definitely be a bunch of images. Just one for cactus itself, but there are others that are for integration tests/demos/etc.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:28:11 GMT):<br/>
OK. I think, just tell me what new ones you need?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:28:42 GMT):<br/>
I think you can enable auto-builds, but I think everyone that did that moved away
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:30:17 GMT):<br/>
Will do, now that we have established the "ground rules" I can actually move the Dockerfile(s) into the Cactus codebase and once that's done (PRs will have to be accepted first) then I'll ping you so we can set it up (assuming I can't do it myself, but with admin rights I can probably just do it all by myself, but let's see how it goes)
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:30:33 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the help!
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 02:13:21 GMT):<br/>
> OK. I think, just tell me what new ones you need?

@rjones Now I see what you meant and I definitely need 4 of them, sorry for not realizing this earlier!

Here's the list of repos I need:
cactus-fabric-all-in-one
cactus-corda-all-in-one
cactus-quorum-all-in-one
cactus-besu-all-in-one

I prefixed them all with `cactus` because that way it's not confusing anybody looking at the besu one for example (without the prefix one could think that the besu-all-in-one image is maintained by the besu team, but it is not)

<p><strong>amalcs23</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 09:59:08 GMT):<br/>
Right now I am not able to run the simple-asset-transfer example?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 16:34:54 GMT):<br/>
You can probably still run the old one, if that's what you want to do, but the new one is coming soon so I'd recommend holding off with the effort  until that happens. The reason I'm recommending this is because the foundations/principles will be pretty much the same in the new code but the mechanics and the implementation will be completely new. So if you invest your time into reading/understanding the old examples/code then you'll have to re-do some of that effort in a few weeks when the new example comes out doing the same thing.
If you still want to go ahead with the old examples I'm happy to take a deeper look into what went wrong with your setup (or if somehow the example got broken since March when I last demoed it) .
Just let me know

@amalcs23 That's a weird issue. Best guess is that the alpine linux CDN was down or that something strange is going on with your local docker installation because I literally just now ran that command and worked fine:

@cliveb Thank you again for the great presentation and all the work we definitely need with regards to security: Our `secure by default` design principle is one of those requirements that is easy to state but extremely difficult to implement even when one has a blank sheet for design where legacy code is not an issue (our present, blissful state that won't last forever).

Does anybody know if Hyperledger can help us out with OSS dependency's licensing questions? There's this OSS package on Github that does NOT have a `LICENSE` file but it does have what *looks like* an Apache-2 at the of its `README.md`, but it is not being given a name in there so I'm just guessing what that license is on the bottom of the readme...

Ultimately I just want confirmation that we can use this package in Cactus, because there does not some to be any good alternatives to it with straight forward licensing... Any help/pointers are very much appreciated !

Does anybody know if Hyperledger can help us out with OSS dependency's licensing questions? There's this OSS package on Github that does NOT have a `LICENSE` file but it does have what *looks like* an Apache-2 at the of its `README.md`, but it is not being given a name in there so I'm just guessing what that license is on the bottom of the readme...

Hi everyone! cc: @peter_somogyvari @JHamilton @sfuji822 

I pushed a pull-request about APIs of Ledger-Plugin on PR #217 .
https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/pull/217
I'd like to discuss about it in the next Cactus contributors' meeting.

@cliveb Responding to your message on Zoom chat: I agree. I am definitely in the CP NewSQL camp ( as in, that's my default choice) and always try to stay away from eventual consistency whenever I can because a lot of times even when someone tells you EC is fine for their requirements it turns out it is not. I'm also kinda biased against NoSQL because I've been on a few projects where someone prior made a choice to go with NoSQL despite the need for a schema and strong consistency in the data model and of course that lead to big headaches down the line... :-)

Also a fan of CockroachDB, I did consider writing a storage plugin for Cactus that could be backed by a CockroachDB cluster that consortium members can operate in a shared manner (didn't do any of it yet, but been toying with the idea for quite some time).

<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 18:44:22 GMT):<br/>
Hello, everyone. Trying to run the simple asset tutorial, here. However, when I run one of the scenarios involving Fabric and Quorum, I got an error of socket hang up:
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 18:44:25 GMT):<br/>
RequestError: Error: socket hang up
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 18:45:29 GMT):<br/>
Does someone knows what this could be? Do I need to have a powerful environment on my host machine to run that?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:38:58 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the old examples need a lot of RAM unfortunately (around 16GB even if you omit the corda tests).
Most likely one of the containers with either the ledgers or the validators is not running, that' usually the cause for the socket hung up error. 
Can you verify that the CI script in the tools directory works otherwise?
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:40:43 GMT):<br/>
Do you mean the tools directory inside the root directory, @peter_somogyvari ?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:42:13 GMT):<br/>
No, that's the "new" CI script which should be fine with a few gigs of RAM.
I meant the old one because I assumed you are working with the old examples under the `contribs` directory (do let me know if that's not the case, I may have misunderstood)
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:44:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I am working with the examples inside `contribs`
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:45:11 GMT):<br/>
`./contribs/Accenture-BIF/core/examples/simple-asset-transfer`
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:47:06 GMT):<br/>
Okay, so the old CI script is this one  `./contribs/Accenture-BIF/core/tools/ci.sh`

and you need to run it with the `CI_NO_CORDA=true` env var:
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:47:27 GMT):<br/>
And that should pass as long as your machine is not running out of memory.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:48:18 GMT):<br/>
And after that script has passed, your machine should have the containers up and running and allow you to run the examples without the socket hung up error.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:48:38 GMT):<br/>
(the script itself also runs those examples, that's basically the test in the CI script)
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:49:38 GMT):<br/>
I see. I will try here. Thanks, @peter_somogyvari ! :)

@peter_somogyvari , tired to run `ci.sh` here, but it did not work. It only has created the Fabric network and Fabric federation. It could not instantiate the chaincode either.

@peter_somogyvari , tried to run `ci.sh` here, but did not work. It only created the Fabric Network. In the step of chaincode instantiation, it failed
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Sat, 18 Jul 2020 01:59:30 GMT):<br/>
It says it cannot pull the image `hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:latest`
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Sat, 18 Jul 2020 02:00:49 GMT):<br/>
Actually, it did not even create the Fabric federation
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Sat, 18 Jul 2020 17:35:40 GMT):<br/>
Actually, I think there isn't a tag latest for fabric-ccenv anymore. Trying to change it, but don't know where in the script this tag is defined.

Hello, @peter_somogyvari . Tried to execute `ci.sh` script in simple asset tutorial, but it fails claiming there is no *latest* tag to *hyperledger/fabric-ccenv* image. Do you know where could I change this tag?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 21 Jul 2020 03:49:22 GMT):<br/>
@lucianosilva44 Hmm. You could change that tag in one of the docker-compose.yml files, but I'm not sure which one because I don't remember us using that image at all.
Can you paste in the full stdout of the script you get? (or attach it as a file is even better)
I'd want to take a more detailed look because I can't make much sense of the error unfortunately
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Tue, 21 Jul 2020 14:00:43 GMT):<br/>

@lucianosilva44 It seems like they chose to break it intentionally by deleting the `latest` tag for the images... :/

https://stackoverflow.com/a/62862682

I don't yet know how to fix it unfortunately.
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 01:21:43 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 15:17:59 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari , one doubt: in the simple asset transfer tutorial, who makes the signatures verification: the destiny ledger federation or the destiny ledger plugin (or connector, if I understood correctly)?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 16:20:24 GMT):<br/>
@lucianosilva44 The actual cryptographic operation happens on ledger, in the validator contract's `verify` method, but it is the connector that calls said method.
You can trace it back in the source code if you look at these files and look for the verify method in each of them (in this case it's the besu implementation but they all work the same in the simple asset transfer example):

`contribs/Accenture-BIF/core/src/plugins/connectors/ConnectorBesu.js`

`contribs/Accenture-BIF/core/examples/simple-asset-transfer/besu/api/routes/actors/actors.controller.js`

`contribs/Accenture-BIF/core/examples/simple-asset-transfer/besu/api/wrappers/actor.wrapper.js`

`contribs/Accenture-BIF/core/examples/simple-asset-transfer/besu/contracts/Root.sol`

I am working in a Polkadot (https://polkadot.network/) validator for Cactus. Can someone explain me in a greater detail what is the role of the validator, in particular the Ethereum validator? How does it validate the transactions coming from a Cactus node, to a target blockchain?
When I look into "io.on('connection', function(client) " it looks more like a connector than a validator.

Hi everybody. I have one doubt about the current state of cactus. Can I use it today to interoperate two blockchains platforms or it's not ready for that yet?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:20:26 GMT):<br/>
Hi @JuanNogueira Welcome to the community! Progress is steady, BUT we are not ready for production yet (the project is in incubation status, watch out for it becoming an 'active' status project).
In the meantime we have weekly calls and maintain a road map of sorts here on Github (mor to come soon) https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/milestone/2

<p><strong>JuanNogueira</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 21:34:21 GMT):<br/>
Ok, if the project is steady that's enough for me (even if it's not ready for prod yet). Is there any tutorial about how to interoperate two platforms? I reviewed the link you sent but didn't find any
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 21:43:56 GMT):<br/>
@JuanNogueira We expect that to be ready by mid-September when we will (hopefully) also present the same thing at the members summit in the form of an actual demo.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 00:27:31 GMT):<br/>
All: I just published the meeting agenda for today here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/cactus/2020-08-25+Cactus+Contributors+Meeting+Agenda
Everyone should feel free to add discussion items as usual.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 03:19:55 GMT):<br/>
@hartm IIRC, this was the Rust compilation target I was looking into that could offer us a proper Ursa JS library (didn't get very far): https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_target/spec/asmjs_unknown_emscripten/index.html
</p>
<p><strong>JuanNogueira</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:04:50 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Another question. Cactus currently supports Hyperledger fabric, Quorum and Corda platforms, right?
</p>
<p><strong>JuanNogueira</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:26:55 GMT):<br/>
And also, which platforms are you planning to use for the demo?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:46:04 GMT):<br/>
@JuanNogueira The definition of what is supported versus is being worked on is kind of fluid since we are not yet finished with the initial release, but all that aside, we have all of those either supported or underway, yes and add Besu to that list.
My personal goal is to have a demo that quickly demonstrates all of those in one go, but this is unlikely to happen because we are cutting it close. I can tell you that the high priority is fabric and corda
</p>
<p><strong>JuanNogueira</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:53:37 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thanks for your answers! Let me ask you one more question. Do you have an estimated date for the initial release?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 16:01:53 GMT):<br/>
@JuanNogueira Personally, my aim is to have an initial release out by the end of September and from then on have regularly scheduled releases every month or possibly even every week that are automated to the extent that the process is not impacting our focus. Ideally it would be a proper continuous delivery pipeline that takes the latest code at any given time, parses the commit messages (which are enforced by tooling to be in a machine readable format) for determining the type of release that should be issued according to semantic versioning rules (e.g. breaking changes trigger a major release). Everything is always a little slower than we hope/expect, but this is the vision we are driving towards. The initial release is still not planned to be something production ready, it would most likely be v0.3 and if all goes well we could have a production ready release with performance benchmarks and extensive test coverage by the end of this calendar year that we could dub as a v1.0.

Hi, i am searching info about cactus, but I dont understand what does DLT fragmentation means, can any1 explain to me that?
</p>
<p><strong>sigma67</strong> (Thu, 27 Aug 2020 13:50:25 GMT):<br/>
I believe it refers to the large number of DLT frameworks that are currently available and used, which results in the need for interoperability
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Thu, 27 Aug 2020 15:47:04 GMT):<br/>
@jbtwist yes, sigma is right.
Essentially, choosing a blockchain allows researchers and developers to implement new use case scenarios, and to keep up
with recent research. However, as this technology is moving so quickly, there are bugs and performance issues. "Developers and researchers have, therefore, to choose between novelty and stability, leading to a vast diversity of choices. This diversity leads to fragmentation: there are many immature blockchain solutions. Until recently, blockchains did not consider the need for interoperability, as each one resolved specific challenges, leading to data and value silos"
</p>
<p><strong>jbtwist</strong> (Thu, 27 Aug 2020 15:58:36 GMT):<br/>
i think that they are not talking about that in this context: https://youtu.be/IHy-5sbMrYs?t=151
</p>
<p><strong>jbtwist</strong> (Thu, 27 Aug 2020 15:59:14 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jbtwist</strong> (Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:02:00 GMT):<br/>
I just want to understand that video and try to learn about how this technology works
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Thu, 27 Aug 2020 18:36:08 GMT):<br/>
In that context it  means that there are a lot of solutions moving at a very fast pace.

hi Rick, I had thought we had 60m slot (as we had for quite some time) and hence over-ran into 3:30 UTC slot - I might now need to use the backup zoom id instead for Developer call - apologies all around firstly  - and so, cactus can have the current zoom id

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 17:01:43 GMT):<br/>
@sfuji822 That one is still in progress unfortunately (it is just a draft, so not ready for review).
My latest info is that the container image itself is operational, but the test automation is still being finalized.

Furthermore there's this technical challenge that is unsolved by this PR about the RPC communication between Cactus and the Corda nodes/apps. There are basically 3 options to communicate from the NodeJS code with Corda 

1) host a Java app as an in-between  translation layer (because Corda RPC libraries are written in Kotlin)

2) run the java app in graalvm and directly invoke the RPC related code from NodeJS

3) compile the RPC corda code from Kotlin to JS and use that as a NodeJS library directly in Cactus.

4) use SSH to connect to the corda server and execute tasks via the CLI  (such as deploying contracts, starting flows etc)

In the #190 PR we went with option 4) because it was the simplest for a proof of concept, but longer term of course this will not scale well for high throughput, performance sensitive production deployments so my plan is to work on option 3) as the most maintainable option. 
Option 1 and 2 both require external processes to be running in tandem to the Cactus process so both of those are sub-optimal when it comes to maintenance and operational complexity because of the extra processes (also bad for containerization because by design a container's life-cycle is tied to a single process running in the container)

That's the context so far. What I could use help with is the implementation of option 3) and if that turns out to be very high effort then option 2 as a fallback/last resort.

Regarding my try on option 3 so far: Tried to add the kotlin JS plugin to my corda fork, but the build then crashes with some gradle dependency error that I haven't yet had the time to investigate properly.

@sillysachin Can't promise any timelines, but hoping for all that to be available in the next couple of months and with a stable release hopefully this year. Everything always takes longer than expected so take this information with a grain of salt of course. ;-)

@peter_somogyvari Yes. I need atomic swap functionality. For examples, ethereum NFT card and our own coin made by HLF.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 12 Nov 2020 04:35:40 GMT):<br/>
@AndrewPark 1 Gotcha. We don't have anything concrete implemented for atomic swaps yet, but there are plans: Basically we want to enable it through plugins so there could be different flavors of ideas such as hash time-lock contracts (HTLCs) or any of the other (relatively) well researched atomic swap algorithms/protocols that people have proposed.
So if you are looking to contribute then the way to get started would be to write a plugin that can do atomic swaps in general, but if you would rather just use something out of the box then the best I can say for now is to wait until we have an implementation ready. :-)

Hey Roman, cheers, it is a pleasure to have you joining us!

Regarding the error, two questions:
1. After cloning the code what steps did you take exactly? Did you follow the build guide[1] or just ran the test script right away?

[1]: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/master/BUILD.md

2. Is there any more logs on the terminal? Usually when running the tests I'd have expected some more details about which test case failed.

I think it's correct yeah, it never showed it in my own time zone anyway for some reason it always showed it in the time zone of the person who created the meeting (originally it was Jonathan I think and he is in central)

sure thing. I'm sure there will be more I need to do to enable you - just let me know when you hit a blocker
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 22:34:50 GMT):<br/>
you should have permissions to create repos now
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 22:35:34 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Going off-topic: on dockerhub it still only lets me select the bot when linking github to the repo (and then the bot doesn't have anything in the next dropdown)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 22:35:53 GMT):<br/>
I totally forgot about that, sorry
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 22:38:57 GMT):<br/>
No worries, just checking in! Still not urgent, but figured it's worth a bump! :-)
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 22:42:35 GMT):<br/>
Verified, permission works to create repos. Can I get more permissions to rename (or delete) repos as well?
I already made a mistake where I gave the repo the name that was meant to be the name of a package inside the repo... :fearful:
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 23:20:37 GMT):<br/>
you're an admin, you have as much permission as I do, I think
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 23:22:02 GMT):<br/>
If you go here: https://bintray.com/beta/#/hyperledger-org/cactus-api-client/edit
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 23:22:11 GMT):<br/>
in the upper right, do you have a "delete" button?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 23:22:50 GMT):<br/>
if not, I'll do it @peter_somogyvari
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 23:29:15 GMT):<br/>
Got it, button was there.
I swear I didn't see it before /facepalm :-D

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 23:29:22 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 23:29:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 15:26:24 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 18:04:50 GMT):<br/>
the GitHub account must be an org owner, which is insane.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 18:05:04 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 18:05:47 GMT):<br/>
Thought they'd allow you to apply the least privilege principle and use some stripped  down account that can pretty much only read the code and that's it.

@peter_somogyvari Thank you for chaging default branch to "main". It's very cool!

By the way, Cactus GitHub toppage is still "master", since "master" is default branch in the current status as GitHub system.
https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus
Could you delete master branch or switch main as default branch?

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 08 Jan 2021 16:35:42 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, then maybe something is wrong on Github's end because I just went there a minute ago and it was still master as the default in the settings. Maybe I haven't forgotten after all.

=>

Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

When:
Thursday, 5 November 2020
7:00am to 8:00am
(UTC-08:00) America/Los Angeles
Repeats: Weekly on Thursday

Hello everyone, This is to bring DCGI (Digital Currency Global Initiative) to your attention. DCGI is a collaboration between ITU-T (an arm of ITU, a UN special agency) and Stanford U business school. ITU-T is a standards body, it has been involved in some important technical standards such as MP3.  More than 197 national bodies and private enterprises are involved in ITU. Digital Currencies that DCGI is looking at includes Crypto-Currencies, CBDC (both wholesale and retail), Stablecoins and e-Money (or private money). The Interoperability WS will create technical recommendations for standards development. We are engaging with ISO, and some other standards bodies as well.  There are three working groups with sub workstreams; one of them is the Interoperability workstream inside the Policy & Governance WG. I am the vice-chair of this group and would like to bring Hyperledger Cactus into the discussion. Please reply to this or email to engage.-
</p>
<p><strong>sfuji822</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 02:32:46 GMT):<br/>

I think we should probably propose multiple talks and let the committee sort out which ones they think fit best.  Of note:  "CFP must be submitted in English; however, talks can be presented in your language of choice. In particular, we’d love to see talks in Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese."  I'm thinking we could propose some foreign language talks @takeutak @sfuji822 @RafaelAPB
</p>
<p><strong>E.alcazar</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 08:39:35 GMT):<br/>
That's a great idea! I can help doing a presentation on Spanish
I'm also trying to move the same thing for Hyperledger local events, I can help accelerate that if you guys want to do a presentation in your language in your region

Hello everyone, I've been interested in HL cactus lately and I saw in a survey that: "The
roadmap predicts integration with public blockchains" but I can't find any info about it. Does the roadmap predict integration with public blockchains? If anyone can help me with this it would be very nice!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 15:56:29 GMT):<br/>
Hello!  Are you asking if we plan to support public blockchains with Cactus?  If so, the answer is yes, although there are some caveats (for instance, integration with bitcoin requires some extra assumptions).
</p>
<p><strong>jmc171144</strong> (Mon, 15 Feb 2021 07:13:06 GMT):<br/>
Ok thanks! Yes I wanted to know if some public blockchain integrations were planned in the 2021 roadmap or if this remains an ambition?
</p>
<p><strong>E.alcazar</strong> (Mon, 15 Feb 2021 10:34:48 GMT):<br/>
Theoretically it already supports Ethereum through the Besu connector plugin, and the HTLC plugins we are about to merge.
It's theoretical because AFAIK we haven't tested it yet, we are still in early stages implementation-wise.

If you have a specific suggestion or idea, we encourage you to join one of our meetings and collaborate with the team to develop new plugins :grinning:

@rjones What's the algorithm to find a free zoom link if I want to introduce a new daily meeting to do Cactus pair programming? I created the calendar entry[1] but wasn't sure what zoom link I could put in there for people to join because it's at the busiest time of the day with 3-4 other meetings running at the same time with zoom links. :/
[1]: https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/cactus/viewevent?repeatid=35080&eventid=1059700&calstart=2021-02-15

We could also just use a google meets link, but I don't know if we are supposed to do that or should stick specifically to the HL Zoom.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 15 Feb 2021 19:02:30 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari you could use Google if you like, but in the near-ish future, Zoom meetings will become a) much easier b) mandatory
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 15 Feb 2021 19:03:09 GMT):<br/>
Basically, there won't be "hyperledger Zoom" accounts any more, there will be a pool of API keys that are used

We’ve created a regular call that runs from 8:00 to 8:30 AM Pacific Time every week day:
https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/cactus/viewevent?repeatid=35080&eventid=1059700&calstart=2021-02-15

Feel free to drop by anytime and ask code related questions from maintainers/contributors. 
Questions can be ranging anywhere from starting a contribution/building the code to finalizing PR reviews. 

It’s an informal setting where no issue is too small to be brought up: If you show up, share your screen and we figure out that a semicolon was missing and that’s why it wasn’t working, that’s a great outcome and the meeting will have worked as intended. 
There’s no pressure or barrier to entry as long as it’s related to Cactus, we’ll be glad to discuss it on the call in a first come first serve ad-hoc basis.

please excuse me if this is a complete noob question, and if the concept is misunderstood, but I am curious of the election process of the validator nodes for the different DLTs, also is there a list of the current ones?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 15:57:31 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean by "election process?"
</p>
<p><strong>AllanLundHansen</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 16:15:18 GMT):<br/>
Maybe a rephrasing is better: 
"The Cactus consortium operates for each connected blockchain a group of validator nodes, which as a group provides the proofs of the state of the connected ledger"  (from whitepaper) so the question relates to who are validator nodes? How do they get to be designated as such? And who is the governing body that choose validator nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 23:17:25 GMT):<br/>
Ah, thanks for explaining.  Whoever is running the particular Cactus consortium in question gets to choose who the validator nodes are (or what the process is to select them).  Or goal with Cactus is to make this as flexible as possible since we suspect that many different people who want to use Cactus will have different needs and choices for validator sets.
</p>
<p><strong>AllanLundHansen</strong> (Sat, 20 Feb 2021 08:01:20 GMT):<br/>
That sounds great thank you for the answer!

Hi, @peter_somogyvari ! (cc: @JHamilton @sfuji822 @hartm  )

I am looking at implementing code to run cactus-ledger-connector-besu (or fabric, quorum) from the Ledger Plugin Verifier <https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/ledger-plugin/VerifierBase.ts>.
Therefore, I'm currently investigating Peter's codes, but there are some things that I cannot understand yet. Would you mind if you answer the following two questions (1) and (2) ?

(1) As I surveyed, cactus-ledger-connector-besu can be called with a RESTful OpenAPI, and I think the call is what the OpenAPI Generator does. I think the definition of API to create is written in openapi.json below.

* Besu: signTransactionRequest <https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-besu/src/main/json/openapi.json#L512>
"transactionHash",
"keychainId",
"keychainRef"

* Fabric: RunTrasactionRequest <https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric/src/main/json/openapi.json#L168>
"keychainId",
"keychainRef",
"channelName",
"chainCodeId",
"invocationType",
"functionName",
"functionArgs"

Then, let me question about it. Could you mind if you tell me what parameter values are specifically assigned to these parameters in a sample application such as supply-chain-app?
For example, it would be helpful if you could tell me the relevant part of the code.

(2) After the transaction was issued by cactus-ledger-connector-besu (or fabric, quorum), did you obtain the response for the transaction result in this code? So does it include some kind of blockchain monitoring?
If you have some kind of monitoring function, it would be helpful if you could tell me the relevant part of the code.

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Mon, 22 Feb 2021 07:32:38 GMT):<br/>
@takeutak 
1) Sure thing, here are some relevant  parts of the code:

- examples/cactus-example-supply-chain-frontend/src/app/bamboo-harvest/bamboo-harvest-list/bamboo-harvest-list.page.ts ( method name: `clickAddNew()` )

-  examples/cactus-example-supply-chain-frontend/src/app/bookshelf/bookshelf-list/bookshelf-list.page.ts 
  `clickAddNew()` method 

- examples/cactus-example-supply-chain-business-logic-plugin/src/main/typescript/business-logic-plugin/web-services/insert-bamboo-harvest-endpoint.ts `handleRequest` method

- examples/cactus-example-supply-chain-business-logic-plugin/src/main/typescript/business-logic-plugin/web-services/insert-bookshelf-endpoint.ts `handleRequest` method


2) Yes: Immediately available transaction results are sent back with the HTTP response. There's no support for streaming/monitoring events so if your smart contract uses events then polling is necessary at the moment (once we have the websocket/gRPC support this will improve of course)

@peter_somogyvari Thank you for the information! It helps me a lot.

What I want to ask is what parameters are specifically assigned to "transactionHash", "keychainId" and "keychainRef" (or "keychainId", "keychainRef", "channelName", "chainCodeId", "invocationType", "functionName", "functionArgs"). Is there an appropriate code?

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 19:21:34 GMT):<br/>
@takeutak Maybe these ones helps more with the keychain related parameters (let me know if it's still unclear, I can try and provide more code location links):

https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/examples/cactus-example-supply-chain-backend/src/main/typescript/supply-chain-app.ts#L147

https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/examples/cactus-example-supply-chain-backend/src/main/typescript/supply-chain-app.ts#L87

As for the other parameters, I'm not sure I understand the question, the parameters you listed are being assigned in the code sections that I pointed to in my earlier message. There you can see those parameters being assigned to from other values so I thought that would answer what is is that's being set for those parameters "specifically" because it's literally right there in the code what assignments are.

Hello, I'm new in Cactus, or rather I'm thinking about being new in Cactus. I've watched intro video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHy-5sbMrYs) - everything looks good, but I need to ask hard question - what are practical disadvantages of Cactus?

I'm asking because I've checked Quilt (https://www.hyperledger.org/use/quilt) and integration with Iroha (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/HL+Iroha+and+HL+Quilt+Integration) and I've found some disadvantages. I know some disadvantages of Quilt and I need to know what are disadvantages of Cactus to compare what is better interledger communication project?

To be more specific, are those disadvantages in Cactus (there are in Quilt as I know):
- Tokens can be added but not taken from source account
- Accounts between networks should be "copied" to Quilt's node
- Credit for accounts - impossible to not have credit.

If You don't want to answer me on public please tell me through priv message:D.

Hello @baziorek. I've done some work on interoperability that could answer your questions: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14282.pdf
A new version, with a comparative framework is about to come out. Hope that helps
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 21:12:01 GMT):<br/>
Adding a bit, the main disadvantage of Cactus right now is that cross-chain communication across a set of members cannot be "enforced" - the price to pay for heterogeneous interoperability with arbitrary business logic. But we are working on it.

<p><strong>baziorek</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 21:49:17 GMT):<br/>
@RafaelAPB If I understood You correctly - it is possible that when transferring between networks it is possible that some of tokens would not be transferred from account A, but will be transferred to account B

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cactus?msg=kAqkNYzzTnXt4oWKC) That behavior is encoded in business logic plugins. Currently there are a few; cross-chain atomic swaps on the way (using HTLCs you could have n-party cross-swaps)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cactus?msg=JLzFRSxwSyqPTFkSZ) Sorry for not precise question. I meen situation like that:
1. bob in blockchain1 wants to send 1 * token1 to alice in blockchain2.
So is it possible that bob sends but alice would not receive? Or alice receive but bob would not send (e.g. because suddenly he will not have enough balance)?

I'm having questions, because I'm proposing Hyperledger Internship Project to connect Cactus and Hyperledger Iroha, so my questions (deadline for submissions is 8th March):
1. Is anybody adding integration between Iroha and Cactus? I don't want to duplicate work.
2. To integrate Cactus with other blockchain is necessarily to just code plugin and run Cactus with the plugin? (I was reading documentation, but I need to make sure, since I'm really new).
3. Plugin can be coded in any programming language, since Cactus is using REST API (https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/whitepaper/whitepaper.md#53-apis-and-communication-protocols-between-cactus-components)? Or it must be in TypedScript as rest of implemented plugins?
4. Is it allowed to integrate two networks of the same blockchain, e.g. Two separate Fabric networks to transfer with Cactus?

1) I don't think so
2) "just"?
3) PLease ask Peter
4) Yes!
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Sun, 07 Mar 2021 05:16:29 GMT):<br/>
@baziorek 
1. Nobody is working on it as far as I'm aware (so chances are that no one is). With that said it would be a most welcome contribution for sure so thank you for considering/doing this!
2. Yes, it's not easy to make it so, but this is one of our core design principles and have been focusing on this a lot when it comes to architecture.
3. Yes. We have a working example of a plugin that was written in Rust here for example: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/main/packages/cactus-plugin-keychain-vault/src/cactus-keychain-vault-server
It's a standalone web server capable of serving API requests conformant what is in the openapi spec file here:
https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-keychain-vault/src/main/json/openapi.json

The example above is not an example of a ledger connector plugin but instead is a keychain plugin, but the concept is the same: If you want to implement a plugin that runs on something other than NodeJS then on top of implementing your plugin logic you will also have to implement the web server part, but for this I recommend using the OpenAPI generator instead of rolling your own (I used the rust template to generate the linked keychain plugin above).

As another example we have the recently added (and for now kinda half-baked) corda plugin which follows the same pattern but instead of rust it is a JVM spring boot app written in Kotlin: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-corda/src/main-server
And again, the only code I actually wrote was the code that implements the REST endpoints, all the other boilerplate is auto-generated from the OpenAPI specs that we give you.
This is how the corda connector  generates it's API server boilerplate for example: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-corda/package.json#L16
4. Yes it is.Plugin instances have a uinque `instanceId` property which will allow us in the future to route requests to different plugin instances where they can be connected to separate ledgers of the same kind such as two distinct Fabric ledgers.

5. We have a daily pair programming call where everyone is welcome to join and ask about code, building, project setup, architectural decisions, etc. so feel free to drop by there as well and I'll be happy to chat about everything I just wrote in more detail or actually demonstrate how it all works:

Hi All, I've got nothing for our upcoming maintainer's meeting, should we cancel it or does anyone else have proposed agenda items?

As for HGF submissions, I'm working on a couple of my own right now 1 for a supply chain app demo of Cactus and another for some kind of hands-on coding workshop (in the spirit of "everyone just submit everything they got and we'll figure it out later")
</p>
<p><strong>baziorek</strong> (Mon, 08 Mar 2021 08:13:35 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari Thanks for all answers. I've prepared internship proposal, now it is as draft, but I'd like to invite You to take a look before publishing, if You agree? I have few more questions (to precise description of proposal):
2. To sum up - to integrate Cactus with some blockchain it is enough to code *plugin*, but it is not easy task, am I right? But it is OK for summer internship (3 months), or rather too hard?
3. To sum-up technology to create plugin - the easiest is to code in NodeJS. It is also possible in other technologies (working implementations are in Rust, Kotlin) but it is necessarily to create also web-server, which can be generated with [openapi-generator] (https://openapi-generator.tech).
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Mon, 08 Mar 2021 14:01:58 GMT):<br/>
@baziorek My pleasure. Sure thing, I'm happy to take a look at the proposal as well if you have a link to the document.
2) I agree that it should be doable if they go with the path of least resistance for implementation which seems to be the option of using the Iroha JS client to implement the Cactus ledger connector plugin. Since the connector plugin runs in NodeJS and not the browser I assume we also don't need the grpc-web-proxy that the readme talks about here https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript
So if the basic connectivity between the Cactus plugin and the Iroha ledger can be trivially established as above without further issues (not always the case), then the rest of the connector development is largely just about writing the open API specs file and then make sure that there's a compliant implementation and proper, end to end test coverage with pristine ledgers being pulled up in containers as part of the integration tests, like we do it here: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric/src/test/typescript/integration/fabric-v1-4-x/run-transaction-endpoint-v1.test.ts
I think this is doable in 3 months because for most of it there's existing examples just for other kinds of ledgers plus if they get stuck with anything we are available every day through the pair programming sessions as well. Plus, personally, if they really get stuck hard on something I don't mind jumping in and helping with the code itself either, usually it's just a matter of pinging me with a question and a link to your fork+branch name and I'll be happy to check it out.
Note: since we consider end to end test coverage crucial for accepting pull requests I would recommend planning on finishing the connector itself ahead of time maybe in 2 months and then allocate the last month specifically for test coverage and hammering out the details (which I think is doable if one is provided with help whenever they get stuck which we are happy to provide)
3) Yes, all correct.

Hi guys/gals, I am really interested in cactus and specifically the interoperability problem that cactus is solving. However, when I looked at the github page it says a massive restructuring is being done. Can anyone point to the some documents that are relevant or suggest me that best starting point. I been using hyperledger fabric for the past 3-4 years and have some exp in the public blockchain space, want to learn more about cactus framework?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 07:50:24 GMT):<br/>
@Koushik You could take a look at the supply chain app example that we have. You can get started with a one liner shell command as long as you have a functioning docker installation on your machine. 
Link: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus#supply-chain-example

The code for the example demonstrates how an application developed using Cactus, leveraging multiple ledgers can look like and the code for it is in the packages here with the matching prefix:
https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/main/examples
Prefix: `cactus-example-supply-chain....`

So I'd start there by running the example, looking at the code, etc. and if you have any questions feel free to drop by one of our daily pair-programming sessions where it's totally cool to ask even the smallest of questions regarding the code or the architecture at large.
Link: https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/cactus/viewevent?repeatid=35080&eventid=1059717&calstart=2021-03-10

If the time zone is not a good fit then we can also schedule a pair programming session in a different one, this is something that we are planning to do anyway.

Jonathan is out of office next week so I figured maybe we could do a trial run of the maintainer's call being in a slightly different time where it's a little easier for Enrique to dial in.
Does this sound okay? 
If there isn't any opposition to the idea, we could converse further about which direction and how much the call could be moved. 
I for one am happy to have it later than it is planned (just an example).

If it was as simple as a PR, I'd say just do it.  But I imagine that it would involve re-litigating the performance metrics, which would be a time-consuming thing.

Yes, it's too late to change it now anyway.

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 17:18:25 GMT):<br/>
All I'm going to say is:
Containers containers containers.
In other words, whatever we have, I want it to be runnable anywhere from a dev laptop to the data center without manual steps.

The dream would be to have an npm script so that one can just say:
`npm run benchmark`
And this would run the speed tests with some mechanism baked in that can compare the results of different source code revisions so that any two commits can be compared and performance degradation detected automatically.

2021-03-23 - Cactus Daily Update
================================

1. Epic battle with the CI flakes is finally won (it appears to be anyway). Will never be 100% flake free but we are in a sea of green right now vs. 99% red from yesterday so there's cause for celebration. Recommending for everyone whose PRs are in the red as false negatives to rebase onto PR #656 which has a bunch of different fixes for flakes.
2. PR draft for a new roadmap document that contains information that prior to this you'd have to obtain by looking at the GH milestones => https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/284e9bee6b4e169ef7f09417f57747ca07886ce5/ROADMAP.md
3. PR: updated the documentation specific PRs (both of them) as per the request from Shingo & Takuma to have the development flow showcase and the build script decision tree tucked away instead of being visible on the main readme page.
4. PR to start using the ./tools/ci.sh script within the GH actions (this is thorougher compared to what the GHA currently does for CI)
5. Rebased a dozen or so PRs onto the branch that has the CI fixes baked in (updated PR to show dependencies, etc.)

It's a way to track updates of what maintainers have been working on during the day across different timezones, we plan to start doing this to sync up on what everyone is doing with a 2 mins read every day.

Maybe we'll move this to a different channel, but this way it's open for everyone

@peter_somogyvari cc: @hartm @E.alcazar @sfuji822 
Thank you for releasing V0.4.0! Thank you for your hard work.

Incidentally, the pull-request #581, which was committed just before the release of V0.4.0, caused the examples/car-trade and examples/electricity-trade to malfunction due to incorrect corrections made to packages/package.json which is required for LedgerPlugin.
Regarding this correction, I have already posted the pull-request https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/pull/761 to solve this.  Then, I have two favors to ask you.

First, would you mind if you approve this PR <https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/pull/761>?

Second, after this pull-request is merged, I would like to tag V0.4.1 as a minor change of V0.4.0. The reason is that examples/car-trade and examples/electricity-trade do not work in the version of V0.4.0 for the above reason, and if this situation continues, new users will not be able to try the sample application.

As for the issue of V0.4.1, we plan to request it again after the above PR is approved. We kindly ask for your understanding.

Hi @jscode017 no that could happen if you are using npm v7

yeah, my version is 7.7.6
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 14:19:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 14:21:07 GMT):<br/>
Okay that's great to hear that the script itself worked. Then at the end of the day the package-lock.json changes don't matter that much, for now you could just safely ignore them and soon we'll add support for npm 7 and this won't be happening

@takeutak @sfuji822  I have a couple of questions, I'll ping them as a thread to avoid spam
</p>
<p><strong>E.alcazar</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 07:13:17 GMT):<br/>
1. Is the verifier Factory is acting as the factory pattern to create verifiers without exposing the creation logic, so developers can have a common way to instantiate any verifier? 
The verifier is instantiated by the developer and the validator has to be instantiated by the network owners so we can deduce that network owners know about their network specifically and therefore they don't need a factory for the validator.

Is that assumption correct?
</p>
<p><strong>E.alcazar</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 07:15:44 GMT):<br/>
2. In step 6 I'm subscribing to an specific event that my application is subscribing?
If so, can you point us to the interface of that endpoint?
It's critical that we make sure that the interface is common for as many protocols as possible
</p>
<p><strong>E.alcazar</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 07:27:23 GMT):<br/>
3. Where does the verifier get the keys of the validator? are they provided during the creation process or the connection with the validator? 

4. Is there a CA in the key emission process? are they attached to specific DNSs? (Maybe we should worry about this after the initial release)

5. With this process I can receive events I subscribe to and trust they are valid as long as I trust the validator. But there is no way for me to validate that a piece of data resides on the validator's blockchain. 
Is that assumption right? if so, I think I can create a small PoC showcasing how that would look like in the next meeting :) It will be limited on scope but I'll explain how it can be expanded
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 17:48:03 GMT):<br/>
Yes!
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 17:49:21 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cactus?msg=kry7tweZhiBWG7mbE) I would upvote this. A common interface for validators and connectors is a crucial point in the mid term. Such an interface would also be beneficial for BLPs
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 17:50:54 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cactus?msg=9tJfixXNZA5hpbHD7) Could the verifiers be the BLP themselves? Using connectors, they could cross-validate what the validators are outputting. If a validator lives in a private blockchain, I suppose the assumption for the existance of a quorum of validators is a good starting point
</p>

<p><strong>kenty</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:34:14 GMT):<br/>
quick question: what is the minimum spec to run cactus?
</p>
<p><strong>kenty</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 16:01:35 GMT):<br/>
nice to meet you guys!
a little background about myself:

@kenty 
The bare minimum for general development (building the code, running the tests, etc) would be around 2 CPU cores (4 threads) and 6 GB RAM free/available.
A recommended setup would be for a dev machine in my opinion is 16 GB RAM 4 CPU cores (8 threads) and of course SSD for persistent storage.

Anecodte: I've ran the tests on a VPS with 4 GB RAM in it once and the only test that failed was the Corda ones because those are hungrier than the others.
Also, if and whne people read this in the future, always inflate the numbers a bit as we continue to add more and more tests every day (test automation is very important to us)

@E.alcazar  
1. Yes. This mechanism is following the design pattern "Factory pattern" which can absorb the difference between the implementation of Verifier which can handle the data formats used by connecting DLT.
2.  No, it is something different. In step 6, Verifier will realize the communication channel is established with Validator. BLP will subscribe to events from Verifier by issuing the startMonitor() command.

3. We assumed the (public) key is set by the administrator of Cactus Node. 
4. I do not think CA is requied. CA will provide the trust on the key based on the trust in the identity of themselves. This trust model is not applicable to us. The administrator(s) can verify the origin of the key based on its own trust policy. Of course, the policy may be used the CA-certified digital certificate, or retrieve the key from the website if it is considered trustworthy.

5. That's a good point. The current implementation of Verifier parses the block data and Verifier breaks the data into a set of transaction data. That means there is no way to verify the validity of the transaction by BLP itself. I interpreted the design of BIF as such. However, if we can improve this for the better, I would like to see your proposal. :-)

Thank you for your careful consideration of our proposal. Technically integration of BLP and Verifier is possible, but I suggest it will be keep separated from BLP. I assume BLP(s) may be multiple instances (just like web apps), and it may reduce overhead on the duplication task of Verifier if the mechanism can be shared with multiple BLPs as a trustworthy, common event source.

<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 12:35:57 GMT):<br/>
Hi, may I ask that which npm version to use to prevent package-lock.json to change when building?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 14:59:12 GMT):<br/>
@jscode017 Do you mean the temporary changes that lerna applies (and then reverts) or do you mean a change in your lock file that stays there even after a successful build?
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 14 Apr 2021 21:55:18 GMT):<br/>
The one that after successful build.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 00:05:23 GMT):<br/>
Gotcha. The short answer is that the lock files should not just after a build unless mistakes were made (which happen all the time though)

If you did change the dependency versions in the package.json files then you just need to revert it back to whatever it was under version control but I'm guessing this is not the case.

If you have your fork/branch up on github I can also take a look if none of this helps. Just let me know. 

In theory you just need to leave the npm versions as is to have the lock files remain stable, unless there was a mistake and someone committed code where they didn't update the lock file in tandem with their dependency changes.

I checked the latest main as of right now with a fresh clone + `npm run configure` and the lock files are untouched so what I can suggest is to drop the changes that were made to your lock files, rebase onto the latest main branch state and then do npm run configure and the only lock file changes after that should be the ones that are legit, e.g. they are there because you yourself changed some dependency versions in the package.json.
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 12:49:46 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, this helpes. Previously I’ve building with tools/ci.sh, which would somehow change those files at my local repo. But simply npm run configure works quite well and leave those files unchange.

@peter_somogyvari & @sfuji822 Can we revive this discussion. I will try to be there for the next cactus weekly zoom meeting to present our project on Digital Currency interoperability....
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 14:31:48 GMT):<br/>
Awesome, glad i could help!
I'll double c heck what's going on with the ci.sh script too because it's not supposed to change the locks either so thank you for the info on that one!
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 14:43:59 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB Yes! And sorry for the thread going dead earlier!
We have a rotating schedule for the maintainers call now and luckily the upcoming one next week is at a reasonable time for New York! =>

https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/cactus/viewevent?repeatid=36253&eventid=1109492&calstart=2021-04-19

I added an agenda item for it.

It's totally reasonable to expect people to either expect or comment on a PR within a week.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 19 Apr 2021 15:33:32 GMT):<br/>
Even a comment--we need to discuss this at a meeting--is fine.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 10:42:52 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari @sfuji822 I had sent some of the material from DCGI after our conversation. Hopefully it did not go into your spam folder and you have access to it we can continue conversation on mailing list
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 19:33:44 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB Thank you again, very helpful document! I sent a question back :-)

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 19:56:28 GMT):<br/>
@kenty Sorry I think I forgot to finish what I was going to say this morning: The getting started guide is awesome and I just wanted to suggest a place to put it which could either be a dedicated section of the BUILD.md document or maybe a brand new GETTING_STARTED.md document (not sure which one is better, I'd be happy to support the PR in either one of those files).
Also a note to self: If you decide to add it as a new document then we should also hook that up to the readthedocs site so it's easy to find for people.
Other note to self: Same goes for the wiki page which should also have a reference to the detailed screencast.
P.S.: As usual, let me know if there's anything I can help with!

Hi, I am currently starting my first pr to the project. (pr812)
And I would like to know how to add packages dependencies.
I am currently trying to import "@hyperledger@cactus-core" in 
cactus/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-corda/src/main/typescript/plugin-ledger-connector-corda.ts /
What I've done is adding "@hyperledger@cactus-core" in the dependencies section of package.json, but does not seems to work(and somehow create other issues).
Is there anyway to do this?

@jscode017 
Check these out:

https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-public-npm-dependency-to-one-of-the-packages
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 13:47:16 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, so I think `npx lerna add @hyperledger/cactus-core --scope '*/*plugin-ledger-connector-corda' --exact`
should do the work?
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 13:47:45 GMT):<br/>
BTW, is it normal to get something like `lerna ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/jasonwang/cactus/examples/cactus-example-supply-chain-backend/node_modules/.bin/cactusapi'`
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 13:48:26 GMT):<br/>
Yeah that should do it.
It is "normal" in the sense that the addition of the dependency still works IIRC, so you can ignore that error, but obviously not normal in the sense that we should fix that.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 13:49:19 GMT):<br/>
Other pro tip: You might need to restart VSCode to load the type definitions of the package you just added
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 13:49:29 GMT):<br/>
I usually do that by hitting F1 and then search for "reload window"
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:21:15 GMT):<br/>
Also added this little piece of advice to the contributing.md doc just now =>
https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/pull/830
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:31:29 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the help, really appreciate that.
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:32:03 GMT):<br/>
BTW, should   `./node_modules/.bin/lerna bootstrap` change package-lock.json?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:32:15 GMT):<br/>
No worries. If you get any more questions just keep 'em coming, it helps us make the documentation better.
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:32:25 GMT):<br/>
I think the error I got previously by lerna add
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:32:53 GMT):<br/>
`lerna ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/jasonwang/cactus/examples/cactus-example-supply-chain-backend/node_modules/.bin/cactusapi'` this one
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:32:57 GMT):<br/>
If you changed any of the dependences / dev dependencies in the package.json then the lock file should be updated accordingly as well yes
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:33:12 GMT):<br/>
Is mainly because every time I run
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:33:14 GMT):<br/>
./node_modules/.bin/lerna bootstrap
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:33:26 GMT):<br/>
it would change my package-lock
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:33:34 GMT):<br/>
So I did not do this previously
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:33:47 GMT):<br/>
You can make that error go away if you do an `npm run configure`
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:34:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm yet to figure out where that error is coming from exactly, just haven't had time yet, but it's on the backlog fo rsure
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:34:26 GMT):<br/>
for sure*
</p>
<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:35:15 GMT):<br/>
Yes, thanks a lot. But I think good news is that `lerna ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/jasonwang/cactus/examples/cactus-example-supply-chain-backend/node_modules/.bin/cactusapi'` is not a issue. It just some error occured by my local side.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 17:52:48 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari I answered via email: The generic top level view is most useful. We can refer to the specifics to illustrate how the framework can be adapted for different interop solutions
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 17:54:46 GMT):<br/>
I'm working on the document, will send it over the email thread later today (fingers crossed) :-)
Thanks again for the rosetta one, it's very helpful!

Rosetta was just meant as illustration. I can help with final draft of Cactus doc.

Hi All, I am trying out the Cactus Corda plugin and want to understand how this (https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-corda/src/test/typescript/integration/jvm-kotlin-spring-server.test.ts#L152) JSON is created for flow invocation. Is there tool is used for this or the JSON is created manually? @peter_somogyvari
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 05 May 2021 13:09:34 GMT):<br/>
@arijit_6 That JSON is created manually for now, but of course we have plans to improve on that ;-)
Corda 5.x might ship with advanced RPC features that will allow us to make it much simpler.

Hi everyone! I am trying to run tools/ci.sh, but the tests are running for over 50 mins now. Referring to a post I found in this chat, my laptop should be within the minimum requirements - 8GB RAM, Dual core CPU (4 threads), OS is Fedora release 33 (Thirty Three). Is this expected as my laptop is slightly above the min. requirements?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 14:56:34 GMT):<br/>
@hristiy4n Yes, that's expected unfortunately. The CI suite has grown quite a lot due to us adding a lot of tests which is good in itself, but not when you think about the runtime).
At that point the ci script should be running the tests already so what you can do if you don't want to wait for it is to just stop it and run `npm run configure` instead which will skip test execution but still perform an initial build that you'll need to get cracking with the code.
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 14:56:46 GMT):<br/>
Hey @hristiy4n . I would say that is normal.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 14:58:10 GMT):<br/>
@arijit_6 No worries, thanks for asking these questions, it helps me prioritize my efforts when it comes to documentation and features. ;-)

No guide on writing the JSON just yet unfortunately, but I can whip something up today, I'll keep you in the loop.
</p>
<p><strong>hristiy4n</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 15:42:01 GMT):<br/>
Great! Thanks for the swift reply. I will follow the README and see if I can get the API server up and running :)
</p>
<p><strong>hristiy4n</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 15:43:01 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 06 May 2021 17:10:59 GMT):<br/>

Do you have a corda network running that your connector is connected to?
</p>
<p><strong>arijit_6</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:15:10 GMT):<br/>
yes it is running and the main-server (Docker process) is connected with it
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:16:12 GMT):<br/>

Can you share the entire code maybe in a github repo by any chance?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:20:14 GMT):<br/>
Or the exact repro steps on a terminal
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:20:36 GMT):<br/>
It's hard to say why some endpoints would be 404 because we have automated tests for all those endpoints
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:21:09 GMT):<br/>
My best guess is that maybe the 0.4.1 version main-server didn't yet have those endpoints, checking that now
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:22:51 GMT):<br/>
Nah, v0.4.1 does have the list flows endpoint so I'll really need the steps you took from the beginning
</p>

(or a repro code)
</p>

cant share the entire code base but sharing the steps I performed
1. 3 Node setup of this corda sample  - https://github.com/corda/samples-java/tree/master/Advanced/obligation-cordapp

2. started the docker using the below command - sudo docker run -e SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON='{"cactus":{"corda":{"node": {"host": "172.41.50.87"}, "rpc":{"port": 10008, "username":"user1", "password": "password"}}}}' -p=8080:8080 petermetz/cactus-connector-corda-server:latest

3. Then executed this code 
```var {DefaultApi} = require("@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-corda")
  
  async function getNodeDetails(){
    
    const apiClient = new DefaultApi({ basePath: 'http://localhost:8080' });
  
    const flowsRes = await apiClient.listFlowsV1();
    console.log(flowsRes.status);
    console.log(flowsRes.data);
  }

  getNodeDetails();```

This should be enough for me to repro, let me try
</p>
<p><strong>arijit_6</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:28:14 GMT):<br/>
is there any version mismatch between docker image and cactus library ?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:28:50 GMT):<br/>
There might be, but I know for a fact that the list flows endpoint didn't change so that is probably not the issue
</p>
<p><strong>arijit_6</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:31:52 GMT):<br/>
Ok, and not only list flows diagnoseNodeV1 and invokeContractV1 is also not working. Getting the same error

<p><strong>arijit_6</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:31:55 GMT):<br/>
If you found some thing please let me know
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:32:53 GMT):<br/>
Actually, the docker image might be out of date now that I think about it. Could you try launching this container instead, the tag being:

`hyperledger/cactus-connector-corda-server:2021-03-30-b03611f`
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:35:57 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, it must be the docker container being old, you were right.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:36:35 GMT):<br/>
So if you try with that image tag , it should work. If it still doesn't ,then potentially this one instead `2021-03-25-feat-622` (because this is the one that the test cases use)
</p>
<p><strong>arijit_6</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:43:33 GMT):<br/>
Thank you so much this tag worked `2021-03-30-b03611f`

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:46:53 GMT):<br/>
The short story of it is that you need to specify the exact JVM fully qualified class names (e.g. with packages)
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:47:44 GMT):<br/>
But I'll come up with a better way to explain it
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:48:09 GMT):<br/>
And also a better way to handle that whole thing because Ideally you could just pass in a "normal" JSON that everybody's used to in Javascript
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:48:29 GMT):<br/>
(much harder to do than say because Java has strict requirements for types)
</p>
<p><strong>arijit_6</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:57:31 GMT):<br/>
yes I understand the challenge with Java, it will be great if we able to simplify the RPC invocation process..
</p>
<p><strong>arijit_6</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 07:34:30 GMT):<br/>
A suggestion I have, currently we can invoke those cordapps flows which are deployed through the cactus connector (main-server) but cant invoke a cordapps which is already deployed or running on the network. We can have a option to upload the jar existing cordapp on cactus connector and which will be stored in the spring boot app class path as the cordapp class are required for deserialization. I think in that way we can invoke the existing cordaap also without deployment.

Hi all,

A merge freeze is in effect until the 0.5.0-alpha.0 goes through: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/pull/927

See a detailed explanation about the why and how here: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/issues/451

Important note to reviewers: 
Keep chugging along with those reviews. 
A merge freeze doesn't mean that PRs cannot be reviewed, just that they won't be merged until after the freeze is over. 

TLDR `Do NOT seize/put on hold any of your review activities on account of the merge freeze.`
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 18:44:39 GMT):<br/>
@arijit_6 I think you might be able to achieve that outcome of only uploading the jars to the spring boot connector app by passing an empty array for the `cordappDeploymentConfigs` property of the deployment request. That way the connector will accept and put the jars on it's own class path and just call it a day without trying to shell into the node (because the array is empty).

Note to self: This should explicitly be documented in some shape or form because it's not obvious unless you have read the code of the connector itself (which is obviously not very user friendly as a requirement :-) )
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Sat, 08 May 2021 00:14:43 GMT):<br/>
@arijit_6 I got started with the examples here: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/pull/944
This only covers the simple cases for now but the more advanced ones will be there next week too.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Sat, 08 May 2021 00:15:16 GMT):<br/>
And I had the idea that maybe we could ease the pain of it by creating our own VSCode extension, but that's sort of a moonshot idea I'm just floating around for now to see what people think.

Hi, does anyone has experience of dealing with  `Starting of dummy infrastructure crashed:  Error: BesuTestLedger#waitForHealthCheck() timed out (120000ms) -> Error: read ECONNRESET` when running the supply-chain example?
Previously, I run the supply-chain example using docker, I thought it was due to the docker pull cactus-fabric-all-in-one takes too long.
So I switch to run the application locally and use `docker pull hyperledger/cactus-fabric-all-in-one:2021-03-02-ssh-hotfix` ahead of npm run start 
But still getting this error
Any helps would be hugely appreciated

<p><strong>jscode017</strong> (Sun, 16 May 2021 14:47:09 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, of course. But it was more like a stupid error on my side. I change the setting to only allocate 2 cpus to my docker desktop about last week and forget to change it back when running the example. 
Though it do get me a while to get to that issue since the `starting dummy infrastructure `seems like do not need much resource.

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Mon, 17 May 2021 18:32:57 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for sharing, I still think this is a great addition to our FAQ because if it happened to you, it could also happen to others (whatever reason you had to change your docker CPU count could also happen to others, etc)

Hey, I am new to the cactus community. I am working on a PoC for the Iroha ledger connector plugin for the HL Cactus + HL Iroha integration project.
In the documentation of Ledger Plugin API (https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/whitepaper/whitepaper.md#532-ledger-plugin-api), I see Verifier functions like `getSmartContractList()`, `getBalance()` etc. I do not find implementation for these functions in the fabric ledger connector plugin (https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric).
Shouldn't these functions be implemented for every ledger connector plugin? If not, then How does a ledger connector plugin get this information from the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>siv2r</strong> (Tue, 18 May 2021 01:25:15 GMT):<br/>
Also, Is there a dummy ledger connector plugin implementation or a template that I can refer to?

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 18 May 2021 04:00:29 GMT):<br/>
Hi @siv2r That discrepancy is there in the API surface as a temporary thing that we are trying to work out  as we speak.
If you want a super bare-bones example then here is one for that: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/main/packages/cactus-cmd-api-server/src/test/typescript/fixtures/plugin-ledger-connector-stub

BUT what I recommend is to just literally copy and paste one of the existing ledger plugin packages instead and then rename the package in it, gut the code down to the minimum, etc.

Lastly: I think the mentorship  candidate selection process hasn't concluded yet so you might want to hold off with that work until that's done otherwise the work might become duplicated.

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 23:00:21 GMT):<br/>
Depends on your appetite for being on the bleeding edge. :-) Only updating npm v7 is the safer choice for now and in the coming weeks we'll gain more confidence in also upgrading node itself, but for now I'd recommend doing just npm v7.
There's a pending PR that will add Node v16 to the test suite matrix meaning that we'll know a lot more about potential v16 specific bugs in the coming weeks, but right now, not so much.
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 23:03:00 GMT):<br/>

@RafaelAPB I've been on Node 16 for the last few days and we also now have the CI matrix testing against it, so at this point I can give the update that as far as I know right now it is safe to switch over to Node 16. (still not necessary, but it looks good so far).

If a few weeks pass from now and we still haven't found any issues that we couldn't solve then I'll start recommending that everyone switch to Node 16 if they can. (for now I'm just making the declaration that it appears to be ready, but not recommending just yet)

As the README of "boot method" describes, in the normal case the above seven containers launches. According to your error message "UNAVAILABLE: failed to connect to all addresses", I think that some fabric peers were not safely launched.

As the README of "boot method" describes, in the normal case the above seven containers launches. According to your error message "UNAVAILABLE: failed to connect to all addresses", I think that some fabric peers were not safely launched in your case. If that is right, I can supply some alternative method.

@Ben10ers Thanks for using the cartrade example! In order to resolve your error, could you tell me about the following question?
When you execute the command "docker ps" on the console after the command of "script-start-ledgers.sh", what containers are launched on your environment? If any of the following containers does not be launched, that may be the cause of the error.

<p><strong>dbdagr8</strong> (Mon, 07 Jun 2021 13:41:42 GMT):<br/>
Hi,
I am using cactus hyperledger fabric plugin to deploy, invoke and query chaincode.
On deploy I am not able to understand the sshConfig part and what to specify in that.

I want to deploy locally using APIs. 
Invoke and query are working fine but on deploy I am getting following error: 
```
 AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: config must be a valid object
    at NodeSSH.connect (node_modules/node-ssh/lib/cjs/index.js:123:25)
    at PluginLedgerConnectorFabric.deployContract (node_modules/@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric/dist/lib/main/typescript/plugin-ledger-connector-fabric.js:98:19)
```
Why sshConfig is always required?

I initialized PluginLedgerConnectorFabric as below: 
```
		let connector = new PluginLedgerConnectorFabric({
			connectionProfile: connectionProfileJson,
			discoveryOptions: { asLocalhost: true, enabled: true },
			instanceId: instanceIdConnector,
			pluginRegistry: pluginRegistry,
			eventHandlerOptions: { strategy: DefaultEventHandlerStrategy },
		});
```
What I am missing? 
Please help!!
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Mon, 07 Jun 2021 15:47:30 GMT):<br/>
Hey, welcome to the community. sshConfig is needed because operations like deploying chaincode rely on establishing an ssh connection between the test ledger container and the peer containers. Which test are you running?
</p>
<p><strong>dbdagr8</strong> (Tue, 08 Jun 2021 05:17:58 GMT):<br/>
I am not running any test, instead I am using cactus to expose APIs to deploy, invoke,query etc for my fabric network.

@peter_somogyvari Regarding the CI check tool.
According to the current configuration, every time a Pull request is merged into the main branch, the CI check must be redone. Considering that it takes more than an hour to complete a CI check, I think that I cannot cope with a situation where the code needs frequent changes.
However, it is not large enough that all code has to be CI checked every time (For example, there is no need to do CI check on the document pull-request, right?). Since CI check is mandatory for all pull-requests, this inconvenience will occur.
I would like to be able to choose to avoid CI checks when merging pull-requests. Is it possible to change the specification?

@Ben10ers Thanks for your replying. I think that your error was caused by the error when you executed the command of script-start-ledgers.sh.

(1) What is OS and version of node.js in your machine environment? Especially, at the present time we recommend node.js-v12 when we use car-trade. (The latest version of node.js will be available in near future.)
(2) Could you share the log when you execute the command of script-start-ledger.sh as txt file? I think that the log includes clues to resolve your problem.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but we would like to solve this problem soon. We would appreciate your cooperation.

Hi everyone! I started playing around with the Cactus `cartrade` example (on commit `a93e451`). 
As a first step, I planned to switch from the provided `fabric-samples` Fabric network to my custom Fabric network (different org/node names, TLS, no CAs), but the chaincode is the same `fabcar`.
I have newly generated `crypto-config` and corresponding `wallet` directories for the my network members. 
I'll continue with the details in the thread ->
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 10 Jun 2021 12:27:05 GMT):<br/>
So I tried to locate every file (config or JS/TS) that contains Fabric connection information, and I found these:
1. `examples/cartrade/config/default.json `
2. `examples/cartrade/validatorDriver/queryCar.js`
3. `examples/cartrade/validatorDriver/config/default.js`
4. `examples/cartrade/validatorDriver/src/config/default.ts`
5. `packages/ledger-plugin/fabric/validator/src/dependent/PluginConfig.ts`
6. `packages/ledger-plugin/fabric/validator/src/dependent/connection.json`
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 10 Jun 2021 12:28:32 GMT):<br/>
However, I'm facing some issues with the configuration. 

For example, in file 1, how can I provide cert information for the nodes, as required by TLS?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 10 Jun 2021 12:29:47 GMT):<br/>
Also in file 1, it seems like the CA component is not optional. Why does the app needs a CA? Every identity is already generated and present. Is the CA mandatory?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 10 Jun 2021 12:34:25 GMT):<br/>
I'd really not like to downgrade to a network without TLS (and with solo orderer), so any pointer is appreciated!
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 07:27:15 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari Do you have any insights into the cartrade app's TLS support?
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 13:33:41 GMT):<br/>
Ok - what you need to provide for the sshConfig is defined on the typings ->index.d.ts of the node-ssh package. More practically, you can check examples on the connectors' test files
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 17:32:52 GMT):<br/>
@klenik I'm mostly familiar with the supply chain and the carbon accounting examples of ours. Car trade is best known by Takuma.
@takeutak Could you please check this out?

Hello, everyone :)
Cactus beginner here. I'm working on building a connector for Polkadot in Hyperledger Cactus and currently trying to implement the "deployContract" function for Polkadot, for the deployment of a smart contract. Based on the other connectors, both the request and response of this function (and other parameters, such as Web3SigningCredential types) are first generated on an open api json file, specific to each connector. Do I also need to build the open api for the Polkadot connector for this function's implementation, or can I build it after the implementation? 
Also, is the open api file required for the generation of the SDK?
Thank you in advance!
</p>
<p><strong>takeutak</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 13:42:02 GMT):<br/>
@klenik Very sorry to reply late.
Thank you very much for your question. You would like to replace the Fabric network provided by car-trade with a custom Fabric network.
Would you mind if you wait my answer for a little, as I am planning to answer after we verify it among the development members? I will reply this week.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 13:44:40 GMT):<br/>
Sure, thanks for the effort :) As I saw in the code, when the fabric node objects are created, the required tls artifacts are not loaded, although there were attempts, which are now commented out 
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 21:44:01 GMT):<br/>
Hi Catarina, welcome welcome welcome! :-)

1. You can start without defining the OpenAPI specs if you prefer. If you do this your test case will have to directly call the connector instance instead of going through the API client (which is okay to start)

2. Yes, the generation of the SDK is 100% based on the openapi.json file

2. I need to know in corda connector, can we pass jar path instead of passing base64 jars if jars are present on same system locally and docker can mount jarpath directly?

@albusaidi Thank you for contact us!
To test the behavior of Hyperledger Cactus, it would be faster to actually use the sample business-logic applications. You can try the following three applications with an Ubuntu virtual machine:

(1) car-trade: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/v0.4.1/examples/cartrade
Cactus car-trade is a sample application where users can exchange car ownership (represented by Fabcar chaincode tokens on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain) for ETH currency on a private Ethereum blockchain.

(2) electricity-trade: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/v0.4.1/examples/electricity-trade
Cactus electricity-trade is a sample application for exchanging electricity (which is measured by a device that is logging to a Sawtooth blockchain) for ETH currency on a private Ethereum blockchain. When the measuring device detects power usage, a Sawtooth transaction triggers a Cactus LedgerEvent to pay the device user's currency on the Ethereum blockchain, where the amount paid is proportional to the amount of power usage recorded on the Sawtooth blockchain. In this example, we use the Sawtooth intkey transaction processor as an application for power measurement logging.

@albusaidi Thank you for contact us!
To test the behavior of Hyperledger Cactus, it would be faster to actually use the sample business-logic applications. You can try the following three applications with an Ubuntu virtual machine:

(1) car-trade: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/v0.4.1/examples/cartrade
Cactus car-trade is a sample application where users can exchange car ownership (represented by Fabcar chaincode tokens on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain) for ETH currency on a private Ethereum blockchain.

(2) electricity-trade: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/v0.4.1/examples/electricity-trade
Cactus electricity-trade is a sample application for exchanging electricity (which is measured by a device that is logging to a Sawtooth blockchain) for ETH currency on a private Ethereum blockchain. When the measuring device detects power usage, a Sawtooth transaction triggers a Cactus LedgerEvent to pay the device user's currency on the Ethereum blockchain, where the amount paid is proportional to the amount of power usage recorded on the Sawtooth blockchain. In this example, we use the Sawtooth intkey transaction processor as an application for power measurement logging.

@takeutak Thank you, I started following the issue :)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 28 Jun 2021 09:35:02 GMT):<br/>
@takeutak The main issue is that I'd like to use TLS, but the cartrade example doesn't allow the specification of TLS certs. So it's mainly a demo issue, the Fabric validator allows for the same, since it's using the common connection profile of the Fabric SDK.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 28 Jun 2021 09:38:27 GMT):<br/>
So while the above issue is valid, I think the core issue is that the configuration file of the cartrade demo is not flexible enough. Relying on the Fabric SDK connection profile (embedded in the cartrade config file, or as a reference to an external connection config) would be more straightforward, and would circumvent potential feature gaps

@peter_somogyvari, regarding ODAP, BUNGEE, CC-TX-Viz, and packages that use connectors: is it fine if they receive API clients instead of a plugin registry? I understnad that if you have a plugin registry you can access plugins IF 1) you have an api server, and 2) if they are running on your api server (?);

But that might not be the case; our plugin might benefit from obtaining data from a connector running somewhere outside our node. Is passing API clients a good option?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 06 Aug 2021 14:48:44 GMT):<br/>
@RafaelAPB I'd say yes to the API clients with the caveat that instead of passing the API clients I'd be passing the options of said API clients so that it's JSON serializable.
Second thing: The plugin registry and the API client within your plugin implementation are not mutually exclusive, they both can be there and used at the same time if you like.

hello everyone :slight_smile: 
I'm a Cactus beginner and I'm implementing a smart contract migrator between heterogeneous blockchains, and I have a question regarding Cactus. Is it possible to deploy a Typescript smart contract in fabric using Cactus? Also I would like to know if it is possible to use Cactus feature to instance a test ledger to test the fabric test files, according to the example given in deploy-cc-from-typescript-source.test.ts file in cacus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric directory and if you could explain me how do I configure to do that?
Thank you very much for your help in advance! :slight_smile:

> if you could explain me how do I configure to do that?

Sorry, not sure what you mean, all the configuration necessary is in the test case including the pulling up of the ledger. Or do you mean something additional?

You can run it via the test runner tap as shown in these examples in the documentation: https://hyperledger-cactus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#running-a-single-test-case

You can also do it via
`yarn ts-node $YOUR_TEST_CASRE_FILE_RELATIVE_PATH`

Also, how can I integrate both connectors in my tool, is there any tutorial or any steps available so I could follow?

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Mon, 23 Aug 2021 18:19:57 GMT):<br/>
@luisabrunhosa I personally use the solidity extension of VSCode and sometimes also an npm package called HardHat if I need the compilation to be scripted/non-manual.
If you clone the project sources VSCode should automatically show a pop-up offering to install the recommended Extensions and the solidity extension mentioned above is one of them so you should accept that pop-up and then you are good to go meaning that after that you can right click on any solidity file in VSCode and have an option to compile it which will place the JSON artifact(s) in the ./bin/ directory of the project root afterwards.

Hi all! :) 
I'm building a cactus connector to Polkadot. 
Polkadot's consensus type does not correspond to any of the ones listed in ConsensusAlgorithmFamily class (from @hyperledger/cactus-core), so I tried to add it to the class manually, by changing the openApi of the cactus-core-api.  

I only added the lines with a new enum member Substrate both in "ConsensusAlgorithmFamily" and  "ConsensusAlgorithmFamiliesWithTxFinality" in the OpenAPI.
However, after running npm run config again, for some reason the open API changed the generated names of the other enum members  (Authority -> ProofOfAuthority, Stake -> ProofOfStake and Work -> ProofOfWork), which caused errors on other connectors when trying to access the enum members. 

Any idea why this is happening? Does it have to do with OpenAPI rules I'm missing?

Thanks in advance!

Yesterday I rebased my fork to update it with changes from the upstream. I noticed there was a yarn.lock file, and that package-lock.json was not there.
Now when I run npm install, I get some weird warnings and it always ends in an error (invalid version). Do I have to run an additional command? Or it was something wrong with my rebase?

Hello all , 
What should be the applicationHostInfo.hostName in the default.json file on ubuntu machine inside virtualbox for CARTRADE example implementation ?

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 21:08:57 GMT):<br/>
@CatarinaPedreira Yup, we've migrated to yarn meaning that there are no more package-lock.json files in every package (instead now we only have the yarn.lock file in the root for all packages).
What you can do is
`npm run install-yarn`
and then just say
`yarn install`
and finally any package-lock.json files that are still present on your branch need to be simply deleted.

If you have conflicts with yarn.lock you can resolve those in any direction and then just run `yarn install` again which will update the file to match whatever dependencies you have declared in the package.json file which are the true source of truth.
Finally, you can say `yarn configure` to run the configure script and build the project (previously this was called via "npm run configure")

@VikiAnand I'm only guessing here: For local development it's "localhost" or maybe "0.0.0.0" could work. Tagging @takeutak because he's the authoritative source to answer the question not me. Takuma, please do chime in :-)

@VikiAnand Thank you for your comments.
This problem is reproduced in some of our machines.
We already found that the cause is that fabric-samples/fabcar-1.4.1 does not work in some environments at present. I will update the version of fabcar which is used in Cactus-cartrade soon.
We are currently in the middle of a major refactoring of some code on another matter, so we would like to resolve this problem later. I will report it on the issue below when it is finished, so could you wait a moment?

Hi,
Is single Cactus instance enough to connect multiple networks (3 or more), or for each connection another instance should be?
And another question - about performance - what is performance of "atomic swap" between two networks?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 09 Sep 2021 15:16:36 GMT):<br/>
@baziorek Hi Greg, you can load any number of connector plugins into a single API server instance and to connect to all those ledger through the connectors.

Performance: Unclear, we haven't had time to do the benchmarks yet unfortunately.

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 19:18:36 GMT):<br/>
@VikiAnand Not recommended to use in production until we hit 1.0. Hopefully that's happening this fall.

Hey everyone.

I have the following bug when running the substrate ledger environment test:

I double checked that the image ghcr.io/rafaelapb/cactus-substrate-aio:2021-08-26-first exists locally with "docker image ls" and it does. However, it seems that tryPullimage() is trying to pull the image from the docker registry, and the image is not published there, which is probably the reason for this bug. 
From what I understood, only @peter_somogyvari can publish the images. Peter, is it possible for you to publish this image in the registry? (this image is generated from the dockerfile of PR https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/pull/1274/files)
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 15:13:41 GMT):<br/>
That image is outdated. I can push the latest (or @peter_somogyvari could push your image to Hyperledger, so your PR tests pass)
</p>
<p><strong>CatarinaPedreira</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 17:44:13 GMT):<br/>
Thank you Rafael! The test is now finishing with success (I pushed the image to my github repo and set the visibility to public), but yes if Peter could publish it to the official repo it would be nice too :)
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:02:40 GMT):<br/>
@RafaelAPB @CatarinaPedreira Built and published the image on the official repo from your branch as it is today. The fully qualified image tag: `ghcr.io/hyperledger/cactus-substrate-all-in-one:2021-09-24---feat-1274`

I noticed that the public-api.ts file in the cactus-test-tooling does not contain the SubstrateTestLedger class and options exported, but contains all the other test containers. Could this be the reason for this error?

On the third build, the error comes from the substrate-test-ledger-constructor-test (a docker error that occurs sometimes, I'm not yet sure why, will check this problem).

Hi @karayel `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use` means that you are already running something on that port. Is there some other app you are running also bound to 8000?

> Could this be the reason for this error?

Could be, but it depends on whether that class is being used outside the package or not. If some of the CI matrix's components succeeded then likely there's some other reason.

Hi @karayel 
Thank you for contracting about discounted-cartrade.
It seems to me that you are running the command “TEST _ POOL _ IP = 172.16.0.2 python -m main” on ~/cactus_validator_socketio/validator-python in local environment.
However, this command must be executed on /root/validator in the validator container.
So, please run the following commands:
...
$docker exec -it validator bash
$ cd /root/validator
$ TEST_POOL_IP=172.16.0.2 python -m main
...
(Reference: Step3 of https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/9a3d89ae2f5d4862d58a69c56b47d7de3ee7ac3d/examples/discounted-cartrade/README.md#how-to-execute-indy-validator)
</p>
<p><strong>karayel</strong> (Tue, 28 Sep 2021 06:16:07 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for your answer @t-yasushi  Actually I ran the python code in the container. However, in the container I couldn't find the /root/validator directory. Then I guessed that I should run the main.py in the /cactus_validator_socketio/validator-python directory of the container. 

Regarding the problem I noticed the following commit: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/commit/35b20ac25df207c5cf329f60541c69375b408ab1

So is it possible that the related python code is actullay ran while container is started and when I try to run again I come accross the "address already used" error?

@karayel
Thank you for telling me the situation.

After Step 6 of the link below, can you try the following two operations?
https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/main/examples/discounted-cartrade#how-to-construct-indy_testnet-environment

The following operations are required to enter the validator container and launch the sample program to verify indy pool communication.

1. Mount sample programs folder
　 Add the following to the parameters in the validator of doker-compose.yaml:
　 (Change source to the directory containing indy-sdk.)
   ----------------------------------
    validator:
　    volumes:
        - type: bind
          source: "/home/user001/workspace/indy-testnet/indy-sdk"
     　   target: "/root/indy-sdk"
   ----------------------------------

2. Log in to the validator container and run the sample program.
   ----------------------------------
　 $ sudo docker exec -it <container ID> bash
　 root@c09106e72918:/# cd ~/indy-sdk/samples/python/
　 root@c09106e72918:~/indy-sdk# TEST_POOL_IP=172.16.0.2 python -m src.main

@hammerstrike It's an implementation of the object store plugin that uses IPFS for storing arbitrary pieces of data in a key/value store format. There is no specific example use case for it just yet but the idea is to provide an easier mental model to developers who are coming from a centralized cloud provider dev environment for example. E.g., if you used S3 or MinIO before, than this should look familiar but with IPFS being the backing storage.

@CatarinaPedreira @RafaelAPB I had some more time to look into the subtrate contract node connectivity issue of the AIO image. Seems like they have additional CLI args that you can pass in to make it listen on all interfaces. It is quite confusing because they have `--ws-external                      Listen to all Websocket interfaces` but also `--unsafe-ws-external               Listen to all Websocket interfaces` and the two appears to be doing the same thing according to the docs but I suspect maybe only the unsafe option works?
The way I figured this out is by opening a shell directly into the running container and then saying `/var/www/node-template/.cargo/bin/substrate-contracts-node help` which printed out the documentation of theirs (which I could not otherwise locate in the github repo of the contracts node unfortunately)

TLDR: Try passing in the `--unsafe-ws-external` flag and then check out the container logs appear to show that it is binding the WS port to *all* network interfaces not just localhost.
One more thing to keep in mind: if you are observing the container logs through the cactus test execution, then this might not show up because the test will only start streaming the logs "as soon as possible" on a best effort basis and so there's a race condition here where I think the initial log messages of the container just don't appear in the test logs so you have to directly inspect the logs via the docker client on your terminal e.g. `docker logs your-container-name-or-id`

Update: I pushed the fix to your branch, the unsafe parameter made it so that it binds to all interfaces. Also published the image

Hey everyone.
I wrote tests for the Polkadot Connector (which I still didn't push as a pull request), and all of them (except one) were passing the other day. 
Today, I ran them again and I get an "Error: Request failed with status code 404".

It seems that this problem is internal to Axios, and the promise is not resolving when I call any function through my apiClient (the latter is built similarly to apiClients in the other connectors' tests). Did this happen to anyone? How can I fix this?

Thank you.

@peter_somogyvari @RafaelAPB can you help me with something?
I wrote tests for the Polkadot Connector (which I still didn't push as a pull request), and all of them (except one) were passing the other day. 
Today, I ran them again (without changing the code or updating any library) and I get an "Error: Request failed with status code 404".

It seems that this problem is internal to Axios; the axios promise is being rejected when I call any function through my apiClient (the latter is built similarly to apiClients in the other connectors' tests). 
I did some research on the bug and it seems like Axios is not being able to find "/api/v1/plugins/@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-polkadot/get-transaction-info" although it has found it in the past.

The function getTransactionInfo is generated by the OpenAPIGenerator, and it is present in the generated api.ts file.

Did this happen to anyone in the past? And do you have an idea of how I can fix it?

Thank you.

I wrote tests for the Polkadot Connector (which I still didn't push as a pull request), and all of them (except one) were passing the other day. 
Today, I ran them again (without changing the code or updating any library) and I get an "Error: Request failed with status code 404".

It seems that this problem is internal to Axios; the axios promise is being rejected when I call any function through my apiClient (the latter is built similarly to apiClients in the other connectors' tests). 
I did some research on the bug and it seems like Axios is not being able to find "/api/v1/plugins/@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-polkadot/get-transaction-info" although it has found it in the past.

The function getTransactionInfo is generated by the OpenAPIGenerator, and it is present in the generated api.ts file.

Did this happen to anyone in the past? And do you have an idea of how I can fix it?

Thank you.

@CatarinaPedreira I'd double check if you are also registering the endpoint instance on the backend (in the plugin's registerWebSErvices function). Usually if that's missing then you get 404 errors.
Also, if you can, please make sure your code compiles, then commit it, push it to a branch and send the link here then I can test it on my side and help with debugging if necessary. :-)

<p><strong>CatarinaPedreira</strong> (Sat, 23 Oct 2021 18:36:29 GMT):<br/>
Thank you Peter. I will double check that, push it to a branch and get back to you !

<p><strong>CatarinaPedreira</strong> (Sun, 24 Oct 2021 00:02:36 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for the delay, had to work on some other stuff in the meantime. It's solved, thank you :)) For some reason I commented out this particular endpoint instance from the registerWebServices function :person_facepalming_tone1:

@CatarinaPedreira  No worries, the same thing happened to me about 10 times before I stopped making that mistake... :-)

Hi Team,
I was exploring corda connector, and wanted to know the format of private key, HostKey that needs to be passed in SSH for deploying jars to node.

I passed pem as string but getting following logs on docker container: 

```

@dheerajbudhiraja Where/how did you obtain the pem from that you are passing in?
</p>
<p><strong>dheerajbudhiraja</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 05:41:11 GMT):<br/>
pem is private key to connect to ssh.
</p>
<p><strong>dheerajbudhiraja</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 05:41:11 GMT):<br/>
pem I passed is private key to connect to ssh. And known host entry field is required , what to pass into that field? I tried passing node's public ssh key into that field. But I was getting same error logs in docker container as stated above. Below is sample values which I am using to pass into deployJars:

For now you can pass any non-blank string in there because that field is not used for now in the backend (the feature behind it is under construction)

@dheerajbudhiraja Also wanted to mention that we have pair programming sessions available for everyone publicly so if you feel it's easier to help you with screen sharing and talking live then let me know. Our pair prog sessions run 3 days a week on Monday, Wednesday, Friday 7:45 to 8:00 Pacific Time =>

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 29 Oct 2021 20:49:08 GMT):<br/>
@dheerajbudhiraja One last thing: If you want to take a look at a working example that does what you are trying to do then look at this test case:
`packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-corda/src/test/typescript/integration/deploy-cordapp-jars-to-nodes-v4.8.test.ts`

https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-corda/src/test/typescript/integration/deploy-cordapp-jars-to-nodes-v4.8.test.ts
</p>
<p><strong>dheerajbudhiraja</strong> (Mon, 01 Nov 2021 06:18:34 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari  Yes followed the same steps in the test file you shared.

deployJars is succesfully connecting with node via ssh, shutting down the node, at SCP jar transfer step, it fails.

One thing I wanted to clarify is ssh credentials used are for corda node only and not the host machine?
I tried scp via terminal to corda node but that also doesn't works. 

Maybe I am missing something here. Will try to join programming pair session.

@t-yasushi 

Based on the error
`ERROR: http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main: DNS lookup error` I would say it's most likely your proxy again because I haven't seen this error before in either the CI nor my local machines. :-(

I found some solution regarding this issue:- 
I made change at line 207 in `node_modules/@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric/dist/lib/main/typescript/plugin-ledger-connector-fabric.js.`
I replaced `await ssh.putDirectory(tmpDirPath, remoteDirPath);` with `await ssh.putDirectory(tmpDirPath, remoteDirPath,{concurrency: 1});`
</p>

@deepakwipro You are the best, thank you so much for coming up with the fix at the same time. :-)
I'll commit the fix ASAP and we'll have a release with it hopefully next week in the form of `1.0.0-rc.3`
Please keep an eye out for the release and the release notes to know when the fix is published onto  npm.

Hi @peter_somogyvari cc: @izuru

I'd like to question about Corda plugin on behalf of one contributor who plans to contribute it (He will get LFID and access this page soon).  He said that some error happened when he uses this plugin.
Would you mind if you answer to the following question?

Question

When I execute the following command, the Corda container starts without error, but the Corda-Connector container exits with an error. Would you please give me your thoughts to solve this error?

At cactus/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-corda

$ npx tap --ts --timeout=600 src/test/typescript/integration/deploy-cordapp-jars-to-nodes.test.ts

Hi @takeutak and @peter_somogyvari we would like to use Cactus in our project for blockchain interoperability and we would like to know which is the best way to start. We have already tried to identify ways to develop our cactus-based solution, and tried the cartrade example but we now need to develop our own use case and business logic. Is there some files/directories that we can use as templates to write our business logic? Is there any documentation for this? And does Cactus support Fabric v2.x? Thanks for your support

HI @haniavis cc: @izuru

Thanks for your interest about Cactus!

> Is there some files/directories that we can use as templates to write our business logic? Is there any documentation for this?

I'm afraid that we are considering to prepare the template and documentation.  As you said, the template and docs are useful for Cactus users, so I will notice you again if those are ready.

> And does Cactus support Fabric v2.x?

I'm afraid that the car-trade app currently supports only Fabric v1.x, but I will contact you if v2.x are supported.

BTW, if you don't mind, we might be able to give you some advice if you let me know what use case you want to develop.

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 23:22:17 GMT):<br/>
@takeutak That test must be a bit flaky because I just ran it and it worked on my machine (classic, I know).
A few questions to help debug on your side:
1. Are you on the latest upstream/main (or a branch that's based on it)?
2. Have you executed `yarn configure` successfully prior to running the test?
3. Does it have the same problem if you try with the other test cases that I mentioned last time on our call, e.g. packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-corda/src/test/typescript/integration/deploy-cordapp-jars-to-nodes-v4.8.test.ts ? (you will need to unskip the test in the code)
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 23:23:27 GMT):<br/>
@KaranKulwal Sorry for the slow response! Besu has it but Quorum not yet. There's a PR that's being worked on to make it happen: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/pull/1337
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 23:26:00 GMT):<br/>
@deetho @dheerajbudhiraja Alright, I shall look into that separately then, assuming it could have something to do with the higher latency between machines on account of the VM being remote. Any chance that you could post the output of a ping command here with which you pinged the remote VM just so that I get at least a rough idea of the latency we are talking about?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 23:29:29 GMT):<br/>
@deetho @dheerajbudhiraja Could you also let me know roughly the size of the chaincode that you are trying to deploy? E.g. is it 5 megabytes of 50 or 500?

@deetho @dheerajbudhiraja Could you also let me know 

1. roughly the size of the chaincode that you are trying to deploy? E.g. is it 5 megabytes of 50 or 500?

2. Also the type of chain code that you are deploying (NodeJS, Go, Java?)

<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:14:05 GMT):<br/>
@haniavis Please take a look at the supply chain app example [1] [2] that uses the published ledger connector plugin for Fabric [3] (which does support Fabric 2.x)
The seeming disconnect between what @takeutak and I am saying comes from historical reasons where some parts of the codebase are still in the process of getting integrated into the framework and so the car trade app and the relevant parts of it are not yet published on npm in any form just yet and you are better off looking at the packages that already are such as [3].

I solved this error by opening the port for RPC ("32888" in this time).

However, I got another error at deploying the smart contract.
If you have any ideas to solve the error, I would appreciate your advice.

Thank you for your response!
(I am the contributor who @takeutak mentioned before.)

I solved this error by opening the port for RPC (e.g. "32888" in this time).

However, I got another error at "t.true(promRes.data.includes(promMetricsOutput), "Total Transaction Count of 1 recorded as expected. RESULT OK",)" in "deploy-cordapp-jars-to-nodes.test.ts".
If you have any ideas to solve the error, I would appreciate your advice.
(I guess that it may be caused by some port issues, too.)

(Do we have something to do related to Prometheus before running "deploy-cordapp-jars-to-nodes.test.ts"? Otherwise, I guess that it may be caused by some port issues, too.)

@K.Keita Yeah you do need to have your firewall open for ports that are being used. Looking at the second error with this additional piece of information in mind I would also guess the firewall first.
</p>
<p><strong>KaranKulwal</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 03:55:15 GMT):<br/>
Great @peter_somogyvari. can you please give a time window for quorum private transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>K.Keita</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 12:13:53 GMT):<br/>
I solved the error by modifying 'hostname: "0.0.0.0"' in line 334 of the script to 'hostname: "localhost"'.
Thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 17:54:51 GMT):<br/>
@K.Keita That's interesting, if the firewall doesn't let you bind to 0.0.0.0 I thought the code would error out because of it, but maybe the firewall doesn't block the OS from binding but then proceeds to black-hole all traffic related to that port anyway (and so the OS happily confirms the port bind which doesn't actually work)
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 17:56:04 GMT):<br/>
@KaranKulwal Estimations are hard™, but I'll go ahead and say that the PR with the quorum private tx support should be merged in December.

I do not exactly understand what happened, but I guess that a http proxy in our environment causes this error somehow.
What I had tried is as below.

1. I run the script, and I got the error which said "<html><h1>Access to this site is blocked by the administrator</h1></html>". I guessed that something happened on a http connection.

<deploy-cordapp-jars-to-nodes.test.ts>
***********

  const listenOptions: IListenOptions = {
    hostname: "0.0.0.0",
    port: 33333,
    server,
  };
...
    t.ok(promRes.data);
    console.log(promRes.data)
    t.equal(promRes.status, 200);

2. I executed "curl" command to "localhost" and "0.0.0.0", and doing "localhost" is worked.

Console

3. I guessed that connecting to "0.0.0.0" which is the destination of "apiClient1.getPrometheusMetricsV1()" (right?) caused the error, and it may be by our http proxy.

@haniavis Absolutely, please stay tuned for the 1.0 release which is hopefully dropping early next year. If you DM me your contact details we could chat more about your use case too, I'd be interested in some more specifics such as whether you need atomic  swaps or just eventual consistency between the separate ledgers and what kind of data is being moved and between what type of ledgers (I assume one of them is likely to be Fabric based on your question)

@K.Keita I agree and thank you for the detailed write-up on the issue and the investigation. I'll open a bug to fix the test cases where we are needlessly binding to all network interfaces instead of just the localhost. (All tests should be able to pass by binding to either localhost or the specific private LAN IP of the interface - for tests where multiple containers need to talk to each other)

@takeutak Do you use the `jade` dependency for anything in `packages/cactus-cmd-socketio-server/package.json` ? I'm asking because of this: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4vmm-mhcq-4x9j
</p>
<p><strong>izuru</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 08:08:52 GMT):<br/>
we will investigate that and try to remove that dependency

@izuru Thank you. FYI: I also took a quick look as well and it did not appear to be in use (I did free text searches)

@Princekumar4812 The next one is on the 13th of December, 4 PM Pacific Time. 
Then the next two after that will most likely get cancelled due to most people going on PTO for the last two weeks of the month, but I cannot confirm nor deny that until we discuss it with the rest of the maintainers as per the agenda => https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/cactus/2021-12-13+Cactus+Maintainers+Agenda+-+Regular+Session

@peter_somogyvari do cactus have function to get list of committed chaincodes in HLF?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Mon, 20 Dec 2021 21:16:40 GMT):<br/>
@deetho You could probably invoke one of the system chaincodes via the Fabric connector to get the information you want.
For example the LSCC system chaincode seems to have operations for listing the chain codes installed:
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/main/core/scc/lscc/lscc.go

Also, we have an example of the Fabric connector doing something similar internally where it queries the QSCC system CC to obtain blocks by transaction ID packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric/src/main/typescript/common/get-transaction-receipt-by-tx-id.ts
So you could probably take pieces of that code as inspiration or as a helpful example

And please let me know if you could make it work because if not, I would want to know why (and then if it's an issue with the connector then we need to fix that as abug)
