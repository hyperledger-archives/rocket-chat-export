{"msg":"I know earlier we put down the identities design principle as aspirational, but thinking through the use-cases that I had in mind I came to think that there's a lot of the real-world scenarios where permissions/access control has a crucial role (which is why we also see a lot of permission-ed DLTs being developed for enterprise use-cases) and permissions/ACLs are useful when we deal with identities as well. So, IMO dealing with identities should also be at the core of what we intend to do instead of being on the wish list. Note: I don't mean for us to be a standalone identity framework or identity provider of some sort, just that we focus a little more on the ability of being able to correlate identities cross-chain, supporting especially the framework(s) that are being developed by the identity WG here at Hyperledger.

{"msg":"Still reading other's papers to get a better grasp of the implementation details (and what I *exactly* want to do). \n\nBUT the vision is that whatever the identity WG comes up with from that big consolidation process of theirs should be something that we are aligned with.  Two reasons for the latter idea:\n1) It would be nice if different Hyperledger projects fit/worked together like legos (so long as they don't constrain each other of course). Don't know if this has ever been an explicit goal or not but I just made it up myself that I think it should be.\n2) From what I understood based on the recent meeting minutes of the identity WG is that they are trying to come up with something uniting DID, DIF, Sovrin/Indy and that's basically the heavy lifting done (if they succeed) for us in terms of how we should approach identity.\n\nI know it's vague, but even just talking about it helps me seeing the bigger picture (at least it feels like it)","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2019-12-13T22:14:17.528Z"}

Much more details on the link (chapter 5 of the document), but here are the key points:\n* For browser based apps that cannot safely store private keys: We need a server side keychain.\n* We need our own authentication service so that said web app users users can interact with the server side keychain if need be\n* All this enables both client and server-side signing of transactions that a user wants to submit to a ledger through BIF.\n* Make it possible for end users to associate their BIF identity to wallets on other ledgers that they own\n* Registry of identities, credentials and other metadata so that a search/discovery feature can be implemented that maps a name of a person or organization to their digital identity, wallets, etc. (only what they choose to make public/discoverable)\n\nhttps://github.com/petermetz/blockchain-integration-framework/blob/docs/peter.somogyvari/whitepaper/docs/whitepaper/whitepaper.md#5-identities-authentication-authorization\n","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2019-12-27T08:01:31.786Z"}

{"msg":"@Abhishek2700 1-5: Sounds correct, yes.\n\n(i) Right now we are still in the design phase with the plugin architecture so the only way at the moment would be sub-class (or write from scratch) your own connector implementation for the given ledger. I'm literally working on the plugin architecture right now for making this easier to customize as we speak so would love to hear what is the exact use case you are evaluating BIF for! (or as much as you can share).\n\n(ii) Transfer should still go through as long as there is at least one trusted validator alive, but I believe the current code to be buggy when it comes to this: a validator node being dead incorrectly causes the verification to fail. Not tested this just based on what I read in the code it looks like it doesn't tolerate any validators being down.\n\n(iii) Per design the transfer should succeed as long as at least one validator is alive. We don't yet have a rollback safety mecnanism in case all of the validators went down so the transaction would stop there with current codebase, but the assets are also can be unlocked so eventual consistency can be guaranteed with some improvements (that are coming). \nLocking an asset in our current contracts is NOT irreversible the way sending coins to a dead address on one of the permissionless ledgers is (locking is reversible by the contract itself). \nThe design idea here is to have a persistent transaction state storage for BIF that survives downtime. Going back to the plugin architecture again: said transaction storage backend should be pluggable so that if you deploy BIF you can pick what you prefer (maybe you want some p2p storage, or just pay a cloud provider to have an RDBMS do synchronous replication to different regions)","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2020-01-17T00:56:00.424Z"}

{"msg":"@Abhishek2700 \n\n1.) As the operator of a cluster you are responsible for making sure that there is network connectivity between the nodes. Whether it's a software defined networking environment (like what Docker Compose gives us) or a physical network it doesn't matter: as long as there is connectivity to the addresses/hosts you supply in the config, it should work. There is a caveat with cross data center or cross region deployments that I noted down here for reference: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/issues/63\n\n2.) They are strictly just for leader election at the moment. In the future (long term) we intend to re-design the system so that leader election for validators is either a) not needed at all or b) it is embedded in the validator codebase itself (e.g. a Typescript Raft algorithm implementation)\n\n3.) It's up to the person who performs the installation. Etcd servers don't need to be on the same machine as the validators and their numbers don't need to match the number of validators either. Etcd works best when it has an odd number of nodes in a cluster.","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2020-01-21T00:35:12.011Z"}

{"msg":"I'm happy to show up as well (and apologies that I haven't so far, I'm still working on the schedule).\nThe first thing that comes to my mind that we need 100% is some enum/boolean (I prefer enums even when there's only 2 possible values to begin with) property describing whether the ledger with the given consensus algorithm has transaction finality. A lot of modern ledgers have pluggable consensus so it's probably wiser to actually have the transaction finality property specified for consensus algorithms and the ledger instance should describe the algorithm it's running on so one could retrieve information about transaction finality with a reference chain like this: \n`ledger.consensusAlgorithm.transactionFinality == TransactionFinality.GUARANTEED` or `ledger.consensusAlgorithm.transactionFinality == TransactionFinality.NOT_GUARANTEED`\n\nAnd then for a BIF transaction proposal one could write code that examines the to-be participating ledgers transaction finality and take action if there's a mismatch.\n\n`Transaction commit rates`: Do you mean from a performance/throughput perspective or specific to the algorithm's configuration (like block size, number of transactions per mined block, etc?)","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2020-05-06T18:03:30.218Z"}

{"msg":"@peter_somogyvari i understand the boolean on finality as a first step, but remember that even ledgers with finality \"are not all the same\"; they may have the same semantics but have very different trust (e.g. you might trust a ledger with multiple organizations participating in the ordering and validation of transactions more than you trust a ledger with an ordering service provided by a single organization)","username":"MicBowman","ts":"2020-05-06T22:00:57.474Z"}

{"msg":"@MicBowman Yeah, I remember these coming up. Have you seen the response we provided regarding trust/authority on the TSC list?

{"msg":"yes, i saw the response. i think we need to keep separate what is \"useful\" and what is \"provable\"... \"useful\" works well with out of band information between a small set of parties; \"provable\" will be necessary in a world where there are \"many\" ledgers and out of band trust is not sufficient","username":"MicBowman","ts":"2020-05-06T22:19:28.080Z"}

Are there any criteria for determining compatibility matrix of a ledger? Or just have to look at current example? . Id prefer to work on something code related that would benefit the project the most from a code perspective.","username":"dmproof","ts":"2020-05-30T05:42:51.304Z"}
{"msg":"Sounds good. There is a process for getting changes approved, yes, there has to be at least two maintainers in approval of any given pull request. With that said, adding a new ledger to the list of supported ones is a very low-key change (thanks to the plugin architecture which we invested into heavily from early on) so adding support for new ledgers is not something I would expect to be opposed by any of the maintainers. With that said of course, you can always open a github issue with the feature request issue template and write it down there that you wish to add this contribution and before you invest any of your time and effort (which we very much value!) you would like to get preliminary confirmation that nobody has any problem with the idea/feature on a high level. This is just an optional step in case you want to be extra sure. I personally can tell your right now as one of the maintainers that I'd love to get new ledgers added. Corda is being worked on as we speak, but we can talk about vechain for sure, but here I also have to be honest and upfront about the fact that we are not yet production ready (we are a top level project within Hyperledger, but with a status of \"incubation\"). So at present when we add a supported ledger we only go as far as contract deployment through the plugin implementing the ledger so if you are looking to contribute a fully featured implementation and expect to use it to interop vechain with other ledgers right after the fact, that will have to wait a little longer (we'll definitely get there, but I'm trying not to over-promise or hype anything because we'd rather get the trust of people long term than get everyone excited and then disappear). Regarding the criteria for ledger compatibility: we want to support every ledger that at least has the capability to read and write block data and the ability to have smart contracts deployed on it. It's a pretty low bar that we set like that intentionally because the goal of the project is making as many ledgers as possible work together even if certain cross-ledger operations have to happen in some downgraded way because one ledger has a feature that the other does not (e.g. transaction privacy). The currently supported list of ledgers is evolving all the time (and note that by support I don't yet mean full support just that we've laid out some ground work and started working on it). Right now, the latest is this: we have besu and quorum ledger plugins set up with automated tests deploying contracts and making that functionality available through the API server as well through REST calls which  are conveniently callable through the SDK which runs on NodeJS and browser as well. (I'm happy to show you around the relevant code components for all of this by the way, just let me know). What's in the works is corda and Fabric 1.4 (for both of those we start with an all-in-one docker image for enabling scalable test automation). So, circling back to code... if you want to get started with a vechain integration then my first question is, can you make an all-in-one style docker image that -upon the launching of the container- pulls up a testable  (but not production ready by any means) ledger implementation? The requirements would be basically the same as for any other ledger, as an example you could take a look at what I wrote down for Jacob who is working on the exact same all-in-one image just for Corda: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/issues/143\n","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2020-05-30T06:05:57.124Z"}

{"msg":"If you ask me, for popular/interesting ones, personally, I would look at Burrow because that's the one I know of, but looking at Vechain (now that you brought it my attention) it does also look like a potential good candidate because they seem to have made good effort on containerization => https://github.com/vechain/thor#docker Not sure if that docker image of theirs meets all our requirements (no host binding of ports/volumes of any kind) but its definitely a good start when a ledger already has a single image that you can use to pull up a working/testable node of theirs. For some more interesting stuff (again just personal opinions) I would also want to explore how/what kind of integration could we do with DAML (which is a smart contract language not a ledger). I can imagine us being able to deploy smart contracts in both the ledger-native language and also in DAML (where the ledger is DAML-compatible). This could actually turn into a bigger piece of work because if it works then some or all of our existing ledger plugins could also be updated with DAML support. This one is sort of a wild card instead of just being about development one would have to also delve into the architecture/design first to make sure it all makes sense at the end of the day. Lastly, if you happen to know any ledgers that are out there and popular among developers, that's always a good candidate for us to have support for just based on the popularity.

{"msg":"It might be a bit too early to discuss here how Cactus will implement escrow contracts for token/coin transfer, since Cactus seems to focus on non-fungible asset transfer between ledgers by locking the assets and then releasing a representation of it at another ledger at the moment. Nonetheless, I wanted to share some thoughts. My current understanding is that cactus wants to achieve an atomic inter-blockchain transfer of tokens/coins with escrow contracts in the future. That means that either the complete transfer is conducted or all participants are completely refunded and no partial transfer is done if an error occurs. I want to talk about this last step when an escrow contract is supposed to refund its locked up tokens to the original owner if the atomic inter-blockchain transfer failed for whatever reason. In case the escrow contract is written in solidity on the Ethereum blockchain and locks up Ether, I am not sure if this last transaction can always successfully refund the Ether (even after retrying to send the transaction several times). I am not referring to the problem that permissionless blockchains might fork and hence some transactions might not end up in the best chain. The problem that the Ether refund might fail forever is that the address where the Ether is sent to might be a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain which has a malicious or accidentally malfunctioning receive() or fallback() function.","username":"DOBEN","ts":"2020-06-02T13:25:06.742Z"}
{"msg":"In more detail, if the original address (the address used for locking up the Ether in the escrow contract) is an externally owned account (EOA), then it should be possible to always send Ether to that address. But if the original address is a contract account (CA), then there are several reasons why this external call could fail. If the receiving address is a contract, it could have a fallback()/receive() function implemented that simply throws an exception, once it gets called. Another reason for failure is running out of gas.\n\nhttps://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html\nhttps://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common-patterns.html#withdrawal-from-contracts\n\nPeople recommend using the pull-over-push pattern to shift the risk associated with transferring Ether to the user or at least making sure that a failed Ether transfer does not block any code in the escrow contract after the failed Ether transaction has thrown an exception and every state change is reverted. This pattern is safer but it does not solve the problem that the escrow contract is unable to refund the Ether locked up.\nSince we cannot influence or check the code at the contract account (CA) before sending the Ether. We have to expect that some refund transactions will not be possible. That means that some Ether might end up being locked up forever in the escrow contract.\n\nIt could be argued that it is the responsibility of the receiver to make sure that the address is able to receive the money back but there are also disadvantages on the escrow contract side and reasons why somebody might behave like this even though they loose money.","username":"DOBEN","ts":"2020-06-02T13:25:25.242Z"}
{"msg":"1. We cannot guarantee that the inter-blockchain transfer is atomic which was the goal of cactus.\n2. Somebody might just send very small amounts of Ether and does not care if the address is able to receive Ether back. The transaction still costs gas which might prevent such spamming in Ethereum but in other protocols with no gas cost this might be possible. It is a kind of spamming attack and the escrow contract ends up being a garbage collector.\n2. There will be at least one person who accidentally locks up 100000 Ether and then cries and ask us for help.\n3. People are curious to see how cactus or the other connected blockchains are behaving in such a scenario and playing around/ testing the limits of this feature.\n4. It would be good to at least donate such money rather than locking it up.\n\nThere might be some workaround to only allow EOA to lock up assets with “require(tx.origin == msg.sender)” but is it really that we want to disallow any CA to interact with the escrow contract. There are also very big warnings to use tx.origin in require expressions because of security issues.\nMy second workaround that I though of was creating an escrow contract for every two parties that want to transfer the value among them and then use selfdestruct() (ether sent cannot be blocked in this function) to refund the ether but this also causes probably new issues.\n\nAdditional comment: If the inter-blockchain transfer is successful and the escrow contract is supposed to pay out the locked ether to its new owner. The same problem occurs that some ether might be locked up forever.\n\nIn Fabric: The escrow pay out might also have problems if the certification authority revoked the credentials of the user or if its certificate has been expired meanwhile or if the organisation of the user left the network. The user might be already removed from the user database when the refund transaction should take place.","username":"DOBEN","ts":"2020-06-02T13:25:39.724Z"}

I apologize if some of these issues have already been discussed. Thank you. If I can help in any of these tasks, please let me know.\n\nI was wondering if people would like to have an “emergency break feature” in cactus. In case the livelihood of one of the connected blockchains reduces below a specific threshold, the emergency break can be activated to prevent any further asset transfer out of this blockchain to keep all blockchains alive. The emergency break can be deactivated if enough assets have been returned to the affected blockchain.  The emergency break could be either activated/deactivated by a trusted external party or could be hard coded and automatically activate in case a specific threshold is reached. How to define and measure the livelihood of a blockchain that I am not really sure about. If all tokens/assets of the total supply value are tradeable/spendable in the network, then the livelihood of the network is 100%. But we don’t know how many of the tokens are locked up/ burned in addresses that nobody has access anymore because e.g. the private keys got lost. Should the livelihood of a blockchain be defined with respect to how many transactions are done per second with that token?","username":"DOBEN","ts":"2020-06-03T02:03:50.444Z"}

Under the “Digital Millennium Copyright Act” in the USA, the possession of some data is illegal e.g. cases of illegal primes. There might be laws and regulations in some countries that if people lock up data in escrow contracts, they are not in control of this data anymore and hence, avoid legal punishment if they were in the possession of such sensitive/illegal data beforehand. Some people might therefore try to lock up such data in escrow contracts.

{"msg":"Another topic: There was this discussion about “burning of tokens” in one of the cactus papers. I agree that in general it is not advised to do so if connected to the cactus network since cactus does not want to jeopardize the “livelihood “of any of the connected chains (If  all the tokens are burned of one chain and no new tokens are mined in that protocol of that chain then the chain is literally dead.). Nonetheless, if someone is still using this pattern to interact with cactus, what would be the recommended implementation to “burn tokens”? Should there be some recommendations in the white paper in the future? I saw at least two different implementations, so I was wondering what are the pros and cons and which is the recommended one when interacting with cactus?\n\t1. Implementation: Tokens are sent to the address of the coinbase/generation transaction in the genesis block (the address of the miner that mined the genesis block, this is the address where the reward for mining the block is sent to). \n\t\t1.1. Additional comments with respect to Bitcoin:\nSince most people in the bitcoin community assume that Satoshi does not know the private key of the address of the coinbase transaction in the genesis block, all coins collected in that address are burned since nobody has access to the private key to reclaim them. It is not proven if or if not Satoshi has the private key of that special address.\n\t\t1.2 Additional comments with respect to Ethereum: I think it is proven that nobody knows the private key of the that coinbase address in the genesis block because it was set to the special address “00000.......000000”.\n2.

{"msg":"@JuanNogueira Personally, my aim is to have an initial release out by the end of September and from then on have regularly scheduled releases every month or possibly even every week that are automated to the extent that the process is not impacting our focus. Ideally it would be a proper continuous delivery pipeline that takes the latest code at any given time, parses the commit messages (which are enforced by tooling to be in a machine readable format) for determining the type of release that should be issued according to semantic versioning rules (e.g. breaking changes trigger a major release). Everything is always a little slower than we hope/expect, but this is the vision we are driving towards. The initial release is still not planned to be something production ready, it would most likely be v0.3 and if all goes well we could have a production ready release with performance benchmarks and extensive test coverage by the end of this calendar year that we could dub as a v1.0.","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2020-08-25T16:01:53.412Z"}

However, as this technology is moving so quickly, there are bugs and performance issues. \"Developers and researchers have, therefore, to choose between novelty and stability, leading to a vast diversity of choices.

{"msg":"@sfuji822 That one is still in progress unfortunately (it is just a draft, so not ready for review).\nMy latest info is that the container image itself is operational, but the test automation is still being finalized.\n\nFurthermore there's this technical challenge that is unsolved by this PR about the RPC communication between Cactus and the Corda nodes/apps. There are basically 3 options to communicate from the NodeJS code with Corda \n\n1) host a Java app as an in-between  translation layer (because Corda RPC libraries are written in Kotlin)\n\n2) run the java app in graalvm and directly invoke the RPC related code from NodeJS\n\n3) compile the RPC corda code from Kotlin to JS and use that as a NodeJS library directly in Cactus.\n\n4) use SSH to connect to the corda server and execute tasks via the CLI  (such as deploying contracts, starting flows etc)\n\nIn the #190 PR we went with option 4) because it was the simplest for a proof of concept, but longer term of course this will not scale well for high throughput, performance sensitive production deployments so my plan is to work on option 3) as the most maintainable option. \nOption 1 and 2 both require external processes to be running in tandem to the Cactus process so both of those are sub-optimal when it comes to maintenance and operational complexity because of the extra processes (also bad for containerization because by design a container's life-cycle is tied to a single process running in the container)\n\nThat's the context so far. What I could use help with is the implementation of option 3) and if that turns out to be very high effort then option 2 as a fallback/last resort.\n\nRegarding my try on option 3 so far: Tried to add the kotlin JS plugin to my corda fork, but the build then crashes with some gradle dependency error that I haven't yet had the time to investigate properly.","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2020-09-04T17:01:43.923Z"}

(cc: @JHamilton @sfuji822 @hartm  )\n\nI am looking at implementing code to run cactus-ledger-connector-besu (or fabric, quorum) from the Ledger Plugin Verifier <https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/ledger-plugin/VerifierBase.ts>.\nTherefore, I'm currently investigating Peter's codes, but there are some things that I cannot understand yet. Would you mind if you answer the following two questions (1) and (2) ?\n\n(1) As I surveyed, cactus-ledger-connector-besu can be called with a RESTful OpenAPI, and I think the call is what the OpenAPI Generator does. I think the definition of API to create is written in openapi.json below.\n\n* Besu: signTransactionRequest <https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-besu/src/main/json/openapi.json#L512>\n\"transactionHash\",\n\"keychainId\",\n\"keychainRef\"\n\n* Fabric: RunTrasactionRequest <https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric/src/main/json/openapi.json#L168>\n\"keychainId\",\n\"keychainRef\",\n\"channelName\",\n\"chainCodeId\",\n\"invocationType\",\n\"functionName\",\n\"functionArgs\"\n\nThen, let me question about it. Could you mind if you tell me what parameter values are specifically assigned to these parameters in a sample application such as supply-chain-app?\nFor example, it would be helpful if you could tell me the relevant part of the code.\n\n(2) After the transaction was issued by cactus-ledger-connector-besu (or fabric, quorum), did you obtain the response for the transaction result in this code? So does it include some kind of blockchain monitoring?\nIf you have some kind of monitoring function, it would be helpful if you could tell me the relevant part of the code.","username":"takeutak","ts":"2021-02-22T06:21:46.234Z"}

{"msg":"@baziorek \n1. Nobody is working on it as far as I'm aware (so chances are that no one is). With that said it would be a most welcome contribution for sure so thank you for considering/doing this!\n2. Yes, it's not easy to make it so, but this is one of our core design principles and have been focusing on this a lot when it comes to architecture.\n3. Yes. We have a working example of a plugin that was written in Rust here for example: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/main/packages/cactus-plugin-keychain-vault/src/cactus-keychain-vault-server\nIt's a standalone web server capable of serving API requests conformant what is in the openapi spec file here:\nhttps://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-keychain-vault/src/main/json/openapi.json\n\nThe example above is not an example of a ledger connector plugin but instead is a keychain plugin, but the concept is the same: If you want to implement a plugin that runs on something other than NodeJS then on top of implementing your plugin logic you will also have to implement the web server part, but for this I recommend using the OpenAPI generator instead of rolling your own (I used the rust template to generate the linked keychain plugin above).\n\nAs another example we have the recently added (and for now kinda half-baked) corda plugin which follows the same pattern but instead of rust it is a JVM spring boot app written in Kotlin: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-corda/src/main-server\nAnd again, the only code I actually wrote was the code that implements the REST endpoints, all the other boilerplate is auto-generated from the OpenAPI specs that we give you.\nThis is how the corda connector  generates it's API server boilerplate for example: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-corda/package.json#L16\n4. Yes it is.Plugin instances have a uinque `instanceId` property which will allow us in the future to route requests to different plugin instances where they can be connected to separate ledgers of the same kind such as two distinct Fabric ledgers.\n\n5. We have a daily pair programming call where everyone is welcome to join and ask about code, building, project setup, architectural decisions, etc. so feel free to drop by there as well and I'll be happy to chat about everything I just wrote in more detail or actually demonstrate how it all works:\nhttps://lists.hyperledger.org/g/cactus/viewevent?repeatid=35080&eventid=1059715&calstart=2021-03-08","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2021-03-07T05:16:29.485Z"}

I have few more questions (to precise description of proposal):\n2. To sum up - to integrate Cactus with some blockchain it is enough to code *plugin*, but it is not easy task, am I right? But it is OK for summer internship (3 months), or rather too hard?\n3. To sum-up technology to create plugin - the easiest is to code in NodeJS. It is also possible in other technologies (working implementations are in Rust, Kotlin) but it is necessarily to create also web-server, which can be generated with [openapi-generator] (https://openapi-generator.tech).","username":"baziorek","ts":"2021-03-08T08:13:35.189Z"}
{"msg":"@baziorek My pleasure. Sure thing, I'm happy to take a look at the proposal as well if you have a link to the document.\n2) I agree that it should be doable if they go with the path of least resistance for implementation which seems to be the option of using the Iroha JS client to implement the Cactus ledger connector plugin. Since the connector plugin runs in NodeJS and not the browser I assume we also don't need the grpc-web-proxy that the readme talks about here https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript\nSo if the basic connectivity between the Cactus plugin and the Iroha ledger can be trivially established as above without further issues (not always the case), then the rest of the connector development is largely just about writing the open API specs file and then make sure that there's a compliant implementation and proper, end to end test coverage with pristine ledgers being pulled up in containers as part of the integration tests, like we do it here: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric/src/test/typescript/integration/fabric-v1-4-x/run-transaction-endpoint-v1.test.ts\nI think this is doable in 3 months because for most of it there's existing examples just for other kinds of ledgers plus if they get stuck with anything we are available every day through the pair programming sessions as well. Plus, personally, if they really get stuck hard on something I don't mind jumping in and helping with the code itself either, usually it's just a matter of pinging me with a question and a link to your fork+branch name and I'll be happy to check it out.\nNote: since we consider end to end test coverage crucial for accepting pull requests I would recommend planning on finishing the connector itself ahead of time maybe in 2 months and then allocate the last month specifically for test coverage and hammering out the details (which I think is doable if one is provided with help whenever they get stuck which we are happy to provide)\n3) Yes, all correct.","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2021-03-08T14:01:58.441Z"}

{"msg":"Gotcha. The short answer is that the lock files should not just after a build unless mistakes were made (which happen all the time though)\n\nIf you did change the dependency versions in the package.json files then you just need to revert it back to whatever it was under version control but I'm guessing this is not the case.\n\nIf you have your fork/branch up on github I can also take a look if none of this helps. Just let me know. \n\nIn theory you just need to leave the npm versions as is to have the lock files remain stable, unless there was a mistake and someone committed code where they didn't update the lock file in tandem with their dependency changes.\n\nI checked the latest main as of right now with a fresh clone + `npm run configure` and the lock files are untouched so what I can suggest is to drop the changes that were made to your lock files, rebase onto the latest main branch state and then do npm run configure and the only lock file changes after that should be the ones that are legit, e.g. they are there because you yourself changed some dependency versions in the package.json.","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2021-04-15T00:05:23.821Z"}

If you DM me your contact details we could chat more about your use case too, I'd be interested in some more specifics such as whether you need atomic  swaps or just eventual consistency between the separate ledgers and what kind of data is being moved and between what type of ledgers (I assume one of them is likely to be Fabric based on your question)","username":"peter_somogyvari","ts":"2021-12-03T15:51:40.113Z"}
