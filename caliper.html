Hi @rjones, there are some folks on the original caliper repo, any way to let them auto redirect to the new repo?
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:02:15 GMT):<br/>
fork
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:02:43 GMT):<br/>
sadly, no
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:03:18 GMT):<br/>
github only gives one redirect, once you create a new repo it breaks it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:03:46 GMT):<br/>
@Haojun what are the github IDs of the people who will have commit access to caliper?
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:05:15 GMT):<br/>
OK... can we restore the archived repo, sign the commits and re-transfer the repo?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:06:13 GMT):<br/>
how are you going to do that? `filter-branch` ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:06:41 GMT):<br/>
everyone will need to sign each individual commit
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:08:37 GMT):<br/>
if you look at https://github.com/hyperledger-archives, you'll see original repos for the `fabric` projects. they all went through the squash commit.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:08:47 GMT):<br/>
also, all of the `sawtooth` repos had this process
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:08:54 GMT):<br/>
OK，I see. Please give commit permission to feihujiang and me
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:09:04 GMT):<br/>
what is your github id?

great, I see you accepted.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:11:36 GMT):<br/>
do you want me to walk you through a squash commit?
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:11:52 GMT):<br/>
Sure, that would be helpful
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:12:02 GMT):<br/>

hi, i think caliper is an interesting project for benchmarking the own blockchain system. however i am struggling with sawtooth api 0.8 as we use 1.0.1 and i wonder are there are plans to update the sawtooth adapter to the new sdk :) unfortunatelly i don't know nodejs and even then probably could not translate much as i have no idea about the differences of 0.8 and 1.0.1 
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 07:58:50 GMT):<br/>
@sillysachin , thanks for your willing to help. Be free to submit github issues or start a discussion here if you have any ideas to improve the project
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 08:01:07 GMT):<br/>
@xcr, as far as I know, some people from Sawtooth is testing Caliper and will help to support v1.0
</p>
<p><strong>xcr</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 08:02:54 GMT):<br/>
it's really hard with so many new techniques and languages. with java i might probably help ;)

North Bound Interface. It is an abstraction layer above the different blockchain platforms, so the callback modules can be implemented in a blockchain platform-independent way.

@Haojun Can you take a look at the metrics document, in particular the section on transaction latency under case 1 to see if the definitions are useful to caliper
</p>
<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 13:34:19 GMT):<br/>
@Haojun Can you take a look at the metrics document, in particular the section on transaction latency under case 1 to see if the definitions are useful to caliper. it was discussed on the PSWG today. happy to chat offline about it.
</p>
<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 13:44:40 GMT):<br/>
specifically we discussed measuring trx latency from 3 perspectives;
</p>
<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 13:44:54 GMT):<br/>
1. client side / observer - i.e the test harness
</p>
<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 13:44:54 GMT):<br/>
1. client side / observer - i.e measure from the POV of the test harness itself
</p>
<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 13:45:14 GMT):<br/>
2. blocktime - typically defined by the SUT itself
</p>
<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 13:45:14 GMT):<br/>
2. blocktime - typically defined by the SUT itself. this may be fixed or variable based on the specific SUT
</p>
<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 13:45:45 GMT):<br/>
3. trx and block propagation _amongst peers_ 
</p>
<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 13:45:45 GMT):<br/>
3. trx and block propagation _amongst peers_  - perhaps recorded as the distribution or min/max/avg measurements of the 2 dimensions

I want to start contributing to this project. Where can I start with?
About me:
Hello I'm Punit Agarwal, an open-source contributor and a blockchain enthusiast. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate studies at Computer Science Engineering Department of The LNM Institute of Information Technology, India. I have been in programming for 4 years now. I started out with C/C++ in my intermediate studies and moved ahead to try my hand at JavaScript and Go. I have a knowledge on Hyperledger frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer. I have earned IBM badges for IBM Blockchain Foundation Developer and IBM Blockchain Essentials courses. I successfully completed the blockchain course on EdX, by The Linux Foundation. 
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 01:35:27 GMT):<br/>
@smcnamara , I've read the section before and have no special comments. Point 1 & 2 are what we do in caliper now. 
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 01:47:15 GMT):<br/>
Regarding point 3, what's the meaning of 'recorded as the distribution or ......'?  Now caliper get the tx status from a single peer (although different caliper client may select different peers if you use multiple clients at the same time to run the test), and I agree measuring with different peers may give different latency value even for the same transaction.
</p>
<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 08:53:10 GMT):<br/>
thanks for clarifying 1 & 2 @Haojun 
</p>
<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 08:54:10 GMT):<br/>
on 3 - there was a discussion about measuring propagation amongst peers. Its not right or wrong - just another metric that might be interesting to measure.
</p>
<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 08:56:10 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps by harvesting all the node/peer logs we could calculate the latencies  for trx and block propagation.
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 09:11:37 GMT):<br/>
 there are two dir in benchmark: simple and drm. what is the difference?
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 09:48:02 GMT):<br/>
@wangdong they are two different test cases. The 'simple' is for a simple bank scenario, and 'drm' is for digital rights management scenario. We plan to provide some out of box test cases for typical DLT scenarios, and users can run the test which they interest in. But we don't have much resource on that now.
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 13:36:28 GMT):<br/>
@Haojun great, thanks for the explanation.

How to integrate a project which was built using hyperledger composer with caliper? 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 07:15:14 GMT):<br/>
@srinivasan23 - there is PR pending in Caliper for just that  :)
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 07:25:33 GMT):<br/>
If you wanted you could pull my branch to try it out, but it will only work for Composer v0.19.0 and above - we recently released (yesterday) with breaking API changes, the PR contains updates to account with those ... there are no more breaking changes planned, if they are I'll make sure the Composer plugin for Caliper can cope with them ;-)

Hey,

Struggling to test my own network, can anyone give a bit of clarification?
The example is running fine

I'm following: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/docs/Composer.md

It says to put the bna under a /contract/composer/bna folder.. But I noticed all the other examples have the lib and models, so I'm guessing it creates the bna for you in those examples?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 21:30:16 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisMcQueenDevelopment : Was this intended for the #caliper or the #composer channel?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 21:30:34 GMT):<br/>

</p>

In https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/docs/Composer.md#testing-your-own-business-network-definition, it looks like the directory should be `src/contract/composer/bna` folder

Hello.. I have a composer network (v0.16.5) with fabric (v1.0.6). Can I test this using caliper?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:46:52 GMT):<br/>
There is a Composer plugin for Caliper, though it is only compatible with v0.19+ and Fabric v1.1
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:47:49 GMT):<br/>
The business network itself is fine to use "as-is" - it is the Fabric to which you deploy to that is the restriction

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:51:19 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisMcQueenDevelopment Hi - yes you are correct, the source files are deployed directly from that folder and there is no requirement to use a BNA. Previously it was working from BNA's but a change was made when moving to Composer v0.19 to remove the use of binary files ... i missed the edit on that document when submitting - sorry!
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisMcQueenDevelopment</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 08:29:35 GMT):<br/>
Hi @nkl199 - no worries and thanks for getting back to me! It's running now :)

Hey again - my transactions are failing, are there any recommendations to investigate why? I've done printing the results but they just return that they failed and not why. 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 12:05:57 GMT):<br/>
It might help to inspect the logs here - you can toggle debug on the `composer.json` file that is specified in the config file (it lives in the /network/fabric-v11 folders) to change the loglevel to "DEBUG". You will also have to remove the "end" command in the config file to prevent the containers from being cleaned up (or ctrl-c the test run once you have hit a failure). Once you have spun the test, you can perform a 'docker logs' on the containers to see what is occurring?

There seems to be an error throw out of my control from blockhain.js file, any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 12:10:36 GMT):<br/>
in your test file, how are you submitting a transaction in the 'run' function?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 12:12:51 GMT):<br/>
My first thought is that the error indicates there is an error before `bc.bcObj.submitTransaction` is being submitted, and that the set of results are being populated with an error instead of a transaction result

It's strange as now a couple of are passing (although returning null as the result) and the rest are failing with an empty array
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 12:19:55 GMT):<br/>
That looks valid, though even if there is a failure, you should be getting back an object. It is likely worth toggling the debug setting to see if something is happening under the covers in the chaincode containers
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 00:43:10 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisMcQueenDevelopment The `results` should be returned (e.g. return Promise.resolve(results))

I tried to run it on default fabric network, that it creates for testing

It is possible that your machine can't handle the >100 TPS rates during the rounds when everything (Caliper and the Fabric network) is running on the same host. Try lowering the TPS rates to 10 in config.json and let me know how it goes
</p>
<p><strong>SwatiRaj</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 12:37:40 GMT):<br/>
Thanks I ll try and let you know
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 12:37:56 GMT):<br/>
(In an environment with limited resources, the connections to the eventhubs might be abruptly closed, that's why you don't get the notification)
</p>
<p><strong>SwatiRaj</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 12:43:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @klenik  It worked by lowering the transaction rate
</p>
<p><strong>SwatiRaj</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 12:44:28 GMT):<br/>
What is the recommended resources size in order to handle a larger no of transactions per sec?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 13:11:58 GMT):<br/>
There is no simple answer for that question. So here is a long "answer" :) And I hope the core devs will correct me if I'm wrong. 
Capacity planning/management is a broad topic. The required resource size depends on a lot of things, for example (in the context of Caliper and Fabric):
1) The complexity of the transactions (basically the complexity of the deployed chaincode). Even if you generate thousands of transactions per second with Caliper, the endorsing peers might not be able to keep up with that kind of load. 
2) The number of transactions you want to generate per second. If you want a constant 100 TPS load with 1 local Caliper client, then between sending two transaction proposals you can only "waste" 10 ms to run other code, or you won't be able to keep up the 100 TPS (someone correct me if I miscalculate), and that's not a lot of time. So you have to "smear"  that TPS across multiple local clients (lets say 5 clients with 20 TPS each, that's 50 ms to waste between transaction proposals). But you are still using the same host machine, and maybe your network connection is not fast enough to generate that kind of TPS. Then you use Caliper with Zookeeper, and face the same challenge on multiple host. :)
3) Same challenges for other Fabric components: orderer service, msp, channels, multiple chaincodes per channel, etc.

You could fill a PhD thesis by taking on these challenges :)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 13:13:32 GMT):<br/>
(but to get some ballpark number, take a look at the evaluation section of this awesome paper about Fabric: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10228)
</p>
<p><strong>SwatiRaj</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 13:33:30 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @klenik  :) got your point, Sorry for asking this broad question

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:27:12 GMT):<br/>
@wangdong the rate control is used to limit and/or specify the rate at which transactions are issued
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:28:59 GMT):<br/>
how I can get the real performance of one blockchain framework if the rate control is specified?

@nkl199 
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:38:36 GMT):<br/>
why should the rate control be specified? what if I just want the real TPS? BTW, from the test report, caliper offers performance metrics and resource consumption, I think these are the performance data. But the rate control is specified how can we get the real TPS?
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:39:21 GMT):<br/>
If any silly questions, please forgive me. I need to clarify this basics.
</p>

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:57:32 GMT):<br/>
@wangdong if you look at some standard benchmarks outside of the blockchain domain, they measure the performance under a specified load. If this load is the "send transactions as fast as you can", then you can implement a rate controller that doesn't wait between transactions. But since caliper is a general benchmark platform (and not an actual benchmark), it has to support the definition of custom transaction load profiles.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 12:53:36 GMT):<br/>
there is a PR in caliper at the moment for a 'pidRate' controller. This will limit all transactions to maintain a specified backlog. You could view that as a 'send as fast as you can' rate controller

there is a PR in caliper at the moment for a 'pidRate' controller. This will limit all transactions to maintain a specified backlog. You could view that as a 'send as fast as you can' rate controller. This is a 'safe' way to investigate maximum continuous throughput, since using a fixed rate at *very high* tps will lead to timeouts

this is the error log from peer
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 14:19:34 GMT):<br/>
How powerful is the host where the peer is deployed? In Fabric, building and starting a chaincode container, then running the Init method can take some time. If it's running on a week host, this time can be more than 2 minutes. 
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 14:21:52 GMT):<br/>
 I got the same error when in mac and ubuntu 16.04
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 14:35:05 GMT):<br/>
I'm not familiar with the inkchain-client, but try raising the timeout on both client-side and peer-side to some really high level. If the error is gone, then you have resource issues.
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 15:01:30 GMT):<br/>
never mind the name,  it is just like fabric
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 15:08:18 GMT):<br/>
For the timeout error, try a greater timeout on both side.
For the "file argument" error, check whether you caliper config.json has a `command.end` property defined. If you don't need it, then remove the `end` property completely, because based on the error you are probably leaving it empty
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 15:29:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes, you are right. I set it empty so that I can debug from the log

<p><strong>rkrish82</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 05:44:32 GMT):<br/>
Hi All, Caliper doesn't give right tps if I send the multiple transactions in a batch. In one of sawtooth benchmark use case I am trying send the batch with multiple transactions, say for example 10 transaction in a batch.. and in test configuration file I gave 1 tps. In caliper test report i still it as 1 tps, it should be 10 tps.
</p>

@rkrish82 , for batch, you should return an array containing all transactions' status.

<p><strong>rkrish82</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 09:13:19 GMT):<br/>
@Haojun sawtooth will return the array of committed transactions as response of batch_statuses

Hi folks, some interesting stuff still going on in the PSWG calls. in a little over 11 hours we hope to review some benchmark work from the royal Bank of Scotland and se how the metrics document holds up against it.  There is probably some good "competetive analysis" in there for Caliper as well.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:42:15 GMT):<br/>
Hey guys, this project just came to my attention. I'm doing a Master's Thesis onpPermissioned Blockchain performance. It seems that Calipher aims at the same that the tooling that I'm building is doing. However there seems to be one major difference, I'm creating Kubernetes clusters to perform my measurements on.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:43:08 GMT):<br/>
I was wondering if someone could enlighten me on how you gather statistics from multiple nodes? Lest I do a whole lot of work that's already been done.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:50:23 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels - do mean beyond 'using zookeeper clients' ?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:50:54 GMT):<br/>
tbh, the above question is probably best answered by @Haojun 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 15:03:25 GMT):<br/>
@nkl199 Basically anything you can tell me about gathering the data you need. I've yet to dive into Caliper's codebase and I'd like to be sure it would be useful to do so :P
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 15:10:21 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels - ok so the jist of it is that zookeeper is used to manage and collect data from multiple remote clients. If i'm honest I'm yet to really explore/exploit that aspect of the code base
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 15:33:33 GMT):<br/>
This seems very interesting.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 15:33:43 GMT):<br/>
I think it meshes well with my own project.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 15:34:05 GMT):<br/>
It would also take a huge load of my shoulders.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 15:34:29 GMT):<br/>
Did you consider making an adapter for Hyperledger Burrow as well?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 15:35:02 GMT):<br/>
I'd be interested in making a PR if I can get Caliper to work on a Kubernetes cluster as well.

I'd have to look into Zookeeper a bit more. Though I think I came across some samples for Kubernetes.

Has anyone tried caliper with fabric installed on multiple vm? Either natively, or using Swarm or using Ansible. Will be great to get hints / roadblocks. 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 23:29:08 GMT):<br/>
From the point of view of Caliper, the only difference is that the addresses of the network nodes are public IPs (and ports). Take a look at this network configuration file:
https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/benchmark/simple/fabric-remote.json
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 23:40:21 GMT):<br/>
@tallharish However, getting a Fabric network up and running on different hosts has its challenges. These are not strictly Caliper related, but could be useful "tips":
- make sure every necessary port is open on the VMs (you can find the default ports of the components in various docker-compose files of the samples)
- don't forget to use IP/DNS SANs in the generated certificates (assuming you generate the crypto material with `cryptogen`), so the nodes can recognize other nodes by IP (and not just hostname)
(- use the 1.1.0 version of the `cryptogen` tool, since previous versions incorrectly interpret the IP SANs as DNS SAN)
</p>
<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 02:03:41 GMT):<br/>
@klenik How does 1.1 version cryptogen support IP SANs? Is there any reference

Hey peeps. Does anyone see any major issues I could run into when creating a Docker container from Caliper source? Anything that you might think of would be helpful. Reason I'm asking is because I'm working on some tooling to create reproducible Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Burrow networks in Kubernetes. So far I've got everything running. Just need to get Caliper in the Kubernetes Cluster and write some code so Caliper knows how to bench Burrow.

Hello everyone. I would like to understand an issue that I'm having with caliper: I'm testing the `simple network` and the `balance transfer` netowork with the same setup (containers, genesis blocks, policies etc) and I obtain completely different results. For the simplenetwork: 
```
Name	Succ	Fail	Send Rate	Max Latency	Min Latency	Avg Latency	75%ile Latency	Throughput
query	5000	0	957 tps	        13.33 s	         0.17 s	        8.13 s	        9.54 s	                  367 tps
```
For the balance transfer: 
```
Name	Succ	Fail	Send Rate	Max Latency	Min Latency	Avg Latency	75%ile Latency	Throughput
query	5000	0	949 tps	        42.74 s	       4.16 s	        30.70 s	         37.40 s	                 117 tps
```
Does anyone of you know the reason>

Not sure , but I have some thoughts:
1. please check whether the configuration of peers and orderers in both networks are the same, such as loglevel, tls, etc.
2. Lower the sending rate. Now the sending rate is much higher than actual throughput, that may cause unsteady performance results.

If trigger the test without commands and starting docker containers it will work properly..

Hi does anyone know from where does caliper get the resource utilization measurements? , does it use dstat of just gets the usage for the containers that are running ..
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 06:33:45 GMT):<br/>
@adityachap Caliper uses dockerode library (which eventually use Docker Remote API ) to fetch remote container's status.  For local containers,  another library named systeminformation is used instead.

For my research work, I am trying to build some new features for Caliper (and hopefully contribute to the community). I am new to Node.JS as well. What development environment (IDE) do you use? I usually use Eclipse, but somehow it gives library errors when I import caliper.  Any guidance would be appreciated.

@Akash76 if you see me online, feel free to ping me and we can try to diagnose the config off the main channel?

+1 for Webstorm as well. Expect issues with refactoring though. It has a tendency to suggest refactoring variables with the same name even if they are in different files..

It's one of the reasons I use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

@tallharish no problem. You can also change your KeyMap to that of Eclipse if you want.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 08:21:01 GMT):<br/>
I used to program Java and used eclipse. Switched to IntelliJ and Webstorm and kept the KeyMap.

Hi!!!

<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 06:19:39 GMT):<br/>
I'm really interested to use this framework to test my Fabric installation. I'd like to test my chaincode too, is It possible with Caliper?
</p>
<p><strong>adityachap</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 06:48:03 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox As caliper is used for performance testing it can test the performance for your chaincode container but not the functionality

</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 06:58:33 GMT):<br/>
Can you explain me deeper?
</p>
<p><strong>adityachap</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 07:17:03 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox Caliper is a tool used for performance testing the fabric network it is not a functional testing tool you can get the resource utilization parameters throughput by using caliper so if you are plannig to use capliper to functional test your chaincode it will  not be possible is what i think

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 09:20:17 GMT):<br/>
Caliper functions as a client for the blockchain network (e.g., Fabric). True, it measures some performance metrics, but since it's a full fledged client, it can also be used for "testing" with the help of the user callback modules.
Note however, that you should still perform independent unit testing of your chaincode. Caliper provides a kind of "integration testing" possibility.

Hi guys, I did performance testing for fabric and sawtooth on an 8 core machine. I found some real unexpected results, fabric's maximum tps went around 340 where sawtooth was only able to reach 69-70, after which transactions stated failing real bad. Are these the results everyone are getting and if yes is something lacking from caliper tool or sawtooth has low performance right now?

do caliper support sending of variable size payload or is it fixed size payload
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 07:44:54 GMT):<br/>
PTE i.e https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/blob/master/tools/PTE , supports sending transaction with variable payload but it doesn't capture the os usage etc in it
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 09:02:30 GMT):<br/>
@kiranarshakota If by payload you mean the parameters of a transaction, then it depends entirely on your implementation of the client module, that calls the `invokeSmartContract` function of the platform. So yes, Caliper supports this, by letting you send whatever you want :)
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 09:18:30 GMT):<br/>
@sgaddam you will need to modify the config file `fabric.json` to account for the different crypto material structure that will have been created by cello when setting up fabric

@sgaddam I'd recommend looking into the logs of the remote network, you will likely have more detailed logging there that will help diagnose
</p>
<p><strong>sgaddam</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 09:59:51 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>sgaddam</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:02:40 GMT):<br/>
@nkl199 This is because of connectivity issue
</p>
<p><strong>sgaddam</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:03:02 GMT):<br/>
Machine X is having Caliper installed
</p>

Machine Y is with Hyperledger Fabric setup through Cello

both are ubuntu in aws with bridge network
</p>

when i try to ping the Machine Y orderer container from Machine X , the connection failed
</p>

coz, i am connecting to the docker internal ipaddress of the orderer 
</p>
<p><strong>sgaddam</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:05:53 GMT):<br/>
how do we solve this issue?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:16:43 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:20:39 GMT):<br/>
i've never gone through the remote caliper testing route so might not be the best person for this question.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:48:10 GMT):<br/>
@sgaddam Can't you define a port mapping from the AWS VM port to the docker container port? That way you should be able to ping the public IP:port.
Something like this: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/2ae2d5036457da7d4a2688a75938649e42f464d1/network/fabric-v11/2-org-2-peer/docker-compose.yaml#L27

Not sure if I understand your point. You can start multiple caliper clients (zookeeper clients) on different regions now to taking tasks.

I got this working recently. But I guess there's a bug on line 105 of monitor-docker.js. I changed it to `/all` instead of `all` and it works fine now

@RobertDiebels True, but why is it a problem during development time? (Unless you have some corporate infrastructure constraint) Plus you can whitelist the IP of the VM where Caliper is running to stay safe.

Using "Caliper " I have started the performance analysis for hyperledger fabric . As Caliper provided the sample of Fabric1.0 with the GO lang. Can anybody suggest is it working for fabric 1.1 node sdk?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 13:16:51 GMT):<br/>
@purandam Caliper also supports Fabric 1.1, just change the docker image versions in the docker compose files, and install the 1.1 client and CA SDKs with npm. As for nodejs chaincodes, see this issue:

@klenik Don't know if you're interested in this but I thought I'd mention it anyway. I run Fabric in Kubernetes and I wanted to avoid having to configure all my VM's docker daemons to expose a port. So I ended up using a NodePort Service + DaemonSet + socat Container that bound traffic from TCP:2375 to unix://var/run/docker.sock
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 10:39:28 GMT):<br/>
This way I don't have to configure anything on my VM's and I can still use the node IP-addresses.

@wangdong hi, I'm first try to caliper. I run the byfn network in the server. Then i run the command "node benchmark/simple/main.js -c config-fabric.notup.json -n ../../network/fabric-v11/2-org-2-peer/composer-tls.json" , and i get the error message as the picture. My question is , I don't grep any "/etc/" word in the caliper folder, why the command tell me not find the  "/etc/hyperledger/msp/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp folder"?
</p>
<p><strong>wangrangli</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 03:26:54 GMT):<br/>
@wangdong I mean I don't find any one "/etc" in the caliper folder, and the folder "/etc/hyperledger/...." that should in the fabric peer in the docker, not in the server I run command at the server.
</p>
<p><strong>wangrangli</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 04:12:05 GMT):<br/>
And in the peer, the folder is  /etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/msp, not the "/etc/hyperledger/msp/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp ", where could i change the "mspconfig" in the src/composer/composer_utils  line 90? Thank you!

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 07:40:21 GMT):<br/>
@kiranarshakota @Gvedam If the chaincodes are deployed on the same channel (called context in Caliper), then you can specify the target chaincode for the transaction when calling the `invokeSmartContract` function in your callback module. The function takes the chaincode name and version as parameters (plus other arguments of course) and these together form a unique ID within a channel. I haven't actually done similar tests, so I'm interested in your results :) 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 07:42:26 GMT):<br/>
@Nabilel 1 In your Caliper config file every round is associated with a user-defined callback module. For the `simple` benchmark, these modules are implemented in the `query.js` and `open.js` files. The report binds these names to the results of each round.

@harsha0826 Caliper is still in incubation, and I'm not aware of any _public_, thorough performance tests using Caliper, but this could change soon :) For the 2nd question: Caliper provides end-to-end measurement capabilities. For performance testing individual components, take a look at the `fabric-test` repository (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test), and let me know if you found anything interesting :)

Hi, everybody. I have some question.

I edited my config.json and fabric.json for running my chaincodes.

There are 2 organizations(org1, org6, each is a different machine).

and after I run the code, I can get html report.

but there is only I can see is org6 perfomance list.

If I want to check org1's performance, what should I do?

Is it related to Endorsement-Policy in Fabric.json?

Please  let me know if you guys know this.

Hi~ I wanna try to run caliper by using chaincodes for Node.js.
Do they not support node.js version? or Is there something I have to edit? because there is some path error in my pacakage.

Okay, At first, when caliper starts instantiate it, below errors comes out.

`error: [client-utils.js]: sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: 2 UNKNOWN: error starting container: Failed to generate platform-specific docker build: Error returned from build: 1 "can't load package: package contract/fabric/ccexcc: cannot find package "contract/fabric/ccexcc" in any of: /opt/go/src/contract/fabric/ccexcc (from $GOROOT) /chaincode/input/src/contract/fabric/ccexcc (from $GOPATH) /opt/gopath/src/contract/fabric/ccexcc`

So, I think that it might be path error , and so I changed chaincodes path in fabric.json like that

`"chaincodes": [{"id": "ccex0_6", "path": "contract/fabric/ccexcc/", "language":"node", "version": "v0.6", "channel": "org6channel"}],`

↓

`"chaincodes": [{"id": "ccex0_6", "path": "opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/caliper/src/contract/fabric/ccexcc", "language":"node", "version": "v0.6", "channel": "org6channel"}],`

however, there is another error comes out like below.

`info: [packager/Golang.js]: packaging GOLANG from /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/caliper/src/contract/fabric/ccexcc/events.js:183 throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event ^`

I think there might be some paths linked gopath or golang. because I didn't set "language": "golang" like that.

when to package the chain code, there is a adjust which language is used for the chain code. Then choose the proper lib to package the chain code.

And caliper now does not support node chain code. when you try to install node skd, it will complain the dir or file can not be found. 
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 06:56:54 GMT):<br/>
But This is not that hard to fix
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 06:57:10 GMT):<br/>
I will have an eye on this.

<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 07:13:52 GMT):<br/>
when to install node chain code, this should be the right log
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 07:14:08 GMT):<br/>
not [pacakger/Golang.js]
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 07:14:08 GMT):<br/>
not [packager/Golang.js]

<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 07:15:00 GMT):<br/>
I think caliper now does not support node js chain code.
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 07:15:10 GMT):<br/>
but we improve this.

it is not that difficult.

@harsha0826 I realize that your question is a bit old now. But I was working on getting caliper working in Kubernetes. I forked it here: https://github.com/robertdiebels/caliper the main difference is that paths must be absolute and not relative. I did this so that I could have more control over where I mount callbacks. Since I'm using Kubernetes to automatically deploy and test through a Caliper container/Job.

</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 08:13:42 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 09:06:00 GMT):<br/>
you can just use the absolute path for the chain code in the config file

Hi All, 
I have added some debug comments to Orderer and built it. 
But when i try to run the caliper with new images , i get the error saying it Failed to instantiate chaincodes, Error: Failed to send instantiate due to error: Failed to send instantiate transaction and get notifications within the timeout period. 
Can anyone guide me here? Thanks in advance. 
</p>
<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 13:31:25 GMT):<br/>
I have modified the docker-compose.yaml to include the new docker images for peers and orderer
</p>
<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 13:34:35 GMT):<br/>
Also , this is with the simple benchmark for Hyperledger Fabric 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 15:47:59 GMT):<br/>
@DivyaAgrawal chaincode instantiation takes some time, and if you run the entire network on a single machine, the resources might not be enough to instantiate the chaincode within the time limit (try increasing the timeout, or distribute the network on multiple machines, or on a stronger one)
</p>

<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 08:08:13 GMT):<br/>
@klenik The same works, when I try to run it with the default images(one without my changes). 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 08:17:56 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, try an example from the `hyperledger/fabric-samples` repository with your custom orderer image and see if it works without Caliper. If it works that way then DM me the name of your docker repo and image name and I'll try to reproduce the problem
</p>
<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 08:41:08 GMT):<br/>
Okay. will try it out and get back. Thanks 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 18:21:48 GMT):<br/>
To Whom It May Concern: there is a pending PR (#116) that adds proper node chaincode and metadata support to Caliper together with example chaincodes (`simple` and `marbles`). Until it's merged, please feel free to experiment with it: https://github.com/aklenik/caliper/tree/chaincode-deploy

I made number of transactions = 5000 and tps = 500 in the config file. Result produced was - about 90 transactions were successful out of 5000 and TPS was 2.
Please let me know how to get this working ?

Run `npm ls fabric-client` in your Caliper root dir. You should see an output like this:
```
caliper@0.1.0 /home/ubuntu/projects/caliper
└── fabric-client@1.1.0 
``` 
If you have the right (1.1.0) `fabric-client` version, and you set the `language` property to `"node"`, then you shouldn't see golang packaging errors

@DivyaAgrawal You modify the right file, but after that you need to regenerate the `mychannel.tx` and (I think) the `twoorgs.genesis.block` artifacts with the `configtxgen` Fabric tool

when caliper starts install chaincodes, There is an error comes out. 

```

I tried to find this error in google. 
https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/issues/102

Here is similar issues, but he said it just request port is wrong.

and I saw instantiate issues, but not install chaincode issues.

Do you know where the issues? fabric.json? or config.json? or there might be another version issues?

Thanks, I downgraded version from 1.2.0 to 1.1.0 and now I finally installed chaincode!!
however... when caliper starts to Instantiate chaincode, there are another permission issues like...

I tested already caliper to use golang chaincode, so I think that fabric_node.json doesn't hava some problem.

@lotty02cho Caliper is not yet verified to work flawlessly with Fabric (and SDK) v1.2.0, so first try to install the 1.1.0 SDK version: `npm install fabric-client@1.1.0 fabric-ca-client@1.1.0`
If you still have the same error, then copy the `chaincodes` section of your `fabric_node.json` here, maybe it's some configuration problem.

This looks like a channel configuration issue. Your network is almost identical to the `simplenetwork` example, except for the org2->org6 rename, the node CC, and the policy. Try to compare your config files with the following files: `benchmark/simple/fabric.json`, `network/fabric/simplenetwork/configtx.yaml` and `network/fabric/simplenetwork/crypto-config-yaml`.
Aside from the start of the relative paths, there shouldn't be any difference

could anyone post installation manual of Caliper?

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 17:43:55 GMT):<br/>
@sujitedu 
1. Clone the Caliper repo 
2. Install the pre-requisites, dependencies and the blockchain SDKs you need (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper#build)
3. Experiment with the sample benchmarks, or write your own :)

Hi, guys. I run caliper by using src/simple/simpletest.go, and I got this report. When you see the report, there is a table which has many columns like Max Latency, Min Latency, Avg Latency, and so on.

Could you explain meaning of these columns more detail? And if anyone who runs simpletest.go is here, Did you get almost same Throughput? If not, How can you decrease tps, throughput?

Thanks, in advance.

@lotty02cho I'm using simpletest.go I'm getting about the same throughput. Why would you want to decrease throughput though?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:19:44 GMT):<br/>
I wouldn't know how to decrease the throughput other than sending less transactions per second.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:20:06 GMT):<br/>
Or decrease your network speed.
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:41:06 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels  No, No.. I try to increase my network speed, and increase tps for performance.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 08:02:54 GMT):<br/>
Hmm.. the only thing I could think of to increase it would be to bulk up your nodes. So increase CPU-power and disk-speed. I don't know how much faster it will make the setup though. So it might not even be worth it.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 08:03:50 GMT):<br/>
I ran my setup in GCE with all peers on independent nodes with Intel Sandy bridge dual cores. Still only got about 74tps for the 'open' transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 08:06:06 GMT):<br/>
I read a paper on Fabric performance [ https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10228v2.pdf ] and it boasted about 1300tps. When I asked for a way to reproduce (via email) they answered that they had forked the original code and the fork is not available anywhere. So there is no way to reproduce those results.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 08:07:10 GMT):<br/>
So afaik fabric 1.0.x and 1.1.x range between 100tps and 74tps max.

@RobertDiebels @lotty02cho The Fabric paper:
- evaluated a different chaincode 
- used a custom system chaincode for some transaction validation (by-passing the grpc communication between peer and normal chaincodes)
- used quite powerful (multi-core) VM instances
- played around with the block size and block timeout settings

If you want to increase the throughput for the `simple` benchmark:
- vertical scaling (stronger machines), as @RobertDiebels suggested, but it has its limits
- horizontal scaling: increase the number of peers per organization (and probably use kafka ordering instead of solo)

Since the endorsement policy for the `simpletest` chaincode is 2-of-2 (or n-of-n generally), you need one endorsement from every organization, but it doesn't matter, which peer gives it from that org. So you could send the 1st Tx to org1-peer1, org2-peer1, the 2nd Tx to org1-peer2, org2-peer2, and so on, in a round-robin (basically load balancing) manner. Currently Caliper doesn't allow the callback modules to chose the target peers for a Tx invoke. This feature will probably be added when the Common Connection Profile for the Fabric SDK has been added.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=PYev5w2Q77x7C4d8j) I don't think it's a proper conclusion. The performance results will vary greatly depending on the test environment (the hardware performance, deployment method, network condition, block setting, etc). BTW, I got a tps about 150 even with a single HP laptop, and I also know some people got a result over 800 using caliper.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 09:40:28 GMT):<br/>
@Haojun As long as there is no way to properly reproduce results I'd say any statement about the performance of Fabric would be a wrong conclusion. That includes your 150 tps, the 800tps and my 74tps.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 09:41:24 GMT):<br/>
So far I've been getting the same results with only a slight variance.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 09:42:34 GMT):<br/>
I'll be posting my experiment with a month or so though.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 09:42:42 GMT):<br/>
Fully reproducible.
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 09:45:29 GMT):<br/>
@klenik  You are correct. Now callback modules are not allowed to choose the target peers. Each client will select one peer for each organization randomly as target peers, so in theory increasing the number of peers may improve the performance if you launch enough clients.

<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 12:13:10 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels can you check results for other chains as well?

<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 12:13:59 GMT):<br/>
and put some info about your environment
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 12:31:24 GMT):<br/>
@neewy I can't unfortunately. I'm running Caliper and Hyperledger Fabric in Kubernetes.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 12:34:03 GMT):<br/>
As for the environment. I'm running Fabric on defaults, no TLS, no Kafka. I've forked Caliper [ https://github.com/robertdiebels/caliper ] so that I could get things to work in Kubernetes.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 12:34:50 GMT):<br/>
Caliper is using the standard simpletest.go chaincode and the callbacks that go with it.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 12:35:15 GMT):<br/>
Aside from what's in that for I made no further code adjustments.

<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 12:48:11 GMT):<br/>
maybe you've got some info about hardware that runs Kubernetes?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 13:13:49 GMT):<br/>
@neewy I do. I'm running locally using Minikube. Remote I created a cluster with Kops (Kubernetes Operations).
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 13:14:53 GMT):<br/>
Using Kops I'm running on 3 test instances. Going to scale up to 64 nodes when I'm done.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 13:16:04 GMT):<br/>
The instances run in the Google Cloud. 2 core cpus, Intel Sandy Bridge. Don't know the Disk specs but they're not SSDs.

Hello, I’m genuinely confused at the performance test results. As most shared, I don’t think I got any throughput over 1000. I’ve read two papers on the performance testing one of the papers mentions that if you increase channels to 16, you can achieve relatively higher throughput.

@rkrish82 Have you enabled the TLS on the server side?

You can try to enable the TLS (ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ENABLED=true)

<p><strong>rkrish82</strong> (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 09:52:57 GMT):<br/>
yes I tried enabling TLS in multi node fabric network..
</p>
<p><strong>rkrish82</strong> (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 10:00:43 GMT):<br/>
@Haojun Now it seems to be working. But caliper is doing following things every time when i am running test. 1. creation of channel 2. joining channel 3. install chain code 4. instantiation chain code(smallbank), it is good for docker based. But if i want to run it on multi node fabric network then i have skip all those 4 steps , because i can do those things during network setup. How to do that?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 11:07:54 GMT):<br/>
@rkrish82 
- Channel and join can be skipped be setting its `deployed` attribute to `true`
- CC install and init can be skipped by omitting the `chaincodes` section in the Fabric config file (not a nice way, but someone confirmed that it works, so it's a good workaround for now)

I would like to test my program, but having some troubles.. May I ask here??

1) Is it possible to run a performance test with caliper in single computer??

2) I'm using composer, but no "fabric-ca-client": "1.1.0",
    "fabric-client": "1.1.0". Could this be problem later during test??

  "devDependencies": {
    "composer-admin": "^0.19.8",
    "composer-cli": "^0.19.8",
    "composer-client": "^0.19.8",
    "composer-common": "^0.19.8",
    "composer-connector-embedded": "^0.19.8",
    "composer-cucumber-steps": "^0.19.8",
    "chai": "latest",
    "chai-as-promised": "latest",
    "cucumber": "^2.2.0",
    "eslint": "latest",
    "nyc": "latest",
    "mkdirp": "latest",
    "mocha": "latest"
  }
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 13:31:55 GMT):<br/>
1) yes, 2) if you look at the readme of composer plugin, it will tell you the dependancies you need :thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 14:06:22 GMT):<br/>
```
"composer-admin": "0.19.0",
 "composer-client": "0.19.0",
 "composer-common": "0.19.0",
 "fabric-ca-client": "1.1.0",
 "fabric-client": "1.1.0",
```

is given as an example, but Composer is now at 0.19.12
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 14:07:04 GMT):<br/>
... and they need to go into the dependancies, not the devDeps

@smile4jc note this sentence on page 10 of the article you linked: "To achieve this, we created a configurable number  of  worker  threads  per  channel  on  peer  startup.  Each worker  thread  validates  one  transaction’s  endorsement  signa-ture set against its endorsement policy.". It's never mentioned "how" they do this. I've had contact with one of the authors of another paper on Fabric performance [  ] and he stated they forked the original code to accomplish their results. So the throughput boost doesn't have so much to do with the amount of channels, rather the fact that they do parallel validation of blocks instead of serial.

@lotty02cho See if you can get some logging from the Fabric Client. Set `process.env.HFC_LOGGING = '{"debug": "console", "info": "console"}'` before you launch caliper. Also, check the logs on your peers and Orderer. I've found that the client intentionally provides vague error messages so that an attacker can't figure out what's happening inside the network. Which is great for security, not so great for debugging.

I have setup deployed status to true and removed the chaincode attribute in fabric.json. But when i am running test i am getting following error

Hi, I start Caliper right now.
I have run simple benchmark file and got report files.

What is the role of benchmark files?
Is just make random variable generator to put our chaincode?
Is it any duplicate exception error checker in 'open.js' or 'query.js'?
l make log and check 

If not do I have to make that kind of exception checker?

I test 'simpletest' chaincode by using node.js.
However when I run `node benchmark/simple/main.js -c config.json -n fabric.json`, from time to time it throws error like this.
`error: [Peer.js]: sendProposal - timed out after:120000`.
I haven't changed chaincode or config files. Why this issues happens?

<p><strong>NidhiKumari</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 06:02:52 GMT):<br/>
@Racoon8704 You can try without "-n fabric.json" and check if its running.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 07:58:30 GMT):<br/>
I guess you get this error during chaincode instantiation, right? You should increase the timeout value. There is a recent issue about this on github that can help.

@klenik Thx, I saw your mention in recent issue(#137) and it works. I try to do next step(using my chaincode), but when I change 'request-timeout' (12000 -> 30000) instantiate chaincodes Error. Is it related to chaincode size?
</p>
<p><strong>Racoon8704</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 09:28:09 GMT):<br/>
because I have 20 functions in chaincodes(it is around 1000 lines.)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 10:00:12 GMT):<br/>
It depends: 
- On every peer node a docker image is created for the chaincode (maybe the base image is also downloaded, I don't know), the container is started, and the `Init` chaincode function is executed.
- If you instantiate a Node.js chaincode, then the `fabric-shim` package is also installed
- And if you execute everything on the same machine (4 peers + other nodes for example), you need a "strong" machine to finish everything before the timeout
- Count the zeros in the timeout value, 30 seconds is not the same as 5 minutes :)

@klenik okay, I just tested my chaincode based on config files in simple folders(like fabric.json, config.json). how can I resolve timeout-error? Do I have to reduce chaincode lines? or Do I have to go to config.json and reduce tps or txNumber?

Yes, you are right. I saw this about this issues[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45347439/mvcc-read-conflict-when-submitting-multiple-transactions-concurrently].

Actually, In my chaincode, I use random value like this.

```
module.exports.run = function() {
    console.info('===================registerFarm(run)====================');
    txIndex++;
    //txIndex: 2 / process.pid: 39310 / FARM_NO: FARM_NO_2_39310 / FARM_NM: FARM_NM__2_39310 / USER_ID: USER_ID__2_39310
    let farmNo = 'FARM_NO_' + txIndex.toString()+'_'+process.pid.toString();
    let farmNm = 'FARM_NM_'+ txIndex.toString()+'_'+process.pid.toString();
    let userId = 'USER_ID_'  + txIndex.toString()+'_'+process.pid.toString();
    farms.push(farmNo);
    console.info('FARM_NO: '+farmNo+'/FARM_NM: '+farmNm+'/USER_ID: '+userId +'/process.pid: '+process.pid.toString());

    return bc.invokeSmartContract(contx, 'traceability', 'v0', 
        {
            verb: 'registerFarm', 
            FARM_NO: farmNo,
            FARM_NM: farmNm,
            USER_ID: userId
        }, 100);
};
```

I think it doesn't matter what I start first. but, I added and tested chaincode using farmNo like this on and on.

```
module.exports.run = function() {
    txIndex++;
    console.info('===================reportTransferSnd(run)====================');
    //owner who send Cow Info Load ex. 'FARM_NO_3_39344'

what should i do ?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 11:45:58 GMT):<br/>
@sathishNS In the `package.json` file the dependency versions are given as version ranges. `npm install` tries to install the most recent version that is inside this range. However, if a `package-lock.json` file is present (containing fix versions), then those versions will be installed to ensure deterministic dependency versions (even if a dependency has a newer version). It is recommended to commit this lock, so everyone installs the same dependencies when the Caliper repo is cloned by different people. Currently this file is not committed, but since Caliper is still in incubation, this is not critical.
</p>
<p><strong>sathishNS</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 11:56:06 GMT):<br/>
@klenik Thanks for the info. So do i need to commit this file ? or i can proceed further

@klenik when i try to install the fabric from the repo, it is saying me package.json does not exist. Is it harmful or can i ignore those messages

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 12:30:18 GMT):<br/>
I don't get similar warnings. Do you have permission to read `package.json` with the `hyper` user?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 12:30:34 GMT):<br/>
And be careful to install the 1.1.0 SDK versions: `npm install grpc@1.10.1 fabric-ca-client@1.1.0 fabric-client@1.1.0`
</p>
<p><strong>sathishNS</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 12:31:44 GMT):<br/>
i dont see package.json /home/hyper/caliper

<p><strong>sathishNS</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 12:31:54 GMT):<br/>
i only see package-lock.json

<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 18:03:31 GMT):<br/>
My fabric blockchain is running over aws one multiple EC2 machines
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 18:30:33 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid Sure, it's possible. In your network config file you define the nodes, channels (with the `deployed` attribute set to `true`), and discard the chaincode section (which is kind of like `deployed=true` for channels). You also need the proper credentials to interact with the network. Caliper (through your callback) will send every Tx to the defined network (skipping the channel and chaincode init parts), it doesn't matter where it's running (as long as you can reach the endpoints of course).
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 18:46:36 GMT):<br/>
@klenik  Thanks for quick reply.. There are  many config files in `caliper/network/fabric/` directory . which one you are talking about ?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 21:01:25 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid The `config[-something].json` files contain the Caliper related round settings (callbacks, rates, tx number/duration), the `fabric[-something].json` files contain the network definitions. Each of these is a little different (demonstrating different features), but based on the docs (and the example configs), you can construct your own custom config files. If you need further help, PM me.

@shken what is the error message you are getting ? sometimes failed transactions can occur when block events are missed by the caliper tool. I had faced the same issue and the reason for this is local-client.js is a single threaded which performs both the tasks of sending/bombarding transactions as well listening for block events for confirmations and the CPU is heavily utilized when the send rate is high and beyond the hardware capacity.

<p><strong>niteshsolanki</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 06:46:04 GMT):<br/>
@shken this is a MVCC conflict error which occurs at the committing phase of the transactions. 
</p>
<p><strong>shken</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 06:59:57 GMT):<br/>
@niteshsolanki If so, Is there any idea I can handle to decrease 'fail' rate? like making benchmark files without duplicate things, whatever. I saw `Readme.md` below, and it said it is not supported re-submitting.

```
The transaction generating process may generate conflicting transactions, for example, updating same account's deposite at the same time or nearly at the same time. Some blockchain systems provides some kind of orchestration to decide execution order of conficting transactions, but some blockchain systems may just return errors for later updates if the ahead update has not been completed and let the application decide what to do (e.g re-submitting rejected transactions). Until now Caliper has not provided any application level optimization such as re-submitting for failed transactions for any blockchain system. So please note in this case, conflicting transactions may cause failures for some blockchain systems.
```

<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 02:14:09 GMT):<br/>
@shken You may increase the number of 'accounts' in the config.json (in the arguments line of smallOperations round, and the number should not exceed the txNumber) which could reduce the probability of 'conflicting txns'. But please not it would reduce the count of other kinds of operations such as send_payment. Or you can add a new test round at the beginning to create enough accounts and use other test round to test other operations.

Can anyone please clarify which configtx.yaml file is linked to simple benchmark, I am trying to change the BatchTimeout and MaxMessageCount, Changing it in simplenetwork/configtx.yaml makes no difference.


klenik 10:31 PM
@DivyaAgrawal You modify the right file, but after that you need to regenerate the `mychannel.tx` and (I think) the `twoorgs.genesis.block` artifacts with the `configtxgen` Fabric tool
```

For making new mychannel.tx , I used `network/simplenetwork/fabric-samples/bin/cryptogen` and `network/simplenetwork/fabric-samples/bin/configtxgen`.

Hi All, 
As per the caliper docs 'Currently, only one policy can be defined and the policy is applied to all chaincodes.'
Can anyone point me to the valid policies and some definition for each. Like what does default policy mean. I can guess, but want to be sure my understanding of it is correct. 
Thanks in advance !

Hi All, 
I wanted to understand how do we specify which peers act as endorsing peers . I am running an 2 orgs 2 peers network and simple benchmark . The endorsing peers are always the same i.e. one from org 1 and another from org2. Why do only 2 peers take part in endorsement and not the other two. 
</p>
<p><strong>JaccobSmith</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 05:10:21 GMT):<br/>
@DivyaAgrawal You really could add the other two as endorsing peers for HA
</p>
<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 05:20:42 GMT):<br/>
@JaccobSmith can you explain a bit more. or point me to the correct documentation. Thanks in advance 
</p>
<p><strong>JaccobSmith</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 05:23:13 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>JaccobSmith</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 05:34:54 GMT):<br/>
Maybe it's the internal mechanism of FABRIC,we only can acquire it by reading the source code:rofl:
</p>
<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 06:21:54 GMT):<br/>
Ya, not sure. If anyone has any info regarding this. Please share with us. Thanks 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 08:52:01 GMT):<br/>
@DivyaAgrawal the configuration you shared is used to determine what type of signature is required for a transaction to be endorsed see: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/endorsement-policies.html?highlight=endorsement%20policy
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 08:53:29 GMT):<br/>
In the above case it is required that each transaction be signed by 2 of the identities in your policy. IN this case identity 0 and 1, respectively a member from Org1 and a member from Org2.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 08:53:45 GMT):<br/>
This means that any peer that fulfills those requirements can act as an endorser.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 08:55:07 GMT):<br/>
See: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/Fabric-FAQ.html?highlight=endorse#endorsement
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 08:55:32 GMT):<br/>
About your question. I don't know of any setting you can use for a peer to "always" act as an endorser.
</p>
<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 08:58:31 GMT):<br/>
OK.. Thanks, In running the caliper tests multiple times, I always see only 2 peers(always same) participating in endorsement. And as this is utilizing system's half the capacity, thought I am missing something. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 08:58:36 GMT):<br/>
This should clarify the endorsement process https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/peers/peers.html#phase-3-validation

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 09:28:29 GMT):<br/>
@DivyaAgrawal you might also want to try nesting your endorsment policy. Because I feel it should be possible to require 2 peers of each org for endorsement.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 09:29:55 GMT):<br/>
See: https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/global.html#Policy__anchor
</p>
<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 09:42:48 GMT):<br/>
Okay, Although my main objective is to still require 1 from each org, but to make both the peers in each org to participate. I got the code in caliper, where they are randomly selecting one peer of each organization to be part of the context for the chaincode. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 10:02:48 GMT):<br/>
@DivyaAgrawal don't they use the channel to send TransactionProposals?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 10:03:58 GMT):<br/>
Afaik they use all the peers as targets when invoking chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 10:04:45 GMT):<br/>
If you can send me the link to the code in github I'd like to take a look at it.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 10:13:43 GMT):<br/>
I checked `e2eutils.js` quickly. And afaics installchaincode, instantiatechaincode and invokebycontext use all peers defined for an organization.

<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 11:04:02 GMT):<br/>
ya just was curious and thought this might improve the throughput, if the endorsement load is more evenly balanced 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 13:02:35 GMT):<br/>
@DivyaAgrawal @RobertDiebels Regarding endorsing peers: a peer is an possible endorsing peer for a chaincode (on a channel), if the chaincode is installed on that peer (so there are no flags to set on the Fabric side). About the Caliper side: currently, at the *beginning* of each round, a random peer is selected from each organization, and Caliper will send every transaction to those peers (and listen for events from those same peers), as seen here: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/src/fabric/e2eUtils.js#L473
So currently you can't take advantage of load balancing inside an org, which (probably) really hurts the throughput of your test.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=jRiaDfPZ5R3XcxrYq) @klenik Just to be sure, if we change this code to add all the peers to the channel, will we be able to select any peer in random ? Or there are some other constraints too ? 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 13:41:46 GMT):<br/>
@DivyaAgrawal The NodeJS SDK sends Proposals to all peers defined in the Channel if the proposals contains no targets. So I think you'd have to remove the peers on the channel and add the ones you'd like to send transactions to.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 13:42:01 GMT):<br/>
Atleast that's what I'm in the progress of writing right now.

A function that takes the current context, removes all the peers from the channel, retreives the index of the removed peer from the organizations peer list, adds a new peer to the channel, then adjusts the context and returns it.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 13:45:23 GMT):<br/>
Though that only works for a setup with 1 organization. Which is good for my purposes.

@DivyaAgrawal I don't think you can choose to which peers the proposal is send unless you set the targets yourself. See: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.0/fabric-client/lib/Channel.js#L1287
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 07:31:51 GMT):<br/>
If you want to load-balance you'd have to change targets with every invoke.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 07:32:20 GMT):<br/>
If you want to send them to both. Then there is no problem.
</p>
<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 07:32:22 GMT):<br/>
yes , I dint mean to choose it myself. What i meant is if i have all the 4 peers(2 org 2 peers network) in added to the channel. I assume it will randomly select out of those 
</p>
<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 07:33:05 GMT):<br/>
ok. got your point. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 07:33:30 GMT):<br/>
Afaik the code sends the transaction proposal to all the peers you add as a target: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.0/fabric-client/lib/Channel.js#L1369

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 07:34:41 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 13:16:14 GMT):<br/>
@klenik Is there an implementation you can think of from the top of your mind that could fix the random selection? I'd like to change the peer on every invocation instead of at the beginning of each round. However I've not been able to do so quite yet. My implementations keep failing on an undefined error. I've tried adjusting the channel by removing and adding new peers. I've tried just generating a new context and passing it to bc.invokeSmartContract() in a round callback's run() function. None seem to work. My guess is that the underlying code is throwing an error the moment I change the context or replace it I just can't seem to isolate where this is happening nor why.

The other question I had was, if the publish block event fails, does the transaction still get committed to the ledger? The client gets an error when publish event fails. However, the implementation doesn't have a roll back mechanism and the block is committed. So there must be a separate mechanism to invalidate the transaction. Any pointers?

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 17:28:48 GMT):<br/>
Tx committing and event notifications are two separate things. I think you can "requery" past events (in case your client is restarted for example), or you can query the state of a specific Tx. Once a tx is committed on a peer, it's possibly committed on other peers as well (or they will sync sooner or later). Rollback goes against the principle of blockchain solutions. 
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=iX2zHKTcMxDXnZmSq) @klenik Thanks for the reply. I have posted the question in fabric channel but didnt get any response. Yes, you are right that there is no rollback (and I verified this in the implementation). Even though the block gets committed to the peer, I am unable to requery past events. I tested this out with a single peer (where there is no syncing required). Although there isnt a rollback, I thought somehow the specific transaction in the block gets invalidated (since the client doesn't know it is successful due to event hub error).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=xgdBYfM8Dm9EbndjA) @rkrish82 Not an expert in this. But looking at the code base, it looks like it is unable to monitor the processes. 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 20:45:01 GMT):<br/>
But from a business point of view, the transaction was successful, and if you read the chain, it's effects are there. It's the client's responsibility to cache the current/needed state of the server side, same as traditional client-server architectures. Take a look at the eventhub methods in the sdk to see the eventing options. As for the sawtooth case, I'm not competent in that area (or the monitoring part of caliper), maybe @Haojun can help with that 
</p>
<p><strong>raspydev</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 20:51:57 GMT):<br/>
@klenik Thanks. I am currently building my own docker container to understand why it isn't able to send the block events. My guess is the buffer size may be too small and there is an event timeout. Yeah, there is nothing to do with Caliper. Btw, is there a plan to update the codebase to use  ChannelEventHub instead of EventHub?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 20:59:41 GMT):<br/>
It's not a high priority task right now I think, but it shouldn't be hard to fix. Although backward compatibility should be considered for v1.0 (plus the behavior is the same for 1-channel setups, and currently you can't use multiple channels in the same round in Caliper)

Hello,
</p>
<p><strong>LewisHenderson</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 16:19:41 GMT):<br/>
I've using Hyperledger Composer which is running on Fabric. I am wanting to install Caliper in order to measure the performance of my transactions. I find the Github instructions very unclear. Is there a better tutorial/instructions anywhere?
</p>
<p><strong>LewisHenderson</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 19:56:16 GMT):<br/>
Does anyone know where I can find example test files from Caliper? For example, someone runs a test on one of the sample networks and the test output file shows tps, latency, ect?
</p>
<p><strong>NidhiKumari</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 06:16:49 GMT):<br/>
@LewisHenderson You can run Simple and Smallbank  benchmark tests. You can refer to this link https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper

<p><strong>LewisHenderson</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 15:39:08 GMT):<br/>
it starts the business network basic-sample-network

@Haojun @klenik @panyu 2 In caliper do we have Ratecountrol class which will increase/decrease the rate control based on success/failures count?

<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 05:54:35 GMT):<br/>
@LewisHenderson you can run the default test to get this.

@LewisHenderson you can try node main.js -c  config-smallbank-sawtooth.json -n sawtooth.json for smallbank or node main.js -c config-sawtooth.json -n sawtooth.json for simple

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 07:55:07 GMT):<br/>
Can you check the orderer logs? Plus start the network manually (and remove the start command from the config), and wait until the orderer logs indicate that it's ready to receive request

@raspydev 140tps is on a per channel basis. The paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11390.pdf states: "By combining all three optimizations 1, we improved the overall throughput by16 × (i.e., from 140 tps to 2250 tps)" and "Further, these three optimizations have
been successfully adopted in Fabric v1.1". I'm running 1.0.6.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:16:35 GMT):<br/>
I need to check whether or not I can update to 1.1
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:18:05 GMT):<br/>
Also their machines are huge. 32vCPUs per VM.
</p>
<p><strong>raspydev</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:36:15 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels Fabric 1.2 is now available, so you should run with the latest version. I have been ran tests on 1.2 but I see throughput that is close to 800tps (if it is write heavy). Reads are usually fast. (3k+).

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:50:23 GMT):<br/>
Well I would love to. Unfortunately I've created a setup that automatically generates a functional Kubernetes setup for Fabric. I am really not looking forward to the issues I will run into when upgrading.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:51:42 GMT):<br/>
Obviously I can try. But if it doesn't work out of the box I don't think I will do it.
</p>
<p><strong>raspydev</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:53:48 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels Ok :) All the best! 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:54:33 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. It's not so much about Fabric's performance as it is about comparing it to a rooted-tree version of Fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:55:21 GMT):<br/>
Essentially I've created a setup with a rooted tree where leaf-clusters (Fabric networks) generate transactions and they flow up the tree into a root-cluster (Fabric-network).
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:56:41 GMT):<br/>
So a leaf-cluster could for instance be a province and all transactions from that area go to a fabric-network for a province. Then a root-cluster would represent a country where an overview of all transactions is stored.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:56:41 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:57:34 GMT):<br/>
This allows parallel processing of transactions based on geo-spatial location or some other attribute.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:58:09 GMT):<br/>
So you'd go from 800tps per chain to 800tps per area.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:59:50 GMT):<br/>
There's a paper on the idea, can't remember the name.. Something about proof of location I believe.
</p>
<p><strong>raspydev</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 17:29:23 GMT):<br/>
Interesting concept. Sure, let me know when you publish the paper. Thanks.

Any idea how to  ?

Hi experts, if my Fabric has been up, could we use Caliper to run the cases by specifying the Fabric info instead of running up the Fabric network?

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 22 Aug 2018 12:07:41 GMT):<br/>
you could 'tweak' the underlying code flow to skip the 'init' sections, but *as yet* there is no flag to do this, but it would make a useful addition. The only caveat being that the specified perf test would need to be capable of dealing resetting the test data in the init(), or be tollerant to the data 'state' in the main perf test run

Hi all, im trying to test a fabric network with caliper and with a send rate ranging from 100 tps to 2000 tps, but in the test im only able to achieve a send rate of 700tps. I have also tried the same using a couple of Zookeeper clients but the send rate has not increased. Is it because of limitations in the machine in which i was using Caliper? can someone help me with this?

@lotty02cho There is something wrong with the certificate. That's why the endorsement policy is failing.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 10:01:07 GMT):<br/>
Try to recreate the certificates you're using to sign.

Hi experts,  I was using fabric in the net mode and dev mode. Then realised that it would be great to have the net mode sort of configuration (2 org, 2 peer, 1 orderer and 2 ca) with ONE chaincode and 2 CLI? I am assuming it is only one chaincode since i have only one chaincode and i would like to use the CLI instead of using a node js app to run my chaincode everytime.  How do I modify my docker-compose to have 2-org, 2-peer to have chaincode container and 2 CLI containers? Is it possible? Is there an example that i can refer to?

@GowriR based on the following sample docker compose file, I think you can assemble a network with two CLI containers:

- I added a secondary boot-script named `server.js` this starts an ExpressJS server.
- The server has several entrypoints among which: `start`, `stop`, `reports/<report-name>`, `data/download`
- These correspond to: `starting tests`, `stopping tests`, `serving the reports on a server`, `downloading a data-dump with all relevant data`
- I needed these features because I had to run caliper in Kubernetes and I needed more control and information out of Caliper.

Hi guys, are there anyone ever benchmark Sawtooth? What is the highest number of throughput measured for Sawtooth? I'm curious because I benchmarked in single node with PoET consensus, the highest number received is 80 tps with 100 tx/batches and 200 tps of sending rate. I'm very appreciative of any number shared :)

ie the process that runs the load

</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 10:15:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm using this block in the composer test config

```
  "rounds": [{
                "label" : "basic-sample-network",

                "rateControl" : [{"type": "fixed-rate", "opts": {"tps" : 100}}],
                "arguments": {"testAssets": 25},

                "callback" : "benchmark/composer/composer-samples/basic-sample-network.js"
            }]

This will execute 10000 transactions at a fixed rate of 100 tps, but of the total, only 50 transactions are successful
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 10:23:40 GMT):<br/>
The 50 success tps is related to the `testAssets` param? 
</p>
<p><strong>labcoinpoc</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 01:15:39 GMT):<br/>
@Javi update one asset twice in a block will cause the read conflict error, maybe the assets in your network is not enough for the test. I tested this network with txNumber 1000 adn testAssets 1000, but seems like it takes too long to create all the assets, I am trying to modify the test script

It hasn't been tested officially, but it should be easy to test by installing the 1.2.0 sdk and using 1.2 images in the Docker compose files. The new features will be missing of course, like private collections

hello. pls advise where is in the repo (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper) exact use case tested by Caliper against sawtooth blockchain? thanks in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>AlexanderZhovnuvaty</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:34:13 GMT):<br/>
also, do you have plans about development of python binding in Caliper or it is JS only?

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 28 Sep 2018 08:14:38 GMT):<br/>
Currently it is JS only, i don't foresee an immediate python binding coming along soon, but wouldn't see it ruled out completely. For sawtooth benchmarks, look at those under the `/benchmark` folder that include a `sawtooth.json` file

@PiyushChittara You can detailed information about the rate controllers here: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/docs/RateControllers.md
Regarding the generated report, there isn't much documentation about it, but I can try and answer your questions if something is not clear

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 12:01:17 GMT):<br/>
@shashank-poojary this means, that one of your transaction tried to modify a value, that was already modified by an other transaction since. Check out the Fabric docs about the exact state versioning semantics 
</p>
<p><strong>shashank-poojary</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 12:21:33 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=SfzSfhthsxB8qnH74) @klenik Thank you for the information. Is there any way to avoid the read/write conflict while doing loadtest.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 12:39:39 GMT):<br/>
Well, the behavior (reads/writes) of the clients is usually given (specification, business requirement, etc). So: 
* you can play around with the data model on the chaincode side to minimize the conflict on a theoretical level (see [this example](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.2/high-throughput), which almost completely eliminates conflicts)
* the source of the conflict is that transaction `A` modifies state `Key1(v1)` to `Key1(v2)` and this change isn't committed soon enough, so transaction `B` modifies the "stale" value `Key1(v1)` to `Key1(v3)`. When the latter transaction is committed, the `Key1(v1)` value is already modified, so the conflict invalidates the latter transaction. So the idea is to commit the first change "soon enough", and this **might** be achieved by lowering the block timeout setting of the orderer. Note, that there **might** be performance implications, which should be evaluated, but this is a deep domain :)

As the architecture document said, a process monitor is used to monitor specified local process. For example, users can use this monitor to watch the resource consumption of simulated blockchain clients.

2. Manually start the docker container
   docker-compose -f network/sawtooth/smallbank/sawtooth-smallbank-go.yaml up
3. Start the smallbank test
   node main.js -c config-smallbank-sawtooth.json -n sawtooth.json

Well then that's your bottleneck :) 6 peer containers, 6 couchdb containers, 3 ca containers, plus caliper load generation. A production network would look something like 6 machines for the peer+couchdb pairs, 3 machines for the 3 CAs of the orgs (usually these already exist, just need to integrate them). Take a look at the evaluation part of the THE Fabric paper: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3190538

@BarkhaJasani max i got from fabric is around 100 tps ... one million is quite a big ask

I am writing my Master Thesis on partitioning permissioned blockchains right now and so far I've reached about 330 Tx/s using a single ledger with Hyperledger Fabric. I doubt that I'll get close to 1 Million though haha xD.

Hey guis. I just started using caliper. After installing caliper, I tried to run example using "node main.js -c config-composer.json" command. But I got this error, "composer.installSmartContract() failed,  Error: Error trying to start business network. Error: No valid responses from any peers.". I have added compose and fabric package in package.jon. Could you help me out for this?
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 06:46:30 GMT):<br/>
@harryc  do you see the documentation [https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/docs/Composer.md]?
</p>
<p><strong>harryc</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 07:59:17 GMT):<br/>
@houqinghui Thanks I am following it and the document indicates business file should be located at /caliper/contract/composer, so I located the bna file at both of /caliper/contract/composer and /caliper/src/contract/composer because the it is a bit ambiguous for me.
</p>
<p><strong>harryc</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 08:02:27 GMT):<br/>
@houqinghui I am trying to run an example of config-composer.json. It is using basic-sample-network and 2-org-1-peer fabric model.
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 11:45:24 GMT):<br/>
@harryc   do you install docker and docker-compose ?  if installed ,  please check the version  that is very import.
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 11:46:24 GMT):<br/>
@harryc  the  right version  is very important !

Hello everyone, I am very new to caliper and I am trying to run my first test against fabcar. I would like to measure the throughput of the transactions. Can you please how to write test cases to do that?
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 13:30:31 GMT):<br/>
@Nabilel 1   you can use the default use case to test the fabric , follow the readme file . 
</p>
<p><strong>Nabilel 1</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 16:46:41 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks

@houqinghui I am using docker version 18.06.1-ce, docker-compose version 1.22.0. I tried to use both combination of composer 0.19.5/fabric 1.1.0 and composer 0.20.2/fabric1.2.1 through package.json of caliper project.
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:34:46 GMT):<br/>
@harryc  please make sure composer version 0.19.0 and fabric version 1.1.0,  npm install composer-admin@0.19.0 composer-client@0.19.0 composer-common@0.19.0   fabric-ca-client@1.1.0  fabric-client@1.1.0  
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:36:05 GMT):<br/>
@harryc   when you install them rightly , please chect ther version of gRPC.

@harryc  you can modify CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE = 2-org-1-peer_default in the docker-composer.yaml at /network/fabric/2-org-1-peer.

How can I query hyperldeger fabric using caliper?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 13:25:22 GMT):<br/>
your 'query' is a function within the deployed chaincode, which needs to be called in a specfic way. Check out the marbles demo (benchmark example) for more details on that one 
</p>
<p><strong>harryc</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 17:24:19 GMT):<br/>
@panyu2 thank you! grpc vesion is 1.10.1 for fab-cli 1.2.1 and 1.14.2 for fab-cli 1.3.0

It might be that it's taking a bit longer to initialize the chaincode and that's what causing it to fail.

Hi everyone. I'm confused with the term "commit" of transaction when using Caliper to measure Sawtooth performance. All the result report of simple test is showed while sawtooth validator is still validating block to push on chain, not when the validators end (I have removed end command entry from benchmark/simple/config-sawtooth.json so that I can watch the validator container validate with Kitematic). Could you please explain to me how monitor of caliper watch transaction from creating time to submitting validator time or to push on chain time?

@toddinpal @RobertDiebels Timeout during a chaincode instantiation is a tricky thing. You would expect that it is an actual timeout, but in my experience it is an error during executing (or trying to execute) the chaincode `Init` function. 

The confusing part is, that this error appears/logged in the `dev***` chaincode container that is created by the peer (and not the peer container itself). But since the peer doesn't receive an OK from the CC init in time (because of the error), it will report a timeout, and delete the container, and yessss, the error message with it :) 

So to observe the actual error, you have to follow the logs of the `dev***` container once it is created (`docker logs --follow dev***`), but before the peer deletes it. For this, you should increase the timeout on the client/Caliper side AND on the peer side with the `CORE_CHAINCODE_STARTUPTIMEOUT=300s` env setting for example.

Hello Guys, What is the command used to run the test on the HL composer mode, I followed the documentation and placed everything in its place but I could not find the command to run the test
?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 09:30:53 GMT):<br/>
it is started via the same method as other tests - a `main.js` file that points to the required config file
</p>
<p><strong>MaherBouidani</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 09:32:22 GMT):<br/>
node benchmark/composer/main.js ?
</p>

@klenik Looks amazing well done :D !
</p>
<p><strong>MaherBouidani</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 09:38:52 GMT):<br/>
Do I have to delete the fabric images in docker (for my composer) before proceeding into testing the caliper?
</p>
<p><strong>MaherBouidani</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 09:38:56 GMT):<br/>
It gives me this error

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 09:46:04 GMT):<br/>
@MaherBouidani You either delete the containers to start a fresh benchmark, or you remove the network start-up script from the config, and it should connect to an already existing network. I'd recommend the first

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=R86RSM7pE7L667gsW) @HaiTranThanh To measure transaction through put time with time taken to commit the transaction to block chain. commit time to block chain - time at which transaction submitted.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 10:39:54 GMT):<br/>
@MaherBouidani Based on the read set mismatch, my guess is that `mychannel` already exists and you try to create it again. Did you reset (remove) the network before starting the test?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 16:59:55 GMT):<br/>
@MaherBouidani -there's been an update in the way networks are named in Docker: the network name specified in the docker compose files needs to match the parent directory within which it resides. If you look at the `network/fabric/<option>` and change all instances of `CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE` to match the name of the folder it is in (such as 2-org-1-peer or 2-org-2-peer), you should be good to go (remember to clean all dev- images in existence first)

Hi everyone, I'm a newbie in Fabric. I have deployed successful with single node. Now I want to deploy fabric on network with mutilnode (physical machine) by using Docker Swarm and Caliper (for benchmark performance), could anyone help me?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 15:12:16 GMT):<br/>
@HaiTranThanh you should ask the deployment question in the #fabric channel. If you deployed the network successfully, then you need to specify the remote endpoints of the nodes to Caliper. Take a look at the remote sample config in the `benchmark/simple` directory

there was a breaking change that went into Fabric 1.3, which makes the client and ca-client incompatible with that which Caliper is uses - there is a change ready to be merged that will make Caliper compatible, but for now it is only possible to use Fabric client(s) at the 1.2 level

<p><strong>SiamakKarimi</strong> (Sat, 17 Nov 2018 19:24:57 GMT):<br/>
How can I simulate the performance of my following IoT-based Application with Caliper?
In my senario, there are N number Nodes(permissioned network without need to proof of work) that store sensor data in Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) while the pointer to the DHT storage address is stored in the blockchain. How I can simulate and show the performance of system and other parameters such as required time to add new block, proccessing time, update time of peer's nodes with received transaction?

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sat, 17 Nov 2018 19:58:40 GMT):<br/>
@SiamakKarimi Caliper currently supports only Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth and Iroha. The gathered metrics follow the ones defined by the Performance and Scalability Working Group. Additional information collection has to be implemented by you 
</p>
<p><strong>SiamakKarimi</strong> (Sat, 17 Nov 2018 22:17:25 GMT):<br/>
I appreciate your response, I would like to store my transaction in hyperledger as a permissioned blockchian and I don't need to use smart contract as all nodes knows each other and there is no need to consensus. however, How can I get performance parameter from Caliper to evaluate my scenario. 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sun, 18 Nov 2018 08:32:47 GMT):<br/>
@SiamakKarimi 
1) You can't interact with the ledger without a smart contract. The smart contract will process your transactions, and the performance of your solution is also related to transaction processing.
2) If you don't need consensus, then you don't need blockchain. Just because your nodes know each other, it doesn't mean that they trust each other. 
3) How many parties are in your scenario? If every sensor belongs to a single organization, then again, you don't need blockchain. DLTs supposed to facilitate the collaboration between multiple organizations with semi-trust between them.

Your scenario is still not clear to me, but see the Caliper docs about how to connect to a network and write your own performance tests: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/

Hey guys, I've reported an issue + root-cause trace + possible solution for the `getUpdates()` error a lot of people are seeing. Unfortunately I don't have the time to create a PR but hopefully the trace should be sufficient for a proper solution. See this issue https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/issues/219

Hi, I am testing a fabric network with caliper. And the nework contains 1 orderer 2 orgs (org1 has 2peers and org2 has 1 peer) with kafka ordering mode.  I have successly create a channel on the three peers. But when I start the caliper it report the err msg:  error: [client-utils.js]: sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: 2 UNKNOWN: access denied: channel [] creator org [Org1MSP]. Then I check the  peer log, it says that:  2018-11-21 17:00:52.775 CST [protoutils] ValidateProposalMessage -> WARN 04d channel []: MSP error: the supplied identity is not valid: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority .  So  I  think the client access peer node with wrong msp. But I don't where to configurate this item.  Who can help me with this problem. Very Thanks.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sat, 24 Nov 2018 10:08:41 GMT):<br/>
@anant706 
Q1-2) In the summary you see the client side observations. Your 5 clients (I think that's the number for the config you're using) submitted 1000 transactions in total. They sent these transaction at a rate of 49 transactions per second (TPS). The DLT platform (here Fabric) processed (endorsed, ordered and committed) these transactions at a rate of 47 TPS. So you could say that Fabric handled your transaction load (the 2 TPS difference aside). Peers don't contribute to the send rate, that's a client side load generated by the processes Caliper spawns. The throughput is affected by the peers (numbers, resources) since they commit the transactions, and the throughput is the number of transactions committed per second.

Q3) First, the difference between the `peer...` and `dev-peer...` containers. When you instantiate a chaincode, every peer that instantiated the chaincode (thus becoming endorsing peer for that chaincode) creates and start a separate Docker container for the running chaincode (separation is good most of the time: robustness, security, etc.). So your `peer...` containers are the Fabric binaries, and they manage multiple channels, chaincodes, etc., so they consume some memory. Your chaincode container/binary on the other hand is (hopefully) not that complicated so it consumes less. 

Q4) I assume that you're also interested the resource utilization differences between two `peer...` containers. For every round (and for the entire round), Caliper selects a random peer from each organization to send the endorsements to. So it's possible that a peer is not (or just a few times) selected for the entire test. That's why you see this difference between peer containers. This limitation will be lifted soon.

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sun, 25 Nov 2018 10:05:23 GMT):<br/>
@anant706 It is the average rate of all 5 clients. The sending rate is set in the rate controller section of the configuration and it's automatically distributed among the clients. For example, if you set a fix rate of 100 TPS, and you have 10 clients configured (in the clients section of the config), then every client will send transactions at 10 TPS. So just decreasing the number of clients won't decrease the sending rate.

For the second question. It depends. The throughput can't be higher than the sending rate, since the best case is that Fabric can process transactions as fast as you (your clients) send them (in this case sending TPS = throughput). But if you send at a really high TPS then it might overload the system, which may decrease the throughput if the system is not prepared for this (this phenomenon is called thrashing). But it's not a fact, just a possibility.

I just benchmarked the impact of the number of required endorsers on the performance. There is no difference, how can that be? I tested policies with 1-4 endorsements
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sun, 25 Nov 2018 14:26:55 GMT):<br/>
The transaction proposals are simulated independently on the target organizations' peers. If they "process in sync" then it's possible that you (as a client) don't see the difference. Although I'm sure you could come up with scenarios where the extra load of an extra endorsement (for every transaction) has an effect on the system.

<p><strong>MaherBouidani</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 11:29:42 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>MaherBouidani</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 11:30:34 GMT):<br/>
Org as fabric documentation is to include set of members(through MSP) and nodes (peer, orderer) 
</p>
<p><strong>MaherBouidani</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 11:30:50 GMT):<br/>
so when I test my own bna with 2org and 1 peer each 
</p>
<p><strong>MaherBouidani</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 11:31:05 GMT):<br/>
does it mean that my bna was replicated in both org? 
</p>
<p><strong>MaherBouidani</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 11:31:28 GMT):<br/>
or arbitrary assigned some member of my bna into the first one

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 11:34:28 GMT):<br/>
@luigima The time-consuming part of a transaction is the endorsement, ordering and committing. Not sure that an extra or two endorsement signature and read/write set adds a significant delay. You could have a scenario where the read/write set is huge, but I think it will affect the endorsement and commit times more than the network latency. But this is just a guess, you need to verify it specifically to your use case
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 11:36:35 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=TvRWm3rrMaMKKqhrq) @anant706 It depends entirely on your use case and the resources you commit (i.e., scaling the network). The way it usually works is that your contractor  say a minimum throughput your design needs to achieve, and the rest is engineering magic :)

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 11:38:37 GMT):<br/>
@MaherBouidani Composer is kind of a "proxy" deployed to each peer of a Fabric network, and it's deployed the same way to every peer. The relationship to organizations is reflected by the peers cert and the network cards you use on the client side. But I'm sure you'll get a more precise answer on the #composer channel

....so on so forth
</p>
<p><strong>MaherBouidani</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 11:42:09 GMT):<br/>
the question is each card for each participant, is it for one org or multiple org...in case of composer fabric 
</p>
<p><strong>MaherBouidani</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 11:42:23 GMT):<br/>
I have one org with one peer in implementation 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 11:42:33 GMT):<br/>
@MaherBouidani The BNA only contains the types of participants, which must be known to every organization. Managing the actual participant instances is the responsibility of the respective roles (the org of TraderXY). And it is usually tied to the authentication of the orgs (TraderXY can't create a CustomerZ instance)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=Za3R5c4MP9tnp8khJ) @houqinghui basically, It depends on what are you looking for. So what I did, I made a conditions for my experiment. the first experiment targets the network load, the second one targets the impact of send Tx

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 10:19:24 GMT):<br/>
@funkol2007 the PR that adds the new features will be raised this week, I still have to write the documentation for it :)

Related to Fabric but is observed by caliper.  getClientIdentity() within the chaincode performes horrible. Anyone happen to know why? 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 13:07:31 GMT):<br/>
@luigima I think you should direct this question to the #fabric channel, with the details of exactly how you use it. Also, take a look at [this](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.3/core/chaincode/lib/cid) library.

I do, thanks @klenik!

@garunkumar450 
- The current entry point for Caliper is the async `run()` function in `src/comm/bench-flow.js`. See the `main.js` files of the example benchmarks for how to use it.
- For the Composer integration, see the [Getting Started page](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/1_Getting_Started.html) and the [Composer Configuration page](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Composer_Configuration.html) of the docs website

@garunkumar450 
- Caliper will be published as an npm package, so it can be included by any (remotely available) backend, but currently we're not planning to provide a "self-hosted" mode, since its working would be mainly dependent on the individual use cases.
- It looks like you can't download the necessary docker images. But it's resolved based on the other errors.
- The command failed error is probably because there aren't any chaincode containers and images to stop/remove. I think docker signals this as a non-zero return value, so it is considered a fail.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 13:51:37 GMT):<br/>
Can you successfully run a benchmark beside these start/end script errors?

Would love to pick someone's brain on using Caliper for a composer blockchain if anyone is around
</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong> (Mon, 03 Dec 2018 20:44:32 GMT):<br/>
wasnt sure if the network has to be on the same machine as the caliper tests running or not

@lotty02cho   the problem is like the issue #112 , you can take a look at the issue.
one solution:

docker-compose -f network/fabric-v11/2-org-2-peer/docker-compose.yaml up -d in another shell
remove "start": "docker-compose -f network/fabric-v11/2-org-2-peer/docker-compose.yaml up -d", from config.json
3.node benchmark/simple/main.js
another solution:

change user to root user.

@lotty02cho   the problem is like the issue #112 [https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/issues/112] , you can take a look at the issue.
one solution:

docker-compose -f network/fabric-v11/2-org-2-peer/docker-compose.yaml up -d in another shell
remove "start": "docker-compose -f network/fabric-v11/2-org-2-peer/docker-compose.yaml up -d", from config.json
3.node benchmark/simple/main.js
another solution:

change user to root user.
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 06:00:10 GMT):<br/>
@Garrett  yes, you are right, the file "/caliper/benchmark/composer/config-composer.json" has been removed, and add the file "caliper/benchmark/composer/config-composer.yaml", now  we change the config file format from json to yaml, 
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 06:01:22 GMT):<br/>
@lotty02cho  you can try it , if cannot sovle the error, please open an issue in the github.

I try to my own query benchmark, but there is issue like below. Does anyone see that kind of issues?
```

I was wonder if you could introduce me links or references showing a sample implemented on hyperledger fabric and uses Caliper for evaluation or simulation where by increasing the number of node how the simulation result will change.

<p><strong>SiamakKarimi</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 18:54:15 GMT):<br/>
and the operating system of my laptop is Win10. Would you tell me whether I can create a hyperledger fabric app and  use Caliper to evaluate it? To start, would you introduce a simple hyperledger fabric app as a sample evaluated by Caliper (and how)? How can I achieve the execution time of transactions? 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 11:45:27 GMT):<br/>
@SiamakKarimi 
1) What you describe is a scalability analysis campaign where you change the network topology (here the number of nodes) in each step. So this is not really the "sample" category that can be put together in an afternoon. 

2) Fabric supports the Windows platform, see the Fabric docs for details. Caliper hasn't been tested on Windows. In theory, Node.js and npm is available for windows, so try it and we'll welcome your results :)
</p>
<p><strong>SiamakKarimi</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 12:26:07 GMT):<br/>
I appreciate your attention. To start, please introduce me a useful sample code or link or resource showing how it evaluated by Caliper.
</p>
<p><strong>SiamakKarimi</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 12:26:41 GMT):<br/>
So, is it better to use linux for Caliper?
</p>
<p><strong>SiamakKarimi</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 12:28:43 GMT):<br/>
Then, how can I use Caliper for evaluating this simple sample by increasing the number of nodes in each step.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 14:09:09 GMT):<br/>
By "nodes" I assume that you mean peers within orgs (you mentioned hyperledger fabric applications), I would recommend running the existing fabric benchmarks and then step through the existing topologies (2Org1Peer through to 3Org3Peer iirc), then you could deploy your own chaincode and write a benchmark for that
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 14:09:53 GMT):<br/>
I would also by default use linux ... if you are on Windows then a Linux VM would be my personal route

<p><strong>SiamakKarimi</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 19:06:47 GMT):<br/>
Regarding my study, in benchmark configuration file, I can define and change the number of node in benchmark configuration file in "test": { "number": 5 }, and for performance I can change the number of transactions in "rounds": [{
        "txNumber" : [5000, 5000, 5000]}

The 5 refers to the number of client generating the workload. The number of Fabric nodes (orderers and peers) is different, it is specified in the other (network) configuration file (that describes the actual network topology you deployed)

@SiamakKarimi - I would recommend that you contact the authors on the above requests ... if you have any specific Caliper questions then we can help with those. The authors in the paper mention that they use a "modified form of Hyperledger Caliper" ... so we would be guessing at exactly how they ran their tests. For the paper, it also looks like a "node" is a "peer". So they added more and more peers, and ran their modified Caliper tests against these.

Yes, but check the address of the peers and orderers. And you can set the channel's `deployed` property to true. The network configuration has to mirror your network topology. The chaincode should be recognized as installed/instantiated, but if not, also delete the chaincode from the `chaincodes` section.

@wangqq Can you share your network config file (github gist is the best)? And what kind of network are you starting manually? Based on the error, the channel can't initialize itself with the genesis block, which could indicate that it can't reach a necessary node (I think an orderer node)

Hi all, I'm a graduate student at the University of Oregon and will be experimenting with some performance analysis of Hyperledger Sawtooth over the next few months.  I'm interested in intelligent benchmarking for reasons that will be obvious to this group.  I have a few initial questions and will greatly appreciate any help or wisdom that anyone has to share!
First - I read the papers published by the group who wrote BLOCKBENCH and noticed BLOCKBENCH is cited by Caliper.  As a performance analysis tool, does anyone have any notes about why I might choose to use one over the other?  Both? Pros and cons? Unique workloads?
Second - I've already run into trouble installing Caliper.  I'll take another stab and come back with specific errors.  Does anybody have any additional notes or resources beyond the main documentation page?  (I'm an npm newbie)  I'm installing on a linux system running Ubuntu 16.04.
Thanks in advance, and thanks for writing Caliper! it seems like a cool tool.

@MohammadObaid  yes you can use caliper to test your own fabric network,The caliper is independent with the backend blockchain network. You can use the default user case to test the fabric network. Of course you can use caliper to test your own fabric network that has been deployed by you. If you want to test your own fabric network, please follow the below steps:

a.	You should modify the fabric configuration file such as fabric-node.json according to your own network topology;

b.	Remove the property command, which can start the docker containers of the blockchain nodes.

c.	If you has installed the chaincode, you should modify the property deployed to true in the channel property.

Does anybody know of any published performance analysis or benchmarking work that pertains to Hyperledger Sawtooth / PoET?  This seems like the best community to ask.  I am working on experimental design and trying to find the most relevant and useful experimental approaches.  There is very little in the literature that I can find.  Thank you!

@MohammadObaid You start caliper using `node benchmark/simple/main.js -c yourconfig.json -n yournetwork.json` so you have to supply your own configurations. Examples can be found in the `./benchmark` and `./network` folders.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 10:03:54 GMT):<br/>
@rkrish82 - benchmark test (simple) passed on the `fabric-v1.2/2org2peercouchdb/fabric-go-tls.json` config

@MohammadObaid As in your own Chaincode? Or the arguments you pass to your chaincode? Both are possible. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 10:09:58 GMT):<br/>
The change the argument simply replace the callback files for each round in the configuration.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=EXdRPuyuMDC4dxALD) @houqinghui Great! The thing is that we updated libraries and I believe you guys use some of those? They need to be updated, I am ready to help in any way if I can be of assistance. I can also write a message in a mailing list though not sure what way you'd prefer to use for communication. Please let me know if you have any questions :vulcan:

<p><strong>Surabhi1777</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 09:52:27 GMT):<br/>
Is it that caliper by default connects to peer0org1, are there any configuartions related to this?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 12:37:14 GMT):<br/>
it depends on the client number:
- client1 -> peer1
- client2 -> peer2
and if clients > peers, then it wraps around again

Hi! I have a simple node.js app which uses fabcar network. My intention is to test it with Caliper but having problems with lack of resources/documentations/tutorials on this. Can anyone help me out with some directions or suggestions? Thank you in advance. 
</p>
<p><strong>amiec</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 20:23:43 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=3g9j2rrRqbKH864og) @LHS_ETR Since you're trying to run a Sawtooth sample, I think you need to specify the blockchain config file (the -n option).  From what I can tell, by looking at main.js inside benchmark/simple/, if you fail to specify the -n option it defaults to a Fabric network setup (not Sawtooth!).  Try adding "-n ../../network/sawtooth/simplenetwork/sawtooth.json" to your command and see if that works.
</p>
<p><strong>amiec</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 20:27:01 GMT):<br/>
Quick question pretty please:  the documentation specifies the -c config option to be a .json file,  and the example on the architecture page looks like a .json file... but from everything I can tell and given the pre-made config files, they look like .yaml files??  I know these file types are highly related but can anyone just clarify for me which one it should be and if it matters?? i.e. can we use either type?  
</p>
<p><strong>Bayeed</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 20:29:29 GMT):<br/>
@amiec after '-c' use benchmarks config.yaml. see if it works!
</p>
<p><strong>amiec</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 20:31:43 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=F7ejsJ2XujFAG5hSt) @Bayeed It does, I've had success with a few config-xxx.yaml test runs - mostly just clarifying if that JSON information is outdated and if so, making a note that the docs should probably be updated (I got confused and hung up learning looking for a config.json that doesn't seem to exist).  I suppose I should just try it with a .json file...
</p>
<p><strong>Bayeed</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 20:36:01 GMT):<br/>
@amiec Glad it works for you. Yes i think updating it with a .yaml extension would be better for beginners to grasp

Greetings Caliper gurus! I recently learned that there was a fork of Caliper called Gauge by a company called Persistent Systems (https://github.com/persistentsystems/gauge/blob/master/docs/caliper-changes.md) which resolves some issues with the Caliper engine. Have those changed been pushed or resolved in the main Caliper tool?
</p>
<p><strong>unlimited</strong> (Sat, 19 Jan 2019 20:10:25 GMT):<br/>
Seems like a rather big issue that "Caliper client was missing out certain block events at higher transaction rates resulting in failed transactions."

Hello, I am trying to setup Caliper with my custom Composer network. Could someone point me to a good tutorial or learning resource please? The webpage i am seeing seems to be referring to files i dont have such as config-composer.json where there are .yaml instead.

@unlimited @ajbill , this documentation described the flow of the Caliper. https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/2_Architecture.html. 
</p>
<p><strong>panyu2</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 07:02:49 GMT):<br/>
The network configuration files are stored in the directory `network/`  @ajbill 
</p>
<p><strong>panyu2</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 07:10:44 GMT):<br/>
@unlimited  the configuration files in the directory `network/fabric-v1.2/**` contains configuration files for fabric 1.2 and the files in the directory `network/fabric-v1.2/dev/` contains the dev test case's network files of fabric 1.2 for dev benchamark test.

</p>
<p><strong>unlimited</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 01:50:01 GMT):<br/>
@panyu2 thanks for the tips! in the benchmark configuration file, is txNumber number of transactions submitted PER client? or TOTAL from all clients? if latter, I suppose the transactions are divided evenly among clients?
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 01:58:38 GMT):<br/>
@unlimited  yes you are right, the txNumber is the total number of transactiosns. In the benchmark flow, the transactioins will be divided evenly to every client.

Hi, I tested sawtooth multi-node network, and saw a lot of instability in the tool itself based on some reports it gave especially after a certain send rate. What is the issue which is causing it, is it some limitation of the clients or technologies used?

@CodeReaper I'm not sure if this is related, but a company forked Caliper and developed their own benchmarking tool called Gauge due to the original Caliper (before it joined Hyperledger) having issues with high send rates. Check it out: https://github.com/persistentsystems/gauge. I thought this was fixed - let me know if it's the same problem you're experiencing?

Also, anyone know if it's possible or how to modify/configure test modules to test crash fault tolerance? like 1. node stopping 2. network bandwidth throttling/messaging delay 3. corruption of messages?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=NgH38qqa6HPXZe3rH) @unlimited Caliper already has implemented forking of client processes or creating multiple remote clients with zookeeper. But for sawtooth, and especially after a certain send rate it starts giving bizarre reports.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=DKhS7mtLumw6B4y45) @houqinghui Thanks, I have a Java application calling the REST API. I have not managed to set Caliper up yet as i have realised all my transactions are not getting committed. Things work until multiple transactions are sent to the REST server in short succession and then only the last transaction gets through. I guess its a question for the Composer section but I am not sure where to look for the problem. I guess its a problem on the back-end but the network seems to be working ok otherwise.

Does caliper support hyperledger fabric 1.4 network deployed in a multi-host setting using docker swarm?
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 23:25:03 GMT):<br/>
https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Configuration.html says latest supported fabric version is 1.2
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 00:40:55 GMT):<br/>
@sherbetlemon yes, supporting hyperledger fabric v1.4 is in progress, but we  use docker composer rather than docker swarm.

@sherbetlemon  Does the "deployed nodes" mean the node of backend blockchain network?  if so,  you can deploy the node anywhere you want.
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 00:52:34 GMT):<br/>
So the only difference between docker composer and docker swarm deployment would be that the IP addresses need to be specifically mentioned in the docker composer?
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 00:58:58 GMT):<br/>
@sherbetlemon  In the caliper use case, the backend blockchain network is deployed by the docker composer, then the caliper can test it . You can deploy your own blockchain network by docker swarm, modify the network configuration file such as fabric-node.json, and use caliper to test it.

Hi all, I'm trying to create a custom transaction processor for use with a Sawtooth network.  The TP is very simple - it literally does nothing.  I've created corresponding BatchBuilder and callback, as well as benchmark and network config files.  Where I'm currently hung up is trying to build a docker image for my transaction processor.  So far, I've modeled everything on the simple-tp-python infrastructure that is already present.  When I try to spin up my network that includes my custom do-nothing transaction processor image, I get "ERROR: for sawtooth-do-nothing-tp-python-default  Cannot start service do-nothing-tp-python: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:348: starting container process caused "exec: \"do-nothing-tp-python\": executable file not found in $PATH".

I noticed that there seems to be an executable called "simple-tp-python " already sitting in the simple_python folder (caliper/src/contract/sawtooth/simple/simple_python)... as well as some magic going on with a "packaging" directory and "setup.py" script.

How did these get there and how would I do the same assuming I have almost a perfect clone of the simple-tp situation?  I'm not sure what's going on with docker in this case or why the compose file can't seem to find and launch my image even though the image appears to have been build just fine.

Please and thank you!!

@amiec you need to check if the contract files (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/master/src/contract/sawtooth/simple/simple_python)'are in the dir `../../../../caliper/src/contract/sawtooth/simple/simple_python`. The above dir information can be got from the following lines (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/network/sawtooth/simplenetwork/sawtooth-simple.yaml#L43) (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/network/sawtooth/simplenetwork/Dockerfile#L57)
</p>
<p><strong>FlyingTiger</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 08:56:37 GMT):<br/>
@amiec If you want to run your own contract, you could do the same as the simple_python,  put your own contract files to a dir, then mount the dir on the docker to run.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=zrYFzNgLHBxttCC3o) @FlyingTiger Thanks! I made a bit more progress - I had failed to provide the appropriate executable to call from the entrypoint specified in the compose file for the container.  I do have one more question though:  In the contract directory structure for the simple tp python, there is a dir called "packaging", and inside that a dir called "systemd", in which there are two files: sawtooth-simple-tp-python and also sawtooth-simple-tp-python.service.  Do you know why these files are there and what they are used for?  Why isn't it enough to just have the executable as a starting point and the relevant python files for the TP?  I'm having trouble getting my new TP be recognized appropriately by my validator and I'm wondering if it has to do with these magic files.

Hi.. I am trying to test Caliper for a Hyperledger fabric based network with 4 Orgs and 2 peers SOLO Orderer. My usescase is that caliper should not start my network using "start" command instead it should just communicate with the network that I have spin up. Can anyone give me some information on how to modify caliper for this working ? 
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 06:53:57 GMT):<br/>
@RamyaLaxmi The caliper is independent with the backend blockchain network. You can use the default user case to test the fabric network. of course you can use caliper to test your own fabric network that has been deployed by you. If you want to test your own fabric network, please follow the below steps: 
a.	you should modify the fabric configuration file such as fabric-node.json according to your own network topology;
b.	remove the property command, which can start the docker containers of the blockchain nodes.
c.	if you has installed the chaincode, you should modify the property deployed to true in the channel property.

<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 08:20:43 GMT):<br/>
@Nabilel 1 You can clone the caliper from github.com. We modify the config.json to config.yaml, and move the command that can spin up the backend network from config.yaml to network configuration file such as fabric-node.json.

<p><strong>Bayeed</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 22:13:53 GMT):<br/>
Quick question, what should be the endorsement policy of a single org fabric network for its configuration file? 
The default i have found few places is- under policy of endorsement policy of config file, 
    
 "policy": { "2-of": [{"signed-by": 0}, {"signed-by": 1}]}

but those networks have 2 orgs. i am working with 1 org network. so thinking of if i should edit this block of code. if so, which way?
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:42:36 GMT):<br/>
@mamtabhardwaj12 This is the caliper documentation web https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Configuration.html. Do you deploy the fabric v1.3 network？ if so, you should install the fabric v1.2 or v1.1 and try it.
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:43:29 GMT):<br/>
@Bayeed Maybe you can modify the value from 120000 to 600000 at the function `instatiateChainCode`'s first line "setConfigSetting" in the /src/fabric/e2eutils.js. Try it.
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:55:10 GMT):<br/>
@Bayeed You can refer to the endorsement policy of the fabric documentation https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/endorsement-policies.html.  if you just have one org, why do you use the fabric network?  Fabric is a Consortium blockchain, and need have two or more orgs which can form a consortium.

@HLFPOC  Sorry, there is not a default use case about Indy, but you can try it following the below step.If you want to test the blockchain system that Caliper does not support now, you should write your own blockchain adapter. Firstly let’s look inside and learn about how the whole framework interacts with the backend blockchain system. When the benchmark engine is running, the master process of benchmark engine will call the user defined blockchain class to complete blockchain’s chaincode’s installion. Then, after the master process launches the corresponding clients, each client will do the test. During the test, the client will get current blockchain’s context, run the test scripts, release the blockchain’s context in the end, and return the performance statistics. Hence, if users intend to test the blockchain system which Caliper does not support, the bellows are what the users would concern about.  

a.	Realize the blockchain NBI according to your own blockchain system, for example, you should implement the funcitons ‘init’, ‘prepareClients’, ‘installSmartContract’, ‘getContext’, ‘releaseContext’, ‘invokeSmartContract’, ‘queryState’. Then you should add the blockchain type in the class blockchain’s constructor.  

b.	Add your own blockchain type into the blockchain’s constructor function.  

c.	Add predefined network files into the network folder.  

d.	Add your own network configuration file into the corresponding network folder.  

e.	Add your command which will be executed before or after test, if you want.  

f.	Define your own smart contracts.  

g.	Define your test module.  

h.	Define the installation script.

1. How is the throughput TPS calculated? 
2. Scenario: Send Rate is 50tps and Throughput is 48tps. Is there a way to understand what affected delay in transaction which resulted in 48tps?
3. Can Caliper be configured to check performance of Fabric in following activities individually ?

<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 01:45:13 GMT):<br/>
@RamyaLaxmi  1. Caliper will record the submitting time and committing time (the time when the tx is committed on the ledger or when the failure occurred) for each tx.
So the send rate is calculated by (Succ+Fail) / (last submitting time - first submitting time).
The throughput is calculated by Succ/(last committing time - first submitting time), here only successful committed txs will be calculated. 2. Because the last committing time is greater than the last submitting time, and the (Succ + Fail) is greater than Succ, so the send rate is greater than the throughput. 3. Maybe not , but you can use the method "variable-controlling approach", for example you can fix the endorsement policy and modify the ordering.

I suspect that the channel was not created, so I changed the name and recreated, but there was a problem.

@wangqq  Do you modify the config.yaml ?  i want to know which version of the fabric network you use.
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 02:44:21 GMT):<br/>
@wangqq  If this is the second run , you should modify the `channel.deployed` to `true`.

I try to make my own network and I modified fabric-go-tls.json to run caliper.
I can easily install chaincode, but however, when instantiating starts, there are some issues comes out.

Here is what I did.
1. I start caliper below this command.
`node benchmark/simple/main.js -c config.yaml -n fabric-go-tls.json`
```

I saw chaincode is installed in my all peers, but there is a long time to wait to instantiate, the error comes out like below,

I try to make my own network and I modified fabric-go-tls.json to run caliper.
I can easily install chaincode, but however, when instantiating starts, there are some issues comes out.

Here is what I did.
1. I start caliper below this command.
`node benchmark/simple/main.js -c config.yaml -n fabric-go-tls.json`
```

@Luxii 
1) Measurements on local docker networks are not really trustworthy, who knows what else runs on your machine beside the Fabric network, plus how they compete for resources. Can you run the same test with an 1.1 Fabric backend? 
2) A Fabric network is distributed among multiple machines, so it doesn't really depends on the stats of a single machine. Running Caliper on locally deployed networks is only for testing your user callback and chaincode implementations. The real deal begins when you start testing remotely deployed and distributed networks.

Hi all, I'm experimenting with some Sawtooth networks and workloads, and wondering if there is any way to control more aspects of the generated report?  For example, I want to have more automated control over the name of the report and where it is saved.  It would also be nice to have the report formatted as a CSV or something more data-friendly.  This is because I plan to run many simulations with a variety of different network sizes under a variety of workloads, so a lot of data may be generated that needs to be organized. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to do this??  Please and thank you.

@GeorgePaulose 
1) Looks like your user doesn't have write access to so directories (beginning warning of your first screenshot; although it's under your user profile), and probably that's why the install fails in the end.
2) The missing files are available starting from the 1.1 SDK, so you need to install those. The full install for testing a Fabric 1.1 backend is the following (don't use `sudo` for the commands, work in some directory where your user has full access):
```
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper.git
cd caliper
npm install
npm run fabric-v1.1-deps
```

@Luxii The question of perfomance is not that simple. In the case of Fabric (and usually other middleware solutions) you need 3 things to talk about perfomance:
1. The middleware settings (like the Fabric network topology, policies, etc)
2. The applications deployed on top of the middleware (chaincodes in this case)
3. The workload of the system. 
If one of the components is missing from a report, be suspicious about its validity :)
THE Fabric paper contains some measurements if you're interested: __Hyperledger fabric: a distributed operating system for permissioned blockchains__

Thanks @wangqq @klenik. There was a mismatch between the client versions, fabric versions and the docker-compose yaml file. Also i modified some user settings in linux

I had another doubt. In the caliper html report, there is a column called send rate and another called throughput. Whats the difference between these two?

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 12:57:34 GMT):<br/>
@GeorgePaulose The send rate indicates how fast Caliper submits transactions, the throughput indicates how fast Fabric processes them.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=EenrevTSWqQcFP2Pi) @klenik @houqinghui  thank you both for the quick response and open issue.  It sounds like this is a work in progress and I'm not missing out on any existing functionality?  I suppose a temporary hack could include a script that moves and renames each generated report file after it is created, and another script could parse the HTML to extract relevant data as the experimental runs are performed.

Above is the configuration for the endorsment policy. 
1. What does "signed-by": 0, "signed-by": 1 mean? Does it imply that the first 2 peers in the identities array or is it something else?
2. If i wanted the endorsement policy to be "any 2 peers" (or-condition), how will i rewrite the config?
3. If i wanted to nest the conditions, how would i write the config? ( Assume 3 peers, condition := 0 or (1 and 2) )

@GeorgePaulose  1. It implies the first 2 peer in the identities array

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:38:08 GMT):<br/>
@Luxii hmm, that's strange. Client/Caliper side performance should only affect the sending rate, and not the processing rate of Fabric. I'm going to perform some measurements with the current state of Caliper (actually, with a new Fabric adapter), and I'll get back to you on this

Hi all, as suggested by Attila, we found the current rotating Caliper call schedule is kind confusing and not easy for people to keep track with.

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 11:40:33 GMT):<br/>
@GeorgePaulose Based on the commit history, Fabric 1.4 is supported as of today. Generally about the time needed to support a new Fabric version: Caliper relies on the Fabric SDK, so first the SDK needs to provide support for new versions and features (the SDK is usually up2date with Fabric), only then can Caliper use/expose the new features/versions. We try to shorten this time as much as possible.

@klenik @houqinghui I modified the configtx. yaml file in the local caliper and rebuilt the network certificate and channel configuration file, but it showed a mistake. The orderer automatically quit. I found that it was a CA certificate problem. I wanted to use the certificate issued by ca, but I could use it before.

Can somone explain to me what local  and zookeeper clients are.? It says in the docs that local processes are forked to become blockchain clients but what exactly does that mean. Also as follow up, what exactly is happening in the update() function in src/gui/src/demo.js file. A startWatch is called before every test and sends the client object as argument to this demo.js file, which recursively calls the update() function.

@GeorgePaulose  The local clients mean that the clients run in the same machine, and zookeeper clients means the clients run in the different machines.  `demo.js` is expected to visualize the performance of the backend system, but is not completed, you can ignore it.

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 12:57:13 GMT):<br/>
@Luxii As I see from the code, the `sendTransaction` function sends already endorsed transaction proposals to the orderer. So it's just the second part of the whole transaction life-cycle. (Although that file changed a bit since I last used it, so maybe @houqinghui could clarify it better.)

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sun, 24 Feb 2019 08:18:25 GMT):<br/>
@cadaroya Well, the support of additional platforms requires the implementation of an adapter for them, so techniqually it's possible and you're welcome to contribute that adapter :)

If i wanted to test a multi-node network, with each node running on different machines, would i have to install caliper on each machine or should i run caliper on a separate instance and somehow pass a suitable a config file. How would I begin to approach this?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 13:16:37 GMT):<br/>
@GeorgePaulose No, Caliper needs to be run only on one machine. The network configuration file you use will contain the endpoints for the different nodes in your blockchain network. Whether these are deployed locally (with docker-compose) or remotely (on your favorite IaaS provider), Caliper doesn't care, it just needs an endpoint address for the nodes (`<IP/HOSTNAME>:<PORT>`).

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 05:53:27 GMT):<br/>
@RonaldReagan 
1) Take any example network config file (under the network dir, staring with fabric-*). 
2) Remove the command attribute from the beginning (contains the start and end script)
3) Modify the node entries according to your topology (how many peers, orgs, channels). 
4) Make sure that the URL attributes of the nodes point to the appropriate remote address.

Hi all, I am confused by the behavior of the benchmark specified in the benchmark configuration file. I am testing on a small, experimental Sawtooth network (Docker-deployed nodes, running on Ubuntu 18.04), and when I use the example config file and corresponding network (`node ./benchmark/simple/main.js -c ~/caliper/benchmark/simple/config-sawtooth.yaml -n ~/caliper/network/sawtooth/simplenetwork/sawtooth.json`) I get the following info reported to the screen:

</p>
<p><strong>amiec</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 21:43:33 GMT):<br/>
which seems to be sending 10 transactions (instead of the 5 indicated in the config file), and seems to be sending them repeatedly!

<p><strong>amiec</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 21:46:25 GMT):<br/>
which involves submitting 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 transactions?  Which seems to have nothing to do with the 5 tx that are specified for this round...  What is this behavior?  Is there some sort of averaging happening?  Where are these numbers coming from?  In experimenting with my own configuration files, I've attempted to specify larger numbers of transactions and rates (for example, i want to be able to send about 1100 TPS because that is an empirical ceiling that's been seen for a single sawtooth node), and what I see is "Submitted: 0".  I can't seem to find details about this behavior in the documentation and I'm very confused about what's actually happening, what's possible, and why.  Your enlightenment would be greatly appreciated!! thank you

@capriya Increase the chaincode start-up timeout for the peer containers by setting the following env. variable (to 600s for example):
`- CORE_CHAINCODE_STARTUPTIMEOUT=600s`

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 11:05:08 GMT):<br/>
@amiec Are you using the up-2-date version of Caliper? The 1000 TPS throughput is also shady a bit. 
</p>
<p><strong>fridtjon</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 12:01:01 GMT):<br/>
Hey guys, a quick question: If the throughput TPS is calculated as Successful Transactions / Time used, then it's heavily affected by transaction timeouts.  How does transaction timeouts affect the Throughput TPS stat in caliper, and does it count the time until transaction timeout? 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 12:08:53 GMT):<br/>
@fridtjon I think they don't interfere on Caliper side, since only the successful transactions are taken into account when calculating the test duration (but I'd need to check the code to confirm this). However, transactions that time out still consume resources on the network side, so they can interfere with (~increase) the execution time of successful transactions. You can't negate this effect, and you shouldn't, since it's part of the system load (unsuccessful request hogging resources is common).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=4MFsniL4sFsc95cLC) @nkl199 Thanks nkl199 - do you mind elaborating a little bit on what a given round does?  For example, if I specify a benchmark that consists of a single round and has 10 tx specified, maybe at a fixed rate of 1 tps... what is going to actually happen in the delivery of the benchmark?  Is there a built-in warmup phase?  Why do I see the repeated reporting of Submitted: __ Success: __ Failure: __ ?  What's going on there?  I would really appreciate it.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=2txpTjzGRTjt6P8JR) @klenik Thanks, I might be on a slightly outdated fork of Caliper... I'll integrate the latest changes and see if that helps.  Is there anything specifically that has been changed in the last two months that should affect the behavior with Sawtooth?  Regarding the maximum TPS that Caliper can deliver... is there any idea what a current upper bound is?  Any ideas for creating a situation that can handle higher TPS?  Maybe multiple clients?  Multiple instances of Caliper examining the same backend system?  Though it seems like the functionality of delivering the workload and then assessing the metrics are tightly coupled in Caliper such that you can't expect Caliper to get accurate metrics if the workload is delivered by an external client?

@capriya Check the peer logs to see why the chaincode instantiation failed. Unfortunately, the peers don't provide a detailed error message to the client apps (Caliper in this case), so you have to dig deeper by hand

[Caliper update news] The default way of running a benchmark changed. Instead of the traditional (and multiple) `main.js` files, an `npm run` script is provided. Check out the [docs](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/1_Getting_Started.html#run-benchmark). Thanks to @gregdhill for the refactor!

@rkrish82 Yes, multiple channels are supported in the same tests. Each chaincode has a unique ID, `contractId`, that defaults to the traditional chaincode `id` if not set. To create multiple channels:
```yaml
channels:
  mychannel:
    # ... other properties
    chaincodes:
    - id: marbles
      version: v0
      contractID: mymarbles
  yourchannel:
    # ... other properties
    chaincodes:
    - id: marbles
      version: v0
      contractID: yourmarbles
```

With the `contractID`, you can instantiate the same chaincode in different channels, and use the `mymarbles` or `yourmarbles` name to identify your chaincode in your client test module

@amiec Regarding your previous question about sending 10 txs instead of 5: I just noticed that you used sawtooth. Is it possible that your user test module submit 2 txs (as a batch) for every callback? This is a supported behavior, and the txs are counted accordingly, that's why your actual load differs from the config file.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 13:46:27 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=kg5F6h2Ychyvq7FQa) @amiec The benchmarks consider TPS to be that "witnessed" by the underlying target platform, so if driven at 2TPS with 2 clients, each client would drive at 1TPS. The flow is to stand the network up, deploy chaincode, create clients, and once all clients are created, to start issuing transactions. Each client reports back the number of successful/failed transactions and there is a user notification report that is presented to the user (success/fail count) and you can configure how frequent that is shown. You can add a warm-up/cool-down phase to the benchmarks by using the correct flag in the benchmark description- it will either ignore a number of start/end transactions, or a duration of start/end transactions...depending if you are running a "X transactions" or "Y seconds of transactions" style of test
</p>

Ah, thanks @klenik and @nkl199 !  I will dig into these possibilities.  I appreciate your responses.

@RonaldReagan I think you're using an outdated version of Caliper. Some bugs have been addressed recently. Clone the repo again, and take a look at [this Fabric adapter configuration](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Ccp_Configuration.html), for example. Nothing else should be changed (but you can remove the chaincodes from the config you don't need, so they don't take up time and storage in your nodes).

<p><strong>amiec</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 22:42:41 GMT):<br/>
Hey all, a question about using the *Sawtooth* adapter...  The network configuration file specifies the URLs for the REST-api containers, and from what I can see in the code, it is important to provide a complete array of the REST-api URLs for all validators, otherwise the workload won't be delivered proportionally across the number of nodes in the network.  (right?)  The other URL specified in the network config file is the validator's URL.  From what I can see in the code, this is used to create an event subscription stream that is used to inform many of the other functionalities of Caliper - like the metrics and any errors coming from the validator (right?)  My final question is:  What if I have a larger network of dozens of validator nodes?  Is there a risk of having biased information by only taking event subscriptions from a single one of them??  For example, if it is used to get transaction commit times, but for some reason this particular validator is less-well connected to the network than other peers and is therefore receiving blocks a little later than others... or is on a machine that is squeezing it out in terms of resource availability.  What are people's thoughts on this matter?

@amiec 1. Yes, you are right. The REST-api is used for submitting batches and querying (Fetches a particular leaf from the current state) . 2. In caliper, the validator URL is used for subscribe event with block commit,  then get batch commit event message to update the batch commit status. 3. Yes, the Sawtooth adapter only taking event subscriptions from a single one of them. The following URL is the white paper from the Hyperledger Performance and Scale WorkingGroup. https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HL_Whitepaper_Metrics_PDFVersion.pdf

Hello, I'm new to the caliper development community so please forgive my asking to some simple questions: Now I'm in the getting started page, and I already use Fabric v1.1.0 to started a network with three organizations. But the *Run Benchmark* give me the code `npm run bench -- -c yourconfig.json -n yournetwork.json`, where I couldn't find any configuration file in my Hyperledger with .json type, and all of them are .yaml files. I also checked the Fabric Configuration and ran `npm run fabric-v1.1-deps`, but it outputs error like the one in the screen shot. My operating system is *18.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.2.0*. Link: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/1_Getting_Started.html. Thanks a lot for the help!

@Jasonyou -- -c benchmark/simple/yourconfig.yaml, caliper now uses yaml config. Sorry for not updating help doc. To your second question, maybe this is mismatch for the versions of node11.10.1 and grpc1.10.1.  node8.X is ok for grpc 1.10.1. Of course, you could find a version of grpc for node11.10.1, and have a try. And if you find, run calilper test OK, please contribute to caliper. Thanks!

I want to configure calliper to my existing running network have chain code installed and instantiated on it .
what changes do I need to made so that the below steps won't be executing while running the bench -
1. no channel installation 
2.no chaincode installation and instantiation
</p>
<p><strong>FlyingTiger</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 09:29:28 GMT):<br/>
@Kazekagegara 1. you could edit "deployed": true, https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/network/fabric-v1.1/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.json#L53  on network config 
</p>
<p><strong>FlyingTiger</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 09:32:08 GMT):<br/>
If you use fabric adapter not fabric-ccp adapter, caliper query whether chaincode  is installed and instantiated, if it is , caliper has no chaincode installation and instantiation

@Kazekagegara I donot know why you come accross this error, please checkout the version of nodejs. If you want to test your own fabric network, you can follwo the below steps:
The caliper is independent with the backend blockchain network. You can use the default use case to test the fabric network. Of course you can use caliper to test your own fabric network that has been deployed by you. If you want to test your own fabric network, please follow the below steps:  

a.	You should modify the fabric configuration file such as fabric-node.json according to your own network topology;  
b.	Remove the property `command`, which can start the docker containers of the blockchain nodes.  
c.	If you has installed the chaincode, you should modify the property `deployed` to `true` in the channel property.

@Kazekagegara @FlyingTiger The Fabric CCP adapter also supports skipping creating channels and deploying chaincodes. See the channel's `created` attribute. Installed and instantiated chaincodes are also checked without any additional configuration needed.

@Kazekagegara It's a bug in the query user module implementation. Try using the new Fabric adapter for the example:
```

My transactions are failing while testing with Caliper / Composer with "the current identitiy with the name 'admin'... must be activated".  I'm using hlfv1.2 with couchdb.  I can successfully run the basic-simple-network benchmark and my chaincode works locally.  Any help is appreciated.

@PranavBhardwaja67  This error is is `Endorsement denied`, do you run the sample successfully? if so , you should use `docker ps -a` to check whether the old containers is live, then you can use `docker rm $(docker ps -aq);docker rmi $(docker images dev* -q)` to remove them, next you can run it again.
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 02:35:46 GMT):<br/>
@pfm  do you run the caliper sample or use caliepr to test your own network?  It sounds like your CA server does not know of that id and it is not bound to the Network Admin in the business network. You have to run `composer identity bind `as an existing participant in the business network. This is the act of the existing business network participants agreeing (via blockchain transaction) that the new business network participant /admin can join and use their identity.

</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 07:31:32 GMT):<br/>
@PranavBhardwaja67 Do you mean that you got the error in the query process, while you donot get the error in the init process?

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 09:33:20 GMT):<br/>
@PranavBhardwaja67 One of the sample benchmarks use the normal transaction workflow for queries, since the query API is limited. Try the new Fabric adapter, its query API is more flexible and doesn't perform the entire transaction flow.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=R3QFLgAjKyhr8vvfc) @houqinghui Sorry for being naive, new to caliper. Do, I need to have a backend fabric network running before I run that command or the command will do it itself?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 06:53:14 GMT):<br/>
@swmdwn There are two approaches:
1) The network configuration file (specified by `-n`) contains a `caliper.command.start/end` attribute, that can run artbitrary scripts, e.g., start a Fabric network. In this case you just run the `npm run bench ...` command.
2) Caliper can also connect to an already running Fabric network. In this case you don't need the `caliper.command.start/end` attribute in the config file.

The sample `-n` network config files all contain the `caliper.command.start/end` attribute, so you can just simply run the `npm run bench ...` command and a local Docker-based Fabric network will be started for you.
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 07:00:32 GMT):<br/>
@HappyThoughts   When the send rate is beyond the capability of the backend blockchain network, the transactioins may fail.  However, the screenshot shows that your transactions all failed. do you modify the config file?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 10:04:28 GMT):<br/>
@HappyThoughts - it looks like you are running a benchmark on your own Business Network too, I'd recommend putting some heavy debug lines into the benchmark code you are running to assist diagnose

@amiec https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/protos/validator.proto#L155 this maybe give you a clue.  Now Caliper only support sawtooth 1.0.5, which version of sawtooth you use? The TypeError is not ref to sawtooth, so avoid it.

<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 06:27:16 GMT):<br/>
@ishanvi.anavkar You can refer to [the caliper docs](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/1_Getting_Started.html). If you want to run caliper to test the default fabric network, you can run `npm run bench -- -c benchmark/simple/config.yaml -n network/fabric-v1.4/2org2peergoleveldb/fabric-go.json` before you install fabric-client and fabric-ca-client.

How to use caliper to test your own blockchain fabric network
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 11:57:53 GMT):<br/>
@ishanvi.anavkar You need to create a network configuration file that matches your Fabric network topology and participants. 
For the old Fabric adapter: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Configuration.html
For the new Fabric-CCP adapter: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Ccp_Configuration.html
Then pass this file's path to the `-n` parameter of the  `npm run bench --` command

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 14:01:50 GMT):<br/>
That's a Fabric error, meaning your parallelly executed transactions read and updated the same key.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 03:35:19 GMT):<br/>
@narsimplyme There aren't any 1.4 CCP example configs yet. But you're right, the only difference between a 1.1 and 1.4 config file is that they start different docker-compose files. But if you remove the commands, then the config files are identical. 
And that was the main reason behind this adapter: support every Fabric version transparently. The only difference between versions is, that for Fabric v1.0 you need to provide event URLs for the peers, and there are some version-specific features (private collection, CouchDB index deploy, java chaincodes). Other than these, the user experience with the CCP adapter is version agnostic :) (I hope :D )

But we cannot run the test simultaneously we get the error container already in use, rename the container. As per my knowledge there is one container per port.So how can we run the test simultaneously on the same server ?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 06:20:51 GMT):<br/>
@ishanvi.anavkar If I understand correctly, you want to run two Caliper measurements simultaneously on two separate local Fabric network. In this case you have to ensure that the node/container names in the two network don't conflict. By appending some postfix to the container names, for example, network1, network2, etc. And you need to separate network configuration files that point to the appropriate container names/addresses and ports.

Hi all, I'm struggling with some Sawtooth and Caliper experiments that are reporting measurements that I don't understand and that conflict with what I believe to be actually happening.  I would like to examine my network's behavior as the workload is being delivered, perhaps by examining container logs in real-time, or perhaps I should figure out how to use Grafana to view real-time metrics in a more user friendly way.  What are your tips/suggestions/wisdom for debugging approaches for me?  How do I watch my logs in real time?  Any votes for Grafana?  thank you!! help!
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 01:17:19 GMT):<br/>
@amiec  1. Can you show me the Caliper logs and explain the conflicts detailedly? 2. Maybe you should examine the container logs in real-time currently. Grafana will be integrated as soon as possible.

@karanp0987 You donot write you own logging codes to do it, you can get the data from the `result` in the class `client.js`.  The data is not stored in the caliper, you can store it and get it.

I was wishing to create reports like orderer latency, e2e latency and so on to identify whats the bottleneck of the network

<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 06:03:05 GMT):<br/>
@nwalisundara 1.  If you blockchain system is not supported, you can refer to [this doc](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Writing_Adapters.html) to write your blockchain's adaptor, then you can use Caliper to test your blockchain system.  2. If your want to test your own blockchain network that supported by Caliper, you can refer to [the doc](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/1_Getting_Started.html)

@nwalisundara You donot develop your own application. You can use the default use case to test your blockchain network. However you can write your own use case if the default use case cannot satisfy you.

because fabric client@1.1.0 has a dependancy on grpc@1.19.0, caliper does not have a dependancy on grpc at all .. did u run a `npm install x --save` command at some point? If so, you will need to revert you pacakge.json file, delete the package-lock.json file, remove all node modules and re-install

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 08:45:29 GMT):<br/>
@Ruben-Joseph-Halder - depending on what adapter you are using, you will get a specific grpc version pulled in (different versions of fabric-sdk depend on different versions of grpc for example) but caliper itself does not have a dependancy on grpc

from a "fresh" clone of the caliper project, steps are:

where x relates to the adapter you are wanting to work with

@Ruben-Joseph-Halder  1. in the caliper/benchmark/simple/config-zookeeper.yam, you should set the same ip of the server. 2.   npm run startclient -- ip:port,  this ip should be the same ip of the server. 3. You should run the caliper in the server machine.

@rkrish82 This looks like an error returned by the chaincode you're testing. Look into the chaincode to see what generates this error. You're probably passing something non-string as parameter. Every chaincode argument must be passed as string, and the chaincode must decode it however it wants

Hi just a quick question has anyone managed to run benchmark tests with Caliper on EVMCC (ethereum virtual machine chaincode), for example running the tests on this repo https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-evm ?
</p>

@MattWilson8 Yes, I've actually added seamless Solidity support to the Fabric-CCP adapter using EVMCC. It's not merged into the official Caliper repo yet, because it's not "production ready" (and definitely not well documented :) )

Is it simply a matter of supplying the correct http://remote_ip:port in the network configuration file?  Or am I going to run into trouble with the Docker network being closed off in some way?  any wisdom would help!

hello @klenik, I was able to test caliper using fabric ccp. I think its easy and works well. I am facing mainly two issues, 1) my network uses kafka-zookeeper and is deploy in docker swarm on 10 distributed hosts. When caliper starts testing network I get a bunch of Promise is rejected- error: REQUEST_TIMEOUT. Is there something I have pay attention to  for kafka deployment to work with caliper.  2) When peers that are not channel creators joins the channel, their chaincode container is not deployed, so caliper gets a "premature chaincode execution" error, how can I make sure that the all chaincode containers are up before running caliper ( I know caliper brings up the chaincode containers eventually but it takes time).

Hello all,
I came across the 2019 intern project and one interesting project is https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Hyperledger+Caliper+visualization . I have good understanding of Fabric and its usecases. Also have good knowledge in MEAN stack and worked as NodeJS developer, so skillset required for this project is matching with my skill set. 

I would like to apply for this Intern project. Any lead/suggestions to understand this project, will help me. Meantime I am going through the links provided in idea description. 

Thanks!

I was struggling also with the ccp like you and after reading the documentation precisely, got a little grasp of how caliper worked

Also, the info part saying 'Orderer: Solo' is just a information that goes at the left bottom of the HTML report generated.
What matters is the 'blockchain: fabric-ccp' which is under the caliper. the Common Connection Profile of the Fabric SDK will automatically connect to the kafka-zk based orderers when the benchmark runs.

I recommend getting a running kafka orderer network and writing your own network credential to the ccp yaml file and try it out

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=Npxd3Eg3pH3h2xAxx) @narsimplyme Thank you..I will go through the link . I am new in caliper and don't have coding knowledge of hyperledger. I wanted to confirm that with the available caliper network it is not possible to test for kafka, if we want to test for kafka we have to check it with our own network?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 12:36:46 GMT):<br/>
@ishanvi.anavkar From the point of view of Caliper, the ordering service is simply a collection of endpoints. Whether you use Kafka, Raft, or your custom magical BFT protocol, it doesn't matter. All Caliper (or the Fabric SDK) needs is the traditional orderer node API, doesn't matter what's behind it

hi @klenik  any update from your end? Also How do we calculate the total tps of the network? Is it the throughput for each test round? Or do we multiply the throughput by the number of transactions submitted (eg. 100). What is the maximum tested Hyperledger fabric network speed (tps)? What aspects should one consider to improve speed (other than the internet speed)? I am trying to achieve 500 tps.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:08:21 GMT):<br/>
@RonaldReagan the setup and connection robustness of the fabric-ccp adapter could use some improvements. Could you open a github issue detailing the current limitations of the adapter? I'll try to improve things in the coming weeks 
</p>
<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:08:42 GMT):<br/>
@jarvis26  The `deployed`  means that Caliper won't create it,  if  you have created a channel. But  if you didnot install the chaincodes in the network configuration file, Caliper will install them. Your error shows that the files don't exist, you can check them.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=fdgpx7PXMGgyf84Sx) @klenik Hi,  I don't have any issues per se. I just wanted to know the best configuration to run in order to test my blockchain network. For example how to set up test machines ( clients) and how have them test a distributed network (How to coordinate them). I know there are limitations in using a single machine for testing. Or do I have to use zookeeper client's for testing and is it better? 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 02 May 2019 11:09:39 GMT):<br/>
@RonaldReagan Well, single machine workload generation is easier to manage, so try to scale your Caliper machine vertically first (and launch lots of local client processes that can be set in the Caliper test config file). And if you hit a limit (monitor your Caliper machine to see what limit) before your desired workload rate, then use the zookeeper feature with 2 strong machines. Until the Caliper clients aren't "dockerized", try to keep your Caliper infrastructure minimal, the Fabric deployment is complex enough on its own :)

@RonaldReagan The TPS is the average in the period  from the first transaction to  the last one.  You can refer to the `Other Questions Related to Caliper`  in the doc https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Caliper_FAQ.html
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 12:58:29 GMT):<br/>
@RonaldReagan It always depends on what you want to present, there are no single golden rule. Since you have two different workloads (jsut invokes, and just queries), I wouldn't calculate a single average on all rounds. Calculate two averages: for invoke rounds (1&2) and for query rounds (1&2)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 13:01:14 GMT):<br/>
@jarvis26 The [Fabric CCP adapter](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Ccp_Configuration.html#orderers) can be easily configured to use multiple orderer nodes, and it even performs [automatic load balancing](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Ccp_Configuration.html#configuring-the-adapter) between them (`loadBalancing` attribute)

<p><strong>houqinghui</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 02:17:33 GMT):<br/>
@AYUSHIAGARWAL You can use Caliper to test your own blockchain network. You can set the property to `true`` to skip the network up https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/0f4d4026cbe8f1fc06c0eddb0796ccf37d83a10b/packages/caliper-core/lib/config/default.yaml#L5, set this property to `true` to skip the channel creation https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/0f4d4026cbe8f1fc06c0eddb0796ccf37d83a10b/packages/caliper-application/network/fabric-v1.4/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.json#L53

Hello, Does anyone know what does number 10 represent in the fabric-CCP query?
        return bc.bcObj.querySmartContract(contx, 'simple', 'v0', args, 10);

Hello guys. I am using fabric-ccp adapter. It is now allowing me to use the same chaincode id for different channels( I have 5 channels with same chaincode instantiated). Is there a way around this?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 08:26:55 GMT):<br/>
hi, a little confused here - that is an aspect of Fabric .. channels are completely isolated and so it is possible to do exactly that. It will only prevent the same ID/version of chaincode being instantiated in the same channel. Are you wanting to install/instantiate different chaincode (or same chaincode on diff ID) on different channels?
</p>
<p><strong>RonaldReagan</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 09:03:31 GMT):<br/>
The channels are already created, chaincode installed on all peers, and instantiated in all channels- the same chaincode. While defining multichannel in caliper network ccp , it doesn't allow same chaincode id. for different channels. 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 09:08:27 GMT):<br/>
ah, righto - understand the question now
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 09:27:27 GMT):<br/>
So is the desire to interact with (the same) chaincode on different channels during a single benchmark run?
</p>
<p><strong>RonaldReagan</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 09:42:09 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 10:13:36 GMT):<br/>
@RonaldReagan What does the error say? Here's the thing: The CC ids must be unique only inside a channel, true. But there's a `contractID` attribute for each CC, that must be unique on a network level, and you use this contract ID to reference your (channel,CC) target from the user callback. Now, if you don't set this contractID, then it will inherit the CC ID, and at this point it won't be unique.
Look at the chaincodes subsection in the doc: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Ccp_Configuration.html#channels
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 10:14:18 GMT):<br/>
But you're right, the docs and the error message should clarify this when the contract ID is "inherited"

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 27 May 2019 11:41:58 GMT):<br/>
@jarvis26 You just have to define multiple channels in the network configuration file, and Caliper will create them:

Hi, I am facing problems when creating a new test-case in javascript (to test another chaincode).

@julient yep, the `acc` argument you pass is undefined. Also, if `random` returns 1 (could happen), then you over-index your array. AlsoAlso, try using the Fabric CCP adapter, it's query API is much better

Hi, 
I need help in below points for testing the performance of hyperledger fabric network deployed on Kubernetes (Single cluster) -
1. which way is better - running from local by configuring the endpoints of peers and orderers OR installing caliper in same cluster and then run ?
2. how caliper test the resources monitor in case of K8s , do the below config works there , in my opinion it will not in either case (running from local or from K8s).
   monitor:
  type:
  - docker
  - process
  docker:
    name:
    - all
  process:
  - command: node
    arguments: local-client.js
    multiOutput: avg
  interval: 1
     
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 11:23:38 GMT):<br/>
@raj_shekhar I think Caliper can't access nodes deployed in a K8s cluster. @RobertDiebels has done some work in this area, maybe he can provide some tips about the Caliper + K8s combo

@raj_shekhar I forked caliper https://github.com/blockchain-partitioning/x-caliper to achieve running it in Kubernetes.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 12:54:59 GMT):<br/>
It runs as an ExpressJS server and takes commands via HTTP. I haven't documented most of the changes I made because I didn't have the time when I was making the changes.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 12:57:12 GMT):<br/>
It requires a DaemonSet to run on all the nodes that run peers/orderers. The DaemonSet runs a container that exposes the docker unix-socket via HTTP.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 13:00:29 GMT):<br/>

It's a set of objects that runs Fabric 1.2 + my caliper fork in a single k82 cluster. Note: Fabric 1.2 doesn't properly function in a K8s cluster. Chaincodes aren't registered in k8s and there are some DNS issues as well.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 13:04:43 GMT):<br/>
To resolve that I add the k8s-dns IP in the Fabric environment variables. This means that if you're going to try and runs this you will have to change the IP to your k8s cluster dns IP. Furthermore, I ran this in GCE only. I don't know if it will function properly somewhere else.

Also, I created a tool called Kubechain. It's in the NPM registry and you can use it to deploy Fabric and Caliper to a k8s cluster. https://www.npmjs.com/package/kubechain
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 13:15:35 GMT):<br/>
You can also call Kubechain programmatically which I do here: https://github.com/blockchain-partitioning/experimentation/blob/master/src/main/orchestration/create-k8s-objects.js
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 13:17:24 GMT):<br/>
I would have preferred to use Helm at some point though I had to work around Fabrics limitations and doing so programmatically saved me a bunch of time.

We want to test our own platform that is similar to Fabric. We only change cryptography algorithms. Which tool can we use to test? Is caliper ok?

@JeffreyDing What do you mean your platform is similar to Fabric?   If the different part is just cryptography algorithms, but the tracsaction flow is same, you can try Caliper to  test your platrorm.

@JeffreyDing If by similarity you mean that the Fabric SDK is able to communicate with it, then you can use Caliper. Otherwise you have to write your own adapter for your platform
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 08:40:22 GMT):<br/>
1. The fork I created has some extra features that I used to get it up and running in k8s properly. For one it has a filter on image-names. K8s creates a bunch of similarly named containers for each peer-deployment. Since my configuration uses dockers-unix socket on each node Caliper needs to filter the image names. Otherwise it will catch a lot of bloat from other containers.
2. I'm not sure whether or not you need to make any adjustments to caliper in order for this to work. I only ran Caliper from inside the same cluster as Fabric and using brand new clusters. Hypothetically it should work since it's just a url change. So long as each node exposes the docker unix-socket threw HTTP you should be good to go. Note: That exposing your docker unix-socket is generally considered a big no-no. The reason I did it anyway was exactly because I ran on brand-new throw-away clusters.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 21:15:47 GMT):<br/>
@nimaafraz Yes, you only need to change the endpoint addresses (and make sure that those endpoints are accessible from outside of course). 
Regarding the timeout: it looks like that the endorsement part of the instantiation run successfully, and the timeout occurred while waiting for committing the instantiate transaction.
1) You can increase this Caliper-side timeout through the [chaincodeinstantiateevent](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-core/lib/config/default.yaml#L60) runtime setting. You can change it in [multiple ways](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Runtime_Configuration.html).
2) Just in case, check the peer logs. If you don't see any errors then the chaincode was instantiated, and 1) should be enough to continue the benchmark.

Hello @klenik . How powerful(spec) should the caliper client machine be in order to get 2000tps?  Asuming that the peer nodes have good specs already. 
</p>
<p><strong>RonaldReagan</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 10:33:52 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for your reply. I am gonna get another machine. Although my current machine has same spec as  the one above. With 30clients @50tps I usually get 37tps throughput for 37tps send rate for a query. Doesn't look bad. Just that the send rate and through put cant go beyond 700tps.  Looks like some setting I need to tweak, just don't what yet. I tried increasing the number of transactions, but nothing.

@RonaldReagan Caliper currently uses nodeJS based clients ... which means that they are CPU bound until we are able to dockerize the clients (we intend to do this). Your current options are:
- use the fastest clock speed possible (number of cores will not help you here)
- use zookeeper clients on multiple machines that are on the same network
We have not put together a sizing table that enables the attainment of a specific TPS for all the provided samples (yet)

Note: spawning more clients is intended to overcome the single-threaded nature of NodeJs. My experience is that a single client should be able to handle 50 TPS easily (and with good scheduling precision). So scale out with the number of clients spawned to reach 2k TPS

Hi @

@houqinghui @klenik .. The hyperlink to definitions of performance indicators from caliper's getting started page (https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/1_Getting_Started.html) is dysfunctional - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/pswg/performance-and-scale-wg Could you please help me with an understanding of how the performance indicators - success rate, Transaction/Read throughput, Transaction/Read latency(minimum, maximum, average, percentile), Resource consumption (CPU, Memory, Network IO,…) are calculated?

Hi, @klenik , I upgraded my caliper client machine( 32vCore@2.7GHz, 128GB RAM, 1T HDD ). Upgraded to latest caliper version. Run the test again and can only get 50tps throughput for 30clients @50tps send rate. I tried other options, but I am getting the same. My goal is to get 1500tps for a query workload. Does it mean  I have to multiply number of clients by the throughput?

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 08:11:50 GMT):<br/>
@RonaldReagan what does your test config file looks like? I'm interested mainly in the clients and rate controller sections 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 08:15:11 GMT):<br/>
You have to specify the 1500tps for the rate controller, and it'll be distributed among the clients (assuming you're using the fixed rate controller) 
</p>
<p><strong>RonaldReagan</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 08:32:59 GMT):<br/>
It looks like so:

clients:
   type : local

@RonaldReagan Try to increase the txNumber, or use duration-based testing (30s for example). Right now your test is too short to be representative (or accurate)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 10:45:59 GMT):<br/>
My home setup: single VM with 4 vCPU and 8GB memory, SSD; running Caliper AND the 1.4.1 Raft example network (lot of containers for one VM...).
My test config for the `simple` benchmark:
```
rounds:
  - label: open
    description: Test description for the opening of an account through the deployed chaincode
    txNumber:
    - 1000
    rateControl:
    - type: fixed-rate
      opts:
        tps: 100
    arguments:
      money: 10000
    callback: benchmark/simple/open.js
  - label: query
    description: Test description for the query performance of the deployed chaincode
    txNumber:
    - 10000
    rateControl:
    - type: fixed-rate
      opts:
        tps: 1000
    callback: benchmark/simple/query.js
```
My report table (single VM => bad throughput of course), expected send rates should be 100, 1000 and 50 TPS:

The query round (or even before) overloaded my VM, so that's why there's a lot of failure. But even with such a "weak" single VM setup, I could reach a ~500TPS send rate for queries.

I'm in the middle of an experiment, I'll try to turn up the send rate above a 1k TPS

@icarrascol  If you need to access the Docker daemon remotely, you need to explicitly enable remote access. Beware that the default setup provides unencrypted and unauthenticated direct access to the Docker daemon. For details, refer to the official [Docker documentation](https://success.docker.com/article/how-do-i-enable-the-remote-api-for-dockerd).

When I set up my test with txNumber = 5000, localClients = 5 and tps = 5, then the 5 local clients send 5 transactions per second in parallel and concurrently?

Thanks in advance :)
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:12:42 GMT):<br/>
Hi, the TPS is always measured at the "blockchain implementation" side - so if you specify localClients=5 and tps=5, then the clients will issue transactions at 1tps ... which is cumulatively 5TPS at the target side .... does that answer your question?
</p>
<p><strong>JulianSolarte</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:15:56 GMT):<br/>
and each client will send one transaction??
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:17:04 GMT):<br/>
if you specify X transactions, then assuming Y clients, each client will send X/Y transactions
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:17:29 GMT):<br/>
(i really should use the thread feature of Rocket chat :joy: )
</p>
<p><strong>JulianSolarte</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:20:56 GMT):<br/>
I understand it but the transactions will be sent in parallel? Suppose we have 500 transactions, and 5 clients and 50tps, so in the first second each client will send 10 transaction in order to complete 50 transaction per second?
</p>
<p><strong>JulianSolarte</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:24:49 GMT):<br/>
Or does clients send transactions in disorder? In the first second one client could send 50 transactions and the other 4 clients 0 transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:26:14 GMT):<br/>
ah, right ... I'm with you ... the clients will send the transactions in parallel 
</p>
<p><strong>JulianSolarte</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:28:13 GMT):<br/>
Thankssss....What about my first question *"I would like to send transactions with time intervals, for example I want to send 500 transactions but send one by one with a 30 seconds interval period. How can I do this using RateControllers in Hyperledger Caliper?"*
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 08:31:22 GMT):<br/>
I would use the fixed rate controller, with the tx number and tps set accordingly. With that slow rate, a single client would be suitable
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 09:45:10 GMT):<br/>

Command used for benchmarking
caliper benchmark run -w ./packages/caliper-samples -c benchmark/simple/config-sawtooth.yaml -n network/sawtooth/simplenetwork/sawtooth.json
It's not able to start simple-tp-python, what can I do?

those are blockchain technology specific, so would be modified within the docker config files under caliper-samples/network/sawtooth. To see the items that can be modified, you will need to check out the sawtooth docs

<p><strong>patelkishan</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 06:02:33 GMT):<br/>
While testing sawtooth with smallbank workload and total transactions =200, it says "There is no block with the id specified in the blockchain." and "Block not found". Out of 200 submitted, 180 are successful and 20 remain unfinished and then failed. Why is this happening?

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 08:33:03 GMT):<br/>
@icarrascol Yes, a sample raft-based network is available in the Caliper samples directory which you can customize if you want
https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/master/packages/caliper-samples/network/fabric-v1.4.1/raft
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 08:34:38 GMT):<br/>
@PB4 Yes, Caliper can adapt to almost to any Fabric network, you just have to put together the corresponding Caliper-side network configuration file. If you run into any limitations, let me know
https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Ccp_Configuration.html
</p>
<p><strong>PB4</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 08:39:22 GMT):<br/>
@klenik Ok, thanks. I would share the results with you, once I'm done.
</p>
<p><strong>patelkishan</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 11:14:43 GMT):<br/>
Can someone explain me how transactions are sent and how performance parameters  are evaluated in caliper? The PSWG link given on Getting Started page is broken.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 11:23:17 GMT):<br/>
@patelkishan A report like [this](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/2_Architecture.html#master) is generated based on the start and finish time of every transaction/query. These transactions are initiated by the [user test module](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/2_Architecture.html#user-defined-test-module), when the [rate controller](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Rate_Controllers.html) grants them execution control. These are common for all platform, so the reported metric types are platform-independent. 
The PSWG whitepaper: https://www.hyperledger.org/resources/publications/blockchain-performance-metrics
</p>
<p><strong>patelkishan</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 11:59:54 GMT):<br/>
As per the implementation, will there be any performance advantage if I send multiple transactions in a batch(txnPerBatch=20) as compared to single transaction per batch(txnPerBatch=1)?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 12:36:18 GMT):<br/>
@patelkishan Well, batching things usually comes with some increased performance, but I can't say for sure. That's the purpose of Caliper, to measure it objectively :)
</p>
<p><strong>patelkishan</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 12:39:20 GMT):<br/>
@klenik  So you mean that if my throughput is increasing by sending multiple transactions in a batch then this is a characteristic of the platform being used and not that of Caliper?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 12:44:40 GMT):<br/>
@patelkishan Yes. Sawtooth natively supports transaction batches from the client side and dependencies between them. I guess it depends on the actual use case and nature of transactions. (Fabric doesn't support sending transaction batches from a client to a peer, they'll be sent one by one, even though the Caliper-Fabric adapter provides "batches" for convenience)

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 26 Jun 2019 08:09:47 GMT):<br/>
@PB4 if the official sdk is still compatible with your custom fabric, then just point caliper to the endpoints of your deployed network. If you broke the API, then you'll have to write your own adapter for your new platform 
</p>
<p><strong>PB4</strong> (Wed, 26 Jun 2019 08:25:07 GMT):<br/>
@klenik these configurations that i changed do not require any changes in the interface of fabric, so I think it should not be a problem.

We'll need more information I'm afraid as there are so many variables - what were u doing, what is unexpected? What is the system topology, what is the transaction being run, what is the technology being tested ...

Local clients
Single VM hosting all the containers
The Red cells are unexpected I guess. I would expect higher max latency for higher send rate but the red cell in the center 0.18 is an exception.

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Sat, 29 Jun 2019 06:00:19 GMT):<br/>
A few more qs: what chaincode language and is it a sample caliper test? If not a sample test, what (in generic terms) does the test function make the chaincode do? (ie read/write to the world state etc). In general the center red cell is certainly strange, I would be curious on the repeatability of that. The RHS set looks like you have reached the limits of the VM (especially if hosting 3orgs) You would expect the TPS to reach a threshold number once the maximum throughput is reached, but with the network being flooded with requests and becoming overloaded, the behaviour is always "strange". This is even more so if you are using node chaincode that can easily become CPU bound, and having an impact on all current transactions

Every block contains only one batch(50txns/batch), even when increasing block_publish_time. What can be the possible reason?

Caliper hooks into the Docker stats APIs to obtain that information via the node `dockerode` module.

Thanks for your response, I repeated the test multiple times and I still get the same results (the strange red box). I am using a node chaincode which runs an auction transaction. I do understand your point with reaching the threshold of the VM but my cloud monitoring is not showing any sign of saturation (it's using 60% of the CPU at most).
Something even more strange happening now. I run the same experiment with 200 TPS send rate in 4 different hardware setting and it seems that the CPU usage in Higher spec VM is higher Than the lower spec VMs.

Start zooservice in server then: 1. in the caliper/benchmark/simple/config-zookeeper.yaml, you should set the same ip of the server. 2. npm run startclient -- ip:port, this ip should be the same ip of the server. 3. You should run the caliper test in the server machine.

hello everyone , i need some help regarding use of hyperledger caliper
I am wondering does hyperledger caliper supports dynamic arguments to be passed while writing benchmark files.
for ex: While benchmarking transfer function of chaincode for 1000 transactions ,can i pass 1000 different arguments in function
of all my transactions can be tested with a static argument defined in configuration file.

@marinkovicvlado You can use the Fabric-CCP adapter so configure mutual TLS. 
1. On Caliper side, you assemble your network configuration similarly to the server-side TLS scenario, plus you set the `mutual-tls` attribute to true: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Ccp_Configuration.html#mutual-tls
2. You also have to configure the Fabric side to use mutual TLS. Refer to the Fabric docs, or see this Caliper sample: 
    a) Fabric setup: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-samples/network/fabric-v1.1/2org1peergoleveldb/docker-compose-mutual-tls.yaml
    b) Network config: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-samples/network/fabric-v1.1/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-ccp-node-mutual-tls.yaml 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 09:14:12 GMT):<br/>
@bamboo The Burrow support is still experimental, but take a look at the provided example network: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/master/packages/caliper-samples/network/burrow/simple
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 09:16:21 GMT):<br/>
@jeetabhi15 The steps to run a Caliper benchmark is platform independent: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/1_Getting_Started.html
You need to pass a [test configuration file](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/2_Architecture.html#configuration-file) and a network configuration file, [for Fabric](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Ccp_Configuration.html), in your case
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 09:24:55 GMT):<br/>
@patelkishan The send rate tells you how many TXs were sent to the SUT by Caliper per second (in average). Normally, it is the rate you specify in your config file. But the actual rate can vary (could be less if the clients can maintain that sending speed). As for the TX/batch/block question: the Smallbank workload can do multiple things, and the sample config is put together so that first it creates some accounts, then maybe moves some amount between them, etc. So take a look at the contents of the transactions, maybe this behavior is expected based on the config file.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 09:26:18 GMT):<br/>
@harsh-98 Currently, you need to clone the repo and install the Caliper packages locally. We're working on publishing npm packages, and then you won't need to go the github repo. 
https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/1_Getting_Started.html
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 09:27:25 GMT):<br/>
@harsh-98 What is the exact test you run?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 09:31:15 GMT):<br/>
@himanshuchawla009 The arguments in the benchmark configuration file are usually used to define behaviors/parameters for the entire test round. However, you can do anything in your `run` callback. When you make the `invokeSmartContract` call, you can assemble the call parameters in any way you like. You could even get the amount to transfer from a remote webservice :) (but don't do that, it'll hurt the send rate)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 09:35:26 GMT):<br/>
@RahulPatil2 I wouldn't recommend installing caliper as `root`, it can cause unforeseen problems. Caliper can run perfectly under a non-root user, and installing packages is less error-prone that way. The other possible source of the error is your NodeJs version. 9.x should work, but if the non-root solution doesn't solve your problem, try using NodeJs 8.x LTS

@jeetabhi15 Looks like you can't publish the same package with the same version again. Try modifying this line:
https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/27ec5f94e70a4cb3856f2b1dfd26b3e2f95b087f/packages/caliper-tests-integration/scripts/npm_serve.js#L80

Add the `--force` flag inside the command, e.g.: 
```
await invokeCmd(`npm publish --registry http://localhost:4873 --force ../${p}`);
```

Let me know if this solves the problem.

@nimaafraz Caliper only reports aggregated stats. But you can acquire the individual TX details in your callback module

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 11:00:13 GMT):<br/>
@casm3 The network examples contain a `generate.sh` script, just run that after modifying the configs. It only affects the runtime artifacts, so you don't need to republish the packages.
For example, for the 1.4.0. Fabric network:
https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/master/packages/caliper-samples/network/fabric-v1.4/config
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 11:01:59 GMT):<br/>
@himanshuchawla009 Your Fabric network is overloaded, thus the connection issues. I'm guessing you're running the test in a single machine. For a proper performance evaluation, you need to distribute your Fabric network on multiple machines (just like a production setup)
</p>
<p><strong>casm3</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 11:12:13 GMT):<br/>
It works! Thank you once again.

Sry to boter you guys once again, but does anyone know where is located the local-client.js file? And why is the txUpdateTime limited to 1000? I was thinking that the obtained failures were the result of the Batch Timeout, but after updated it I still get some failures even with a send rate of 100tps. 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:13:57 GMT):<br/>
@casm3 No problem, that's the purpose of the channel :) 
`txUpdateTime` is the console update interval, so it's purely progress reporting. It's default value is 1000, which means 1s. You can override it in multiple ways, as discussed in the runtime config doc page: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Runtime_Configuration.html
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:14:57 GMT):<br/>
@casm3 What kind of errors do you get? 100 TPS might be a lot, if you run the entire Fabric network on a single machine (and it's not a strong server).
</p>
<p><strong>casm3</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:19:29 GMT):<br/>
actually it is not an error, but a set of transaction that fail, and I don't know why it happens. 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:20:30 GMT):<br/>
If a transaction is marked as failed, then some kind of error message should be displayed on the console about the reason

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 09:35:16 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, yes, it looks like the Composer adapter doesn't provide an error message. You can log the error at [this line](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/fdff118805047eddf73422725420a976ec69d92f/packages/caliper-composer/lib/composer.js#L160) then reinstall/republish Caliper to see the changes

@casm3 If you don't need Composer, then definitely use the Fabric-CCP adapter. 
(The mentioned line can be extended with a logger.error(err) call, so you could see what's the reason for failure.)

The local publishing and installation of Caliper has been improved a bit in order to help debug issues many user are facing. 
See the new guideline for setting up Caliper until it's published on npm:

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 09:36:57 GMT):<br/>
That's not a straightforward question to answer. You'll have to monitor your resources to find the bottleneck, and upgrade your machines accordingly. It depends on many things, like your chaincode complexity, your Fabric policies (like endorsement), and general configuration of your network (ordering, gossip, channels, etc)

@snakejerusalem that's a problem with grpc not yet releasing for the latest LTS version of node ... you are (by the looks of it) on node 10.16 (the LTS version) but will need to drop down to 10.15 until the binaries are available for GRPC

So I am able to get chaincode transaction throughput but monitor for docker processes does not work I have provided the remote worker node url (http://host:2375), but I didn't get any resource monitoring statistics. Is this possible to get resource statistics for docker container running into kubernetes (pods->containers)? Quick response will be really appreciated.

<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:25:08 GMT):<br/>
I even created a clean installation of a nodejs 10.15.0 binary in another machine , still got the same issue. Should I checkout the repository at an older commit?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 06:29:58 GMT):<br/>
IBP is slightly different, we are looking into changing the Caliper base monitor, but to get yourself going faster I would strongly recommend that you connect the K8 service that you are using for IBP to Prometheus/Grafana - there are some really good samples/tutorials out there that are k8 specific

That should not be necessary - can you make the error available in pastebin again pls?

Hello, I'm experiencing the following: running the example test for fabric seems to work fine.  Running it for sawtooth gives the following error: `error: [sawtooth.js]: invokeSmartContract failed, Error: Unable to load batch builder for simple[1.0] at src/contract/sawtooth/simple/SimpleBatchBuilder.js::Cannot find module 'caliper-sawtooth'`  can someone provide a bit of guidance?

Hello everyone, I am trying to understand how to run a performance evaluation test on a deployed Hyperledger Composer network. I tried to read the related section on the documentation(https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Composer_Configuration.html) but I think that it's not it is not very clear for those approaching for the first time to Caliper. I cannot find a basic but complete step-by-step guide for running a simple test.

I also posted a question on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57142705/hyperledger-caliper-tutorial-for-composer-network

Any help would be appreciated

HI @RiccardoBonesi - are there any specific issues that you are facing? 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 10:26:07 GMT):<br/>
The general process is the same for all Caliper runs, the main difficulty is finding the required links between the differing config files

Hi Does anyone have documentation/tutorial for using caliper with fabric
</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 12:16:19 GMT):<br/>
In particular, after having followed the instruction in "Building caliper" and "Installing the Caliper cli" sections (https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/1_Getting_Started.html#building-caliper) I am trying to run a sample benchmark from "Run a sample benchmark" section.  I don't understand which file I need to target with the "-n" parameter. 
In particular, I am using the first-network sample from Hyperledger Fabric samples with a multi-org configurations and I tried to target the confitx.yaml file but I receive this error:  "Error: The configuration file [/home/riccardo/fabric-dev-servers/fabric-samples/first-network/configtx.yaml] is missing its "caliper.blockchain" attribute"
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 12:28:15 GMT):<br/>
ah, looks like you are targetting something from a non-caliper folder. You can start with the same composer benchmark we run in the regressions tests via `caliper benchmark run -c benchmark/composer/config.yaml -n network/fabric-v1.3/2org1peercouchdb/composer.json -w ../caliper-samples/`
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 12:29:42 GMT):<br/>
all the composer samples and their config files are in the `caliper/packages/caliper-samples/benchmark/composer/` folder
</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 12:31:56 GMT):<br/>
I still don't understand which files I have to define if I want to run a benchmark on my Composer business network
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 12:36:22 GMT):<br/>
you will need test files that interact with your business network (similar to the files in `caliper/packages/caliper-samples/benchmark/composer/composer-samples/`
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 12:36:33 GMT):<br/>
and specify those as callbacks in your config files
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 13:02:23 GMT):<br/>
the config files in caliper are not the same (but are similar) to those from the hyperledger samples
</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 14:11:02 GMT):<br/>
Ok thank you for your help :)
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 14:23:45 GMT):<br/>
Dear Caliper users - we are going though the final stages before publishing to npm. The most significant of these is the removal of the "old" fabric adapter, and the renaming of the fabric-ccp adapter to become the only fabric adapter for use when benchmarking Fabric. The first step has now been merged, and we will now be working on the renaming of fabric-ccp, before publishing modules to npm :tada:

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 14:25:35 GMT):<br/>
Note that if you relied heavily on the "old" adaptor, it is still available in the github history, though we will not be supporting it

Hi Everyone, I am new with this plateform. Please let me know, how i can measure the performance of our prototype which been built using Fabric with composer.  Please help me in this so i can check the performance of our network.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 08:28:52 GMT):<br/>
I'd recommend using the Composer adapter - start by deploying and investigating the current samples tested (within the samples), then look into deploying your BNA and writing targeted tests for it to drive the transactions of interest

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 09:13:50 GMT):<br/>
might be a compatibiltiy issue with the composer version and the newer target version of fabric 1.4?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 09:14:46 GMT):<br/>
worth checking the composer compatibilty on their pages, and then modify the composer version in the package if needed
</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 09:14:59 GMT):<br/>
I have composer v0.20.8

</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 09:15:58 GMT):<br/>
0.20.0 and above are compatible with the Fabric 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.3.0 and 1.4.x driver only
Source: https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/releases
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 09:16:59 GMT):<br/>
:thinking: should be compatible then
</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 09:30:26 GMT):<br/>
Maybe it's because Composer 0.20.x is not fully compatible with Hyperledger Fabic 1.4

Yeah, when I added the 1.4.1 examples, I wasn't sure about composer compatibility, so just focused on fabric 😁😅
</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Fri, 26 Jul 2019 10:16:57 GMT):<br/>
Running the same 3 orgs and 2 peers scripts with fabric-v1.3 works correctly so maybe there is just no compatibility with composer and fabric-v1.4
</p>

I try to get a bit of time today to look at the samples for the 1.4.1 bits - it shouldn't be a compatabiltiy issue, but there are some subtleties with the configs

If none of the containers is up, then channel creation is not the issue. Do you start your network in the composer.json file's start script?
</p>
<p><strong>KindleBitSoln</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 12:25:14 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 12:25:21 GMT):<br/>
Try the start command on its own, without Caliper: `docker-compose -f network/fabric-v1.1/2org1peercouchdb/docker-compose.yaml up -d`

Hmm, then it should also work when Caliper calls the start command :thinking:

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 12:40:23 GMT):<br/>
True, but issue seems to be that it can't connect to the orderer. If you start the network first (like above), and remove the start script from your network config file, and start Caliper, do you get the same error?
</p>

I think your orderer is not configured properly, since it can't find the genesis block.

Greetings. I am still having problems compiling caliper. I tried on multiple versions of ubuntu, never succeeding, even though I make sure to use nodejs 10.15. Here it is the log when I run `npm run bootstrap`: https://pastebin.com/FJ5tjvCe

That output was created on ubuntu 18.04, with nodejs 10.15.3, npm 6.4.1 (which was bundled with nodejs 10.15.3), with node-gyp v5.0.3 (installed using command `npm install -g node-gyp`, also npm 6.4.1). I made sure to install make, python and g++ with `apt install`.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:24:54 GMT):<br/>
@snakejerusalem Try switching to nodejs 8.16.0, as described here: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/issues/496#issuecomment-516601985

Hello, I am new to Hyperledger Caliper, I am working for a start up using Hyperledger fabric and I am trying to figure out how to implement a caliper to benchmark my existing fabric system. I tried doing some digging around on the web and I ended up here.  Are there any good references I should know to get started?

After following those alternative instructions, we are supposed to find/execute caliper-cli at `./caliper/packages/caliper-samples/node_modules/caliper-cli/caliper.js`, correct?

I am running everything inside an oracle virtual box, could this be causing issues w.r.t. virtualization? Docker worked fine when I tested it with the hello world.

I'm currently working on performance benchmarking using Hyperledger Caliper.
I have tried several samples but it seems that the structure of sample benchmarks are different from that of a business network made on Hyperledger Composer. Looks like model file and script file are all reproduced into one javascript file.
Could you tell me how to test my own business network made on Hyperledger Composer? Or, Should I reproduce my business network into one javascript file?
Thank you!

@ken1110 - the composer benchmarks use the sample composer business networks. The extra work you need to do is to write a separate test file that interacts with the deployed business network. https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Composer_Configuration.html should help

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=rtZFA4g8jHmhjNMcR) @snakejerusalem This error occurs when your user is not in the `docker` group. Make sure the hello world example also runs without `sudo`. You can easily find materials online that helps you using docker without sudo. The changes will require a relogin/restart to take effect.

the sample networks all seem to be designed to deploy containers locally. Are there any templates illustrating how deploy an actual distributed network? If not, am I expected to setup everything manually and then invoke caliper to benchmark the deployment?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:05:35 GMT):<br/>
@snakejerusalem Caliper doesn't support the deployment of the SUT. Spinning up a local network is just an example usage of the start/end script feature of caliper, and it's useful for testing your configurations and benchmark logic locally. For a real analysis, you'll benchmark a truly distributed setup, but starting the network is your responsibility, caliper will just connect to it.

1) in our integration tests we kick it with `caliper benchmark run -c benchmark/composer/config.yaml -n network/fabric-v1.3/2org1peercouchdb/composer.json -w ../caliper-samples/`
2) /caliper-samples/benchmark contain the test files, caliper-samples/src/contract are the files that compile into a BNA (we don't like holding binary files in caliper, as they are a pain to maintain)

If I already have a working network, do I need a yaml file or a json file?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 15:36:28 GMT):<br/>
@AaronEtheridge Yes, Caliper always need a benchmark config, and a network config file. The sample network config files contain an optional start script that starts a local network. If your network is already up and running, you don't need this start script.
</p>
<p><strong>AaronEtheridge</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 17:14:36 GMT):<br/>
the network config file in the client section,  ClientPrivateKeys path has a key.pem file at the end, when I try to locate a similar file in my already created network, there is no key.pem file, just a #HASH_sk file. What should I be putting in the client private key? 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 18:57:35 GMT):<br/>
Those two are the same, in the samples we just rename the hash-based names, so the network config files can remain the same

@klenik what folder do the benchmark config files and the network config files  need to be in , and how do I run them? Does caliper need to be inside of my working network folder or should I be placing the caliper folder somewhere else?
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 16:29:54 GMT):<br/>
Does anyone know if increasing the number of local Caliper clients affect the network performance of a Hyperledger fabric setup? I thought that the increase in clients only ment that the local desktop running Caliper would only fork the total amount of transactions between the selected number of clients. Can anyone confirm?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 16:34:24 GMT):<br/>
@AaronEtheridge When you run the CLI, you can set a workspace folder, and the other two config file paths (and every other relative path in the configs) will be resolved from the workspace folder.
https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/1_Getting_Started.html#run-a-sample-benchmark
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 16:37:50 GMT):<br/>
@HappyThoughts 
1) Yes, the transactions to send are distributed among the running clients, so your second point is correct.
2) What do you mean by affected network performance? Each client will instantiate its own Fabric adatper, and each Fabric adapter maintains, for example, event hub connections to the peers. So it might affect the network performance. Can you share some additional detail about your observations?
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 16:42:14 GMT):<br/>
Well, I am running a performance test on a blockchain. My results show that an increase in clients from 5, 10, and 20 in a send rate of 1000 TPS result in a higher failure rate and lower actual send rate, resulting in lower throughput. I initially thought that the increase of clients are simply a local issue, and is isolated from the blockchain network. This however indicates that the transactions fail before reaching the network, does this make sense? 
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 16:45:48 GMT):<br/>
I am running the blockchain and Caliper isolated from one another, and they connect remotely. Does this mean that each client process has its own connection to all of the peers in the network, or do they each get one peer that they connect to. Will for example each peer get 20 clients connected to them, or does each peer get an amount of the total number of clients selected. 
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 16:48:07 GMT):<br/>
@klenik I initially claimed that the number of clients wont affect the send rate, unless they spend to much resources on the local machine for a fair multiplexing. 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 16:54:01 GMT):<br/>
@HappyThoughts Currently, every Caliper clients has an eventhub connection to every peer. There's a development plan to make clients independently configurable, but we're not quite there yet. Which commit version of Caliper are you using? There was a PR recently that addressed the sending rate performance of clients, so event 2-3 clients should be able to generate 1k TPS. And Fabric peers should be able to handle this "many" client connections. What are the exact failures you get?
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:05:02 GMT):<br/>
@klenik Well most of the failures are TIMEOUTS, I am using a commit from 22 march, I removed the git files so I cant really find the commit version
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:07:26 GMT):<br/>
@klenik But in essence, using 20 clients causes an issue of keeping the send rate? Since you said that 2-3 clients can manage, but any more and the send rate declines?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:08:55 GMT):<br/>
@HappyThoughts March was a long time ago :) I'd suggest using the current version, we made some great updates, both to the code, and to the documentation :)
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:10:22 GMT):<br/>
@klenik yes it was a long time ago, but i am writing a thesis on Hyperledger fabric with Caliper, and i ran the tests back then with that version. I dont have time to upgrade and run new tests, so i need the environment to stay the same :sweat_smile: 
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:11:47 GMT):<br/>
@klenik I just cant find information on whether the increase of clients actually does impact the actual send rate the local host can manage, I would think not because that would mean that the scheduling of processes is the  issue.
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:13:49 GMT):<br/>
@klenik But if each client has a remote connection to the peers, the issue might be the network resources. 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:15:36 GMT):<br/>
@HappyThoughts Well, in the older version, I usually maximized a single client's send rate around 50 TPS, so for 1k TPS, I'd use 20 clients. Since the eventhub receives blocks, it shouldn't be much of an overhead. But I haven't done perf testing from this aspect. But yeah, a stable network and resources are needed if you want to handle 1k TPS. 
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:21:58 GMT):<br/>
@klenik Do you think that this may be an issue, but on a remote basis? https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/issues/43
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:27:59 GMT):<br/>
That issue was fixed by PR 50 in 2018, and I run those tests on remote networks. What is your network setup? (Let's continue the discussion in this thread, so it's easier to follow)
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:29:25 GMT):<br/>
I have 6 virtual machines running my blockchain network. 5 virtual machines for 5 peers, and one virtual machine for all of the Orderers, CAs and Kafka services,
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:30:51 GMT):<br/>
From another desktop, I run Caliper with different configuration files. Each file has the same number of transactions to run, the same number of rounds, and the same chaincode function. The only difference is the number of clients, which range from 5, 10 and 20 clients.
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:31:52 GMT):<br/>
Each of the test rounds run 1000 transactions in total, for 4 rounds. Each round has a target TPS from 25, 50, 100, and 1000
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:33:04 GMT):<br/>
The results for the 25, 50, and 100 TPS do not show any significant fluctuation in the actual send rate that Caliper achieves. However, when the 1000 TPS target round runs, the fluctuations are more significant when the number of clients increase
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:35:31 GMT):<br/>
What is the utilization of the peer VMs for 1000 TPS? If they're saturated, then it's possible that those extra few connections matter. How strong are the VMs?
</p>
<p><strong>HappyThoughts</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 17:41:18 GMT):<br/>
Each peer has 2vCPUs and 8GB RAM, running Ubuntu 16.04

hello, does caliper work like fabric-node-sdk when it tries to invoke the transactions, as in using the same packages and methods? 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:36:55 GMT):<br/>
@AaronEtheridge Looks like an orderer connection issue. This is usually caused by one of the following: the orderer is not ready to serve requests yet, or it didn't start successfully. Check the docker logs for that node. If you can't find any errors, then increase the sleep time at the end of the start script (giving the network more time to be ready). Also, you're running a lot of containers locally, and this number will increase when the chaincode is deployed, so don't expect high performance.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:37:43 GMT):<br/>
@ItaloCarrasco Yes, the Fabric adapter in Caliper uses the standard Fabric SDK methods (and the client connection profile feature for easy setup)
</p>
<p><strong>ItaloCarrasco</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:41:23 GMT):<br/>
@klenik  so should the throughput that shows caliper be the same (or near) if i test fabric sdk throughput?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:43:31 GMT):<br/>
@ItaloCarrasco We haven't done detailed performance testing of Caliper yet, but the extra layer of the Fabric adapter is very thin, the SDK functions run (or wait) most of the time during the life-cycle of a TX
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:45:49 GMT):<br/>
@ItaloCarrasco We tried to optimize the hot path for TX submission the best we could, you can check it here: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/1f8b76e3f4c675015c9c408641e115f4e067bc4c/packages/caliper-fabric/lib/fabric.js#L1765

@ItaloCarrasco the Fabric adaptor in Caliper can also use the node-sdk 'evaluate/submit transaction' methods, which are the recommended methods to use with the sdk when developing your own applications - details are in the docs

for each invoke they get the client the channel and then send the transaction, there is nothing else, they arent using fabric network api

<p><strong>AaronEtheridge</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 13:33:20 GMT):<br/>
@klenik If i might make a recommendation to the generate.sh function inside all of the samples files, you may want to add the --output=./crypto-config to the cryptogen step. Just so that it auto sets up everything in the correct folders, took me a while to realize the crypto materials were in the wrong spot

Hi again. I have successfully taken the 2orgs1peercouchdb sample network for fabric 1.4.1 and deployed it in a distributed environment. I have also succeeded in executing the smallbank benchmark with that deployment. Everything works fine if I use the configuration in `config.yaml`. However, if I use `config_linear.yaml`the vast majority of transactions submitted suffer a timeout at the peers. I have checked the logs from the peers and they seem to receive and commit new blocks just fine, so I assume these timeouts occur in caliper. Is there way to increase the value of the timeouts?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 13:56:55 GMT):<br/>
@AaronEtheridge I think that's the default value. Since it's a relative path, the location will still depend on where you execute the command from (your working directory). If you call the script from its folder, then there should be no problem. An alternative solution is to switch to the script directory from the script, so the path will be fix (feel free to raise an issue and pr for this :)) 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 13:58:21 GMT):<br/>
@snakejerusalem when you call invokeSmartContract from the user module, the last parameter is the client-side timeout in seconds. You can set that for every individual transaction 
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 14:07:15 GMT):<br/>
this is in `./packages/caliper-samples/benchmark/smallbank/smallbankOperations.js`, correct?

I have noticing something while fiddling with the configuration for the smallbank benchmark. If I increase the rate of transaction submission (or maintain the rate but increae the number of clients) the throughput drops significantly. Is this a race condition on caliper? Or does fabric 1.4.1 has some issue with heavy loads?

This seems to be a problem with the solo orderer. If I use another orderer the problem seems to be mitigated. However, I ocasionally get this error:

Hi again. I am trying to execute caliper CLI with distributed clients. However, caliper fails after it finishes installing the chaincode with this error:  `error: [caliper-flow]: Error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'unshift' of undefined`

I reckon it has something to do with the YAML configuration file. I edited it based on how it is described for a JSON file, like this:

```
test:
  name: smallbank
  description: This is smallbank benchmark for caliper
  clients:
    type: zookeeper
    zoo:
      server: s1:2181
      clientsperhost: 5

```
If this is not the correct way to place the parameters in the YAML file, how should it actually be?

<p><strong>AaronEtheridge</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 19:19:55 GMT):<br/>
@soumyanayak if you got to caliper/caliper-samples there will be a network folder and a benchmark folder. You will need a file from both of these and then run the two files with caliper benchmark run -c benchmark/simple/config.yaml -n network/fabric-v1.4/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.yaml -w ../caliper-samples/
</p>
<p><strong>AaronEtheridge</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 19:20:40 GMT):<br/>
@soumyanayak the best way to get caliper to work is to modify the files inside of the samples folder to match your network

Hi all - there are quite a few questions about targeting existing Fabric networks using Caliper. Essentially the network config file is an augmented connection profile, with information on all orgs etc to enable chaincode installation. If we consider "an existing fabric network" to be a network that is ready to issue transactions to via a client (ie chaincode is already installed/instantiated), then we can possibly make the connection far simpler for you by enabling the use of:
- a connection profile
- a file wallet
To connect and transact with the network. These items should be readily available to you all, or at the very least trivial to construct. We should also put together a tutorial to make required steps easy to follow.

Any thoughts/comments welcome!

It's nothing to do with nodeJS, because we have not published to npm yet, the global installation is performed by using an npm proxy called Verdccio where the packages are published to and then installed as if using npm. The error you are seeing is the result of those pacakges already being in the verdaccio storage folder when the script publishes to verdaccio. You need to follow the `cleanup` process to remove these before repeating the install

since it is timeouts you will have to increase the timeout value in Fabric, or (sorry for this one) get more resources within your cluster

someone, somewhere, decided to publish the caliper packages without our knowledge/consent ... so it will interfere with any of those scripts. You should be able to use the package that they published though - `npm install -g caliper-cli`

Well, the peers on both VMs can talk to the orderer on the other VM.

I recently read this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03421.pdf , where the authors benchmarked Quorum using the caliper tool. They claim to have made modifications to the tool to enable them conduct the research. Unfortunately, I am unable to find the source code. 

In addition to this, I noticed this PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/476/files which adds an application adapter to code based. I have clone the fork and try to run it to no avail. Has anyone either done this successfully or have pointers on it?

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 12:15:17 GMT):<br/>
u are probably updating the same item in your test - the read conflict is basically complaining that an entry in the state store was changed after the read but before the write of the current transaction

u are probably updating the same item in your test - the read conflict is basically complaining that an entry in the state store was changed after the read but before the write of the current transaction ... solution is to force the test section to work on a different item in the state store each time ... or at least loop around a large list of them
</p>
<p><strong>carlosalca</strong> (Sun, 25 Aug 2019 12:37:25 GMT):<br/>
I'm not updating the same item, in the logic I handle not to update the same item nor query an empty item
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 13:40:26 GMT):<br/>
@carlosalca Also make sure that your chaincode implementation doesn't modify the same key for every transaction. So the transaction inputs are only one part of the story/issue.

Hi, I want to run a benechmark based on my contract. When I run it it successfully instantiate two default samples, marbles and simple but when it comes to instituting my contracts I get the following error.   Error: Error: Invalid endorsement for mycontract@v0 in mychannel from peer0.org1.example.com: timeout expired while starting chaincode mycontract:v0 for transaction. My contract is based on "fabric-contract-api" and all the samples are based on fabric-shim. Is there any caliper example based on "fabric-contract-api"? I used the config.yaml file in the simple project and changed the callbacks. I also use default caliper network config networkconfig network/fabric-v1.4/2org1peercouchdb/fabric-node.yaml.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 07:38:51 GMT):<br/>
@Sara.r This behavior is typically (in my experiences) caused by a compilation error in your contract. Now the trick is, that you only receive the timeout error. And by that time, the peer destroyed the CC container... So when you see that Caliper started instantiating your chaincode, monitor one of the target peer logs (docker logs), and check the container list (docker ps) for CC containers, and also check their logs to catch the exact error
</p>
<p><strong>carlosalca</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 09:24:23 GMT):<br/>
I do make sure that I use different keys for each transaction. It may be the CouchDB is locked while writting a transaction and do not let write another different ?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 09:30:11 GMT):<br/>
@carlosalca I don't think so, the error code is clearly for read/write conflicts, which is a business level issue (raised by the peer). Can you share your related Caliper user module code, and the corresponding chaincode function as well?

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 11:03:35 GMT):<br/>
@carlosalca Which Caliper (commit) version are you using? The `fabric-ccp` adapter has been renamed to `fabric` when the old adapter was removed. However, I don't think this is the problem, and I can't see any other issue with your user module. Can you share the `create` function of your chaincode? That's the other part where you can introduce dependencies between transactions

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 11:20:55 GMT):<br/>
@carlosalca 
1) No problem, these things are sensitive content :) Look through every GetState and PutState in your function, just to make sure that you don't read keys that a previous transaction might have overwritten (proper data dependency is crucial for Fabric chaincodes).
2) Caliper is not semantically versioned yet, that's why I asked for the commit ID. If you execute `git log` in your repo, what's the top commit (and ID) you see?

@carlosalca Still had the ccp adapter at that point, so I suspect an issue with your chaincode function. That's my best guess at this point

Thanks! How can I update Caliper ? Is it enough with removing the repo ?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 11:56:38 GMT):<br/>
@carlosalca Yes, there haven't been breaking changes compared to that (just extra features). But I'd recommend removing that `fabric-ccp` condition check. It is only needed when targeting multiple platforms with the same user logic. And also check the docs for installing/bootstrapping Caliper, that part changed a bit.

Hello everyone, I am running some tests on Caliper but some transactions ends in "fail". Is there a way to understand why some transactions fails?
At the end of the execution the test summary says that all test are succeeded.

How caliper instantiate smart contracts? I use "peer chaincode instantiate .." command to instantiate my contract in fabric network but I couldnt find this command in caliper files. I am getting the following error while caliper tries to instantiate my contract.  SendProposal - timeout after 300000, and when I look into docker logs I see "error": "context finished before block retrieved: context canceled", "grpc.code": "Unknown", "grpc.call_duration": "676.055798ms"}

@klenik  Sorry to bother you again. I've tryed to update but I didn't get it, so I returned to the version I was using and changed the fabric-ccp condition check in the network configuration file. I changed from `fabric-ccp` to `fabric` but I got the same error as in the updated version:

info: [caliper-flow]: ####### Caliper Test #######
error: [caliper-flow]: Error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'network' of undefined

What I'm doing wrong ? Thanks for your help :)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 06:58:27 GMT):<br/>
For the older version, leave the check there, or just keep the ccp branch of the  if-structure (so your args will be ccp compatible). Is there any stack trace for this error? Did you specify a network configuration file?
</p>
<p><strong>carlosalca</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 07:56:17 GMT):<br/>
I did specify an example within the repo as the network configuration file. The stack trace is:

caliper uses the fabric-sdk-node to perform all operations
</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:59:45 GMT):<br/>
I tried to check the docker logs  of the peers but there are no informations about why some transactions fails

Hi all, I have a question : how can i use caliper to send proposal to 2 peers to utilize the ever peer's performance to improve the tps
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 07:01:19 GMT):<br/>
@klenik 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 09:08:52 GMT):<br/>
the fabric-adaptor for caliper should already load balance across all known peers
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 09:11:41 GMT):<br/>
i saw it, i know how to make it ,the adapter choose one peer of every org,so it may cause that 2 org both make proposal ,not one of the two org ,i will set the target peer in the callback js file.thanks

Hi all, I want to know how many tps can i fetch just use the local client
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 06:23:25 GMT):<br/>
I use intel i7 8 core just fetch 600tps, ths cpu up to 100%
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 06:24:00 GMT):<br/>
I saw caliper can fetch 10k tps in github ,so i want to know what type machine  it use
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 06:24:11 GMT):<br/>
no session established for client

I meet the same problem when i use zookeeper
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 06:29:05 GMT):<br/>
@TopJohn With a few local clients, you should be able to generate 10k TPS: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/issues/505
The zookeeper feature will be removed soon, so I wouldn't rely on that. It'll be replaced with an easier-to-use solution
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 06:54:03 GMT):<br/>
but it can't up to 10k tps
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 06:54:22 GMT):<br/>
the max send rate just 700
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 06:54:27 GMT):<br/>

Hi, is there any site where explain how to scale the Fabric network to improve the tps ?
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 07:58:35 GMT):<br/>
when will the new solution release to replace zookeeper
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 09:35:05 GMT):<br/>
@TopJohn The client send performance have been improved a few weeks ago, so the current version of Caliper should be able to handle it.
1) Which Caliper commit version are you using? 
2) Are you running your Fabric network on the same machine?
3) How complex is your user module? Are you doing some CPU-heavy stuff there?
(These can all contribute to low sending rates)
</p>
<p><strong>carlosalca</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 09:50:42 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand what is the user module, what is it ?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 10:13:48 GMT):<br/>
@carlosalca The user callback file that you write/use for a given round. We should really fix the terminology :sweat_smile: 
https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/2_Architecture.html#user-defined-test-module
</p>
<p><strong>carlosalca</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 10:18:18 GMT):<br/>
ah ok, I have use it many times :sweat_smile: 
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 11:46:33 GMT):<br/>
hi all , i found a problem, and @FlyingTiger say he gets the same conclusion that the send rate now just Less than 700 per send in  a 8 core machaine
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 12:16:36 GMT):<br/>
how many test clients?
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 14:15:14 GMT):<br/>
8 or 16

</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 14:15:24 GMT):<br/>
But the result is same
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 14:16:06 GMT):<br/>
The cpu’s every core is 100%
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 02:40:44 GMT):<br/>
i found there are too many connections to orderers and peers, maybe this is the reason
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 02:40:46 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 05:08:16 GMT):<br/>
does anyone use zookeeper type to make test successfully?
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 05:08:57 GMT):<br/>
when i use this approach , zookeeper always say ubable to read  additional data from client
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 05:12:18 GMT):<br/>
I don't know how to solve this problem
</p>
<p><strong>FlyingTiger</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 06:57:32 GMT):<br/>
Yes，I  got the similar conclusion,  send rate now just Less than 800 transactions per send in a 8 core machaine (8 test clients, benchmark/simple , network/fabric-v1.4/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.yaml).
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 08:08:38 GMT):<br/>
it's easy to up to 100% every core ,when i set the tps = 600
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 08:08:53 GMT):<br/>
if 500， about 80% every core
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 10:21:17 GMT):<br/>
@TopJohn @FlyingTiger after taking care 1-2 major updates (publishing, monitoring, reworking distributed clients), we will (or need to) do some profiling to reveal the bottlenecks. But there's no point in doing that now, since the code base will change considerably 
</p>
<p><strong>TopJohn</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 02:05:47 GMT):<br/>
But the bottleneck solved,may be the distributed client may not important

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 21:40:29 GMT):<br/>
@Sara.r Check the orderer logs to see if they started successfully. 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 08:22:52 GMT):<br/>
@Sara.r  - as suggested by klenik, it is probable that the service has not started, you can increase the 'sleep' in the config file start command to give it more time

Error : `error: [adapters/fabric]: The following errors occurred while querying mychannel information from Org1's peers: - Couldn't query mychannel information from peer0.org1.example.com: 14 UNAVAILABLE: TCP Read failed - Couldn't query mychannel information from peer1.org1.example.com: 14 UNAVAILABLE: TCP Read failederror.` Command used to run the test is : `npx caliper benchmark run --caliper-workspace ../caliper-samples --caliper-benchconfig benchmark/simple/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig network/fabric-v1.4/3org2peercouchdb/fabric-node.yaml`. Can anyone please suggest what can be the issue here. @klenik

<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 11:11:15 GMT):<br/>
Also after receiving the error, containers automatically gets stopped , so not able to check the logs for peer and other containers 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 11:19:48 GMT):<br/>
@HLFPOC The TCP Read errors indicate that the connection (and probably the containers too) was terminated. CouchDB is resource demanding, and you're running 6 instances, plus the other containers. Try a smaller example
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 11:23:28 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I have tried with a small sample as well (2 org 1 peer couch db), got the same error there also
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 11:24:38 GMT):<br/>
What is the specs of your machine? Check the resource utilizations when running the sample
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 12:06:52 GMT):<br/>
Issue was with memory of instance, by increasing it, I was able to resolve and run the test case. Thanks for your inputs :)

Hi all, I am new to Hyperledger and wonder if anyone know an easy tutorial to test and run a caliper test for a fabric network that I can look at?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 19:51:52 GMT):<br/>
@Xepp A good starting point is the Caliper install & usage docs: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Installing_Caliper.html
You will see some example usage based on Fabric. Find the referenced files in the repo. And if the Fabric network config is not clear from the example, then out its doc page: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Configuration.html

@Utsav_Solanki The 1.4.2 Fabric sdk release had a defect, so it's not available for binding. You can use 1.4.1 or 1.4.3

hi i have a fabric network and i want to install Caliper to test performance can anyone plz share with me a step by step guide to install Caliper an configure it in order to test benshmark my network ??? i didn't find the official documentation clear enought

<p><strong>AhmedBENROUHA</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 14:07:54 GMT):<br/>
hi thank you for your fast replay. i'm trying to follow the instraction to install Caliper so that i can run performance tests to my fabric network.
what i did for now is : 
1- creating a caliper-benchmarks directory 
2-npm init -y  
3-installing the cli with : npm install --only=prod @hyperledger/caliper-cli
4-bind it to fabric SDK : npx caliper bind --caliper-bind-sut fabric --caliper-bind-sdk 1.4.0

now and accordin to the documentation i need to Invoke the local CLI binary (using npx) with the appropriate parameters. 

</p>
<p><strong>AhmedBENROUHA</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 14:08:17 GMT):<br/>

The 4th command is the last step. For the API of `benchmark run`, see this section: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Installing_Caliper.html#the-benchmark-command
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 14:12:18 GMT):<br/>
The samples assume, that you cloned the `caliper-benchmarks` repo, which contains the required artifacts:
```
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks.git
cd caliper-benchmarks
```
This is the starting point of every example

ok thank you. one more question plz do i have to change something in the fabric network ??
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 14:14:32 GMT):<br/>
If you only run the samples in the benchmark repo, then no, they're already perfect :)
A tutorial for writing your own benchmark is on the way, until them you can get familiar with Caliper through the existing examples
</p>
<p><strong>AhmedBENROUHA</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 14:15:24 GMT):<br/>

Hi, when I increase the number of transactins in for the fabric network 1.4. 3org2peercouchdb a huge number of transactions failed due to this error -> error: [adapters/fabric]: Transaction[c24b5caba6] commit errors:
        - Commit timeout on peer0.org1.example.com. Where can I increase the timeout time? I changed it in config file but it did not work. 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 06:53:48 GMT):<br/>
@Sara.r The timeout can be set in multiple ways. The following are in order of precedence:
1) Set (in seconds) when invoking `invokeSmartContract` or `querySmartContract` in your user module: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/fabric-config/#the-run-callback
2) Set (in milliseconds) through the `caliper-fabric-timeout-invokeorquery` setting key from some source: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/runtime-config/
The examples all set it through 1), so you either need to remove that setting to use 2), or change it in the user module

@Utsav_Solanki GOPATH is set to the workspace by default, which is the desired setting for your example. The go chaincode paths are derived like this: GOPATH+path. So set the workspace to `~/caliper/packages/caliper-samples`, that way it will point to the correct path: ~/caliper/packages/caliper-samples/src/contract/fabric/marbles/go

@carlosalca Where do you mount your workspace? If you mount the `caliper-samples` host directory to the `/hyperledger/caliper/workspace` container directory, then the above path should exist
</p>
<p><strong>carlosalca</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 09:58:09 GMT):<br/>
I mount it here: 
        volumes:
          - ~/hyperledger/caliper-v.0.1.0/packages/caliper-samples/:/home/node/hyperledger/caliper/workspace

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 09:58:15 GMT):<br/>
@carlosalca Like here: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/installing-caliper/#starting-a-container
(The example is using the caliper-benchmarks repo, but the important thing is mounting the correct host dir to the container workspace)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 09:59:23 GMT):<br/>
`/home/node/hyperledger/caliper/workspace` => The workspace is wrong (this was the original path in the proof-of-concept image).
Correct: `- ~/hyperledger/caliper-v.0.1.0/packages/caliper-samples/:/hyperledger/caliper/workspace`
</p>

<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:17:07 GMT):<br/>
Hello @klenik , Can you please confirm if we can do concurrent transactions in Caliper on Hyperledger Fabric network? 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:17:46 GMT):<br/>
@HLFPOC Of course, otherwise it would be quite a useless load generator :)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:18:43 GMT):<br/>
The transactions are submitted sequentially within a client, but Caliper won't wait for a result before submitting the next transaction, so their executions are overlapped, i.e., concurrent
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:19:50 GMT):<br/>
Okay, so you mean to say, Caliper submits the transaction concurrently by default..right ?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:22:38 GMT):<br/>
If we only consider a single load generating client, then technically the TXs are *submitted* sequentially. So start_time(TX1) < start_time(TX2) < start_time(TX3) ...
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:23:41 GMT):<br/>
but there are only a few ms of difference usually, and a Fabric transaction takes 0,5-1-2 second usually, so in Fabric, the transactions are executed parallelly 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:24:06 GMT):<br/>
If you use multiple load generator processes, then even the submissions are parallel
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:25:16 GMT):<br/>
thanks for clarifying, any pointers on how to start multiple load generators ?

<p><strong>casm3</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 12:21:27 GMT):<br/>
Hey guys, how are you doing? I just want to know if Is there a way to measure or check transaction response time through the caliper or fabric log?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 13:24:45 GMT):<br/>
1) On one VM, you install and bind Caliper (it will install the necessary SDK too), and have the benchmark and network configuration files in your workspace (and other related artifacts, like user callback file, crypto, etc).
2) You can have your Fabric nodes at any other VM, you just have to provide the correct endpoints in the network config file of Caliper. And make sure the VMs can see eachother
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 13:26:01 GMT):<br/>
Caliper already reports these on the console and in the generated HTML report. What is your exact use case? As for Fabric, it also provides metrics. Check the Fabric docs and related forums (mailing list, #fabric )
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 13:28:07 GMT):<br/>
@lotty02cho The `wrong command format` error is returned by the chaincode. Probably the user callback modules submits the TX with wrong arguments. See the chaincode source for the correct API. As for the other error log, please provide the beginning of the log.
</p>
<p><strong>casm3</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 14:13:51 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. I want to know if when the server is overloaded the transactions are dropped for waiting too long in the queue, and the process of thrashing for a very large number of transactions. From Caliper HTML I only see the average, maximum and minimum latency, not the transaction response time.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 14:16:07 GMT):<br/>
In your callback module, the `invoke/querySmartContract` functions return an array of TxStats. You can log these yourself: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/fabric-config/#transaction-data-gathered-by-the-adapter
</p>
<p><strong>casm3</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 14:19:31 GMT):<br/>
So does the log store all this information for each submitted transaction or do I need to modify and redo all experiments?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 17 Sep 2019 14:20:51 GMT):<br/>
They are only aggregated currently. If you data about each Tx, you have to log those manually in your user callback. So you have to redo your tests. (With the upcoming observer feature, this will be provided out-of-the-box)

@klenik Nope, I haven't changed it, I remove docker container and change root directory. That's all.
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 08:52:56 GMT):<br/>
Should I check environment variable or path to run caliper?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 08:56:02 GMT):<br/>
I'll take a look at it now. Maybe the example has a bug
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 09:15:27 GMT):<br/>
Yep, it's a bug in the example. Modify this line: 
https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmarks/scenario/simple/open.js#L77
Change `fabric-ccp` to `fabric`
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 09:43:21 GMT):<br/>
@lotty02cho I've submitted a fix. Until it's merged, you can use my branch: https://github.com/aklenik/caliper-benchmarks/tree/fabric-ccp-fix

```
git clone https://github.com/aklenik/caliper-benchmarks.git && cd caliper-benchmarks && git checkout -b fabric-ccp-fix origin/fabric-ccp-fix
```
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 11:34:59 GMT):<br/>
@lotty02cho It's been merged, you can use the original repo again
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 00:10:58 GMT):<br/>
@klenik I always appreciate your help! I will let you know it works.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 05:24:16 GMT):<br/>
@lotty02cho that's expected. The workload logic is random, so txs in the same block try to modify the same keys in the world state. So that's an example limitation, not a "real error"

<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 14:06:49 GMT):<br/>
Has anyone tried caliper with Docker Swarm and do you think if it is doable?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 14:14:48 GMT):<br/>
@nimaafraz I don't see any issues with that. Caliper only needs the endpoints of the backend DLT network, which should be easy to access thanks to the swarm overlay network. So mount your benchmark artifacts into the Caliper container, and set the node/container endpoints in the adapter network configuration file. And let us know how it goes :)

Thanks @klenik, I was more thinking about replacing the Start Command in `fabric-ccp-go-tls.yaml` to `Docker Stack Deploy` using the same docker-compose files (with some changes). I am doing this as I was not able to get the raft sample working with orderers in separate hosts.
```
[36m2019-09-18 19:38:41.652 UTC [grpc] createTransport -> DEBU 2d1[0m grpc: addrConn.createTransport failed to connect to {orderer2.example.com:7050 0  <nil>}. Err :connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing dial tcp: lookup orderer2.example.com on 127.0.0.11:53: no such host". Reconnecting...
```
This happens while I am able to see the orderer2 port open from inside a peer on the other machine.

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 14:28:44 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, with distributed testing maybe the hardest part is wiring the network correctly. Unfortunately, there are some many scenarios or deployment platforms, that we can't cover them with how-to tutorials (yet). 
(You might not be able to ping the orderer ports due to the TLS settings, the connection will be refused.)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 14:29:34 GMT):<br/>
We'll try to write a general tutorial about distributed deployment benchmarking, but right now we're working on more lightweight tutorial, that focus more on Caliper than the deployment of DLTs :)
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 14:34:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I totally understand. Would there be any easy way to disable TLS in the Raft sample Farbic1.4.1?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 14:42:34 GMT):<br/>
I think TLS is mandatory for Raft: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/raft_configuration.html#configuration
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 18:42:51 GMT):<br/>
I finally got the raft sample working in two VMs using Docker Swarm. I will soon write a post about it.

Cool! If you'd submit it as a pull request into the caliper docs, we'd be grateful :P
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 18:52:20 GMT):<br/>
And we'd help with the technical stuff, of course

How to point to peer where already chaincode is installed and instantiated in caliper
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 07:57:49 GMT):<br/>
use that peer in the network configuration file, and use the flag `caliper-flow-only-test` when executing CLI command
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 08:06:33 GMT):<br/>
@SagarHundekar installed/instantiated chaincodes should be detected automatically by caliper. If that's not the case, then it is a bug :)

Hello everyone, I recently run some benchmark tests with Caliper and I noticed that the first peer node (e.g. peer0.org1) always consumes more CPU resources than the other nodes. Is there a reason why this happens?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 09:08:31 GMT):<br/>
@RiccardoBonesi What is your exact network topology? And how is Fabric deployed?
</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 09:11:13 GMT):<br/>
I have a 3 org 2 peers couchdb network
</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 09:11:47 GMT):<br/>
I used the composer example to deploy the network with fabric 1.3
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 10:41:36 GMT):<br/>
Only a single peer consumes more resources, or every "first" peer of every org?
</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:10:14 GMT):<br/>
Only a single peer. Maybe because it makes all the initialization (prepare the nodes, establish connection pipeline, etc) and this resource consumption is added to the actual test consumption

Hey all, Has anyone ever faced an issue to have their containers (peer, Orderer) restart in the middle of the benchmark? This is happening to me and while the containers restarting the TXs fail and also when they are back still they fail as the CA cannot enroll them
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 08:32:49 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=PicRxtKL9HdHZGrLf) Is it deployed on a single machine? Which example are you running?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 08:35:44 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=uYPXEHafivTqwr4AJ) Docker should have some logs about the reasons it shut down containers
</p>
<p><strong>RiccardoBonesi</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 11:45:27 GMT):<br/>
Yes it is deployed locally on my pc and I am running my code
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 12:15:09 GMT):<br/>
Even with composer, the peers should consume the same amount of resource if they get the same load. How many orgs and peers do you have? And where do you deploy your BNA?

Has anyone run fabric v1.4.3 in Caliper. Just looking for confirmation someone has done it. I expect since 1.4.1 has been verified , 1.4.3 would work, but don't want to chase down that rabbit-hole if someone has experienced problems with it

@DivyaAgrawal Check the orderer logs why the request was rejected. Caliper currently signs the channel TX with every Org admin, but not with the orderer admin.

<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 13:22:34 GMT):<br/>
@klenik Thanks, found the issue. The default generate.tx download v1.0.0 which apparently has this but, that doesn't set mod_policy appropriately..  Changing it to v1.0.1 solved it.

I realized this happens more when there are many TXs in the benchmark. It's quite random. Sometimes the benchmark runs with no problem sometimes gets errors.

Hi all, when you guys try to `npx caliper run ~~`, Have you met this following kind of issue? and if you know, let me know how you can fix it? is it related ca container? because I changed name of ca containers.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 15 Oct 2019 06:45:14 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, is there any previously built CC Docker images on the peer? That could interfere. Try removing them with `docker rmi $(docker images dev-* -q)`
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 04:43:09 GMT):<br/>
I try to remove images using `docker rmi $(docker images dev-* -q)`. but it has still same error :(
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 05:29:44 GMT):<br/>
Is this error related to fabric version 1.4.3? because when I saw document of caliper, caliper is based on 1.4.1.
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 05:31:34 GMT):<br/>
but I'm very confused, when I start to run caliper local ip, error doesn't show. but when I use cloud ip address, it will show out.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 06:04:16 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, maybe it's a chaincode registration issue. Try to set the "autodetect address" setting of the peer to true. 
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 06:11:56 GMT):<br/>
Do you know where I can set or refer to document about autodetect address?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 06:17:19 GMT):<br/>
The fabric repo has a sampleconfig/core.yaml file, that's the default peer config 
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 06:31:33 GMT):<br/>
you mean this? https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/59d4adce36d2ed1a8c22b1ea0de9f77879a9f53e/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L42 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 06:46:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes 
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 07:09:08 GMT):<br/>
I made my network based on `hyperledger/fabric-samples/first-network`, but I can't figure out where is autodetect address valuable. and one more thing I wanna ask. if I want to change this valuable, do I have to stop the network?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 07:11:59 GMT):<br/>
If you have a peer settings like `topproperty.subproperty.leafproperty`, then you can set it with an environment variable `CORE_TOPPROPERTY_SUBPROPERTY_LEAFPROPERTY`. And yes, I think you have to restart your peer to pick up the new setting (no need to stop the entire network)
</p>

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 08:40:03 GMT):<br/>
That's just an example name, to illustrate how you can set properties through environment variables :) 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 08:42:34 GMT):<br/>
So in your case, you need to set the CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT env variable to true 
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 08:44:46 GMT):<br/>
ah, I understand. So, I have a docker-compose.yaml file to set environment variable like below
```
  peer0.org2.honeybee.com:
    container_name: peer0.org2.honeybee.com
    extends:
      file: peer-base.yaml
      service: peer-base
    environment:
      - CORE_PEER_ID=peer0.org2.honeybee.com
      - CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org2.honeybee.com:7051
      - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT=peer0.org2.honeybee.com:7051
      - CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=org2MSP
      # Prometheus
      - CORE_OPERATIONS_TLS_ENABLED=false
      - CORE_OPERATIONS_LISTENADDRESS=:9443
      - CORE_METRICS_PROVIDER=prometheus
    volumes:
      - /var/run/:/host/var/run/
      - ../../artifacts/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.honeybee.com/peers/peer0.org2.honeybee.com/msp:/etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp
      - ../../artifacts/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.honeybee.com/peers/peer0.org2.honeybee.com/tls:/etc/hyperledger/fabric/tls
      - peer0.org2.honeybee.com:/var/hyperledger/production
    ports:
      - 7051:7051
      - 9443:9443
```
so If I want it to add autodetect address, can I just add environment here and restart peer container?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 08:47:07 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that should work. Try it with one peer first, then you could add the setting to the base yaml, then restart the other peers one by one 
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 08:51:47 GMT):<br/>
Okay. I entered peer container. and export `CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT=true`
</p>
<p><strong>lotty02cho</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 10:20:02 GMT):<br/>
I guess it doesn't work....:cry: 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 10:24:25 GMT):<br/>
You should find a more detailed error somewhere. My guess is that the chaincode container prints some error, but the container is destroyed after the error. So unless you have a log collector service, try to manually monitor the chaincode container during that brief time it exists

Questions about Caliper - Corda:

1) Team have installed the dependencies of caliper-core https://www.npmjs.com/package/caliper-core but they are not quite sure if this is the latest version or the right dependency  

2) Team wants to know if they are on right directions on this one:

"We currently are trying to do the installSmartContract method but we are having doubts if i will continue  working method on this since corda has its own contract coded contract)"

And actualy when they search on the caliper-core there are two results


They did use the caliper-core (without the @hyperledger... is that correct ?

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 12:42:35 GMT):<br/>
@AgniCampos 
1) No, the hyperledger one is the official. If you install the cli package, it'll install every other caliper package. Moreover, you might want to develop your adapter based on the master branch of the repo, that's the up2date 
2) I'm not sure if I understand the contract part.
3) let's continue this discussion in the #calipercaliper-contributors channel, it's easier to track the development stuff there

Hello, I'm trying to kick the tires with the ethereum support with HL Besu.  However I'm having difficulty getting it started.
* Is the ethereum module published to NPM or Docker yet?
* Does caliper build on macOS?  I keep getting a bunch of gyp error relating to keccak native code compilation.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 15:11:06 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon The Ethereum adapter will be included into the next release (coming in a few days). Caliper isn't tested on macOS or windows, but the Docker container should circumvent these kind of problems 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 20 Oct 2019 05:10:05 GMT):<br/>
Turns out the problem on mac is that grpc has an unreliable build on mac and the lerna invocation in this build script always causes the faiure.  If grpc is built with the build from source flag it works fine:
```
npm i && npm run repoclean -- --yes && npm install --build-from-source grpc@1.10.1 &&  npm run bootstrap
```
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sun, 20 Oct 2019 08:57:11 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon Yeah, grpc has different issues on different nodejs versions. The binding process takes these into account, and uses the needed compiler and flag overrides. But this doesn't apply to the bootstrap, so thanks for the workaround :) What is your environment (node version, npm, etc)? We should add your fix to the docs 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sun, 20 Oct 2019 22:29:48 GMT):<br/>
node 10.6.3 npm 6.9.0 Mac OS 10.14.6 xcode 11.1
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sun, 20 Oct 2019 22:34:53 GMT):<br/>
@nkl199 IIRC you also use mac. Encountered anything similar?

My expected outcome would be a linear increment in latency as the send rate increases but that does not seem to be the case here. Should I reconsider my assumption?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:01:13 GMT):<br/>
@nimaafraz Is that a Fabric benchmark?
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:05:45 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:06:57 GMT):<br/>
1.4.1, Raft, 5org, 1peer each, 5 Orderers
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:07:03 GMT):<br/>
My guess is that since the send rate is low, you trigger a different block cut mechanism of the ordering service. Instead of cutting a block after N TXs, the time-based cutting is triggered, a bit later
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:08:16 GMT):<br/>
But take a look at the Fabric metrics to figure out what causes this. Caliper just reports what it measures. Unfortunately, it can't do root-cause analysis. Yet :)
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:10:10 GMT):<br/>
Ok, Thanks. Just wanted to share and see if others also find this strange.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:10:54 GMT):<br/>
Things are only strange until you find a reasonable explanation for them :)

Got it running with besu - https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/616 
I needed to add support for raw transactions since Besu is not a wallet, just an ethereum node.

Hi
Is there official performance test on Hyperledger fabric v2.0 and v1.4.4 versions?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 07:27:02 GMT):<br/>
thanks - we'll look at the PR asap
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:16:25 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean by official? There are some papers about Fabric performance characteristics, plus you can find evaluations here: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper-benchmarks/
(not 1.4.4 or 2.0)
</p>
<p><strong>biligunb</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:49:51 GMT):<br/>
Hoping for something like

Perf test : #1
 - Fabric 1.4.4 using Caliper x.x
 - 4 peers 2 orgs etc...
 - fabtoken (invoke method)
 - batchsize 2mb, 500txs
 - max 3000TPS

etc... :D

@shemnon Left some comments on the PR
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 09:21:47 GMT):<br/>
Well, the caliper-benchmarks repo contains things like this. And you're welcome to perform your own experiments and submit the report and artifacts :grin: 
</p>
<p><strong>biligunb</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 09:38:37 GMT):<br/>
Seems there is only 1.4.0 version test benchmark.
Max TPS about 300~750?

I am conducting my own tests and have not been able to crack 2000TPS barrier yet.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 10:01:30 GMT):<br/>
Tps is just a number, and depends on a great number of thighs. With enough money/resources, you can probably crack it. That's why standard benchmarks define a $/TPS metric. But if your smart contract is poorly designed, then no amount of resources will help you 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 07:52:22 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon what are the rules for the nonce? I know it should be unique, but must it be strictly incremental (1,2,3,etc)?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 13:50:24 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=HbuiZQX6tmYIplp1D) @klenik 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 13:52:26 GMT):<br/>
strictly incremental.  It should really be called sequence number but the name nonce was well socialized before the decision it was a sequence  number was set.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 13:55:16 GMT):<br/>
Ah, then we need to associate a client with dedicated accounts 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 13:56:32 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking of using the private key seed to make hd wallet addresses.  Does each client get a client ID that is visibible ti the execution?

<p><strong>biligunb</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 01:43:55 GMT):<br/>
I understand that. So far I have been testing with the simple chaincode (generic-chaincode used in Canadian Waterloo Whitepaper)

And limiting the peers to AWS c5.4xlarge instances. (orderer ca etc... similar)

However i just couldnt find reliable research reports containing specs and performance metrics

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:41:31 GMT):<br/>
Look through the hyperledger blog entries, there are some real-life use cases. One of them mentions that the (Fabric) network served the required daily XY million transactions, and if you do some calculations, that was like ~550 TPS. They don't mention the specs though. What I'm trying to say is that maybe there aren't many absolute performance measurements, because it's not the most important aspect of the system.
But Fabric gives some logs and metrics for every TX life cycle phase, so you can dig into what's limiting your TPS

Hi, I run the sample command below on the tutorial of https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/composer-config/
`caliper benchmark run --caliper-workspace ./packages/caliper-samples --caliper-benchconfig benchmark/composer/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig network/fabric-v1.1/2org1peercouchdb/composer.json`

But, it output error like below.
Could anyone tell me how to fix it?
Thank you!

Hello everyone,  i am stuck in  100 tps in "open" so how can i make it reachs to 200 tps or more ? thank you for helping
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 15:44:43 GMT):<br/>
@DiAnh - there are quite a few answers to that depending on more elaboration to your question:
- what exactly are you testing (is this a sample or something you wrote)?
- which adaptor are you using?
- how many test clients are you using, and how are they driving the test?
- are you testing on a single machine, or do you have a distributed setup? If distributed, what is the relation to the clients and "server" aspects of the system (ie are they geographically distributed)?
- what is the spec of the test machine(s)?
- ...

Hello all, caliper is a really nice tool to easily test Fabric networks :) I'm writing a masters thesis that uses Fabric. I'm just wondering if there is a way to generate the report in a way that is more programmable. I want to make some graphs using e.g. Python so that I can get an overview how Fabric performs as you add more entities. Or do I have to scrape the results from the html-report?

Thanks! 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sat, 09 Nov 2019 15:37:11 GMT):<br/>
@dachrillz Glad that you like Caliper :) The reporting (content and structure) is kind of rigid right now. The maintainers are currently working to fix this issue (which requires a considerable refactoring of the core code-base). But not all is lost, since even now you can get details about every TX, and do your own aggregation and/or exporting. Check out this section of the Fabric adapter docs: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/fabric-config/#gathered-tx-data

I'm back with another issue :) I also want to evaluate how fabric performs under a varying amount of orderer. Everything worked fine for 1 and 2 orderer, but now that I added 4 orderers caliper produces:

[caliper] [caliper-flow] 	Error: Error: Couldn't create Channel 'mychannel': Orderer response indicated unsuccessful Channel 'mychannel' creation: SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE

Looking inside the orderer logs the following warnings are produced:

I do believe that I have proof-read the configuration files, so I think they are correct. Of course I could have messed something up somewhere, but the configuration is identical to when I ran with two orderers, except that I added the last two orderers.

Any thoughts what this could be? E.g. is it because the orderers don't have enough time to setup, or because I'm running it on a single machine?

Many thanks

Unavailable service can indicate that the orderers are not ready yet, which can be caused by the single machine setup (Fabric is a heavier distributed system). But you should look into the warnings as well (trying channel creation through the peer cli and consulting the #fabric channel)

I guess it just overrides the first one

<p><strong>dachrillz</strong> (Sun, 10 Nov 2019 20:02:16 GMT):<br/>
because the two last orderers worked fine

Hmm, strange behavior, I thought YAML parsers enforce unique keys. Oh well
</p>
<p><strong>dachrillz</strong> (Sun, 10 Nov 2019 20:03:53 GMT):<br/>
I'm just happy that I found it haha, but yeah it would probably be nice with some check that at least lets you know that you are overriding the same key in the same file.

Anyways, thank for your help

Also, the Fabric adapter docs page details everything you could possibly need for a network configuration, including an example at the end: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/fabric-config/#connection-profile-example

hello 
how to setup caliper on  kubernetes , is there any docs 
thanks 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 14:05:02 GMT):<br/>
@Preetam007 I don't know about such doc, but since Caliper has a Docker image, it shouldn't be hard. A good starting point is the install docs: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/installing-caliper/#using-the-docker-image

The docker-compose example shows how you can configure Caliper through env variables. That is very similar what you'd use in a swarm deployment (there is a tutorial about it somewhere I think), and the swarm concepts are kind of similar to k8s concepts (with a bit of a stretch) :)

What I'm saying, is that you shouldn't need anything special to run Caliper in k8s, just make sure that Caliper can see the SUT network endpoints

we pulled the image and created the pod successfully.Can you provide some documentation so that we can test the benchmark
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 18:10:29 GMT):<br/>
You have to specify the version explicitly, since we don't publish a "latest" image. So try hyperledger/caliper:0.2.0 
</p>
<p><strong>Preetam007</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 18:31:39 GMT):<br/>
we created kubernetes pod with caliper image successfully.But when we run the exec of the pod there is no option to run caliper.package.json does not contain any usefull script.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 18:50:59 GMT):<br/>
@Preetam007 Please read the above install doc carefully (from the beginning), it details the Caliper CLI, how to use it, and what is the default command in the image

Hey people, first of all congratulations, this tool is amazing. I come here because i'm trying to run a simple benchmark on ethereum. I've found the sample configuration files in the repo, so im trying to run the "simple" benchmarking. I also got the ethereum config files and changed the json configuration file to write my blockchain parameters.
I managed to get the tool running and it seems to connect to my blockchain, it is even creating contracts but when printing the results I have the following error:
`error [caliper] [caliper-flow] 	Error: Error: Table must define at least one row.

Is there any common mistake while configuring that leads to this error? I feel like i may be missing something.

@ulalaa14 @leopardo The short answer is: wherever you want :) Although the following approach is recommended (to have a "pretty" project):
1) Create a directory which will contain all your Caliper/benchmarking artifacts (e.g., `~/myProjectDir` ).

2) Save the benchmark and network (e.g., Ethereum) configuration file in that directory (`~/myProjectDir/benchconfig.yaml` and `~/myProjectDir/networkconfig.json`).

3) When you start the Caliper CLI (which is either installed locally or globally), you have to specify 3 crucial information, either via command line parameters, or environment variables (or additional configuration files, see the runtime config docs).

3-a) The workspace directory path. Through command line: `--caliper-workspace <PATH>`. Though env var: `CALIPER_WORKSPACE=<PATH>`. `<PATH>` can be either an absolute path (`~/myProjectDir`), or a relative path (`./myProjectDir`). A relative workspace path is resolved according to your *current working directory* (CWD) where you executed the Caliper CLI. At this point, Caliper knows the absolute path to your workspace directory.

3-b) The benchmark configuration file path. Through command line: `--caliper-benchconfig <PATH>`. Through env var: `CALIPER_BENCHCONFIG=<PATH>`. `<PATH>` can be either an absolute path (`~/myProjectDir/benchconfig.yaml`), or a relative path (`./benchconfig.yaml`). A relative benchmark config path is resolved according to your *workspace path*. 

3-c) The network (e.g., Ethereum) configuration file path. Through command line: `--caliper-networkconfig <PATH>`. Through env var: `CALIPER_NETWORKCONFIG=<PATH>`. `<PATH>` can be either an absolute path (`~/myProjectDir/networkconfig.json`), or a relative path (`./networkconfig.json`). A relative network config path is resolved according to your *workspace path*. 

To sum up: it's recommended to keep every artifact under you workspace directory, and refer to them with relative paths (relative to the workspace dir). This makes your project movable across machines.

3-b) The benchmark configuration file path. Through command line: `--caliper-benchconfig <PATH>`. Through env var: `CALIPER_BENCHCONFIG=<PATH>`. `<PATH>` can be either an absolute path (`~/myProjectDir/benchconfig.yaml`), or a relative path (`./benchconfig.yaml`). A relative benchmark config path is resolved according to your *workspace path*. 

3-c) The network (e.g., Ethereum) configuration file path. Through command line: `--caliper-networkconfig <PATH>`. Through env var: `CALIPER_NETWORKCONFIG=<PATH>`. `<PATH>` can be either an absolute path (`~/myProjectDir/networkconfig.json`), or a relative path (`./networkconfig.json`). A relative network config path is resolved according to your *workspace path*. 

To sum up: it's recommended to keep every artifact under you workspace directory, and refer to them with relative paths (relative to the workspace dir). This makes your project movable across machines.

Which config files did you use to start the benchmark? This error occurs when you want to generate a report, but you don't have the data for it (e.g., because monitoring is enabled, but it couldn't gather any metrics).

Thanks for your fast answer! So i'm using the simple benchmark file (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-samples/benchmark/simple/config.yaml) which i  didnt change and the ethereum JSON (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-samples/network/ethereum/1node/ethereum.json) in which i added my blockchain config. I have the feeling i have to change also the docker-compose.yaml from that folder but i dont understand completely how it works.

Hello again, I've still got an error while testing my blockchain:

@airela The peer closed the connection. Which could mean either it didn't start successfully, or it's not ready yet, or it's overloaded. Do you run the test on a single-machine network?

Then it's possible that the machine can't handle the number of nodes running on it. Start the `watch top` command in a separate terminal before starting the benchmark, it'll show you whether you exhaust your resources or not.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 06:51:25 GMT):<br/>
The Fabric CI test uses two channels, so this can be a good start: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/fabric_tests/phase4

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 07:16:46 GMT):<br/>
That looks like a Fabric-side permission issue. Check your configtx.yaml, or use Caliper's channel definition (see the docs) to create the channel
</p>
<p><strong>z5239604</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 07:22:55 GMT):<br/>
I have double checked a number of times. This because I don't have org4 in mychannel but the benchmark test try to run transactions  on it. If I add it to the channel then it works without an error. However in my use case I want channels to only have a subset of the peers.
</p>

<p><strong>z5239604</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:13:05 GMT):<br/>
Is there a way to target benchmark tests on a single channel within benchconfig.yaml?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:16:13 GMT):<br/>
Benchconfig is independent from your network. It just defines the rounds and related workload attributes (tx rate, user test module). Your network config has to contain the channel information, plus your user module must decide which channel to use to invoke the tx. 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:17:24 GMT):<br/>
The latter is achieved by giving every chaincode in the network config a unique contractID. That will automatically identify the channel of the chaincode, so in your user module you just reference the contractID
</p>
<p><strong>z5239604</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:20:41 GMT):<br/>
Oh ok, was using the same contractID in both channel. Let me change that and try it again. Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:24:40 GMT):<br/>
Note that id != contractID, the docs explains the difference. It shouldn't be possible to use a contactID twice. If you managed, then that's a bug in the validator :grin: 
</p>
<p><strong>z5239604</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:46:31 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 23:46:54 GMT):<br/>
Short answer: from the point of view of Caliper, that's irrelevant. If you give Caliper the correct endpoint address of the blockchain nodes (in the network configuration file), then Caliper will send requests to those endpoints. It's up to you to make sure that the different machines/services can reach each other.
Longer answer: see this post about such a scenario. But really, the only difference is that you set <IP/HostName>:<Port> addresses in the network config file instead of localhost:<Port>

I don't have it either, but this tutorial covers step-by-step what you need to do regarding the Caliper setup:

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 08:29:11 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the Caliper commands are universal, and the configuration is the same, except for the wallet part. But see the Fabric adapter docs for details

Is Anyone else getting `MVCC_READ_CONFLICT` error with the `Transfer`  transaction in the `Simple` benchmark? I do not get the error for tps=10 but for tps=20 and higher I get this error. I assume this happens in higher tps because at some point the value of the same key is being changed consecutively before the previous one being committed to the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 23:57:10 GMT):<br/>
@nimaafraz Yes, and that's expected at higher rates. Increasing the number of created assets might lower the error rate, but you probably can't circumvent it by design. This is the trade-off for the scalable execute-first consensus design.

Well, the core problem is that a TX reads a key at version X, and during its life-cycle that key is updated to version Y by an other TX. Whether you can circumvent this problem depends mainly on your business use case.
1. If you have financial-like logic, like the above transfer, then the more accounts you have in the ledger, the smaller the probability that two TXs would like to modify the same account/key in a short time window (which would cause a dependency between them, and probably MVCC conflict). This is the main motivation behind the execute-order-validate consensus style (and optimistic concurrency control in general). It scalable, and most of the time conflict free.
2. If your TX batch timeout (or other) setting is large(ish), then the life-cycle of a TX will be longer (longer time between reads during endorsement and reads during validation). Thus increasing the probability of MVCC conflicts. You can shorten the batch times, but that has a limit of course.
3. Sometimes you can circumvent conflicts by design, ensuring that they can never occur. A fine example for that is the high throughput chaincode example: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/v1.4.4/high-throughput

N.B.: The above points are based on my experience with Fabric, I don't have the measurements (yet) to support those hypotheses. So you should definitely do your own use case-specific experiments regarding the above points. 
</p>

You can increase the throughput by using a distributed setup.

Hi all this may be a stupid question :) but inorder to test the marbles or fabcar chaincode does the Blockchain network need to have it marbles chaincode installed or does caliper simulate the installation and instantiation ?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 11:24:00 GMT):<br/>
Both are viable approaches. Define the chaincodes in the network configuration, then Caliper can do the followings. It'll check whether that chaincode <id,version> instance is installed/instantiated on that channel. If it is, then Caliper will do nothing. If it's not deployed, then Caliper will deploy it. Refer to the Fabric adapter docs for more detail: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/fabric-config/

Hi @klenik,

I have a question in the channels section of the config.yaml file, specially in the created section.If the Blockchain network is already running and is operational before running the benchmark test, then I would make the value true for the created key right?
```yaml
channels:
  mychannel:
    configBinary: networks/fabric/config_solo_raft/mychannel.tx
 ->   created: true
    orderers:
    - orderer.example.com
    peers:

      peer0.org2.example.com:

<p><strong>alainN</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 22:55:34 GMT):<br/>
use the fully qualified name of the function e.g. 'contractName:functionName'

Hi! Does anyone knows what is the proper way to bind caliper with fabric? Have been following the commands according to the documentation but failed. I'm using MacOS
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:13:05 GMT):<br/>
what command are you using? (I'm on a mac and have no issues)

hallo hyperledger caliper team, i would like to ask about the benchmarking report from caliper. how u can determine value from summary table? because there might be rounds for each functions test. is it by averaging or else? thank you

Hello everyone! 
I'm experiencing some problems while using Caliper on my fabric network. I'm able to execute transactions on the network, so the configuration and certificates are valid and well configured, but when running tests I encounter this error:

*Handshake failed with fatal error SSL_ERROR_SSL: error:14094412:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:sslv3 alert bad certificate.*
* Couldn't query mychannel information from blockchain-org1peer1: Failed to connect before the deadline*

I've tried various configurations with the certificates, but being able to send transactions through my app I'm not sure is it Caliper or some bad configuration.
If someone has a guideline, please advice me. Thanks!

hi all i am try to connect  caliper with my own fabric network but did not any support please help @klenik 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 11:15:20 GMT):<br/>
are you trying to connect to run a "standard" caliper test, or a test using a gateway?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 11:16:18 GMT):<br/>
I think we're a little weak on documentation for connecting to bespoke networks - i assume you have looked at the benchmark samples for the sample networks that are used?
</p>
<p><strong>RahulEth</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 11:35:02 GMT):<br/>
@nk199 i want to configure cliper to test my own chaincode with my own network
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 11:38:06 GMT):<br/>
do you want caliper to stand the network up as well, or is it already existing?
</p>
<p><strong>RahulEth</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 11:52:41 GMT):<br/>
@nk199 my network already exist. please help if you any idea of setting it up
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 11:55:48 GMT):<br/>
in which case you will need to gather all the crypto material required by the clients to interact with the network, and use the CLI flag `--caliper-flow-only-test`
</p>
<p><strong>RahulEth</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 12:09:25 GMT):<br/>
yes i have all crypto metrial right now i am using below command ```npx caliper benchmark run --caliper-workspace . --caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4.1/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.yaml```
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 12:36:17 GMT):<br/>
if the network is already up, you need the `--caliper-flow-only-test` flag too
</p>
<p><strong>RahulEth</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 12:49:14 GMT):<br/>
thanks @nkl199  i will try
</p>
<p><strong>RahulEth</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 12:49:14 GMT):<br/>

@nkl199 i guess caliper is trying to call npm with the older version of web3 (version 1.2.0)  but i guess web3.js 1.2.0 is no more available. The latest version of web3.js is 1.2.5

Update: downgrading the gRPC v to 1.1.1 and node to 8x seems to avoid the issues.
Still a bit unsure what caused the issue for the latest version of gRPC support within the node.

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 11:46:58 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, running the npx command will essentially run the latest code that you have in your workspace. It could be that the more recent changes (which include changes to the configuration file structure) has made the two incompatible ... I'll check locally myslef, though you could also look into pulling down the npm based caliper module and installing that for use
</p>
<p><strong>TzortzisPanagiotis</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 14:14:42 GMT):<br/>
Regarding to problem concerning ERROR: Table must define at least one row:
After thinking I realised that the config.yaml provided for the test (and also, almost every sample configuration file included) does not have a correct syntax. Thus, caliper cannot recognise it. The errors are multiple, for example:
txNumber is supposed to be an array, thus txNumber: 100 is wrong.  You have to change it to:
txNumber: 
      - 100
Same things apply for rateControl.
Please consult the docs: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/architecture/
Explaining what each field is supposed to be.

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 16:58:09 GMT):<br/>
Yep, that will do it - if you are using the current code base locally and not the released version of caliper available on npm, you will need to consult the vNext docs, and not the vLatest as per your link above

Can someone point me towards some Hyperledger Fabric benchmarks measuring transactions per second comparing the performance of the three different consensus/orderer types Solo, Raft and Kafka? Any links would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 12:47:27 GMT):<br/>
@yannikgold I haven't run into such a comparison yet. But since Raft is the obvious winner in that set regarding scalability, management, true decentralization, etc., the achievable TPS is probably not the most important factor when choosing between them. But if you find/do such a report, feel free to share it :)

I cloned a repository from https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper. Now I follow instructions on https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/composer-config/, but I dost see these folders.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 09:07:48 GMT):<br/>
because composer has been deprecated, we are no longer supporting it - it has been removed from the Caliper repository. The published npm release does contain the adaptor, but we will not be carrying it as debt going forwards
</p>
<p><strong>SamikSamik</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 12:31:34 GMT):<br/>
So what are you saying is, that it is no longer possible to make benchmarks with Caliper on blockchain (composer + fabric) network?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 13:31:07 GMT):<br/>
it is possible with caliper@0.1.0 from npm

Good news all, thanks to @klenik, we are now publishing unstable releases of Caliper to npm .... so you can get a sneak preview of new features not yet in an official release :ok_hand:   Please remember that the unstable releases *will* contain breaking changes, so consult the vNext docs when you hit issues ;-)

@Koushik and everyone struggling  with the samples. Use the following commit version of the benchmark repo, which is from the time v0.2.0 was released: 68fd45900edfabbadc0f2c6215a08ee31e49a596
```
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks.git

We'll soon tag the repo explicitly with v0.2.0 (and also for later releases of course)

@Mozer18 that indicates a wrongly configured tls somewhere. Are you running an example benchmark from the repo, or your own? Please provide some more details about your setup 
</p>
<p><strong>Mozer18</strong> (Sun, 16 Feb 2020 21:03:31 GMT):<br/>
I'm running my own network. I created my network  with two ICA(one for MSP and one for TLS). 
I'm using fabric 1.4.3 currently.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 08:48:45 GMT):<br/>
@Mozer18 I haven't worked with ICAs yet, but there shouldn't be any magic on the client (Caliper) side if you pass the correct certs and keys for TLS. I suggest you try to make your network work first through the Fabric CLI (channel create, CC deploy, invoke, etc). Right now my guess is that the problem is with the Fabric side configuration, so maybe you can get more useful help in the #fabric or #fabric-ca channels. If you can get it working with the Fabric CLI, then you can easily configure Caliper based on that configuration (i.e., setting the correct crypto artifacts in the network configuration file)

<p><strong>RamanM</strong> (Fri, 21 Feb 2020 12:42:34 GMT):<br/>
does anybody know when Caliper will support Fabric 2.0 benchmarking? I am trying to use "--caliper-bind-sdk latest" but it fails on chaincode resolving step. I think it doesn't work with new chaincode lifecycle.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 21 Feb 2020 13:41:28 GMT):<br/>
@RamanM There's definitely some experimental support, since the benchmark repo contains measurement results for Fabric 2. @nkl199 Any pointers to bind and run against Fabric 2? 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 21 Feb 2020 13:46:07 GMT):<br/>
If you use the latest unstable Caliper release, you could bind it yourself by providing a bindings file with the packages that you wish to bind to, but we can't support it fully as the node-sdk is still in beta, and every merge introduces breaking changes. I have local changes that enable testing on the current snapshot, which is itself an update on those already in the caliper code base... which supports snapshot level circa 250.

No worries about lifecycle, because you can still deploy using the 'old' lifecycle ... it does not impact the chaincode in operation.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 21 Feb 2020 13:46:43 GMT):<br/>
--caliper-bind-sdk latest would give you 1.4.5 sdk at the moment

Hi All,

First -- caliper is a really neat tool which is very useful. I've had a little play and I can get the 'simple' and 'smallbank' scenarios working for 'networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4.1/2org1peergoleveldb' from the caliper-benchmarks project. I've ran into a bit of an issue though when running 'networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4.1/2org1peergoleveldb_raft/fabric-go-tls.yaml'  with both peers complaining the channel the chaincode is to be invoked does not exist:

2020-02-27 17:57:26.845 UTC [endorser] SimulateProposal -> ERRO 455 [mychannel][dd2ede41] failed to invoke chaincode name:"lscc" , error: API erro
r (404): network 2org1peergoleveldb_raft_default not found

Has anyone ran into this before and is there a workaround?

Also, what is the status of Caliper -- is it good for general use or is it in early stages? Same question for caliper-benchmarks.

I am using caliper v0.2.0 + the v0.2.0 tag in caliper-benchmarks.
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 18:19:55 GMT):<br/>
The above is from a fresh checkout of v0.2.0 of caliper-benchmarks and then 

 npx caliper benchmark run --caliper-workspace .  --caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/scenario/smallbank/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4.1/2org1peergoleveldb_raft/fabric-go-tls.yaml

@GBECBWP When the docker-compose file is "upped", it should create a network called `2org1peergoleveldb_raft_default`, since it is in the "2org1peergoleveldb_raft" directory. For some reason this isn't the case for you. Can you execute the start script in the network config file manually? Then list the docker networks (`docker network ls`). Older docker-compose versions handled the underscore in the dir name differently (removed it).
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 19:41:15 GMT):<br/>
Or if you want to be sure, call docker-compose in the start script with the `-p 2org1peergoleveldb_raft` parameter. But it'd be interested in the answer for my above question :)

<p><strong>SateeshBangarugiri</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:07:34 GMT):<br/>
 hi anyone knows how to test network of Fabric for transaction latency?? 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:12:28 GMT):<br/>
@SateeshBangarugiri The following docs pages are a good starting point:
- https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/installing-caliper/
- https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/fabric-config/
And check out the examples in the benchmark repo: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks
</p>
<p><strong>SateeshBangarugiri</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:19:01 GMT):<br/>
i have fabric 1.4.6 installed in my machine....
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:21:56 GMT):<br/>
@SateeshBangarugiri Then you can try the latest unstable 0.3.0 release, that has binding support for Fabric 1.4.6

@klenik thanks for the pointer. I randomly checked this on my Catalina machine today (yesterday I was using latest Linux Mint) and there is no issue running: npx caliper benchmark run --caliper-workspace . --caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4.1/2org1peergoleveldb_raft/fabric-go-tls.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:27:53 GMT):<br/>
Probably it has a newer docker-compose version. But I'm glad the issue is gone
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:28:36 GMT):<br/>
Did a quick check: 

OSX -- docker-compose version 1.25.4, build 8d51620a

Linux: -- docker-compose version 1.17.1, build unknown
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:30:38 GMT):<br/>
This all underscore management can be circumvented if you explicitly set the project/network name. But still a nasty move from docker-compose to change this behavior
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:42:19 GMT):<br/>
Thanks bit odd -- although personally I had not encountered it before. Thanks for the quick help though.

Just upgraded my docker-compose on Linux to the same version and got the same issue. 

I was on the v0.2.0 branch in caliper-benchmarks. On OSX I was actually on master, so I changed to master in caliper-benchmarks and it runs fine.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:58:17 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, the compose file should be the same on both commit versions. Strange.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:58:46 GMT):<br/>
We should probably make the compose files more robust in the benchmark repos
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:05:02 GMT):<br/>
For clarity I am using caliper v0.2.0 + caliber-benchmarks master as of commit 3630692eb2a80483b16f5ccc3dce39da2f5f4095.

docker -v = Docker version 19.03.6, build 369ce74a3c
docker-compose -v = docker-compose version 1.25.4, build 8d51620a

The following, after change to benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml to read as

yep
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:05:54 GMT):<br/>
The change in config.yaml shouldn't cause a difference, it's just a change in Caliper syntax
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:06:40 GMT):<br/>
I have docker 19.03.5 on OSX and docker 19.03.6 on Linux
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:07:16 GMT):<br/>
From what I am seeing the key is to use master branch on the caliper-benchmarks repo rather than v0.2.0
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:07:54 GMT):<br/>
docker-compose is 1.25.4 on my OSX and Linux machines
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:10:15 GMT):<br/>
But then you have to use the master/unstable builds of Caliper, since benchmarks@master is not compatible with caliper@0.2.0 (due to the above config syntax change)
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:13:50 GMT):<br/>
OK. I just had the benchmark for the command I posted in this thread complete fine. I have not used caliper from master yet -- I was going via npm.
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:14:03 GMT):<br/>
Is master (0.3.0?) relatively stable?
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:14:03 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:15:41 GMT):<br/>
We're releasing 0.3.0 early next week, so yeah, we deem it stable enough. When using the unstable release, check the vNext version of the doc pages
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:16:41 GMT):<br/>
OK, cheers. Will keep an eye on it.

hello everyone, i successfully ran caliper on my network but i have a question, on the caliper.yaml config if i set discovery to true and usegateway to true it should enable discovery service right?, if this is the case when i start the caliper test with a peer down it fails saying that it cant connect to it, from what i understand discovery service generates a valid endorsing combination with the available peers so it shouldnt need all of them to be working
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 04 Mar 2020 10:06:40 GMT):<br/>
@icarrascol Hmm, maybe @nkl199 can shed some light on this behavior and requirements for the discovery service :thinking: 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 04 Mar 2020 13:31:32 GMT):<br/>
Hi, yeah - so assuming that you have configured the network for discovery (caliper does not to my knowledge perform the required anchor peer update transactions) then there is still the "which peer did you take down?" question as it is important with regards to the peer listed in the (minimal) connection profile, and the endorsement policy
</p>
<p><strong>icarrascol</strong> (Wed, 04 Mar 2020 17:19:18 GMT):<br/>
@nkl199 but isnt that automatic? like how fabric node sdk manages discovery service, when u set up a minimal config with 4 peers and you take one down the service just "knows" by itself....
 when i set up discovery on caliper.yaml file and do a test with one peer down it fails because it tries to connect to all the peers 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 04 Mar 2020 17:46:52 GMT):<br/>
@icarrascol Discovery information is maintained by Fabric, and needs server-side configuration. https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/discovery-overview.html
</p>
<p><strong>icarrascol</strong> (Wed, 04 Mar 2020 20:57:32 GMT):<br/>
@klenik i have discovery service enabled, with node sdk if i stop a peer it still generates endorsing combinations and it shows them on console, i thought caliper used a modified version of the node sdk to send the transactions, at least for node sdk discovery needs to be enabled on its network configuration and when you initialize the channel in the code itself like: channel.initialize({ discover: true, asLocalhost: true }

Hi can anyone guide , that how should be make clients pick up different transaction adapters.  For Ex : If I have two txn adapters & I am configuring Local Clients - 2 in the config.yaml , then Client 1 - should pick up file 1 ( Call back file ) & client 2 - should file up file 2 ( Callback file) ?

You probably need to increase the timeout for waiting for the chaincode committed event: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/runtime-config/#fabric-adapter-settings
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 09 Mar 2020 20:06:57 GMT):<br/>
The `caliper-fabric-timeout-chaincodeinstantiateevent` setting is what you need (since the endorsement was successful). See the docs on how to change its value

Hi guys, I'm new to Caliper and I would like to benchmark JPM Quorum. So I'm starting to write my own blockchain adapter for Quorum but I'm quite disoriented, since the online guide https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/writing-adaptors/  is referencing folders and files that are not in the Caliper repository anymore. Is there any thorough tutorial or up-to-date documentation that I can follow? Thank you!

Hi Guys any updates ?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 13:17:52 GMT):<br/>
Currently this is not supported, because the workload module paths are received from the master process, so each worker loads the same workload module. We'll lift this restriction later, but it involves quite a few changes
</p>
<p><strong>PranavBhardwaja67</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 13:27:58 GMT):<br/>
Thank you Attila for your response, Do you know if there is a workaround for this ? As Same file being picked up by multiple clients returns MVCC_Read_Conflict ...
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 13:47:00 GMT):<br/>
That originates from your workload implementation. It is your responsibility to mitigate it (using unique seeds for each worker) or live with it (it is possible that this scenario is valid for the expected workload)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 13:48:10 GMT):<br/>
This is the only workaround for now. However, if you're using the distributed setup, then you can use different implementations under the same filename. But I think that's not the core problem here

Hello, I'm trying to run the Ethereum benchmark and I'm following the configuration guide https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/ethereum-config/. 
It says "Contract necessary for the benchmark are automatically deployed at benchmark startup while the special *registry* contract needs to be already deployed on the network. ABI and bytecode of the registry contract are reported in the *src/contract/ethereum/registry/registry.json*."
Does anybody know where can I find that file? I checked it out in both caliper and caliper-benchmarks repositories without success. 
Thank you
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 18:54:31 GMT):<br/>
@MarcoMazzoni I think that sentence is outdated. The adapter takes care of that automatically now (it was needed to keep track of the deployed contract addresses, but a more efficient method is used now).

</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 09:41:18 GMT):<br/>
Does it take care of that by simply saving the deployed contract addresses in the Context object? Thank you for the answer
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 11:32:18 GMT):<br/>
This is how the context variable looks like: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-ethereum/lib/ethereum.js#L102
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 11:33:01 GMT):<br/>
You don't get addresses, because you can reference the contract by name, the adapter will do the translation for you. That way you don't have to worry about random generated addresses

Hi everybody, I'm trying to write a new blockchain adapter for Caliper but I don't understand what's the workflow to do it. For sure the fact that I'm new to the NodeJS world is not helping me at all. Can anybody help me to figure out how to successfully setup and publish (using Verdaccio) a new blockchain package? (The online official tutorials are somehow outdated and maybe they include some implicit steps that I'm missing out)

The steps I was thinking to take are the following: 
1. Fork and clone the caliper repo locally
2. Open the caliper project in my IDE and add a *caliper-myblockchain* package in the *caliper/packages* directory
3.  Create the *lib* in *caliper-myblockchain* with the following files: `caliper-myblockchain/lib/adapterFactory.js` and `caliper-myblockchain/lib/myblockchain.js`
4. Create the following files in the package directory: `caliper-myblockchain/index.js` and `caliper-myblockchain/package.json`
5. Run `npm install` inside the caliper-myblockchain directory to install dependencies and then publishj all the caliper repo on a local Verdaccio server

Could anyone tell me if this is the correct way? Or can anyone guide me through the correct steps? Thank you very much for your support.

Hi all! I'm trying to test the v0.3.0 of caliper but (additionally to the entrypoint being changed to --version now) I'm getting an error, on the caliper-cli.
 For now I just changed the docker image and the entrypoint of the docker image to test the new version.  Are there any additional changes required in the new version? When are you planning to update the docs?


Thanks!!

The docs is already up2date: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/installing-caliper/#using-the-docker-image
The examples include setting the command to execute when the container is started. The entry point is `caliper`, the command should either be `launch master` or `launch worker`, plus any required setting you need (either as command line arguments or env variables, or config file)

I'm trying to run caliper v0.3.0 with the node debugger and running into a bit of trouble when it forks the worker process. The worker process attempts to listen on the same port as the parent process. Is their a known workaround for this? Alternatively is there a way to run a simple benchmark without forking?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 22:18:39 GMT):<br/>
You can separately start the worker process from the master, but you have to use mqtt messaging in that case. That way you can specify different inspection ports for the processes (or only debug the worker process). For details: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/architecture/#process-distribution-models (and the reference messenger setup page)

Thanks. I managed to get that working easily enough, though it would be nice if there was a single-process capability to ease debugging. Debugging friction often means more bugs.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 00:21:51 GMT):<br/>

Can I please draw some attention to this issue? https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/issues/776.

I've been working on validating caliper for benchmarking Besu, and this is a blocking issue. Before I proceed further with a fix it'd be good if the maintainer(s) weighed in.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:34:08 GMT):<br/>
Yea, we discussed it on the contributor call this morning and your #2 approach is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:43:26 GMT):<br/>
ok, I'll look into getting that done, then - something else I think we need to discuss though is backfilling in-flight transactions in cases where the transaction failed to be submitted (no txn hash returned) and nonce errors would otherwise be returned
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:43:38 GMT):<br/>
should we replay those, or just let them die?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:43:41 GMT):<br/>
I suspect the latter?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:44:21 GMT):<br/>
I think once the request ordering is more consistent however this will be less of an issue, but intermittent connectivity problems, etc are still a concern
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:47:04 GMT):<br/>
I think if we get no TXID we replay.  Multiple TXes with the same nonce are tolerated, all but one will be discarded.  If we have a hole in the nonces we have the Christmas light problem (one goes out they all go out).
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:49:49 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, so the Christmas light problem is actually really easy to fix as long as we can detect it - we just reset the nonce in the context to the nonce of the first failed txn minus one
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:50:09 GMT):<br/>
it's just a question of whether we maintain an internal list of outstanding transactions, tracking their state
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:50:38 GMT):<br/>
I think that's likely the most robust solution, but it means higher memory consumption, and there's the question of the error and latency stats
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:51:05 GMT):<br/>
do we count the errors for the lights that go out further down the chain? do we count the time spent in replaying those txns in the total latency?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:52:12 GMT):<br/>
I think it's probably more appropriate to count retries as separate from errors (except for the first failure, that should be an error), and let the latency figure accumulate the total time until success/failure, including replay time
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:52:35 GMT):<br/>
problem with that is we'd need to introduce a new metric into the reporting scheme, but I suspect that's not all that difficult?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:57:04 GMT):<br/>
It will be lower consumption than what web3.js does, they keep a set of promises polling for the receipt so it' already consuming lots of memory. 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:57:05 GMT):<br/>
Total latency is from time submitted via rawtx to the time it's reported as in a block, i.e. when we can get a receipt.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:57:27 GMT):<br/>
so I think it's time from first attempt to submit, including all re-submits.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:59:45 GMT):<br/>
unless we can move to a one account per tx model then we must re-try or all following txes fail.
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 17:15:26 GMT):<br/>
> they keep a set of promises polling for the receipt so it' already consuming lots of memory.
good point, I forgot about this
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 17:16:26 GMT):<br/>
btw, I'm also going to reach out to Dan Finlay re: MetaMask's nonce management - I loosely worked with them on it back in 2017 and I recall that they put quite a bit of effort into it - their code is mostly quite modular and reusable, so we might get a quick win there

@shemnon how do you feel about mandating use of websockets for caliper? I think it's best practice for users anyway, and would make the job quite a bit easier

<p><strong>SaphiraBjartskular</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 15:21:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes I have. The logs indicate skipping `start`  `init` and `install` as expected but the it looks like testing phase first step is enrollment
This is the error log `error: [FabricCAClientService.js]: Failed to enroll admin, error:%o message=Calling enrollment endpoint failed with error [Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:7054], stack=Error: Calling enrollment endpoint failed with error [Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:7054]`

I think I've made progress on the nonce/transaction reordering issues - testing it now and it's looking good so far.

I realized part way through the process of writing my own transaction handling that the reason why transactions are getting reordered is because during the transaction processing web3 is deciding that it needs to reach out and ask the gasPrice and chainId. This wasn't happening uniformly on all transactions (I'm not sure why) and as a result, some transaction requests would be sent ahead of others. To work around this I've explicitly set the chainId and gasPrice in the transaction params, and I no longer see extraneous requests for these things during benchmarks.

Hi.
I am planning to test on Hyperledger Besu with Hyperledger Caliper.
According to Doc( https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/installing-caliper/ ), it says that it supports Besu version up to 1.3.2.
In our project, we plan to launch the service before May by applying 1.4.0 or 1.4.1. So I ask if I can test Besu 1.4.0 or higher with Caliper before May.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 15:18:58 GMT):<br/>
It supports all current versions of Besu, even if the CLI isn't lined up.  I'll submit a patch to get it reflected in the bind code and docs
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 16:13:46 GMT):<br/>
Hi @jongyoon,

I'm afraid that I wouldn't use v0.3.0 of Caliper to test Besu. It will run, but the results you'll get out of it aren't indicative of real performance. I submitted a PR yesterday to address this issue. https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/780

If you test using that PR, be sure to set up your benchmark to connect to Besu via websockets, as otherwise you'll see poor performance and quite a few errors. This is because of a problem with a library that Caliper uses, not because of a problem with Besu.

Hope this helps!

Hello, 
My student is running into an issue with caliper and he posted his question on Gitgub as well:
https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/issues/50

Please advise..

"I recently installed Caliper v2.0 on Ubuntu18 but when I'm running a sample benchmark on hyperledger 1.0.0 I keep getting this error: TypeError: Path must be a string. Received Undefined.
Apparently, the tool is not recognizing the path of the config files. Just so you know, the same syntax has worked before without any problem. All the versions of the prerequisite tools (nodejs, make, git, npm, etc) seem to be on point. I'm kinda new to Linux and the tool so your kind help would be very much appreciated!
Thank you!

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 19:08:38 GMT):<br/>
@benjamincburns We can't really turn it on on the CLI level, since these options can be set from various sources. But v0.3.0 already includes checks/asserts for the above configuration file paths (every other setting has sensible defaults)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 19:11:20 GMT):<br/>
If you want to run tests with the cloned master repo (because you made some code modifications, for example), follow these setup steps: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/installing-caliper/#installing-locally-from-source
If you want to run tests with a published NPM/Docker version, see the previous sections of the same doc page.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 19:12:45 GMT):<br/>
The above problem probably occurs because you didn't bootstrap the project (i.e., didn't wire the caliper package dependencies)

Hi everyone:```
I'm running a problem running a sample marble test on Hyperledger Fabric. It seems to have something to do with Docker but I can't figure it out. I'm kinda new to the tool. Next is the output log I'm getting. Thank you in advance for your help!

Hello everyone:
I'm getting an error when running a sample marble test on Hyperledger Fabric. Apparently, it has something to do with Docker but can't figure it out, I'm kinda new to Linux and the tool. I've followed the instructions for Caliper installation, binding SDK and running the test. In the next message, I'm attaching the output log. Thank you in advance! - angelo.

Hey guys, does anyone know if Hyperledger Fabric v2.0 might be supported from Caliper in a near future?
</p>
<p><strong>TzortzisPanagiotis</strong> (Sat, 04 Apr 2020 13:27:25 GMT):<br/>
Hello. Trying to recreate the tests by N K Lincoln, I run benchmarks targeting the fixed-asset chaincode. running the create_asset benchmark, after multiple successful rounds i face this error:
    error: [ChannelEventHub.js]: _connect - timed out after:45000
After a bit of research, this error has to do with the node sdk i am using.

My question is, does the sdk version has to match the fabric docker image version?
Right now i am using fabric 1.4.4 version, should I use SDK 1.4.4 or I can also use SDK latest? 

</p>
<p><strong>TzortzisPanagiotis</strong> (Sat, 04 Apr 2020 19:27:54 GMT):<br/>
After doing some tests, I have come to the conclusion that the error occurs when running  create-asset.js with bytesize 64000. On any other round of the create-asset.yaml file succeeds.

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 07:50:53 GMT):<br/>
that's a connectivity issue with the CA, which means something is wrong within the configuration (URLs) or credentials. The logs within the containers might help track down the issue there

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 14 Apr 2020 09:09:53 GMT):<br/>
@gauravgiri You're using a network configuration file that was intended for Fabric 1.0 networks (there's an `eventUrl` for the peer entries). Since there were significant/breaking changes after 1.0 in the eventing, we require the 1.0 SDK for 1.0 networks, so use a fabric:1.0.0 binding
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 14 Apr 2020 09:11:51 GMT):<br/>
https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3/architecture/#process-distribution-models
This explains how you can scale Caliper to multiple machines if you run into the limitations of a single machine. But without further info about your settings, I don't know whether that's the problem. Increasing just the worker number won't increase the sending rate, you must also increase the sending rate of the rate controller
</p>
<p><strong>gauravgiri</strong> (Tue, 14 Apr 2020 09:35:42 GMT):<br/>
also, as part of client definition in connection profile, we need to provide clientPrivateKey, clientSignedCert. any way for caliper to enroll a registered user with provided with enrollid/enrollsecret, and use this user to perform tests?

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 07:57:40 GMT):<br/>
Thats quite a general question to which there are too many answers. What is the configuration? What is the peer targeting strategy? How complex is the chaincode? How many workers are you using? Are you using docker based workers? What rate limits are you setting? Are you maxing out the CPU/Memory/Network? What are the orderer settings? What state database are you using? If using CouchDB is it indexed? ... there is no "silver bullet"

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:38:57 GMT):<br/>
looks like you are using marbles chaincode in the callbacks? And only calling the init function?
</p>
<p><strong>randyshu</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:41:48 GMT):<br/>
I specific --caliper-workspace workspace/local and init file is in this directory.
</p>
<p><strong>randyshu</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:42:06 GMT):<br/>
just ignore callbacks directory.
</p>
<p><strong>randyshu</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:42:49 GMT):<br/>
yes,now I only test the tps 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:47:18 GMT):<br/>
and the callback is for "marble create"?
</p>
<p><strong>randyshu</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:50:07 GMT):<br/>
yes , actually for creating car...I gorget to submit init.js
</p>
<p><strong>randyshu</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:50:07 GMT):<br/>
yes , actually for creating car...I forget to submit init.js
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:52:47 GMT):<br/>
OK - so for a single machine configuration, you are right in the ballpark for expected output TPS. To go higher, we would recommend moving the client drivers to a different machine (same network to minimise latency) and then scale them up -> 50+ workers is not uncommon. Having caliper workers on the same machine as the fabric network itself can really impact resources.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:53:05 GMT):<br/>
what clock speed is the machine?

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:58:13 GMT):<br/>
that's pretty substantial - are you running with "fixed tps" rate controllers?
</p>
<p><strong>randyshu</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:58:44 GMT):<br/>
yes.      rateControl: { type: 'fixed-rate', opts: { tps: 800 } }

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:59:24 GMT):<br/>
ok, increase the number of test clients locally first, see what impact that has on the resource consumption and getting closer to  the target rate
</p>
<p><strong>randyshu</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 02:12:35 GMT):<br/>
thank for your advice and now the tps can be 800

Hi @HelmiTrabelsi - have a look at Caliper's documentation here: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3/getting-started/

Personally I haven't ran it against Fabric, but if you look to the message directly above yours, you'll see that other users have.

Hi All, Can Caliper be used with AWS, IBM, Azure or SAP Services?
</p>
<p><strong>NageshCR</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 05:09:51 GMT):<br/>
if yes is there any guide to use this?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:23:39 GMT):<br/>
This can be done using the "distributed" docker based workers that communicate using mqtt
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:23:59 GMT):<br/>
yes, though no guides at the moment

<p><strong>HelmiTrabelsi</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 15:50:57 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>HelmiTrabelsi</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 16:56:11 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @nkl199. Do you have any idea or tutoriel how i can use caliper with an existing fabric 2.0 network??
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 17:19:25 GMT):<br/>
no tutorials out, but it is the same as any other fabric network - you just need the credentials and network configuration to match the target network. Oh, and make sure the chaincode containers are up already, becuase the new model is that they are not created until the first transaction hits the peer
</p>
<p><strong>HelmiTrabelsi</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 17:36:37 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 18:23:45 GMT):<br/>
@NageshCR The called spawn function can't find the npm command for some reason. Based on your paths, I guess you're using Windows, which could cause the difference in behavior. As a workaround for now, try executing the "binding" manually in your benchmarks dir: `npm install grpc@1.14.2 fabric-ca-client@1.4.4 fabric-client@1.4.4 fabric-protos@2.0.0-snapshot.1 fabric-network@1.4.4`

 #hyperledger-caliper
We are using hyperledger fabric (v.1.4.2) with 1 Org 2 Peer 1 orderer setup running in different VM. Now I'm trying to analyze the performance using hyperledger caliper (v.0.3.0). Can this be done? Or hyperledger caliper testing can be done only in dockerized environment?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 13:58:21 GMT):<br/>
a) yes this can be done
b) can be done with or without the docker clients, that is a user architectural choice to make
c) Caliper "only" needs to have the correct credentials to connect to the system, where-ever it may be. If you can create a client connection, you can test it with Caliper
</p>
<p><strong>Vgkmanju</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 15:46:25 GMT):<br/>
Thanks nkl199,

Currently in our network setup, I have already started the orderer and peers and peers have also been joined to the channel. I have installed and instantiated all the chaincode in my network.

This is the command that i have used to start the caliper, 
npx caliper launch master --caliper-workspace . --caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4.1/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.yaml

In this networkconfig yaml file, they are using docker-compose and their dockerized network configuration to start the network. As my network is already started, what are the changes that has to be done in the configuration files as well as the command to run the caliper in my network? and also do you have any reference for this?

Hi Everyone, I’m currently researching on how to go about automatically creating different sized Fabric networks (varying orgs, peers, channels) and testing those with Caliper. I have found a way to create the needed docker-compose config file and the crypto-assets for HLF using some basic scripts that require manual editing, but I was wondering if there was a more streamlined and automated approach for this.

Hello Everyone, I hope you all are keeping safe. I was wondering how do you figure out where is the bottleneck of your computing/network infrastructure that keeps the transaction throughput low? For example, Since I've moved my experiments from Google Cloud to a private cloud network the performance has degraded. So far I have realized that for one the network bandwidth is much lower in my private cloud compared to Google Cloud (Private Cloud: 500 Mbits/sec vs. GCloud: 9.6 Gbits/sec). However, when monitoring the network interfaces it does not seem that the benchmark uses more than 40-50 Mbits/sec tops. So I assume the network is not the bottleneck. The same goes for the memory and the CPU. Even at the highest peaks of the benchmarks, CPU and memory are not being fully utilized. Considering these, I do not seem to be able to get a TX throughput of more than 120 TPS on the simple benchmark open Tx (2org1peergoleveldb_Raft). And once I increase the send rate to 200+ I start getting plenty of failed TXs due to timeout. I was wondering if there is a systematic method of finding the bottleneck here.?

Another observation regarding this is that if I repeat the same benchmark with 300 tps, while all the raft orderers are located at the same host, the timeout errors do not occur but the throughput remains low.

Hi there.  Can somebody clarify how Caliper Observers are used?  This is not very clear in the documentation. For example, what's the difference between these two declarations (the first one without and the second one with Observers) in the benchmark configuration file:
1) 
monitor:
  type:
  - process
  process:
  - command: node
    arguments: fabricClientWorker.js
    multiOutput: avg
    interval: 10

2) 
monitor:
  type:
  - process
  process:
  - command: node
    arguments: fabricClientWorker.js
    multiOutput: avg
  interval: 10
observer:
  type: local
  interval: 10

A monitor is used to collate information into a report at the end of a benchmark, an observer is used to notify a user of the current transaction submission numbers during the benchmark

Hi Nick, thanks for your answer. This playbook was right what I was looking for. However, when trying to connect a caliper network to two-org-test network, I encountered a policy error.

https://gist.github.com/Schkai/aa6e258ad103b8548c06c9eef7f0e837 That's the caliper config I was using. I know that this is Fabric's intended policy behavior. However, I was wondering how i can circumvent this error when creating the playbook. 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 28 Apr 2020 08:42:19 GMT):<br/>
OK, so you will need to match the policy with how you are driving the tests - looks like the credentials you are using are not admin credentials (there's a difference between those and client credentials) You could modify the policy being used or change the user creds

Hey, we just recently started working with caliper and really love the concept and think it is a great project.
I was just wondering, is there a way to specify the report format? So have something better machine readable than html? What I see, everything refers to HTML reports
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 28 Apr 2020 12:54:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm sure this could be possible :thumbup: I know that Atilla uses logging information that is output, but there's no reason an alternative export version couldn't be specified for tabular style information 
</p>
<p><strong>kiview</strong> (Tue, 28 Apr 2020 13:34:08 GMT):<br/>
something easily readable like JSON or XML would be great. Does the current architecture support different report generators?

Hey, I'm new to Caliper but a veteran in Fabric. I can't seem to get caliper to work with 2.0. It stops at the chaincode instantiaion.

Error while performing "install" step: Error: Invalid endorsement for marbles@v1.0 in channel from peer.cpqd.com.br: Channel 'channel' has been migrated to the new lifecycle, LSCC is now read-only

Isn't this a Fabric specific error?
</p>
<p><strong>lepar</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 13:21:03 GMT):<br/>
I found out that caliper doesn't support the new cc lifecycle so I'm changing it in the configtx.yaml configs and from what I noticed, it needs to use the 1.4 sdk
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 13:24:43 GMT):<br/>
You can use the 1.4.x binding to create channels, install/instantiate cc, and then switch to the 2.1 binding to test if desired. The 2.1 fabric-sdk no longer contains *any* admin actions and so we are unable to perform such actions

Hey, I have setup hyperledger fabric version 1.4.2 with 1 org 2 peers 1 orderer setup all are running in 3 different VMs natively. Now I am trying to implement caliper v0.3.0 in this fabric setup. Peers and Orderer are already up and peers are joined in the channel. I have already installed and instantiated chaincodes in the network. I have modified the network config file and benchconfig file in caliper according to my network. So I directly run the caliper using the flag "caliper-flow-only-test". While executing this, I am facing issues like

note you will need to remove the npm installed fabric-client package before running the test, as we first check for existence of that before picking what adaptor to use

Hello. I have setup 2 VMs that run a fabric network, using docker swarm. Prometheus observer is currently obtaining details only from the vm that runs the test (say vm1) and ignores containers in vm2.  To deploy prometheus i used docker-compose file found in caliper-benchmarks:  https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/tree/master/networks/prometheus-grafana. Any ideas why this is happening?

Hi guys, I have a couple of software design questions about Caliper, specifically about the `caliper-core` module. 
``` 


</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Sat, 02 May 2020 14:32:40 GMT):<br/>
Hi guys, I have a couple of software design questions about the `caliper-core` module. 

1. Why the *Blockchain class* in `lib/common/core/blockchain.js` does NOT extend the* BlockchainInterface class*?
2. Why the same  *Blockchain class* does not call the *adapterFactory() method* for creating the blockchain Adapter directly in its own constructor (similar to the *Messenger class* referred in question 3)?
3. Why the *Messenger class* in `lib/common/messaging/messenger.js` does NOT extend the *MessengerInterface class*?
4. Why the several blockchain Adapters implemented in each SUT package, are called "Adapter"? I mean: if this refers to the *Adapter design pattern*, it deosn't sound quite correct. Since the *Blockchain class*   in `lib/common/core/blockchain.js` wraps and calls the methods of the Adapter object, it seems more like the *Blockchain class* is the _Adapter_ (in the pattern terminology) and the *BlockchainAdapter* is the _Adaptee_

Hope they're not stupid questions. Thank you in advance!

I don't have answers, but personally I'd like to know. Personally I'd love to see this whole codebase migrated over to TypeScript - would help to enforce certain design choices. If there's support for that among maintainers I might make it a project for some rainy weekend.
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Mon, 04 May 2020 22:38:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes I totally agree about migrating it to TypeScript. But I would also like to hear from mantainers about this, because I think software design is an important aspect to clarify so to avoid cargo cult programming. There is no doubt that JavaScript does not allow full expressivity on such a complex project.

Hy guys, I have a question about how Prometheus monitor looks for results.
I am testing a permissioned Ethereum network with Caliper, and I set up a Docker network with Prometheus (observer and monitor),  MQTT broker, Caliper Master and *3 Workers*. The result I am getting is as follows:
1. Thebenchmark consists of sending *120 transactions* with *fixed-rate* rate control, hence each Worker has to submit 40 transactions.
2. Each Worker is indeed *successfully* submitting 40 transactions, and publish the *testResult* message on the MQTT broker
3. The *mqtt-master-messenger* gets correctly each testResult message from the Worker 
4. The *RoundOrchestrator* on the Master, once it received the results from the WorkerOrchestrator, calls `await this.report.processPrometheusTPSResults({start, end}, roundConfig, index);` for the round index: this function makes *queries* on Prometheus using the *prometheus-query-client*
5. It asks for the *sum* of *caliper_txn_success* and it gets a response of *111*, whereas I'm expecting 120, since the Workers sent a msg with 40 successful transactions each.

I tested this many times, varying both the observer and monitor intervals, but the outcome is always the same. 
I'm testing my network all in a local environment using Docker containers.
As follows, I attach the output of the Master's log, in order to show you what I just described.

That's likely to be a result of the frequency at which results are sent to Prometheus, the scrape frequency of Prometheus to the PushGateway, and the time segment used in the query (start/end) ... all of which contribute to clipped results

<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 08:35:26 GMT):<br/>
The time segment used in the query {start, end} is taken by the framework itself, it is not settable by the user. The framework decides those time params in the `formatResults(results)` function of the *WorkerOrchestrator* class, by taking the maximum of all startTimes and the minimum of all worker endTimes. So, how do I change frequency of pushes and the scrape frequency of Prometheus? Thanks

I'm a fan of typescript too, however I suspect more than a single rainy weekend would be required to convert the entire project (using typings that are not 'any' everywhere). The current code base has evolved from the initial contribution from Huawei, we added with consistency to the original code base, including the manner in which the "adapters" have been implemented
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 08:38:06 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thank you for the clarification!
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 08:38:41 GMT):<br/>
yes - only the framework knows when a particular round has started/ended. The scrape frequency is within the docker compose files of Prometheus and is set when the containers are started
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 08:39:30 GMT):<br/>
Of course, should you find yourself with many rainy weekends, or want to look into modifying the current adaptor hierarchy ... PRs are welcome!

Re: TS, I was being somewhat facetious about it taking a weekend, but I'd imagine that it could be done one module at a time with fairly minimal disruption to the active codebase.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 08:41:10 GMT):<br/>
That is true, and it is something I would welcome as my personal preference is for Typescript
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 08:41:10 GMT):<br/>
That is true, and it is something I would welcome as my personal preference is for Typescript ... it is certainly something that should be scoped
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 08:43:22 GMT):<br/>
I've done a bunch of TS conversions, anyway. The hardest part is just keeping the blinders on for the initial conversion and resisting the urge to improve the underlying code too much. I'll have a look at it. If typings exist for most dependencies, it might not be too bad.
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 09:49:54 GMT):<br/>
I just tried changing the scrape interval of the prometheus-ethereum.yml  file setting it to 1 sec (instead of 5 sec), but the issue is the same.
Thus, if the problem depends on how the framework takes the start and end times of a Round, it is not something the user can fix. 
Is the scrape interval the only parameter that could fix this?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 09:52:21 GMT):<br/>
you can also increase the rate at which updates are sent to the push gateway (bench config setting)
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 09:55:30 GMT):<br/>
I've set this in the *monitor* params to 1 second, like this:
`monitor:
     interval: 1
     type: prometheus
     prometheus:
         url: 'http://prometheus:9090'
         push_url: 'http://pushGateway:9091'
         metrics:
               ignore: [prometheus, pushGateway, cadvisor, grafana, node-exporter]
               include:
        Avg Memory (MB):
          query: sum(container_memory_rss{name=~".+"}) by (name)
          step: 10
          label: name
          statistic: avg
          multiplier: 0.000001`
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 09:57:04 GMT):<br/>
:thinking: I would have thought that would capture them all - @klenik - any thoughts? Might need an issue to opened on this?
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 09:58:33 GMT):<br/>
In a configuration with *local* Master and Workers, and a dockerized MQTT broker everything works fine.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 09:59:44 GMT):<br/>
yeah, each of those transactions are explicitly tracked, whereas the Prometheus operation registers execution and are later retrieved via an internal query against the prometheus server
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:11:29 GMT):<br/>
Anyways, the *prometheus-query-client* inside  `processPrometheusTPSResults({start, end}, roundConfig, index)` sends out a query with an *endTime* that is the EARLIEST of the endTimes of all workers (look at the `format(result)` function in WorkerOrchestrator). This implies that the maybe it is cutting off a time slice in which the other workers are not completed with their transactions yet.

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:12:41 GMT):<br/>
that could well be it :thumbup: 
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:12:55 GMT):<br/>
Therefore, it retrieves less transactions than actually have been submitted.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:14:43 GMT):<br/>
there's probably 2 requirements there:
- fix it to retrieve all
- enable trimming of results, ie ignore first and last x-seconds (user defined, default none), so that you are looking at the statistics when the SUT is being run at a steady state and not when the load is ramping up/down
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:18:52 GMT):<br/>
How is that second bullet achieved? You mean to perform the last read just after the SUT "settled down"? This means performing a kind of "sleep" on the end of the last Round, and then make a query. Kind of?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:19:38 GMT):<br/>
You could define a "trim" setting in the bench config, and then modify the start/end times used in the query accordingly
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:19:54 GMT):<br/>
start+trim, end-trim
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:20:39 GMT):<br/>
that would explicitly throw away txns, but if you are running a benchmark for 15mins, you are mainly concerned with the steady state and not the beginning/end
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:28:43 GMT):<br/>
But in this way I will not retrieve the same number of transactions that I specify in the `rounds` setting of bench config. So let's do a concrete example:
- For each query you suggest to trim the beginning and the last time slice, so to take only the "stable" part of the round
- In every "stable" time interval,  the count of transactions will be less than the nominal one
- I will receive maybe "98 transactions completed" out of the "120" specified
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:29:24 GMT):<br/>
correct - but in that case you could not specify a "trim" and the timing would be such that all txns are accounted for
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:30:19 GMT):<br/>
the idea would be to enable a user to intentionally discard start/end txns to only register steady state, or let them include the ramp up/down phases
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:30:23 GMT):<br/>
Maybe I'm not seeing your point. Unfortunately I'm not a JS developer, I'm just writing my Master thesis to show that Caliper is a good tool for running blockchain benchmarks in distributed environments
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:31:54 GMT):<br/>
Oh ok I now see your point
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:32:11 GMT):<br/>
Anyway, I will try to make the fix of the first bullet you suggested and let you know
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:33:22 GMT):<br/>
I think you have come across a hidden design intention that is coming across as a defect - by issuing the query at the time when the first worker is complete, we ensure that the SUT is h=being hit the hardest. What you have revealed is that this is not always what someone want - in this case you want to know the total (exact) number of txns .. but we also need a new feature there to let a user interested in steady state operation select an "inner window" for the query to operate on so that they do not consider statistics for the start/end phase
</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 10:40:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I finally agree with that.
The problem right now is that, when I set 120 txns to be run, and I receive [ *111 txns successful* and *0 failed* ] I wonder what happened to the other 9 txns? But if we clarify that the benchmark is purposely accounting for a subset of them to ensure that during their submission the SUT was being hit the hardest, then everything makes more sense.

</p>
<p><strong>MarcoMazzoni</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 13:47:39 GMT):<br/>
I am pretty sure I solved the problem.
So, the reason why the Caliper report won't print out ALL the transactions submitted by the Workers when using Prometheus is the following:
1. When the `CaliperLocalClient` (Worker) executes `doTest()`, at the beginning of the function it sets the *txUpdateTime*, which can be configured in `caliper.yaml` (otherwise the default is 1000ms)
2. The *txUpdateTime* is the frequency the `CaliperLocalClient` calls the `txUpdate()` function, which will *push* transactions statistics on the Prometheus push gateway
3. Inside `doTest()`, the Client will call either `runFixedNumber()` or `runDuration()`: these functions execute the workloads (submit txns) and when all the Promises resolve, they set the *endTime* variable
4. When these functions completed, some clean up is performed inside `doTest()` and `clearUpdateInter(txUpdateInter)` executes the last `txUpdate()` call
5. The *endTime* variable is sent along with the results to the Master, where it is returned to the `RoundOrchestrator`
6. The RoundOrchestrator now wants to build the report, and calls `await this.report.processPrometheusTPSResults({start, end}, roundConfig, index)`, where *end* is the *endTime* recorded above: through this function, queries are issued to Prometheus in order to retrieve the Caliper txn metrics at *time = endTime*
7. The problem is that *endTime* is an instant in time *PRIOR* to the *last txUpdate()* performed by the Worker, thus it's gonna retrieve the metrics about all transactions except the last bunch of them, that have been pushed by the `CaliperLocalClient` in the last `txUpdate()`.

Now, the higher is the update frequency from worker to Prometheus (set by the user through `txupdatetime` in `caliper.yaml`), the lower will be the probability of running into this issue.
But in the majority of cases this "inconsistency" can happen.

To make a concrete and trivial example, let's assume a Worker has to submit 20 txns at a fixed rate of 5 txns per second, and let's assume a *txUpdateTime* (frequency of pushes to Prometheus) of 3 sec:

START-TIME
[0 sec] push_to_Prometheus(Submitted: -, Succ: -, Failed: -)
[1 sec] 5 txn are submitted
[2 sec] 5 txn are submitted 
[3 sec] 5 txn are submitted && push_to_Prometheus(Submitted: 15, Succ: 15, Failed: 0)
[4 sec] 5 txn are submitted
END-TIME
[5-sec] clearUpdateInterval() and make last push_to_Prometheus(Submitted: 20, Succ: 20, Failed: 0)

When all Workers are done with this process, the Master is going to choose the *earliest endTime* and the *latest startTime* among them, but this does not affect the occurrency of the issue.
As you can see, when the Master is gonna query Prometheus to retrieve metrics at END-TIME, it is going to receive *just 15* txns submitted, missing the last batch of 5 txns.

This can be solved by trivially tell the RoundOrchestrator to make a query at *endTime + txUpdateTime*: in this way, we can be sure that at this point in time the last push to Prometheus has been performed, and we have all the 20 txns in the report.

[4 sec] 5 txn are submitted
END-TIME
[5-sec] clearUpdateInterval() and make last push_to_Prometheus


As you can see, when the Master is gonna query Prometheus to retrieve metrics at END-TIME for that Worker, it is going to receive *just 15* txns submitted, missing the last batch of 5 txns.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 13:04:13 GMT):<br/>
You're right, it's intentional, as in a normal deployment scenario docker-in-docker is not needed. Caliper will be just another containerized service (managed by swarm, k8s, etc) next to the SUT services
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 13:05:56 GMT):<br/>
That being said, it would be useful for the examples when using the Caliper image (the example network configs contain scripts to spin up a local docker network). But I wonder whether we can support that without putting docker into the image. For example, like the Fabric peer, which accesses a mounted docker socket to spin up chaincode containers.
</p>
<p><strong>kiview</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 15:59:29 GMT):<br/>
Yes, we set it up like this, with docker socket mounting and custom image. Docker is not required in the caliper image, but access to docker socket (also user permission).

I'd like to contribute it to the examples, just to have a super easy way for new users to generate a report without setting up anything.

This is our current approach, not perfect yet, but a start:

When running caliper against Ethereum Parity I get:
`Error while performing "init" step: Error: Returned error: Method not found`
Maybe someone has an idea? Is Parity missing some methods in its API?

Might this happen in this method?

Can I change logging to give more detailed errors?

Hi @SergioTorres - sorry it has taken me a while to respond. I suggest that in forums like this, rather than asking to ask a question you just post your question into the channel and people will respond as time allows. You'll get an answer a lot quicker that way :-)

<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 18:48:31 GMT):<br/>
Also I generally try not to respond to questions via DM. It's better if people talk in the public channels so that the conversations are searchable

Hi all, I am seeing that the latest supported version of Caliper for Fabric is 1.4.7.
Is support for v2.x.x in the work and when will it be released or can we test already?

Hello, I've been trying to use the prometheus monitor with the 0.3.0 Caliper image and having some issues with the report building. It is having trouble with querying the correct data for Caliper despite properly pushing. After looking into it a bit, I  noticed that when prometheus pulled Caliper data from the Prometheus Push Gateway, the instance name was changed to the url of the gateway. Is there something I need to configure on prometheus to prevent this from happening?

test client or fabric base images? Fabric V2.0.0 and 2.1.0 are able to be driven using the 1.4.7 SDK binding, though there is also a 2.1.0 Fabric SDK binding available ... but it is only capable to driving tests on an existing network as all admin operation has been removed from the 2.1.0 Fabric SDK

When I run caliper in multi-process mode (one master, one worker, communicating via MQTT), should I expect both processes to live until killed? That's the behavior I've been seeing lately when running Besu tests. If this is expected, is there a way that I can get them both to exit cleanly when the benchmark is finished?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 07:40:57 GMT):<br/>
that is the current behaviour, I think there is scope for some tidy-up there. The initial expectation was that MQTT would be used when using Dockerised workers, which would hang around for some time. Certainly worth a lifecycle discussion today on the maintainers call :thumbup: 
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Fri, 22 May 2020 23:27:58 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your answer, @nkl199, I am testing with the 1.4.7 SDK binding and 2.0.0 for fabric-protos now, and everything works, except for the private data. I have the transientMap correctly set in the tx settings, but the chaincode receives an empty transient map. And so I get an endorsement failure. Do you have any idea of problems with private data or can you point me to something I should check/change, please?

Thanks a lot!
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Sat, 23 May 2020 00:35:03 GMT):<br/>
Could it be that I am using a wrong gateway adapter that doesn't take the transientMap field? 
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Sat, 23 May 2020 00:51:52 GMT):<br/>
What I see is that in the @hyperledger/caliper-fabric/lib/adaptor-versions/v2/fabric-gateway-v2.js they check for invokeSettings.transientData, instead of invokeSettings.transientMap:

```
// Add transient data if present
        // - passed as key value pairing such as {"hello":"world"}
        if (invokeSettings.transientData) {
            const transientData = {};
            const keys = Array.from(Object.keys(invokeSettings.transientData));
            keys.forEach((key) => {
                transientData[key] = Buffer.from(transientData[key]);
            });
            transaction.setTransient(transientData);
        }
```

But I am not sure this is the reason, because I tried changing transientMap to transientData in my workload callback, but it also gave the same error...
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Sat, 23 May 2020 00:59:42 GMT):<br/>
I think there is definitely something wrong in the logic there, it does the Buffer.from on transientData instead of invokeSettings.transientData...
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Sat, 23 May 2020 01:01:20 GMT):<br/>
so I think two things should be fixed in this code, changing it to `invokeSettings.transientMap` and then using `invokeSettings.transientMap` in the `Buffer.from`. What do you think @nkl199 ?

<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Sat, 23 May 2020 03:50:27 GMT):<br/>
and what I see in there is that invokeSettings.transientData is checked instead of invokeSettings.transientMap, could this be the issue?

Hi all, I did the v2.0.0 binding, but I see that when running the tests, fabric-gateway-v1.js is still used and it gives some errors. Where can I configure the use of fabric-gateway-v2 as the adapter, please?

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 25 May 2020 10:25:12 GMT):<br/>
@covepark The Fabric CI tests should be a good starting point: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/fabric_tests/phase3/networkconfig.yaml
You just define multiple channels in your network configuration. From your callback file, you can refer to the desired contract ID which will automatically identify the target channel (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/fabric_tests/init.js#L43). If you want the same chaincode instantiated on multiple channels then explicitely set the `contractID` in your network configuration (https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.1/fabric-config/#network-configuration-file-reference)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 25 May 2020 10:26:26 GMT):<br/>
The correct adapter version automatically gets picked up based on the bound SDK version. You can see the detected SDK version in the logs. If it still shows 1.x, then clean your node_modules folder, probably a remnant 1.x SDK package causes the problem

You need the following steps to accomplish that:
1. Every chaincode in the network config file needs a globally unique `contractID`. If you don't set one, then the `id` of the chaincode will be used. In your case that won't work, since both `id` is simple. So add a `contractID` to both chaincode, like `simple-ch1` and `simple-ch2`. Like theses lines: 
https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/fabric_tests/phase3/networkconfig.yaml#L61
https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/fabric_tests/phase3/networkconfig.yaml#L79

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 09:36:59 GMT):<br/>
2. In your workload module (aka callback file), you can reference the channel/chaincode pair using these `contractID`s. So `simple-ch1` will identify your `simple` contract on channel `ch1`. The following is an example of this selection: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/fabric_tests/init.js#L43
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 09:41:31 GMT):<br/>
3. You need to decide what you mean by "simultaneously". Caliper enables TXs according to the set rate controller. In the linked example the workload module submits a single TX when it's enabled, alternating between the two chaincodes/channels, hence the single `invokeSmartContract` call. The other way is to submit two TXs when the workload module is enabled, meaning two `invokeSmartContract` calls in your `run` function. In this case you must ensure that you concatenate their returned promise arrays and return that array. This second approach is closer to "simultaneously", but the first approach is simpler.

@PamudithaNavaratne Based on the error message, I think TLS is configured on the CA but you set its address as HTTP. But we need a bit more context to determine the exact cause.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sun, 07 Jun 2020 12:36:47 GMT):<br/>
Take a single machine, and check the maximum send rate a single worker can produce (possibly affected by your workload logic). A worker will take up maximum a single CPU core (possibly less), so monitor your resource usages to determine how many workers can you fit on a machine. Then use as many machines as needed. The master process and the mqtt broker shouldn't need much. Since Caliper doesn't store much about the benchmark execution, there's no minimum required config.

I am trying to set up the remote worker modules and the container keeps stuck on  initializing MQTT:
```

Before that, I also get some warning:

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 17:54:12 GMT):<br/>
that's not normal - not sure about the latter, but I have witnessed the former by using the incorrect mqtt url (try container-name:port)

Thank you @nkl199 , but I still got the same problem.

I am trying to run the worker like this:
```
docker run \

    -e CALIPER_BIND_SUT=fabric:2.1.0 \

hello everyone, i'm still very beginning in learning caliper. I'm trying to implement caliper on my existing fabric network. In the documentation, it stated line like this "--caliper-networkconfig networks/fabric/v1/v1.4.4/2org1peerleveldb_rFT/fabric-go-tls.yaml" so does that mean i need to convert my currently working network's yaml file to caliper yaml file? i'm quite confused as in fabric, the implementation of fabric network is quite long and i have multiple file for yaml file. what i don't understand is:
1. does network implementation in caliper stop before initiating chaincode?
2. Can i use my fabric's yaml file as it is without changing anything (i use npm caliper, not the docker one)?
3. Does chaincode on fabric network doesn't affect caliper at all then? (i can't see anything related to chaincode in caliper-benchmarks)
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 09 Jun 2020 20:00:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I was doing the distributed deployment and I hadn't set op my mqtt broker correctly, but now it is working.
I have another question though, and that is if it is normal that my worker container exits after having executed a workload or is there some way to keep the container running?

not yet - though if you would benefit with being able to keep the containers alive upon benchmark completion, someone else might ... so a config option there would be handy => feel free to raise an issue for it

ok, i managed to build caliper based on my fabric and it all run well until i instantiated existing marble chaincode in caliper-benchmark, whatever i do it always return "Failed to generate platform-specific docker build: Error returned from build: 1 "/opt/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/link: signal: killed" anyone can help me with it? i searched on forums and they say it was memory issue but i checked on activity monitor and my memory still have 5 gb left (i'm running on macos catalina, is that an issue maybe?)

Hi, What does Caliper consider a transaction (specifically for writes): is it the entire data flow from proposal, transaction to orderer and finally the block being written, or is it something else?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 10 Jun 2020 13:02:28 GMT):<br/>
@GBECBWP The TX is measured from the time Caliper submits it to the time a result is returned to Caliper (for non-queries, when the block is written and the event notification arrives).
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 10 Jun 2020 13:03:23 GMT):<br/>
I assume you are referring to Fabric here, which results in a slightly more complicated answer to what you might be hoping for! In all cases, Caliper considers the entire data flow, so you can consider it to be client centric ... ie it will be what a client using the SDK would also observe from their own application
- if not using a gateway, the transaction timing is started and the point at which the transaction body is constructed and stopped after the orderer event has been detected
- if using a gateway, the transaction timing is bound to either side of the gateway.submit/evaluate and this will depend on the event/query strategy that is being used

@klenik well, I am not using Kubernetes to deploy worker loads, I am manually creating some virtual machinges in AWS and starting the worker load containers on them. I am then launching the master from my local machine. SInce I am still figuring out how to set up and connect everything, I have to do the benchmarking every time I make some chance to see if everything still works. How I got it to work is first starting the all worker loads, and then launching the master with the benchmarking configuration I want to execute. So after every time It executed a benchmarking, I don't want to have to start every worker load again before being able to execute another benchmarking configuration to try other things out, so it is handy that the containers start automatically again instead of me having to start them. Or is it not normal that I have to start them manually? Should they being start automatically when the master is launched maybe? But how then?

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 10 Jun 2020 14:24:57 GMT):<br/>
If you use the distributed setup, then the master can't launch them. So you have to start them manually (whatever that means depends on your deployment method). Keeping the workers running is a nice trick to save some time during development :)
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 10 Jun 2020 14:32:26 GMT):<br/>
@klenik Ok, great, thanks a lot for the clarification. So I am not doing anything too weird then hahaha.
For the moment I am still in development indeed and so its handy to keep them running. What would be the recommended way in production? Just deploying everything automatically in the moment you want to do a benchmarking and then cleaning up everything afterwards again? So having good automatic deployment seems important then, right? Do you advise Kubernetes for it or any other tools?
Thanks a lot!

docker swarm and kubernetes are popular
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 10 Jun 2020 14:44:13 GMT):<br/>
Yep, swarm or k8s is an easy way to manage containers/services. You only have to initialize your cluster once, then k8s/swarm will handle the deployment of services for you. Take a look at this thread: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/issues/855

Using the following: https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/tutorial-listening-to-events.html

So when (2) is emitted? (I'm assuming that transaction commit here implies the block has been written?)

ah, willing to bet the current samples are doing exactly what is now not permitted! We do run samples in our builds though, so if you check out the material here: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/v0.3.2/packages/caliper-tests-integration/ethereum_tests you should see a better example. ONce you solve it, feel free to raise a PR on the benchmarks repo ;-)

Hello, does anybody know how I could calculate the transaction and read latency manually? I can't seem to get caliper to work, so I'm wondering how to do that through a script or a program.

You can check the source code how caliper does this. AFAIK it is a bit more involved with regards to specifying finality.

As noted by the end of the following doc section, spinning up a docker network inside the caliper container won't work currently. You need to add the caliper service to the compose file.

Take a look at the following Docker compose file (using the official image instead of the test image) and related artifacts.

Hey,
I am running the benchmarking command  from the installation tutorial, namely this:
npx caliper launch master \
    --caliper-bind-sut fabric:1.4.0 \
    --caliper-workspace . \
    --caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml \
    --caliper-networkconfig networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4.1/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.yaml
At the end, the report is generated but the resource utilization for the rounds is empty. Any idea why this happens?
The only things that I modified were the txNumber, the tps and the money for each round. 
Thank you.

Hi,

I just started using Caliper to test a Hyperledger Fabric network. I am having a problem with Caliper using my network config file.
In my network I have one channel common to both organizations and one channel with only one organization, as follows:
channel0 including only Org0
channel2 including Org0 and Org1
In the network config file I have therefore defined two clients: one for each organization:
client0 from Org0
client1 from Org1

I set CALIPER_FABRIC_GATEWAY_USEGATEWAY, CALIPER_FABRIC_GATEWAY_DISCOVERY and CALIPER_FLOW_ONLY_TEST to true.
So I get an error at the beginning of the benchcmark because Caliper is trying to interact with channel0 using client 0. 
Is there a solution other than creating two different network files? One for each channel? There is no way to indicate that client 0 should only interact with channel 1?

within the callback, you can explicitly name the client to use to issue the transaction (`invokerIdentity` as an args parameter) otherwise caliper will pick one for you. Since you will likely be using the same callback for both clients, it would probably make sense to assign clients within the init stage of the callback, since you will have access to the zero based worker index (ie odd worker numbers use clientID0, even use clientID1)
</p>

Is the network created already?

<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:27:00 GMT):<br/>
This was my docker compose file

services:

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:32:16 GMT):<br/>
OK, and did you then create a network file using the mapped credentials for that network? The `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:7054` on an existing network would imply that the wrong certificates are being used
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:33:30 GMT):<br/>
teh caliper network config file describes the network to connect to, seems that you  used an alternative script to create a network and install smart contracts?
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:36:19 GMT):<br/>
nope....how exactly do i map the credentials?
how do i create a test network using caliper?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:36:53 GMT):<br/>
we have some samples in https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:37:46 GMT):<br/>
hopefully the readme there will help you create and use a test network ... dont forget to generate the credentials though!
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:42:32 GMT):<br/>
i have created all credentials using ./generate.sh in the four folders....how do i start the test network using caliper-benchmarks?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:44:00 GMT):<br/>
`caliper launch master --caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/samples/fabric/marbles/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4.1/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.yaml --caliper-workspace <path_to_caliper_benchmarks_root_directory>`
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:44:31 GMT):<br/>
something like that - ie pick the benchmark (test) the network (target) and specify the root directory comon to those as the workspace
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:53:31 GMT):<br/>
i dont think this starts a test network
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:56:33 GMT):<br/>
it will start the one specified under `--caliper-networkconfig`. Make sure the credentials for it exist, and there are no other networks already "up"
</p>
<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 08:07:11 GMT):<br/>
All right, I'll try that.
Thanks!

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 10:02:15 GMT):<br/>
I think it's a bug in the benchconfig file, where the docker monitor is configured. See the docs for the current syntax: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/caliper-monitors/#docker-monitor
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 10:03:43 GMT):<br/>
Caliper is added to the docker-compose file as any other service: 
https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/fabric_docker_local_tests/docker-compose.yaml#L265
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 10:04:24 GMT):<br/>
Then in the Caliper network config, you can simple reference the service names of the Fabric nodes:
https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/fabric_docker_local_tests/networkconfig.yaml#L116
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 10:06:48 GMT):<br/>
Does the doc page help? https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/ethereum-config/
Also, there is a sample in the repo: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/ethereum_tests
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 10:10:41 GMT):<br/>
I think the Ethereum/Besu adapter only supports a single target node
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 10:13:29 GMT):<br/>
The above error log is from the master process. There should be error logs from the worker processes that include detailed stack traces

I defined invokerIdentity to client1 in the approriate callback, but I notice that I got the error well before the execution of the first round in fact, during the preparation phase:

Hmm, the implementation could be that each client is assumed to have access (would have to check). Permissioned access across channels seems like something we would need to explicitly add as a new feature
</p>
<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:23:27 GMT):<br/>
Okay. I'll stay tuned if you find something new.

For now I will use one network configuration file per channel.

Hello,
I read in the comments above that you can benchmark a fabric network v2.x using caliper and you can issue administrative commands if you bind to v1.4.8
So, the following commands should do the trick:
npx caliper bind --caliper-bind-sut fabric:1.4.0
followed by:
npx caliper launch master \
    --caliper-workspace . \
    --caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig networks/fabric/v2/v2.0.0/2org1peergoleveldb_raft/fabric-go-tls.yaml
However, when trying to install the chaincode, the benchmark crashes like so:
Error returned from build: 1 cannot find package "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim" in any of: ....

This works fine for the 2org1peergoleveldb_raft network  from the example in /v1/v1.4.1/ Are there any workarounds?

Thank you, at the moment the config file is configured like so: 
docker:
-all
In order for redsource consumption reports to work, I have to explicitly write the name and the ip of every container?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 13:32:01 GMT):<br/>
Hey all. I ran into this issue, when both v1 and v2 Fabric images were present on my machine. The problem is the underlying ccenv image, which doesn't contain the usual shim packages anymore. v1 images somehow try to use the v2 ccenv image when building the chaincode (probably that's the `latest` image) that's why the build fails. Clean up the new ccenv images and try again. If you want to install v2 CCs with Caliper using v1 bindings, then make sure that your installed CC is v2 compatible (vendors the correct shim packages, etc)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 13:41:34 GMT):<br/>
No, `all` is a special keyword, so every container will be monitored. So just use the snippet from the docs:
```yaml
docker:  
    containers:
    - all
```
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 13:42:18 GMT):<br/>
If you have remote containers, then yes, you must list the remote host names (and configure the remote dockerd to allow remote connections)
</p>
<p><strong>NickName</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 14:13:46 GMT):<br/>
Thank you! In my configuration I had name: instead of containers: It now displays the resource monitor statistics for all my docker containers

Hi,
I have some questions. I'm using Caliper 0.3.2 with  Fabric 1.4.6.
Is it normal that only the metrics of the process monitor appear in the html report and not those of Docker and Prometheus?
Is it also normal that I only have the metric on the CPU usage and not the metric on the memory usage with the process monitor?
Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 13:09:40 GMT):<br/>
this would all depend on the configuration files that you pass to caliper
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 13:09:40 GMT):<br/>
this would all depend on the configuration files/settings that you pass to caliper

<p><strong>aqid</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 13:38:07 GMT):<br/>

so in the process arg, you probably need to be more specific with the process name as it will only pick up on process names that are visible `arguments: fabricClientWorker.js` for example.

looks like you might have grafana in the mix, i'd have a look to see if you are able to see the specified queries there - caliper uses the same Prometheus gateway for queries. I've seen missing data before, and it was a result of the platform I was running on - fixed by changing the volume mounts

With "fabricClientWorker.js" as argument, I don't have any metrics, that's why I put "caliper", with that I have at least the metric on the CPU. 
Here is the command launching  a worker:

Yes, I took the example which is in the caliper-benchmark project (version 0.3.0) for  prometheus-grafana stack: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/tree/master/networks/ prometheus-grafana

wondering if virtualbox in the mix is causing issues
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 14:41:30 GMT):<br/>
definitely worth logging into the grafana instance that you have and seeing if it displays anything

<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 14:48:09 GMT):<br/>
Apart from the points I mentioned above, prometheus-grafana seems to be working well for the moment.

<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 14:48:35 GMT):<br/>
Would you like me to check for the presence of a specific metric in Grafana?

about 10 containers
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:15:32 GMT):<br/>
hmm, ok, so they should certainly be getting detected
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:15:50 GMT):<br/>
and you are running the caliper command via CLI on the ubuntu VM?
</p>
<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:17:55 GMT):<br/>
with this screenshot, I launched from the Caliper container
</p>
<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:19:02 GMT):<br/>
and in this case Caliper does not detect the other containers
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:20:06 GMT):<br/>
ah!
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:20:22 GMT):<br/>
ok, yes - in which case it is a networking issue
</p>
<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:20:29 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:20:39 GMT):<br/>
kinda surprised there were no errors telling you that
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:21:20 GMT):<br/>
ok - so instead of localhost you will need the explicit container name, and all containers should be on the same docker network
</p>
<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:22:06 GMT):<br/>
I think I have a message like "no container detected" in the logs
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:22:34 GMT):<br/>
ok, that is probably due to the containers being on different networks
</p>
<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:22:45 GMT):<br/>
yes, i plan to modify the networking
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:22:46 GMT):<br/>
`docker network ls` will tell you the ones being used
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:23:15 GMT):<br/>
then docker netw
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:23:44 GMT):<br/>
`docker network inspect <network_name>` will tell you what containers live on them
</p>
<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:24:39 GMT):<br/>
I launch Caliper container with "  --network="host" " so I can reference the others containers with localhot and also launch Caliper from npx
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:25:48 GMT):<br/>
:thinking:
</p>
<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:26:37 GMT):<br/>
but I'm going to configure the Caliper container to use Faric's container network
</p>
<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:29:17 GMT):<br/>
for that I will also have to modify grpc urls of the containers of Fabric in the e network config file I suppose, by putting in place of "localhost" the name of the container
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:30:41 GMT):<br/>
target name override in the network config should sort that for you automagiclly
</p>

alright

there is a caliper-benchmark for the fabcar (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/tree/master/benchmarks/samples/fabric) that comes complete with a 2.1 network for instant use (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/tree/master/networks/fabric/v2/v2.1.0)
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:01:24 GMT):<br/>
What is your actual intent? `./startFabric.sh` is used in the CI pipeline in the samples ... it looks like it also creates a wallet with identities in it fr you to use directly as part of the output. Which means you could "just" use that wallet within caliper and perform a `--caliper-flow-only-test` interaction once you have created the required config and test files. So, kinda like this: https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/blockchain/tutorials/blockchain-performance-testing-smart-contracts-vscode-caliper but using the benchmark and callback files from the caliper-benchmarks repo I linked to above
</p>
<p><strong>aqid</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 19:14:11 GMT):<br/>
so first of all, I modify the config.yaml from their github https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmarks/samples/fabric/fabcar/config.yaml but apparently their configuration for `monitor` is not applicable for 0.3.2 - I know this by going through the source code and debug the process. Then I change the configuration to fit the requirement ( previously `monitor.process.command` to `monitor.process.processes.command` )

My intention is to test fabcar chaincode written in javascript.  
After following the instructions given in the lonk, I created the following network-config file and benchmark-config . I used the following docker-compose file to run caliper. Still getting a similar error.

Hi all, I am using the distributed deployment of workers and it works until a certain TPS (200 tps) with a throughput of 200 and no failed txs, when I increase the TPS, to 250 for example, the tests also seem to go wel with success in the logs of the workers, but on the moment the tests finish and the client should be disconnected, the workers crash with the following error:
```
node[1]: ../src/node_http2.cc:893:ssize_t node::http2::Http2Session::ConsumeHTTP2Data(): Assertion `(flags_ & SESSION_STATE_READING_STOPPED) != (0)' failed.
```

Does anyone know the reason for this?

Thanks a lot in advance.

have you tried connecting your docker container with fabric network? I have a feeling that that's the problem. I used to have connection refused problem because the containers are not in the same docker network
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:56:28 GMT):<br/>
hey, how do I connect the container with the fabric network?
</p>
<p><strong>aqid</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:58:53 GMT):<br/>
in the docker compose definition, use external network and specify the fabric network name ( in case of test network, the network name is net_test )
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:05:25 GMT):<br/>
I've come across that one as well - it's an internal node error that has hot other projects too. There's some investigation ongoing at the moment, with some projects "fixing" it by upgrading the node version. Is the TPS you are setting a global TPS, ie not a "per worker" TPS?

I added the network part but it still shows the same error
</p>
<p><strong>aqid</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:33:22 GMT):<br/>
in the caliper service you need to specify the network as well
</p>
<p><strong>aqid</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:34:02 GMT):<br/>
after that please inspect docker network to make sure all containers are in the same network. if the error still persists, the problem might lies elsewhere
</p>
<p><strong>aqid</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:34:23 GMT):<br/>
try changing localhost to docker hostname
</p>
<p><strong>aqid</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:34:40 GMT):<br/>
or check if the address is accessible using telnet, etc

Can we have Go SDK for testing with Hyperledger Caliper
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 10:36:31 GMT):<br/>
No, Caliper (currently) is only implemented in JS, so the Fabric adapter uses the Node SDK. The long-term plans include workers implemented in different languages, so adapters can also be implemented using different SDKs.
</p>
<p><strong>NickName</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 10:05:32 GMT):<br/>
Hello,
I was looking through the resource utilization statistics reported by caliper. In a six peer network, the report says that each peer uses 25% of CPU on average.
What does this mean precisely? Why do the percentages go beyond 100%?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 10:13:44 GMT):<br/>
Docker CPU stats can go beyond 100% if you have a multicore CPU. So your 6 peers use 1,5 CPU core in average during the benchmark
</p>
<p><strong>NickName</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 10:18:37 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thank you
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:39:50 GMT):<br/>
Hi @nkl199 Thanks for your answer. What I want is a global TPS, but I don't know how to specify if it is global or per worker. Where can I specify that, please?
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:39:50 GMT):<br/>
So if I use the inbuilt rate controllers, it can not be the problem?
I guess the node version is also a bit dificult, because I use the docker images, so I guess node with its version is already in there...
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:40:46 GMT):<br/>
the inbuilt rate controllers consider it as a global setting
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:44:21 GMT):<br/>
Do yo have any other idea what could be wrong or what I could do to solve it?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:45:26 GMT):<br/>
how many worker containers are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:46:05 GMT):<br/>
8, on two machines with both 4 CPU
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:46:56 GMT):<br/>
I tried also lowering the number of workers, using only 4 workers, but got the same error
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:47:33 GMT):<br/>
ok, was the TPS threshold the same there too?
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:48:27 GMT):<br/>
yeah, using the same TPS
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:48:47 GMT):<br/>
which connector?
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:49:08 GMT):<br/>
It all works until 200 TPS, if I try more, it fails

Hi! I understand that Fabric v2.0.0 is the latest stable I can use with Caliper. Can someone point me to a guide or tutorial on how to set it up with that?

I was following the existing tutorial and it was downloading v1.4.1 binaries (even when I've configured caliper to bind to v2.0.0:

caliper-benchmarks/networks/fabric/config_raft$ ./generate.sh

Pull Hyperledger Fabric binaries

===> Downloading version 1.4.1 platform specific fabric binaries
</p>
<p><strong>DT.Kernel</strong> (Sun, 05 Jul 2020 13:47:55 GMT):<br/>
And why is support for v2+ appears to be so thin in Caliper, when Fabric v2.1 is the latest stable (apologies if this is a misconception, but reading the docs that what it seems like).
</p>

there are some sample networks in https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks that include Fabric 2.0, and 2.1. The only "issue" relating to support for v2+ is that the admin client was removed in the fabric-sdk-node API for v2+. That being said, it is still possible to bind to the 1.4.x API to build the network, then change to the 2.1.0 API to perform the test phase
</p>
<p><strong>NickName</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 08:46:50 GMT):<br/>
Hello,
Is there any section in the caliper documentation that explains the purpose of the workers? I know that their number is configurable but what do they actually do?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:03:13 GMT):<br/>
they submit transactions to the System Under Test. These transactions are measured (timing information), the information from all workers is aggregated to determine transaction statistics
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:06:04 GMT):<br/>
https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/architecture/#the-worker-process
</p>
<p><strong>NickName</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:35:02 GMT):<br/>
Thank you. So what is the purpose of the clients then? I've seen clients in the configuration file for the network and I  thought the clients were responsible for generating the transactions, because they seem to have wallets.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:35:55 GMT):<br/>
clients === workers
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:36:33 GMT):<br/>
in the configuration file an client is an entity that has an identity within the system being tested, a worker uses that identity
</p>
<p><strong>NickName</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:39:46 GMT):<br/>
Oh, I understand. And if I specify in the benchmark configuration file that there will be 10 workers, but in the network file only two clients are configured, the system will be tested with two workers (clients), right?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:41:33 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:41:33 GMT):<br/>
mostly correct - 10 workers will be used, but they will pick from the available client identities

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:41:33 GMT):<br/>
mostly correct - 10 workers will be used, but they will pick from the available (2) client identities
</p>
<p><strong>NickName</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:48:24 GMT):<br/>
Ok. One final question. If a fixed rate controller were to be used in an attempt to generate let's say 800 tps (to stress the network), is using only one worker a bottleneck?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:55:00 GMT):<br/>
yes, the workers are currently nodeJS based, and that means they are single threaded - as soon as the CPU limit is hit, you have reached a rate driving bottleneck
</p>
<p><strong>NickName</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 11:04:42 GMT):<br/>
Ok, this was very helpful, thank you very much
</p>
<p><strong>NickName</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 13:49:56 GMT):<br/>
When running the simple benchmark, (benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml) is it normal that in the transfer round, some transactions fail or am I doing something wrong? Also, in the transfer round there are errors such as commit timeouts for transactions and MVCC_READ_CONFLICTS.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 13:57:47 GMT):<br/>
yes, this is "expected" if the driving rate is too high. MVCC_READ_CONFLICTS is due to a transaction trying to be processed when the information it is based on has changed. ie transaction a and b read information and then submit a transaction to change some information in the world state rev0 -> rev1, transaction a completes before before transaction b ... when b is applied to try and change rev0 -> rev1, it is already at rev1 ... so invalid (that's the jist of it, a quick google will give more info)
</p>
<p><strong>NickName</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 14:00:07 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Thank you.

Hi @nkl199 , I've checked the debug logs and there is not any more information than the one shared here already. What I did see is that it are only a couple of workers that have this error, while others did terminate correctly after sending the tx results back.
I am running different workers on the same machine and they use the same directory of the host machine as their workspace volume, could this be something that is wrong or shouldn't it make no diference?
And yeah, I think building an own image using node 12 would be something good to try. Can you share the files you mentioned, please? Thanks a lot!

Hello,
Does anyone know some resources / tutorials on how to benchmark a v2.1.0 caliper networks from the samples?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 10:03:26 GMT):<br/>
caliper acts as client using SDKs that target a SUT platform (such as Fabric) - you bind to SDK versions, not a platform. The target platform itself is a separate concern. The samples available for Caliper include V2.1 for fabric: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/tree/master/networks/fabric/v2 ... which essentially just call a basic docker-compose file to create a network `export FABRIC_VERSION=2.1.0;export FABRIC_CA_VERSION=1.4.4;docker-compose -f networks/fabric/docker-compose/2org1peercouchdb_solo_raft/docker-compose-tls.yaml up -d;` the export sets the version of the network created for you.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 10:05:46 GMT):<br/>
use these resources: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks
bind to 1.4.8 SDK and perform start, init, install phases
bind to 2.1.0 SDK and perform test phase
more details here: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/installing-caliper/#caliper-test-phase-control

I am unable to perform the install step on the v2.1.0 network even when binding to v1.4.8, because the chaincodes cannot be deployed on peers. Can you tell me how to solve this?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 14:53:27 GMT):<br/>
is there an error message? First point of call would be to remove *all* images from your system  using something like `docker rmi $(docker image ls -q)` ... sometimes there is a container conflict

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 18:07:48 GMT):<br/>
so it seems that the issue is within the chaincode containers - when they build, thay always look for ccev:latest ... and, well ... now latest is at 2.2, not 1.4

yes, but in fabric :wink:
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 18:09:08 GMT):<br/>
work around is to pull the required container: `docker pull hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:1.4.1` in this case
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 18:09:14 GMT):<br/>
then re-tag it as latest
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 18:09:29 GMT):<br/>
docker image ls to get image ID of the above

fair ahahah
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 18:09:51 GMT):<br/>
then `docker image tag d7433c4b2a1c hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:latest`
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 18:10:11 GMT):<br/>
but make sure the image ID is correct for you

I know there is this whitepaper on the website, but didn't find anything in the actual code (and I would assume this is specific to the Ethereum adapter? And it should know the consensus protocol?)

Is it possible to pass argument in init function of the go chaincode in caliper?

<p><strong>NickName</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 10:59:04 GMT):<br/>
Has anyone tried to measure differences between the same smart contract written in different programming languages? I have done some measurements on a v1.4.1 network and on a v2.1.0 network on the "simple" benchmark. For v1.4.1 I used the go version of "simple", but for v2.1.0 the go smartcontract did not work so the node version was used. There is quite a difference in throughput and latency between the results and I wonder if it's because of the language. The workload was the same in both cases, but it seems that way more transactions fail on the newer version because of peer timeouts and reaching some cocurrency limit, and this did not happen in 1.4.1.

Hi there, I'm a bit confused where are the clients placed in caliper. The docker-compose file doesnt not instantiate the clients. Only peers, ca and orderers. My question is that I want to instantiate more clients to increase the load.
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 15:51:40 GMT):<br/>
hum... I guess the clients are created at the workers, so I need to deploy caliper workers to distribuite/increase the load..
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 15:59:45 GMT):<br/>
depends what mode you are in - if you are using a single container, or "local" - then you specify the number of clients/workers to spawn in the benchmark file
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:01:10 GMT):<br/>
I'm using swarm. peers, cas, orderers are correctly distributed amongest 3 servers. but i suspect that all clients are spawn at the caliper manager host
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:02:17 GMT):<br/>
unless you specify dockerized workers, they spawn within the master container
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:03:32 GMT):<br/>
caliper itself is not containerized. I used npm local install. thus what you says confirms what I thought
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:03:52 GMT):<br/>
ah, ys - so it will spawn all workers locally as separate processes
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:04:40 GMT):<br/>
So i will look into dockerized caliper next. 
It's being a long battle... :-)
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:34:32 GMT):<br/>
using docker almost worked out but it didnt.. there is an issue with the docker image. 
problem is: the caliper launch command invokes the network's start command. this one boots up the docker swarm deployment. therefore there is a need to access docker inside the caliper container. which has no docker installed. and it fails.
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:36:27 GMT):<br/>
alternatives are: start the workers without docker, or rebuild the image such that the docker command is available. 
I think my deployment is complex enough to put docker inside docker and I will try out running the workers directly to see if it's cleaner
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:38:07 GMT):<br/>
could you:
- provide command to the container (`launch manager --caliper-flow-only-test`)
- map a caliper.yaml file that has an `only test` flag
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:38:39 GMT):<br/>
basically you need the manager to pick up on a flow flag
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:42:16 GMT):<br/>
I dont get it, sorry. what file are you referring to? the network or the benchmark configuration?
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:43:15 GMT):<br/>
I still dont understand caliper very well. sorry. I'm also kind of new to fabric as well
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:44:23 GMT):<br/>
either a `caliper.yaml` file that is in a mapped volume (https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/runtime-config/#configuration-files) or a command line flow flag (https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/installing-caliper/#caliper-test-phase-control)
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:45:01 GMT):<br/>
basically you can use flow control flags to perform specific phases only
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:45:40 GMT):<br/>
you could also just remove the `start` and `end` commands from the configuration file
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:46:15 GMT):<br/>
hum... let me think about it a minute
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:48:21 GMT):<br/>
if I remove `start` and `end`, how can i invoke them later?
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:48:35 GMT):<br/>
otherwise the experiment wont run
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:49:02 GMT):<br/>
start and end create/destroy the network - you mentioned you don't want/need that?
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:51:48 GMT):<br/>
no. 
my current deployment has caliper installed locally. 
when i invoke caliper launch master .... --network-config ..../fabric.yaml it starts the experiment. inside this file, the caliper block command invokes docker swarm deploy --compose file. this starts the experiment.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:53:38 GMT):<br/>
oh, ok
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:53:41 GMT):<br/>
if i create another docker-compose file to start the master/workers in a swarm, if fails because the master cannot invoke the start command of the fabric.yaml

it's possible for create your own bespoke caliper image that includes docker, but i'd probably be looking more towards a distributed use-case similar to https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/fabric_docker_distributed_tests

Yes, if you instantiate the chaincode through Caliper, then it's possible to set the `channels/<mychannel>/chaincodes/[i]/init` and `channels/<mychannel>/chaincodes/[i]/function` attributes in your network configuration file (just like for normal TXs). See the docs for these two attributes: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/fabric-config/#network-configuration-file-reference

Quick question: What is the appropriate rate controller to determine a network's maximum TPS?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:04:49 GMT):<br/>
The upcoming (currently unstable) release will contain the rate controller you're looking for: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vNext/rate-controllers/#maximum-rate
Feel free to take it for a spin :)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:14:19 GMT):<br/>
@dporto Some additional insights, since I've been using Caliper with Swarm for a while now.
1. The start/end commands should be lightweight commands for basic init/cleanup tasks. Since Caliper has its own container, these won't be necessary probably. The commands are definitely **not** for swarm deployments. 
2. You'll need the distributed deployment model of Caliper:https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/architecture/#distributed-message-broker-communication
3. Once the Fabric services are deployed, then you can deploy your MQTT broker, your Caliper Worker services (using the `launch worker` command for the service), and the Caliper master service (using the `launch master` command for the service).
4. Once the Caliper master service starts up, that will be the automatic start of your benchmark, targeting an already running Fabric (as Nick said). 

So I wouldn't touch the Caliper image, since you won't need docker-in-docker in a well-designed scenario. Especially not in a managed swarm cluster, where manager node access is needed for deployment.

worth noting that at the moment Caliper will report average TPS, which mean the "ramp" nature of the mentioned controlled will result in an average ... we plan to provide a "max TPS" output in the reporting to account for this

What I'm trying to accomplish is to see how many transactions a network can handle. To do so, I have used the fixed rate controller and gradually increase the send rate until the throuput started to lag behind the send rate. The disadvantage is that v2.1.0 peers seem to be very sensitive to periods where many transactions are present in the network and they start timing out. So I was wondering if there is a rate controller that stops sending transactions when peers start timing out.

here is a summary of what I've changed:
- the benchmark scenario file (config.yaml) , I changed workers block to:
workers:
    type: local

hello everyone, right now I'm testing my network that run on very small system (ec2 t2.micro with 1gb of ram) and instantiating the chaincode is really slow. is there anyway to delay the instantiating timeout? or is there anyway to skip instantiating process like in skipping channel create by using environment variable? i'm able to instantiate the chaincode using fabric "peer chaincode instantiate..." but whenever i tried to test using caliper with the same chaincode and version that has been installed, it gave me error "chaincode already installed" even though both chaincode are exactly the same but have different folder.

hello everyone, I think it's related to caliper. Right now I'm comparing the performance of multi hosts (4 hosts of ec 2 t2.medium 4 gb) and single node (16gb ram), but I'm confused why does my system on the cloud have better performance compared to my single node (201 TPS vs 87 TPS tested using caliper). when I tried to figure out just how fast is the connection between hosts by installing ping on peer and pinging hostname (peer1.org2.example.com on host B from peer0.org1.example.com on host A) and the ping was 0.078ms, but when i use ping outside of container with static IP (from host A to B ) the ping was 0.92ms?? I'm confused right now, does that mean the connection between peer doesn't actually mean they connected between hosts? (because when i ping from inside the peer container, all of the other containers have IP 10.0.2.x even containers from different hosts, so I doubt they actually pinged the real host). does that mean caliper aren't actually connecting via multi-hosts???

<p><strong>hazbiy97</strong> (Tue, 21 Jul 2020 23:00:12 GMT):<br/>
hello everyone, i wonder why i can't get above certain send-rate TPS even though i set it higher than that (i set 150 send-rate TPS but i only get 120 send-rate TPS even though my throughput TPS is almost the same send-rate, so my multi hosts should be able to handle above 120 send-rate TPS). it seems like caliper is limiting the send-rate because on my single hosts with higher CPU and ram, i can get 200 send-rate TPS even though it can't handle that and the throughput is dropping to 90 TPS because of CPU overload. can anyone tell me how to remove the limitation of send-rate?

When you call `invokeSmartContract` from your custom workload module, the last argument is the timeout in seconds. Try increasing that

Skip the end command executed by Caliper: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/runtime-config/#benchmark-phase-settings
Add the `--caliper-flow-skip-end` flag when you call Caliper

i have node v10.22.0
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 12:23:21 GMT):<br/>
The question is what nodejs version is available in the container spin-up by the peer
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 12:24:14 GMT):<br/>
how fo i check/fix that?
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 12:24:19 GMT):<br/>
*do
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 12:30:08 GMT):<br/>
I'd inspect this image: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L544
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 12:46:48 GMT):<br/>
how can i access this on my machine....also i get a different error when i try fabcar with java
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:26:19 GMT):<br/>
if you're running a local test, then the images should be present
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:26:31 GMT):<br/>
maybe not as the nodeenv, but ccenv image
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:26:54 GMT):<br/>
But this is really a Fabric question, so I'd try the fabric channel
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:43:50 GMT):<br/>
I inspected it, but hot sure what i should look for:sweat_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:46:05 GMT):<br/>
try to run a container from that image interactively, and check the node version
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:53:13 GMT):<br/>
v8.16.1.... this is the node version in the container
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:53:26 GMT):<br/>
@klenik how do i upgrade it?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:59:16 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if you can. Try using newer Fabric images, like 1.4.8
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:59:25 GMT):<br/>
hopefully it has a newer node version
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Tue, 28 Jul 2020 14:05:37 GMT):<br/>
i was able to upgrade the node version but the problem still persisted
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:36:09 GMT):<br/>
the java version works perfectly....only the javascript version seems to have the chaincode instantiation issue
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 10:04:17 GMT):<br/>
hmm, maybe Fabric v2 contains a fresh node version (if it's an option for you)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 10:04:52 GMT):<br/>
Although accessing the file system from a chaincode seems like a strange move, if you don't mind me saying :)
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 12:12:57 GMT):<br/>
i was able to instantiate the chaincode code.... turn out i didint install fabric-contract-api and fabric-shim api
</p>
<p><strong>NamanGupta1003</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 12:13:41 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>HelmiTrabelsi</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:34:11 GMT):<br/>
it is in the core.yaml file ??
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:35:24 GMT):<br/>
yeah, should be there somewhere ... but the main fabric channel should be able to pin pint it faster
</p>
<p><strong>HelmiTrabelsi</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:36:47 GMT):<br/>
I change it and restart the network but I get the same error
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:37:49 GMT):<br/>
then i guess the configuration setting is not being picked up - either a bug to be reported to fabric, or you need to do something different

Hi. I saw that latest version of  Caliper is not supported for Fabric 2.0 (Chaincode Lifecycle). Will it be fixed anytime soon ? Or is there a work around for that ?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 18:04:17 GMT):<br/>
@tharindupr As of now, the administrative actions are removed from the Fabric SDK, so there's nothing we can do to support the new lifecycle. You can set up your Fabric network through the peer CLI, then connect to the initialized network with Caliper
</p>
<p><strong>tharindupr</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 05:41:36 GMT):<br/>

Hi. I tried the fabcar benchmark sample for fabric 2.1.0 and caliper 0.3.2. I use 170 tps and 340 as the max assets. I observe that in the `helper.js`, the process of `createCar` is skipping some index, hence causing errors when doing benchmark. e.g when queryCar tries to get index 336 it returns error because the helpers.js create object for index 334, then jump to 337 without creating 335 and 336. Is this the expected behaviour?
</p>

Hi I have a question about Caliper (Installing locally from source). In the documentation, it says you can check (and change) them in the package.json files of the corresponding packages. I'm quiet confused which package.json should I chose and how can I change it? Say I would like to change the SUT to ethereum.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 10:03:53 GMT):<br/>
picking a target platform to test is done via the network configuration file, the package update will only modify the version of the node-sdk used to interact.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 10:04:29 GMT):<br/>
so the network file would look like: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/ethereum_tests/networkconfig.json
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 10:05:02 GMT):<br/>
and you can modify versions in https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-ethereum/package.json to change the ethereum dependancies

Hve a look in the peer logs, it might be that you are using the wrong certificates

<p><strong>aqid</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 12:45:41 GMT):<br/>
It only shows intermittently though - when benchmarking, some transactions failed due to no discovery results. I don't think certificates are the problem here
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 12:46:19 GMT):<br/>
stange - the "no discovery results" error is from the base SDK being used, not caliper
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 12:46:49 GMT):<br/>
what fabric sdk are you bound to?
</p>
<p><strong>aqid</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 12:47:17 GMT):<br/>
2.1.0 - in the end I decided not to use gateway discovery to avoid this issue.

Hi! Does Caliper support the latest version of Sawtooth? The documentation mentions support for 1.0 versions of sawtooth and "latest" (which would be 1.2.5).
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 14:09:14 GMT):<br/>
caliper supports (or at leat tries to support) SDK versions for target platforms and not the platform itself
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 14:31:30 GMT):<br/>
@aqid This could be an issue with the node-sdk itself. Might be worth asking on the #fabric-sdk-node channel to see if it's a known issue or not and whether to raise a jira about it.
</p>
<p><strong>aqid</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 15:57:50 GMT):<br/>

Hi, Guys, i am facing the following issue regarding the deployment of caliper as a docker container via docker-compose up:

Error: Benchmark configuration file "/hyperledger/caliper/workspace/benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml" does not exist

This happens on versions 0.2 and 0.3 as well.
</p>
<p><strong>casm3</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 20:34:43 GMT):<br/>
Actually the error on 0.3 is this one:

error [caliper] [cli-launch-master]       Unexpected error during benchmark execution: Error: Invalid "mychannel" channel configuration: child "chaincodes" fails because ["chaincodes" is required]. "contracts" is not allowed
</p>
<p><strong>tharindupr</strong> (Tue, 04 Aug 2020 04:47:22 GMT):<br/>
See whether you have correctly mounted the config.yaml on the docker-compose.yaml file.
</p>
<p><strong>tharindupr</strong> (Tue, 04 Aug 2020 05:28:01 GMT):<br/>
I hope the same SDK is used when we are implementing the API to expose chaincode functions via HTTP. If so invocation works perfectly well in the REST API.

I should have solve the dependencies but it still doesn't work. I even tried to install the @hyperledger/caliper-core in the caliper's node_moudle but it cannot find it as well.
</p>

- modified ethereum package
- ran bootstrap
- tried node ./<path>/caliper.js command
?
</p>

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 04 Aug 2020 11:03:04 GMT):<br/>
where/when does the failure occur? I'm wondering if you need to package the callbacks you are trying to use as well. If you start by testing with the current test files used within the integratino tests (packages/caliper-tests-integration/ethereum) you can be assured that they *must* work .. we can then diagnose issues in the samples

I would like a confirmation on how to write callbacks with version 0.3.2.

Should we write them as async functions and do the invocations inside without await as in this example from the documentation?
```
module.exports.run = async () => {
    let txArgs = {
        // TX arguments for "mycontract"
    };
    
    return bc.invokeSmartContract(contx, 'mycontract', 'v1', txArgs, 30);
};
```

If we don't want to analyze the result, we are therefore free to make the invocation without await?

Hi there,
caliper is working in a distributed docker swarm. I know need to find how how to saturate my deployment.
I'm a bit lost with some parameters.
Specifically:
crypto-config.tx has a parameter Users, how does it connect to caliper? How many users shall I create?
benchmark/scenario/simple/config.yaml has workers/number. How does this number connects to the number of users? are they only the instances of caliper and it will spawn the necessary number of concurrent users to saturate the deployment?
</p>

the network config file specifies available identities to use. The identities match those requested in the callback/work load module. the `workers/number` parameter tells caliper how many test workers to spawn, and each of these can use the same listed identity to transact with... unless you have a specific use case the requires multiple identities with different roles, it is usual to have the caliper workers using a single identity within testing. if you are looking for for realtime information, then you need to use the prometheus/grafana configuration - which is detailed in the observers section of the caliper docs

Correct. If you don't do anything with the results, just return the promise directly
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 12:50:38 GMT):<br/>
You are requesting 3 signatures from Org2. The `signed-by` indices should be 0, 1 and 2 (instead of 1, 1, 1)

I'm still confused with the role played by monitors and observers, what is the difference? 
From what i inferred from the documentation, monitors gather information about the system resources (CPU, Mem, Net)  and observers about the application/chaincode (TPS, Latency, success, failure...). Am I right?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 14:47:01 GMT):<br/>
observer will detail (print to console) the current transaction information at a high level (submitted/failed/pending) monitors are for resource consumption collection
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 14:48:25 GMT):<br/>
so observer data can be collected locally while monitor will be gathered somewhere?
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 14:49:04 GMT):<br/>
can I save the observer output to a file?
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 14:49:49 GMT):<br/>
That's probably what I want. I dont need CPU,Mem/Net information because im collecting it in a different tool.

<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 14:50:59 GMT):<br/>
if I can print out all the metrics to console timestamped I will be happy.

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 14:51:07 GMT):<br/>
in the next release you will be able to save to a file, though worth noting that caliper will draw that information from prometheus ... so best get it from there

you could modify you callbacks to also perform logging, but then you would have to perform aggregation from those logs ... which would be hideous

also I'm using the networks/prometheus-grafana/docker-compose-fabric.yaml I also had to change it to add to the swam network. 
I appended a few changes as the original file seem to work for single host deployment. namely: set placement to a specific host (all the prometheus stack to the same host) and added an alias to each container of prometheus stack for reference within the swarm, namely: prometheus container have an alias to prometheus.example.com, pushgateway also have one to pushgateway.example.com and so on.. 
because when the join to the swarm the container is prefixed with the tag and things break apart.
finally the prometheus-fabric.yml file was updated with the targets:
prometheus.example.com:9090, pushgateway.example.com:9091, every peer, and every orderer

Hi,
Is it possible to have percentile indicators with Caliper?

<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 21:26:02 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 08:47:37 GMT):<br/>
The short answer is no, only min/max/avg. The long answer is that percentile calculation would require storing TX results, and Caliper is currently "stateless" to support long running benchmarks (approximating the percentile would be possible with limited state storage). The best way to capture percentiles right now is to save the TX results in your workload module, and do your own post-processing.

Hi there, so far i was using caliper running locally form the source. However there are complications integrating with prometheus inside the docker swarm. (got some weird errors from clients trying to access endpoints private to the swarm like peer0.org1.example.com  ... etc) Then I decided to move caliper master and workers into swarm too.
A few problems raised and I hope someone can help with:
I'm using a distributed deployment (mqtt and several workers + master) it was working. The docker-compose example does not include the specific variables to work in this setting such as endpoints to mosquitto and communication parameters. I followed the patter and added them but I dont know if they actually exists.
from dockerfile:
    command: launch worker  
    environment:
    ...
    - CALIPER_WORKER_REMOTE=true
    - CALIPER_WORKER_REMOTE_METHOD=mqtt
    - CALIPER_WORKER_COMMUNICATION_ADDRESS=mqtt://mosquitto.example.com:1883
can you confirm they do exist?
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 11:06:41 GMT):<br/>
also, the caliper code mounted is already bind to the SUT, but when the container starts, it start compiling stuff again and it breaks. not sure why. Is there a way to skip binding?

Ok I figured. I compiled capiler with an ubuntu container. probably issues with libc is preventing it to work. 
I will create a container for clients myself using the same environment.
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 13:08:48 GMT):<br/>
for those variables, I will simply append them to the launch command just in case. it should do.

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 13:16:39 GMT):<br/>
@dporto You can set the desired settings through either environment variables, command line arguments, or configuration files, whatever suits your deployment: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/runtime-config/
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 13:17:40 GMT):<br/>
Also, if you omit the `caliper-bind-sut` setting, the binding is skipped by the manager/worker processes.

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:34:20 GMT):<br/>
hi, a few questions above so will try to answer them:
- MVCC_READ_CONFLICT is a fabric thing, because you are trying to change something based on out of date information. More/less of these is simply a result of the system being able to process transactions such that there is less occurrence 
- Not familiar with the benchmark you are running, but it is possible that the workers are not adding worker UUIDs to help make transactions unique
- For monitoring docker resources, the docker sock mapping is required by the master container
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 08:14:10 GMT):<br/>
thanks for replying @nkl199 , here are some answers:
- the MVCC behavior is consistent and the only thing I made different in both benchmarks was that one run in containers and the other dont. I ssh into the machines, open terminals and type the commands manually (tmux). There are 4 clients connected via mosquitto each one connected to one peer. There are 4 peers in total.
With the fabric network up, I run the baremental benchmark several times with the same result. 
Caliper has initialized the benchmark only once to install the smartcontracts. and the command line run only the --caliper-flow-only-test
After installing the contracts, I run either the baremetal command (master and workers) or start each container manually
In all cases they connect and issue transactions
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 08:19:37 GMT):<br/>
- the benchmark Im using is the standard one. benchmark/scenario/simple/config.yaml with the only difference that i increased the number of workers. it is running open bank accounts, query and transfer.
after running the caliper startup steps (start/init/install) some contracts are installed. I did not change that
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 08:19:59 GMT):<br/>
thanks for letting know that the master container require docker mapping. I would test that eventually

For context, I'm trying to build a simple real case scenario.
fabric network: 2 (ca) orgs, 3 raft nodes, 4 peers (2 per org) 
caliper nodes: 1 client per peer (4 in total) + master node/mosquitto/prometheus/grafana
A total of 14 nodes. each one with one container (except that i co-locate master node, mosquitto and prometheus in one node).
any smartcontract. got the example from scenario/simple.

once this is done I will try to find the peak throughput of  my deployment for find the saturation point. no changes required. just vanila caliper/fabric
but there is no complete real world example of distributed setting to follow. 
Therefore,  I'm reverse engineering parameters and merging (several dated) tutorials in a try and error fashion.

@dporto this line is your problem: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/blob/871355a8a66bf42f56b8e1a65cda5402a8d1a184/benchmarks/scenario/simple/open.js#L62

When you run a worker inside a container, they all get the 1 PID. So they'll try to modify the same accounts at the same time 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:18:52 GMT):<br/>
Try to introduce some other form of randomness. Not sure whether the worker index is passed to the callback modules in v0.3.2, that would be the ideal "random seed" 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:20:02 GMT):<br/>
Baremetal doesn't have this problem because all the workers run in the same kernel namespace, having different pids (or even if distributed to multiple machines, the probability of pid collision is less) 
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:28:26 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @klenik I would never guess that the issue was there... .

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:29:30 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it's a general issue :) the sample was intended for localized deployments in the beginning

<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:30:13 GMT):<br/>
would you suggest another sample for a distributed one? I dont need to use specifically this one.

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:34:38 GMT):<br/>
The sample workloads utilize the PID when they need "random" values. You could use true random values instead, and save the generated accounts so the modules of the other rounds can access them 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:35:20 GMT):<br/>
It's not ideal, since you have to store state, but can't think of other simple solutions 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:38:08 GMT):<br/>
(An other, more complex solution is to run caliper twice. First with an init round, with a single worker, where you load the network with predictable items. Then a second caliper instance can use multiple workers to do anything with those items. For example, you load items with IDs [1...1000], then the second instance can safely use rand(1,1000) to avoid/minimize mvcc conflicts) 
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:58:18 GMT):<br/>
Would also be possible to use the mosquitto for it?
I see it generates a unique id per client connection. Could caliper use it internally as a random seed for workers?
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 14:05:29 GMT):<br/>
it seens that hostname is also available and returns a string with a container name. it's also another way to inject randomness

Whatever works, I like environment independent solutions better, so you don't run into issues like the previous one. The mosquito uuid won't be passed to the workload modules, since that's a configuration detail. The worker index is constant and independent from everything else

2. I want to request 1 signature from each organization(I have 3 organization) using 'and' policy.  How am I supposed to write?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 21 Aug 2020 12:41:35 GMT):<br/>
Signed-by references an index from the identities array above it, which lists the org identities/roles. N-of means that at least N signatures/endorsements must be collected (you can nest n-of expressions). The fabric (and sdk) docs explain this better, this is just the gist 
</p>

Changing open partially solved the problem. But I've seen other issues with "transfer.js". Still digging...

Hello everyone,
i want to create a sawtooth PBFT test network and benchmark it with hyperledger caliper.
I am having a problem running a sawtooth test network using docker on ubuntu 18.04.
I ran the sawtooth PBFT tutorial:
https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/app_developers_guide/docker_test_network.html

using this YAML file:
https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/app_developers_guide/sawtooth-default-pbft.yaml

command i run: docker-compose -f sawtooth-default-pbft.yaml up(node start,it works fine)
docker exec -it sawtooth-shell-default bash (works fine)
curl http://sawtooth-rest-api-default-0:8008/peers(works fine)
response`:{
"data": [
"tcp://validator-4:8800",
"tcp://validator-3:8800",
...
"tcp://validator-2:8800",
"tcp://validator-1:8800"
],
"link": "http://sawtooth-rest-api-default-0:8008/peers"`

But when I run this command: curl http://rest-api:8008/blocks
it gives me an error: curl (6) could not resolve host rest-api

I will be thankful for your help

This looks to be very geared purely to sawtooth - have you tried their RC channel for assistance on network creation?

possibly a lerna update, we can build and push package locks (should be doing that tbh)

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 12:58:45 GMT):<br/>
sawtooth is falling behind development at the moment, sadly the best way to see how it is used is though either the sample benchmarks, or within the integration tests .. but make sure you checkout the correct branch that matches a released version

Hi all, is there any active development to support fabric v2.2+?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 14:46:05 GMT):<br/>
sdk or SUT?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 14:46:36 GMT):<br/>
if "can u test fabric 2.2, then yes ... caliper "just" uses the sdk to interact and that is currently not broken
</p>
<p><strong>qadahtm</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:17:36 GMT):<br/>
I meant for SDK. I am new to hyperledger. So I am not sure if that is actually necessary.
</p>
<p><strong>qadahtm</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:18:15 GMT):<br/>
Is there any benefit to support v2.2 SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:18:47 GMT):<br/>
you can test 2.x Fabric with 1.4 and 2.x SDK< but at the moment there is no internal binding for the 2.2 sdk, however you could provide an override to use the sdk during the bind process if desired
</p>

<p><strong>qadahtm</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:19:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I think I successfully tested that.
</p>
<p><strong>qadahtm</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:21:09 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I was wondering if there is any active efforts for developing the internal binding.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:21:58 GMT):<br/>
there are, but we also permit an override so that people can bind to any version sdk they wish
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:22:14 GMT):<br/>
just in case someone wishes to test with an unreleased sdk for instance
</p>
<p><strong>qadahtm</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:23:20 GMT):<br/>
I see. Thanks @nkl199! That makes sense.
</p>
<p><strong>qadahtm</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:23:48 GMT):<br/>
Where can I get more information about the development effort?

Hi all (seems I can't do an 'at-here') We are approaching a new release of Caliper, and it has breaking changes (all for the better!). Once the release has been processed, we would like to invite all those interested to a teleconference where we will talk through the changes that have been made - whilst we have also been making changes to the documentation as we incorporate the changes, it is hoped that having us talk through them with examples will be of use to you. :thumbsup:

Hello, I am trying to run some caliper tests on a fabric network with fabcar chaincode that is already deployed. I get this TypeError:
* Handled unsuccessful "prepare" message for worker 3 and test round 0 with error TypeError: Class extends value #<Object> is not a constructor or null*

Any ideas how to work around this? I use code from caliper-benchmarks repository, benchmarks/samples/fabric/fabcar.
After some research, it seems that it is an issue of circular dependency, since I am trying to extend an imported class (?)
Any ideas on how to work around this?

I use nodejs v10.

Hi there, how does the linear-rate rate controller steps advances with time? I have 4 worker nodes and configured start tps as 400 and end tps as 20000 for 300s but it seems that's not enough time for caliper to get to maximum TPS

I tried with linear-rate, fixed rate and also I tried with a mix of fixed-rate and zero-rate.
I can see a spike in the begining in TPS but it drops quickly. the rate is not steady even though the network usage is far below the maximum usage, or CPU or memory of the nodes.

<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 16:53:50 GMT):<br/>
here is the line plot from prometheus:

<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 16:55:22 GMT):<br/>
This experiment is have 5 rounds. The first one one is the open operation followed for a zero-rate (pause for 30s) then open operation again with higher fixed tps.

I dont get these spikes... 
and it is also not clear to me why the round 0 of client 0 that should last for 300s last for that long.

Do you guys have any benchmark values published?
I have a deployment with 2 orgs, 3 raft orderers, 4 peers, 4 caliper workers, each one in a separate node. plus 1 manager node(caliper master+mqtt+docker swarm master)
I dont have a reference of what good numbers are but the best i got was < 700 TPS with A LOT of failed transactions (only open)
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 17:08:21 GMT):<br/>
that's for caliper 0.3.2 with fabric v1.4.1

There are some published figures here which may be of help. Not looked at them myself https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper-benchmarks/

okay... I'm still trying to undestand these numbers...
I got a maximum of ~700 TPS which I've found very low initially.. I was expecting thousands of transactions per second...
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 10:24:52 GMT):<br/>
but putting it into perspective, it seems that bitcoin is roughly 4TPS and ethereum 15TPS..
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 10:25:00 GMT):<br/>
perhaps that's the right comparison.
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 10:25:31 GMT):<br/>
I had PBFT numbers in mind, in particular BFTSmart can get to 20k TPS..

@hassan_ahmed4621 , so things to check that I can think of that might be causing this error. 

1. that the chaincode was installed and instantiated. This should be clear in your test-network folder (that was created in the fabric tutorial) or if you are using your own network, should be found there. Also check it was done so on the correct organisation (so org1 in this case).

2. That you do have a client under ‘admin@org1.example.com’ this is the default one, but if you changed it then you will need to change any mentioning of admin@org1.example.com to the name you gave it. 

3. It could be the case of the arguments for InvokeSmartContract (which is in the queryAssetBenchmark.js) are wrong. It should have 4 arguments. Those defined in the init function:  ```ctx = context; myArgs = {
                chaincodeFunction: 'createCar',
                invokerIdentity: 'Admin@org1.example.com',
                chaincodeArguments: [assetID,'blue','ford','fiesta','jamie']
            };```
And those defined globally. Which is: contractID=‘fabcar’; version = ‘0.0.1’;

Those are the most clear faults that might be causing this.

<p><strong>hassan_ahmed4621</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 14:18:37 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for response @RosieM  
So 
For point 1 i did deploy chaincode and i suppose it installs and instantiates it automatically with current fabric version and ./network deployCC for test-network did ended fine. 
For 2 yes i do have admin@org1.example.com in my network config client section
For 3 Actually i want to share that when i tried without passing any invokerIdentity it worked fine
_"And those defined globally. Which is: contractID=‘fabcar’; version = ‘0.0.1’;

Those are the most clear faults that might be causing this that I can say without seeing any code."_
can you explain a bit how to define contractID and version

<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 14:33:57 GMT):<br/>
Nice, i think i've found the issue with the performance. The TPS remains similar but the success rate improved A LOT. and that's just the first tweak.

Pictures are making more sense now:
</p>
<p><strong>RosieM</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 15:08:09 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, so this is in your queryassetbenchmark.js file. At the top before the init function should be this code. ```
'use strict';

module.exports.info  = 'Template callback';

const contractID = 'fabcar';
const version = '0.0.1';

let bc, ctx, clientArgs, clientIdx;
```   Also to note, in the network_config.json file there should be a channels block which also has the following ```
"chaincodes": [
                {
                    "id":"fabcar",
                    "version":"0.0.1"
                }
            ]
``` So both those should match, if you have upgraded your contract its likely version 0.0.2. But these should be the default values.

Hello everyone, 
I have a Hyperledger Fabric V2 running and I am trying to connect Caliper to my network. I want to use an exported FileSystemWallet and have Caliper use identities stored in that wallet to interact with my network. I have created an admin user called “admin.Org1” and stored it in the wallet. However, when I launch Caliper I see the following error:

``` bash
error [caliper] [message-handler]       Handled unsuccessful "init" message for worker 0, with error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'privateKey' of null
    at Fabric._initializeUsers (/home/ubuntu/.nvm/versions/node/v8.11.1/lib/node_modules/@hyperledger/caliper-cli/node_modules/@hyperledger/caliper-fabric/lib/adaptor-versions/v1/fabric-gateway-v1.js:704:45)
    at <anonymous>
```
It seems like either the connection to the wallet has a problem or Caliper cannot properly retrieve the user from the wallet. I would appreciate any help to fix the error. 
The wallet and clients in my network configuration file are as following:
```    
"wallet": "../pubsub-interop/blockchain-client/javascript/wallet",
"clients": {
        "admin.Org1": {
            "client": {
                "organization": "Org1"
            }
        }
    },
```
I run Caliper with the following command:
```
caliper launch master --caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/myAssetBenchmark.yaml --caliper-networkconfig networks/network_config.json --caliper-workspace ./ --caliper-flow-only-test --caliper-fabric-gateway-usegateway --caliper-fabric-gateway-discovery
```
I can share the complete error log if needed. Thanks in advance.

The wallet structure was changed between versions of node-sdk (1.x and 2.x) so what might have happened is that you have built a wallet which is in the v2.x structure but you have bound to a 1.4 sut and so it actually can't read the wallet format.
</p>
<p><strong>sghaemi</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 16:20:05 GMT):<br/>
Thank you so much. This was exactly the problem.

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 18:06:47 GMT):<br/>
seems odd to get some statistics and not others there. Maybe the code trying to capture the stats isn't collecting it correctly. Not in a position to try it myself at the moment, maybe worth rasing a github issue about it and provide details ?
</p>
<p><strong>hassan_ahmed4621</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 18:07:56 GMT):<br/>
yeah i will open and issue because its kinda strange as some stats are showing

sharing benchconfig if you can have a look at spot anything wrong ..just wanna be sure its not some dumb mistake on my part before opening issue
</p>
<p><strong>hassan_ahmed4621</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 20:32:48 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel Found it, the problem it was caused because i was using network config file template of couchdb and network was using leveldb as i ran network with couchdb cpu and disk stats showed up
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 21:20:37 GMT):<br/>
ok, glad you sorted it out
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:38:16 GMT):<br/>
The worker processes are single threaded. Your settings mean that by the end, a single worker must output 5000 TPS. That means that the worker must schedule a TX at every *0.2 ms*. That's not enough time for the workload loop to start over. Based on your graphs, you reached a 175 TPS per worker load rate. Which sounds reasonable. So for 20k TPS you'll need around 115 workers. Which also sounds about right, a continuous 20k TPS is a lot.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:44:36 GMT):<br/>
Makes sure you checkout the same benchmark repo version as the caliper version. The master branch is updated for caliper v0.4.0-unstable, which doesn't have the `callback` attribute anymore in the benchmark config file.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:52:35 GMT):<br/>
Can you share some insights about improving the sending rate (and throughput) in the example?
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 09:27:54 GMT):<br/>
The issue was the fabric parameter MaxMessageCount that defines the number of messages in a batch. The long tail in the first picture (https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=Ef48aQm3ffMd3f92x) made me suspect of queuing. The experiment was supposed to last only 300s but there was still processing long after that.
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 09:30:30 GMT):<br/>
The value of MaxMessageCount was set to 50. There are 3 upper bounds to play with:
the BatchTimeout, MaxMessageCount and AbsoluteMaxBytes (+PreferredMaxBytes)
From what i understood a new block is generated every BatchTimeout with at most MaxMessageCount or AbsoluteMaxBytes whatever comes first.
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 09:31:44 GMT):<br/>
Lots of operations failed due to queuing timeouts.
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 09:33:10 GMT):<br/>
I first increased the MaxMessageCount to a very large number as I dont find the number of operations a meaningful metric. Some operations are long and large others are short and small, their number dont say much. The size of the block is more important in my opinion
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 09:35:33 GMT):<br/>
I kept the block size (AbsoluteMaxBytes) at 1MB as it is similar to bitcoin. MaxMessageCount was set to 5000 initially (planning to set it to 100k) but I still havent decided what makes sense to BatchTimeout

Hi guys just a quick question I have a running network with 16 peers but only 4 have chaincode installed how should i set network configuration because its giving me error for those peers that chaincode not installed which i know ..should i just remove those peers for network config yaml file under Peers section and organizations>peers section ? (i want the resource utilization of those peers as well)
</p>
<p><strong>hassan_ahmed4621</strong> (Fri, 11 Sep 2020 06:32:19 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=E5hDf4aqZ6AW8egjX) Update : if i remove those peers from network config file i get thrown error 
```child "peers" fails because ["peer1.org1.example.com" is not allowed ..```
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 11 Sep 2020 06:57:42 GMT):<br/>
@hassan_ahmed4621 You can configure the peers under the `channels.peers` attribute, whether they are endorsing peers or not. https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/fabric-config/#network-configuration-file-reference
Also, the resource monitors are independent from the network configuration, so it's also okay to remove the peers from the network config (but remove them from every section: orgs' peers, peers, channels' peers, etc)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 11 Sep 2020 15:48:13 GMT):<br/>
@klenik can you look at the question I asked above? I think something small is not right but have no idea what. If you take a look at the command I use, you probably will see immediately. Thx

Hi, everyone, Minifabric has just added caliper. to run a test using caliper, you simply need to run two commands if you do not really have anything at all. please see doc here https://github.com/litong01/minifabric/tree/master/docs#run-caliper-test
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:48:41 GMT):<br/>
here are the two commands needed to run caliper test.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:48:54 GMT):<br/>
```minifab install,approve,commit,initialize -n samplecc -p ''
minifab caliperrun```
</p>

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 10:11:59 GMT):<br/>
jmeter is pretty popular, of course if you fancy maintaining the sawtooth connector, there's an opportunity there!

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:11:42 GMT):<br/>
Make sure that if you mount your artifacts outside of the default workspace (as I see you don't change the default) then every path in your config files are also absolute, otherwise they'll be resolved (incorrectly) relative to the workspace.
Also, why do you mount/need the docker socket? The Caliper image doesn't contain docker, so you can't really do much with it (I think).
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:12:40 GMT):<br/>
Are there any other errors before the log snippet you shared?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:14:41 GMT):<br/>
Seems like a mismatch between your Caliper version and benchmark repo version. You're probably using the master benchmark repo, checkout the v0.3.2 tag.
</p>

@dporto The proposal response errors are peer-side errors, so you need to increase that on the server side. The commit timeouts are client/Caliper-side errors, you can increase them in your workload module (callback file).

how to improve tps 
i am getting low tps around 90
i need something 1000 if possible
is this possible?
what is the maximum tps we can achieve and how to achieve it?

You are using the master branch of the benchmarks repo, which is for the upcoming v0.4.0 release. After cloning the repo, `checkout` the `v0.3.2` tag of the benchmark repo, that is compatible with Caliper `v0.3.2`
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 21 Sep 2020 08:13:46 GMT):<br/>
That could depend on a LOT of factors:
1. Your contract logic.
2. Your network topology (number of nodes).
3. Your distribution of the network (multiple physical/virtual hosts), or in general the available resources for your nodes.
4. Your SUT settings (this is the most complex part, you have to tune your system based on your contract and workload).

So there's no precise answer to your question, just the usual "it depends" :)

The doc details how to correctly run the examples: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/installing-caliper/#overview
```
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks.git
cd caliper-benchmarks
git checkout v0.3.2
# proceed with the example
```
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 07:42:58 GMT):<br/>
1.Perhaps v1.4.3 is not suitable for Caliper?Such as the code "--caliper-networkconfignetworks/fabric/fabric-v1.4.1/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.yaml",the document"fabric-v1.4.3"(i change the code from v1.4.1 to v1.4.3 in order to  match my fabric version) not only do not exist in the document "fabric",but also do not exist in the document "v1" where have some version like v1.4.1,v1.4.4 and so on.
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 07:47:39 GMT):<br/>

Hello,

I'm trying to set up a private Ethereum network and bind it to Hyperledger Caliper. However, I couldn't sufficient sources to do that. Recently, I used geth v1.19 Ethereum client and created two nodes, initiliased them with the same genesis.json file. But I couldn't go beyond that point. I tried to bind it to Caliper and the error I got as the following.

For more information, please see https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/issues/776#issuecomment-624771622


I may not achieve to set up a proper private Ethereum network for Caliper. I would be grateful if you could help me out with testing the private Ethereum network with Caliper.

Checkout this local network example: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/ethereum_tests/config/docker-compose.yml
You must expose/configure the websocket endpoint for your node (refer to the geth docs)

also worth making sure:
- crypto content has been generated
- docker volume prune to make sure volumes are empty
- delete any crypto stores that might locally exist and are being used (or change crypto config path in caliper network config file)

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 13:34:53 GMT):<br/>
i try to add things to the caliper docs where possible
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 13:39:30 GMT):<br/>
thank you very much anyway and i will learn how to work out the error tommorrow.If you can tell me how to figure the error out  ,i would be very appeciate .Thanks again.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 13:43:21 GMT):<br/>
usual process on failure is:
- check all docker containers are up
- inspect logs for those that have failed
- depending on error, check component has what it should or is complaining about
- possibly increase debug level

<p><strong>miribeiro</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 15:22:27 GMT):<br/>
Hi!
I'm trying to test an existing network with Caliper (v0.3.2).
This network has 3 organizations (Org1, Org2, Org3), with one peer each, and 2 channels where Org1 has access to channel1 and channel2, Org2 has access only to channel1 and Org3 has access only to channel2.
I specified this realtions in configtx.yaml and enabled the discovery service, using the flag on the caliper launch command.
However, an error appears saying:
"[Network]: _initializeInternalChannel: Unable to initialize channel. Attempted to contact 1 Peers. Last error was Error: Channel:channel1 Discovery error:access denied"
Why Org2 tries to access the channel2 even though it does not have access to it? Does anyone know how to resolve this?
Thank you in advance for your attention!
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 16:36:25 GMT):<br/>
Hi, caliper is not designed to be a network deployment tool, though it can be used for creation of basic networks. Caliper assume that everyone has access to everyone; best thing to do would be to hand craft (or automate with a suitable tool) the network, and then connect caliper to it in a "test only" mode
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 16:45:44 GMT):<br/>
@miribeiro you probably can take a look at minifabric which set up network easily with your own setup/layout, then run caliper with just one command, then it produces a report. Fast and easy.
</p>
<p><strong>miribeiro</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:03:25 GMT):<br/>
The network I mentioned is already deployed through Fabric.
The issues I'm having are related to the 'client' section of the network_config.json. 
When you're saying "that everyone has access to everyone" are you saying that the clients used in Caliper must access all channels mentioned in the network_config.json?
</p>
<p><strong>miribeiro</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:07:11 GMT):<br/>
It is not the same logic as setting up Caliper on an existing Fabric network? In Caliper v0.3.2 docs appears an example of that.
</p>
<p><strong>miribeiro</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:08:44 GMT):<br/>
Even though the clients don't have access to specific channels in the network created?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:12:58 GMT):<br/>
what is the intended test scenario?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:13:43 GMT):<br/>
for instance, do you intend to performance test the chaincode using clients from ultiple organisations, or just one of the organisations?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:13:43 GMT):<br/>
for instance, do you intend to performance test the chaincode using clients from multiple organisations, or just one of the organisations?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:14:36 GMT):<br/>
if the latter, then you can just use a reduced network config that only lists Org1/2 and another with org1/3
</p>
<p><strong>miribeiro</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:27:21 GMT):<br/>
In a first phase, test the network using a client from one of the organizations yes. Using 2 network_config files seems the best solution so far, so thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>miribeiro</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:28:32 GMT):<br/>
And at a later stage, the ideal would also be to test using clients from multiple orgs. Is that possible?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 18:21:25 GMT):<br/>
@minifabric creates a network using your own spec or a default spec, then you can simply invoke minifab caliperrun command to run caliper test against the network you setup using minifabric, very easy, you can certainly place your own code in the place of the code comes with minifabric to run whatever the test you prefer. Take a look at the doc on this at docs/README.md, you will never need to struggle with Fabric.

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:44:20 GMT):<br/>
that would be the issue - there is a helper script generate.sh or similar
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:45:43 GMT):<br/>
can i move teh generate.sh from fabric1.4.3 to caliper?
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:46:25 GMT):<br/>
would that can help?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:47:00 GMT):<br/>
are you using a caliper sample?
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:48:16 GMT):<br/>
i dont know what do you mean.i indeed follow the article https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/installing-caliper/
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:49:55 GMT):<br/>
the fabric network being created, is that a caliper-benchmarks sample?
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:51:30 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:54:41 GMT):<br/>
i mean i studied hyperledger fabric at first. I have the loss of some files when i  run the caliper command,then i will copy the file in hyperledger fabric to meet the demand
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:55:25 GMT):<br/>
i guess that step may generate some  mistakes?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:58:42 GMT):<br/>
that is possible, tho the errors above indicate that the network is not up. Once the network is up, i would recommend fllowing htis tutorial: https://nklincoln.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/fabric-tutorial/tutorials-fabric-existing/
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 09:04:55 GMT):<br/>
so when the network is up,do the caliper-benchmarks include folders named crypto-config and bin,because i know these folders are essential for hyperledger fabric
</p>

Hi sir,

I've been trying to run your local network example but I'm getting an error. Here is what I've done.

I cloned the Caliper repository.

Then executed the following commands.

npm init -y
npm install --only=prod \
    @hyperledger/caliper-cli@0.3.2
npx caliper bind \
    --caliper-bind-sut ethereum:latest
npx caliper launch master \

    --caliper-benchconfig packages/caliper-tests-integration/ethereum_tests/benchconfig.yaml \
    --caliper-networkconfig packages/caliper-tests-integration/ethereum_tests/networkconfig.json

The error I got when I run above commands:

fabric peers in the docker compose file will name the docker network to use when building/instantiating chaincode. It must be the available network. Do a `docker network ls` to see what you have, and modify the file accordingly

@yongmu-lol It appears that you are using an older Docker-compose version, which simply ignores the underscores in the parent directory name (which is used to generate the network name by default): `2org1peergoleveldb_raft_default` <->`2org1peergoleveldbraft_default`

Update your Docker-compose version (recommended), or don't use underscores in the parent directory (you need to modify a lot of paths, not recommended)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 14:07:55 GMT):<br/>
The ethereum node is not ready for connections yet. Check its docker logs to see the reason (maybe a config error).

Hi, I have a question regarding running the SmallBank benchmark on Fabric. I noticed that we can set `txnPerBatch` variable to control the number of transactions sent per client request. Is this also considered when computing the throughput results? or is it ignored and the throughout result that reported correspond to the number of requests per second regardless of the value of `txnPerBatch`

Hi all, Caliper 0.4.0 has just been released :tada: 

There are *significant* breaking changes for all users (hence the jump from 0.3.x to 0.4.x), but there are also significant features to take advantage of. We have updated the documentation accordingly, but intend to present these features on the next Caliper call on Wednesday the 7th of October (please check the Hyperledger Calendar for more details and access https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings) ... we hope that you can make it!

By designed your chaincode in a way that TXs have minimal data dependency on each other. Not always possible to completely eliminate it. But this is a Fabric chaincode design issue. Find some pointers here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/high-throughput

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 14:28:39 GMT):<br/>
There's no direct integration with grafana yet (if you mean including time series data into the report). But Caliper can now expose TX-related metrics for Prometheus. So after a benchmark run, you can use Grafana+Prometheus to visualize some things. Metric details: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.0/caliper-monitors/#prometheus

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 18:04:09 GMT):<br/>
for now, stick with 0.3.2 and BTW, this is to integrate caliper with Minifabric which is now hyperledger lab project. https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/minifabric
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 18:04:54 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 18:05:39 GMT):<br/>
if you start up fabric network using minifabric, you can simply do minifab caliperrun to run tests.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 18:06:14 GMT):<br/>
but it uses 0.3.2, I tried to go 0.4.0 but with the above described issue, I hold that off.
</p>
<p><strong>dporto</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 18:09:58 GMT):<br/>
that's probably too late for me now. I've designed a bunch of playbooks to deploy any number of organizations peers, orderers and caliper workers + prometheus and node exporter. 
I have not see how is it done the inventory of nodes, or if it works with prometheus... in fact looking at it quickly it doesnt seems to have enough docs and im a bit tired of reverse engineer stuff and combine different tutorials to make a (supposed) simple distributed deployment work

A lot of the SUTs were dropped in 0.4 (as having so many different versions of the same almost exact level such as 1.4.1, 1.4.2 etc didn't make sense). It's possible to define your own SUT through a caliper config however.

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 08:17:21 GMT):<br/>
there was a timeout on deploy. Those are fabric resources that we have no control over, so would redirect you to the fabric rocket channels for issues there ... but my suspicion is that the javascript contract took too long to build and so you hit a timeout
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 12:40:10 GMT):<br/>
traced it to an issue within NodeJS itself - moving caliper images to a NodeJS version that contains the required patches
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 12:41:27 GMT):<br/>
seems that an internal node error was thrown that blew up the worker process, but manager continued as separate process.

@nkl199 happy that you were working on this issue. Should I give it a try with a new image? Is it on docker hub?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 12:48:41 GMT):<br/>
we will be backporting the fix, so it will take a little while yet - the most recent unstable image is up there but is only valid for the 0.4+ configuration
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 12:48:55 GMT):<br/>
would be great if you could have a look at it though :thumbup:
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 12:54:19 GMT):<br/>
So if I take the latest 0.4.0 unstable image, it should contain the fixes? @nkl199 
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 12:55:22 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 13:01:45 GMT):<br/>
@nkl199 ok, any newer 0.5.0 image than that one will also contain the fixes or only this one?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 13:02:41 GMT):<br/>
only this one at the moment, we will release 0.3.2 and 0.4.0 images with the same fix though

this result uses 2 workers and 800 transactionLoad. it seems to me in this little env, the best combination is to use 2 workers with transactionLoad being 400.

@tongli You can add arbitrary key-values under the `info` attribute in a network configuration file: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/blob/master/networks/fabric/v1/v1.4.4/2org1peercouchdb_raft/fabric-go-tls-solo.yaml#L26-L31
These will be included in the report as-is
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:17:25 GMT):<br/>
ok. let me give it a try. thanks @klenik
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:21:46 GMT):<br/>
So basically I can put any info there as I please?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:33:48 GMT):<br/>
Yep. Typically network information stuff, because workload descriptions have their own place in the benchmark config
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:34:12 GMT):<br/>
But yeah, any key-value pair, no restrictions
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 17:08:50 GMT):<br/>
@klenik Added these in the network configuration file. same thing though. but this is using 0.3.2 for testing
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 17:08:58 GMT):<br/>
```  "info": {

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 17:35:30 GMT):<br/>
@tongli So this kind of embedding is not supported by the HTML report template anymore, but if you but the key-values under a `details` attribute (so they're under `info.details`), then they will be included in the report as stringified JSON

Hello everyone, 
I have Fabric v2.0 running, and I am using Caliper to test the network. I run my benchmark with a fixed-rate rate control and I want to see how the network reacts when I change the rate control’s send rate. When using numbers less than 65 tps for the send rate, everything works perfectly fine. However, if I use a number more than 65 tps, the report shows a send rate around 65 rather than the original send rate that I set in the configuration file. There are no errors and all the tests are successful, but it seems like the send rate is limited. Does anyone have an idea why this is happening? Does this mean I have reached the hardware limits of my machine with 65 tps?

The following is my config file:
``` 
name: my-asset-benchmark
description: test benchmark
workers:
  type: local
  number: 3
rounds:
  - label: subscribeToTopic
    description: Subscribe to topic benchmark
    chaincodeId: broker
    callback: benchmarks/callbacks/broker/subscribeToTopic.js
    txNumber: 500

Hello Team,
Am trying to connect Caliper to my own network and want to check if we have any option for CALIPER_NETWORKCONFIG where instead of mentioning a custom modified network details .yaml file can we consume the connection profile json file for fabric network

Or is it like every-time we want to connect Caliper to any new network we have to manually modify the netowork config file
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 14:58:11 GMT):<br/>
the caliper network configuration file is bespoke to each network you wish to connect to
</p>
<p><strong>suneel18</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 15:18:12 GMT):<br/>
is there any template for CALIPER_NETWORKCONFIG file since the benchmark folder has lot of samples and even includes commands to start and stop a network
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 15:19:20 GMT):<br/>
have you had a look at the fabric tutorials- https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.0/fabric-tutorial/tutorials-fabric-existing/

Hi there,
Im running experiments with fabric+caliper and in my scenario I need to redeploy the a clean network a few times. I was trying to backup the containers but noticed that at the peers the chaincode has a different name for repository. I wish to avoid the external download of these containers by caching (saving) them (for a quick clean redeploy).
I wonder from where is the chaincode container for the peer is being downloaded and why they are different for each peer:
dev-peer1.org2.example.com-fabcar-v0-80b68d3a5d35507df5aff4085d6f72e7e86a1cb844dde4502427e096b54d936c latest 8989419e438a 42 minutes ago 162MB

are these dev-peers containers created locally based on the fabric-peer container or by caliper??

Thank you for your answer. Yes, the fabric is running on the same machine. Also, I tried increasing the number of workers to 5 and the exact same thing happened.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 15:45:34 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, the nodeJS runtime quite quickly becomes CPU constrained as is single threaded. Depending what spec your machine is, you could simply be reaching the limit.
</p>
<p><strong>sghaemi</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 15:46:55 GMT):<br/>
Thank you so much. This is probably the case. I will try running Caliper on a seperate machine.

Does caliper 0.4.0 supports fabric 2.2.1
am trying to  run but it fails with
Error: Unknown "fabric" SDK version "2.2.1"
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 22:11:21 GMT):<br/>
You can bind to the 1.4 fabric node-sdk to work with a 2.2 fabric network for now. Hopefully we will be able to include a version of fabric node sdk 2.2 soon

<p><strong>suneel18</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 05:59:37 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:23:02 GMT):<br/>
2.1 is available to use and can be used against a fabric 2.2 network but I would still recommend binding a to 1.4 to use against a 2.2 network

How does Caliper outputs a chart? I saw in documentation that it is possible to add an option within the benchmark configuration file for each monitor, but I did that and the report only outputs tables. Am I missing something? Thanks in advance!

@miribeiro it produces a html file

If everything is working as expected. You can use minifabric very easily to experience that if you are doing fabric stuff

It worked! I think there was a wrong indentation :sweat_smile:

Hi there, I'm having a hard time understanding the output of caliper in different fabric configurations.
I tried several combinations of fabric configuration parameters, namely: 
BatchTimeout,
BatchSize-MaxMessageCount
BatchSize-AbsoluteMaxBytes
BatchSize-PreferredMaxBytes
for caliper I picked the rate-control: fixed-backlog 
also varied the number of workers which are containers in a single host or across 2 or 3 server hosts.
The results are hard to understand and I wish to configure something that looks like a real deployment to compare. Below I post what I have found so far.

The failures I've found are due to timeouts. They happen mainly at the beginning of the experiment. I'm thinking on adding a zero-rate controller to give time for the system to setup the peer container. These are not failures due to concurrency.

you would need to look into the peer/chaincode  logs there - enabling higher trace levels in the caliper output will help too as caliper will dump SDK reported errors so they are visible

you bind to an SDK, not a benchmark: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.1/installing-caliper/#the-bind-command

So you want to bind to the ethereum sdk, and then target a sample

@nkl199 Conduct performance analysis of my fabric network which I set up natively on a vagrant machine. The network I built has two chaincode which communicate to accomplish a certain task.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 21 Oct 2020 13:18:50 GMT):<br/>
so i'm going to assume you need to submit a transaction on one chaincode, then complete/agree the transaction by submitting a transaction on the other chaincode?

So there is no way to influence which node becomes the leader, the only thing you could do (potentially) is to figure out the current leader, kill it, and wait for another node to take over .. but you would not be able to specify which node was to then become leader

orderer nodes?
</p>

No! For example in marbles contract with fabric (in caliper benchmark) consists of only two organization with one orderer.

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 21 Oct 2020 13:47:18 GMT):<br/>
so caliper can pull information on each component, docker based, or Prometheus query based. Performance itself is measured from the perspective of the client sdk. If you have prometheus connected to fabric peers (or the orderer nodes) the wealth of information that you can pull out is pretty impressive, since the components expose quite alot (the difficulty is getting the right query!)

Hi, 
I need clarification on the meaning of the "Send Rate" metric in Caliper report. Does this metric mean that a proposal has been submitted for endorsement or that the endorsed proposal has been submitted to the ordering service?

Another related question in my benchmark is that by increasing the number of my workers (from one to more than 10) in a distributed configuration ( with diffferents hosts and with the messsage broker ), the "Send Rate" indicator does not increase significantly. What is strange is that the peers don't show a high CPU consumption either, unlike CouhDB. Is there something to do with the endorsement settings or should I just increase the number of endorsers at this point?

Thanks

Hi,
I need a clarification on the meaning of the "Send Rate" metric in Caliper report. Does this metric mean that a proposal has been submitted for endorsement or that the endorsed proposal has been submitted to the ordering service?

they need to be spawned as separate docker containers, there is an example in the caliper main repo https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/fabric_docker_distributed_tests

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 26 Oct 2020 09:10:58 GMT):<br/>
at the moment, the only way to test it would be to do one batch of "phaseA" transactions followed by another batch of "phaseB" transactions. You raise a valid use case - feel free to raise an issue in the main repo to request a feature that would do what you are asking (total time for series of transactions) :thumbsup:

Hey, I have 3 clients defined in network-config.yaml, and if I run Caliper invoking the first client everything works fine. But if I specifiy the benchmark to be invoked by the second or the third client, it gives an error related with DiscoveryEndorsementHandler. 
I can't understant why because I have all the keys and certificates for all clients. How are these clients 'used' in Caliper?

each client is considered an identity to use when creating a connection to the network peers. If you are using the "gateway" mode (which is the only way to use discovery) then a gateway is created and persisted for each client listed in the configuration file

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:28:25 GMT):<br/>
@darksidergod To coordinate assets/anything between separate chaincodes/channels, you'll probably need to implement a commit protocol on your chaincode level (2/3 phase commit, HTLC, or anything). Since you already have your chaincodes, I'm guessing this part is taken care of. On the Caliper side, you can list both chaincodes in the network configuration file. In your workload module, you can choose a target chaincode and invoker identity for every TX. You can code any logic in your workload module, so you could maintain such "user workflow states" in a single round. It requires a more complicated implementation, but such closed-loop user workflow implementations are possible.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:30:31 GMT):<br/>
Supporting such multi-TX request sessions on the Caliper level is not trivial, since we don't store TX results, just aggregate them.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:36:21 GMT):<br/>
Caliper reporting is platform-neutral, so the send rate is calculated from the total number of sent TXs divided by the round time (so it's an average sending rate). Whatever "sent" means, it depends on the platform, but the "time for sending" usually denotes the very first TX-related activity in the connector. For Fabric, it is before the TX is sent to the endorsers.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:37:12 GMT):<br/>
The zero send rate is an anomaly, something's wrong. Can you reproduce the 0 rate? Which Caliper version are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:40:37 GMT):<br/>
The throughput is calculated only from the successful TXs: number of successful TX divided by the round time.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:42:46 GMT):<br/>
Latency descriptors are shown for every TX, AFAIK.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:42:46 GMT):<br/>
Latency descriptors are also shown for successful TX, AFAIK.

okay, and what is the default of localHost flag? I'm asking because I can run the discovery through a fabric-sdk-node app with peers on remote hosts, but when I run Caliper with a second or third client it gives an error saying that it "failed to connect to all addresses".

About the anomaly on the "Send Rate", here is the configuration I used:
- Docker image in version 0.3.2.
- Binding: Fabric SDK 1.4.11
- SUT: Fabric 1.4.6

Since then I have migrated to version 0.4.1 of the Caliper Docker image. My code has changed in the meantime and I will not be able to easily return to the state of the project where the anomaly occurred. And I do not recall that the anomaly has occurred more than once.

it is possible that the configuration file isn't quite right and so the option is not being detected (i had this) probably worth double checking the indentation on the yaml file, or use a json structure file

Caliper currently supports Hyperledger Besu, Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum and FISCO BCOS networks only. Support for a new platform requires implementing a connector for that platform: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.1/writing-connectors/

I wanted to prove that Fabric can support a throughput of 1000 tx, I want to know some information. I am using tha fabcar chaincode on 2org1peergoleveldb_raft network:
1- What is the relation between the send rate and the number of worker (When I increase the number of worker more than a max number the send rate and throughout decrease)
2- How I can increase the send rate to increase the throughput to reach 1000 tps
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 08:56:35 GMT):<br/>
workers are nodeJS based, so are single threaded. To increase the "system pressure" it is advised to use a distributed configuration via docker swarm or similar

Hi, I want to evaluate the performance of my Fabric network, but I'm having some difficulty figuring out the values that I pass to the rate controllers. 
What I understood so far is that if I run Caliper (0.3.2) with a fixed "txNumber" and vary the "tps" on fixed-rate controller I can see the maximum throughput of the solution if the throughput stops increasing, is this correct? Does this correspond to using the linear rate with an interval of "tps"?  
What about the fixed backlog? How are the "unfinished_per_client" transactions related to throughput?
Thank you in advance!

essentially you are correct, the issue is when the system under test cannot deal with the number of requests, at which point you will get timeouts. A linear rate controller (that slowly increases tps) while observing the send/achieve rate in grafana would visually display the tipping point for you. Fixed backlog aims to maintain a fixed load, and you will get the maximum TPS at that load
</p>
<p><strong>miribeiro</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 10:35:21 GMT):<br/>
Currently I'm not using grafana but eventually I'll set it up so I can visualize it better.
That fixed load is represented by the "unfinished_per_client" value? How do I know which value I should pass there? The documentation gives the example of 5, but I've also seen examples where it is passed 100. Does it depend on the "txNumber" that is passed?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 10:36:57 GMT):<br/>
it depends on what the system can sustain during steady state operation, if the loading is too high then you will get timeouts
</p>
<p><strong>miribeiro</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 10:46:58 GMT):<br/>
So a try and error task if I understand correctly, where it is given several values until there is a timeout?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 11:26:36 GMT):<br/>
that is the common approach without using a visual real-time display

Hello, I am trying to use my own smart contracts to test my Ethereum network but I am having problems to generate the callbacks, is there any kind of tutorial to see it and try to adapt the ethereum benchmarks to work with my Smart Contracts?
</p>
<p><strong>miribeiro</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 18:20:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to run several tests, while changing the rate controller, in order to reach a conclusion about the performance and another question came up: what is the default backlog for the fixed-rate controller?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 18:38:05 GMT):<br/>
the only tutorial so far is for fabric, but the callbacks are generic - check out the docs

Hi! @nkl199 thanks for that. Actually, I was able to run bootstrap command afterwards and it was successful. My question is can we install caliper with caliper benchmark workspace repo from source code?

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 13 Nov 2020 09:59:04 GMT):<br/>
The caliper project has some samples used as integration tests under packages/caliper-test-integration

If you want a wider set of samples, then I would recommend cloning the caliper-benchmarks repository

ah right, to test with souce you can execute the CLI command directly (we do this in the integration tests) so use `node <path to caliper>/packages/caliper-cli/caliper.js launch manager ....`

You should use a representative test network. Caliper makes a client connection to a network, and  consequently the action will be interact with the network exactly as a client would (including ledger growth)

Hi Team. In my chaincode I am verifying an attribute from Certificate.So I need different chaincode invoker. In Caliper how do I generate numbers of invokerIdentity. Right now I have seen If I mention clients in network-config it automatically generates the client identity. But for that also I need to enter client section may be for 5000 identities 5000 entries. Does there any better option?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:02:31 GMT):<br/>
To verify the certificate attribute, do you need 5000 different certificates, or could you loop around a list of 100 50 times?
</p>
<p><strong>adgupta011</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:03:18 GMT):<br/>
list of 100 50 times will also work
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:03:52 GMT):<br/>
Is this for fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>adgupta011</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:04:18 GMT):<br/>
Yes Hyperledger Fabric v2.1.0
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:06:12 GMT):<br/>
OK, final q - is the idea to pass the certificate into the chaincode for analysis (by any client), or to connect with a client using the certificate(s) and then issue a transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>adgupta011</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:10:01 GMT):<br/>
Its validating identity and then issue transaction
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:16:35 GMT):<br/>
ah, ok so in this case the requirement is to use a series of different client connection, that are back by different certificates.

The route I would take here is to create a set of identities for inclusion within the caliper configuration file, and pass an array of the identity names into the callback/workload as arguments, looping over these as invoker identities for each Caliper transaction during the workload generation

You can rely on caliper to create these for you (as you mentioned) or use cryptogen to get the actual certificates that you want, and map these

<p><strong>adgupta011</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:02:04 GMT):<br/>
But I would like to avoid declaring all identities in network-config.js
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:03:57 GMT):<br/>
Caliper only has knowledge of the identities declared in that file, and they are the only ones that may be used to submit transactions to the target system. All client connections are made (and persisted) in advance of running the workload phase
</p>
<p><strong>adgupta011</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:05:08 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Also in config.yaml I am seeing an option to declare client like this
</p>
<p><strong>adgupta011</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:05:10 GMT):<br/>
clients:
    type: local
    number: 5
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:05:24 GMT):<br/>
that is the number of "worker threads" that are used
</p>
<p><strong>adgupta011</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:05:24 GMT):<br/>
What is this for?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:05:50 GMT):<br/>
so in the above, caliper will spawn (or assume the existence of) 5 workers
</p>
<p><strong>adgupta011</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:06:44 GMT):<br/>
Ok. One more thing. Just a general question reagrding caliper. Suppose I am getting a good result with let say 100 workers. Now in my actual application what needs to be changed to achieve 100 worke's equivalent TPS
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:12:11 GMT):<br/>
not sure if I understand that one, Caliper uses rate limited workers to  drive a workload. Ultimately it will determine the achievable/sustainable workload of the system that is ultimately used by an application
</p>
<p><strong>adgupta011</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:02:18 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your explanation and sorry for late reply.

<p><strong>adgupta011</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:10:40 GMT):<br/>
If I am executing with 10 worker nodes at fixedRate 150 TPS does that mean In each second 150*10 transaction would be added or 10 workers would submit 150 transactions together in 1 second?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 20 Nov 2020 14:50:21 GMT):<br/>
the rate driving is "as the SUT would see it" so however many workers there are will contribute to the defined workload requested

Hello,
I am a new to JS. I have a problem with "Gathered TX data" (https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.1/fabric-config/#gathered-tx-data). 
I have an example from that site:
<code>
const result = await this.sutAdapter.sendRequests(requestSettings);
let shortID = result.GetID().substring(8);
let executionTime = result.GetTimeFinal() - result.GetTimeCreate();
console.log(`TX [${shortID}] took ${executionTime}ms to execute. Result: ${result.GetStatus()}`);
</code>
How I can log to console "time_orderer_ack" and "time_endorse" for each transaction?
I use Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.8 with golang smart contracts + Caliper v0.4.1.
Thank you in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 23 Nov 2020 15:24:41 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger Composer is end of life now and the only thing that remains are the npm modules and source code. Depending on what you are doing it may still be possible to get things working. If you were using 0.20.x version of composer then it should still be able to run on fabric 1.4 but there are no guarantees. I would highly recommend that anything using hyperledger composer is dropped and moved to using the native fabric libraries for writing chaincode and client applications
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 23 Nov 2020 15:28:38 GMT):<br/>
Those values won't be available if you use the gateway option `--caliper-fabric-gateway-enabled`, hopefully if you don't specify that option you will get those values
</p>
<p><strong>MichalJarosz</strong> (Mon, 23 Nov 2020 15:35:10 GMT):<br/>
Ok, so I have to run the tests with this option. But how do I get this data  for each TX to the console later?
Will they show themselves? Or should I call some function?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 23 Nov 2020 15:43:11 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, I can't answer that really. I've looked in the caliper docs and can't see a way to provide extra information into a benchmark report. Looks like you would have to manage it all within your workload module and get it to output something. Hopefully someone with more knowledge will provide an answer if there is an alternative
</p>
<p><strong>MichalJarosz</strong> (Mon, 23 Nov 2020 15:45:25 GMT):<br/>
A small correction, I want to put it on the Linux console as a log, not into the html report.

I have only one peer & one orderer. Everything is running in my local machine.
1. For same caliper configuration(txcount,worker, fixed rate tps) I am getting different Throughput (TPS) at different time(Sometimes it 400 TPS & sometime around 291 TPS). Does the result depends on any network bandwidth? In my local machine cpu & memory consumption is almost constant.

2. Few times send rate tps is lower than Throughput (TPS). How it is possible? 
+------+-------+------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------------+
| Name | Succ  | Fail | Send Rate (TPS) | Max Latency (s) | Min Latency (s) | Avg Latency (s) | Throughput (TPS) |
|------|-------|------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| open | 38296 | 21   | 410.15          | 10.43           | 1.43            | 5.82            | 451.1            |
+------+-------+------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------------+

3. If I enable prometheus monitor, send rate TPS drops than the one declared in config file. With local monitor it remains the same.

absolutely, there is a large amount of data flow through the system and network bandwidth can impact results. That is still quite a large performance swing though, so my initial thoughts are that the local machine is running other background tasks that are impacting the performance run. I've had that quite a few times, and it was bad enough to jump onto a bare metal server to get repeatable runs

Thanks. I would check my background task as well. I am using caliper 0.3.2. For 0.4.1 I was getting '_Error: Invalid "mychannel" channel configuration: child "contracts" fails because ["contracts" is required]. "chaincodes" is not allowed_' . So I shifted to 0.3.2.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 16:05:13 GMT):<br/>
ah right, yes - there is a configuration change there such that in the config file "chaincodes" is now "contracts"
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 16:06:18 GMT):<br/>
I would highly recommend moving to the 0.4 version as there are some significant improvements, not least those available from the generation of TPS statistics and the way you can use Prometheus

I have implemented marbles chaincode with caliper benchmark. I tried to create file but was unsuccessful. I tried a read file function but it says file or directory not found. However, the file is in the directory. My question is what is the logic behind not reading or writing to file by a chaincode funciton ?

chaincode cannot create files, only interact with the ledger. 

The callback/workload module can. You will need to use fully qualified paths.

how to set Targetpeers in async submittransaction () of query.js in caliper ?
</p>
<p><strong>CarlosMorales</strong> (Mon, 30 Nov 2020 19:29:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi, is it possible with Caliper to send transactions in parallel?, when you set up the accounts, you just introduce one, so although you put 5 workers, it is one after the other.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 07:20:41 GMT):<br/>
It's not one after an other. TXs are submitted asynchronously (even within a single worker they can overlap), and independently in each worker (overlap among workers).

I have a question. In order to test the use of the kubernets high throughput Fabric system, I used the distributed mode of caliper 0.3.2. I have used five machines but the sendtps is only 1000+, and the tps result is also around 1000. How to continue to improve sendtps, adding more machines? Is there a better way?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:51:16 GMT):<br/>
I would recommend moving to 0.4.x Caliper, there have been some significant enhancements in the core. 

How many workers and what rate driving are you using? The workers themselves are single threaded, and so to increase send TPS (having determined that the workers are the bottleneck) the only way would be to increase the number of worker clients being used.

1. I have 2 peers in a single organization with Endorsement Policy "MAJORITY Endorsement". For write transactions 80% of the endorsements are going to peer1 inspite of its ledger height is lower during execution.For Read transaction it is automatically scaling to both the peers. I tried changing sort criteria to random in chaincode arguments but that too is not working.
2. For prometheus resource metrics few times the parameter vales are coming as 'NaN' though there is valid data in Prometheus & Grafana API.
3. During start I am seeing many errors ' error: [EventService]: send[peer1.xx.xx.com:8051] - #3 - Starting stream to peer1.xx.xx.com:8051 failed'. Can I disable those errors.

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 17:12:40 GMT):<br/>
1) you can pick different endorsement strategies if using the gateway option
2) this might be an issue in caliper
3) Depends on if you use the gateway option or not. It is likely to be a fabric-sdk-node issue. The errors cannot be disabled as they are generated and dumped by the sdk. To my knowledge they  cannot be turned off completely - though would recommend checking inthe fabric-sdk-node channel

if those don't suit, you can provide target peer overrides within the workload arguments themselves

Moreover, the samples need to be updated, especially in the benchmarking folder. For example, one will need to remove the dash (-) from the sub-property "type" of the property "rateControl". This has been a frustrating issue to me with the new caliper version.

That's specifically a Docker issue for Mac introduced in 2.5.0.0 looked like they haven't fixed it in 2.5.0.1 either :-(

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 07:06:14 GMT):<br/>
That's an issue with fabric, they removed all the `latest` tags. Check that you are using the latest version of fabric as that should be fixed or retag ccenv as latest in your local docker images

I used 4 servers and each server has 15~20 workers, send TPS is set to 2000. It seems not helped that increasing the number of workers. The CPU usage of each server is very high. If I use more server, the send TPS will increase.Can 0.4.x caliper do better？

@sroopsai The `permission denied` message indicates that the user running Caliper is not permitted to open that file. As I see from the path, you are using the docker image of Caliper, meaning you mount your local workspace directory into the Caliper container. The container uses the `node` user to run Caliper. Make sure you don't create the workspace files as root, so the container user can access them. To help you further with the problem, we'll need more details about the steps you performed.

@sroopsai Are you executing these commands as `root` user (sudo), or as a standard user? Can you verify the permissions on the problematic file after running `./generate.sh`?
</p>
<p><strong>sroopsai</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 14:43:11 GMT):<br/>
as a standard user
</p>
<p><strong>sroopsai</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 14:43:22 GMT):<br/>
I am not using sudo
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 15:07:19 GMT):<br/>
And how are the file permissions set?
</p>
<p><strong>sroopsai</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 15:09:28 GMT):<br/>
600 mode
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 15:19:36 GMT):<br/>
That means only the owner (your user) can access the files. It's strange that the Fabric binaries would generate such files. As a workaround I suggest setting more permissive flags for the files in your workspace

Hi, I am trying to Setting up and Running a Performance Benchmark on an existing network. my fabric test-network is up and running (Version: 2.2.1), and my chaincode is installed and instanciated.

Looks like the node-sdk thinks that you got some bad responses but then doesn't actually contain the errors in the message it thinks there are. Could you try binding to a 1.4 SDK and seeing if the problem occurs ? At the very least if it does you might actually get a cause of the problem

that's a really odd problem, maybe there was a problem resolving npm packages. I've seen similar when the mtu values differ within a networked environment. The other thing might be to check you are using an lts version of node.js such as v10 or v12 for a 1.4 node-sdk version

Hi team, My chaincode uses MSPID and CertID from the invoker client, please how can I do that with caliper ?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 11:26:30 GMT):<br/>
no, the recommended version of node for 0.3.2 is a minimum 10.22.0
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 11:27:25 GMT):<br/>
can you run `npx caliper bind --help` ?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 11:29:50 GMT):<br/>
do you mean that you pass both of those items as arguments, or are they extracted from the transaction instance within the chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>HelmiTrabelsi</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:19:17 GMT):<br/>
I pass the two items as arguments
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:22:43 GMT):<br/>
it is possible to extract the cert and mspid from the calling within the transaction chaincode side, which is the most generic solution. If you cannot change that, then the alternative is to maintain a map of client -> mspid/cert and pull then relevant item within the callback

Thank you @nkl199, I have an other question please, if a trasaction fails with timeout, caliper resubmit the same transaction? because I have some timeout but I get 0 as failed transaction.
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Sat, 19 Dec 2020 13:14:21 GMT):<br/>
yes， i can ran that

</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Sat, 19 Dec 2020 13:19:17 GMT):<br/>
read the official document and i saw "Node.js v8.X LTS or v10.X LTS (for running Caliper)"
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Sat, 19 Dec 2020 13:22:47 GMT):<br/>
and i tried v0.4.2,the error  was  TypeError: Cannot read property 'stat' of undefined
    at IdentityManager._extractPEMFromPath (/home/li/hyperledger/fabric/caliper-workspace/node_modules/@hyperledger/caliper-fabric/lib/identity-management/IdentityManager.js:321:22)
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Sat, 19 Dec 2020 17:28:14 GMT):<br/>
that looks like a possible configuration file error
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Sat, 19 Dec 2020 17:29:02 GMT):<br/>
at the moment caliper will not resubmit on any errors, they will show as failed transactions
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Sat, 19 Dec 2020 17:29:02 GMT):<br/>
at the moment caliper will not resubmit on any errors, they will show as failed transactions -and the timeout ones should also show ... if they are not then there might be an error somewhere

I have collected some data using caliper and fabric network. The result somehow does not make sense to me. I have three different transaction in my chaincode, for example, a, b, and c. a and b just query some data from the ledger and return the result. Their average latency based on different numbers of transactions is always around 0.02 or 0.01. The c transaction query data, get the length of an array from stored data and do some calculation. The average latency for transaction c is around 1.2. Now the problem is for transaction d. d calls all three transactions a,b, and c, do a simple calculation on these three values, store the data on the ledger, and it returns the result. The average latency for d is around 0.4, while I expect that its average latency at least be around 1.2 (which is average latency for transaction c). Any thoughts on how it could be possible?

emmmm，the issue above has been partly solved.I thought it was 0.4.2 but it was 0.3.2 ,so the networkConfig.yaml did not match the version.So i change the yaml doc but there was still a error saying:child "orderers" fails because ["orderers" is required]
.But as far as i am  concerned,the offcial tutorials'networkConfig.yaml  does not require anything about orderer

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:47:11 GMT):<br/>
looks like it could be a certificates issue, so if that aspect is relating to the client connection aspect then either the wrong certificate is being specified in the configuration file, or the specified path for the file does not exist
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:48:32 GMT):<br/>
correct, the tutorial assumes that discovery is being used and therefore the orderer specification is not required
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Wed, 23 Dec 2020 12:02:08 GMT):<br/>
but i can deploy the network which  includes 5 orderers and 4 peers and i installed and instantiated the chaincode,if it was a certificates issue,the steps above  would have some errors,right?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 23 Dec 2020 12:06:12 GMT):<br/>
did caliper configure the network? It might be easier to diagnose by using the explicit caliper phases (https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/installing-caliper/#caliper-test-phase-control) as you will be able to inspect for any errors within those phases instead of having to look at a sizable log

Hi, I'm trying to install caliper. My underlying network is fabric 2.2.0. Does all the caliper version supports fabric 2.2.0? In the caliper bind command I have passed fabric sdk version as 2.2.0 (--caliper-bind-sut fabric:2.2.0) , it throws the following error 
error [caliper] [bind] 	Unknown "fabric" SDK version "2.2.0"

Hello !!
Is it possible to install Hyperledger caliper along with Iroha on Raspberry pi 4?
I already have Iroha running on Rasp4. Now I need to install Caliper to measure the Iroha implementation performance (benchmark tool).
</p>
<p><strong>Vgkmanju</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:04:09 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. Now I am facing the following error 
error: [EventService]: send[peer0.xyz-net] - #1 - Starting stream to peer0.xyz-net failed
2021-01-04T14:58:14.527Z - error: [EventService]: EventService[peer0.xyz-net] timed out after:3000

I tried to add connection timeout ( connection:
      timeout:
        peer:
          endorser: 6000
          eventHub: 6000
          eventReg: 6000 ) in channels but channel config doesn't support connection. How to extend connection timeout?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:06:42 GMT):<br/>
that's deep down in the fabric sdk, i'm surprised that the 3s timeout is being hit though
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:07:13 GMT):<br/>
connection timeout appears to be locked in the fabric-sdk (for the version that you are using)
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:08:48 GMT):<br/>
is the connection being made?
</p>
<p><strong>Vgkmanju</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:14:48 GMT):<br/>
Yeah connection is there.  
The following is the sample benchconfig 
- label: BankDetailsCC --  SaveBank
      description: Test description to store bank details through the deployed chaincode
      txNumber: 100
      rateControl:
        type: fixed-rate
        opts:
          tps: 20
      arguments:
      callback: src/fabric/scenario/bankema/BankDetailsCC/SaveBank.js
    - label: BankDetailsCC --  GetAllBank
      description: Test description for listing the bank details through the deployed chaincode
      txNumber: 100
      rateControl:
        type: fixed-rate
        opts:
          tps: 50
      arguments:
      callback: src/fabric/scenario/bankema/BankDetailsCC/GetAllBank.js

For invoke,
out of 100, 60,70 upto 90 got success. max latency around 4 - 6 s
For query,
out of 100, 100 got success. max latency 0.01s

For invoke I want all the transactions should be success but in the middle i got connection timeout
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:20:27 GMT):<br/>
ah, so the transaction itself times out?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:20:43 GMT):<br/>
that is a Fabric peer level setting
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:20:59 GMT):<br/>
depending on the peer veersion, it may be dynamically configurable
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:21:41 GMT):<br/>
that's ... never been done before! (to my knowledge)
</p>
<p><strong>Vgkmanju</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:22:33 GMT):<br/>
yeah during transaction got timeout. my peer version 2.2.0
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:24:34 GMT):<br/>
ok, so you can either rebuild the network, and ensure that the `CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMEOUT` setting is "high" (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/blob/master/networks/fabric/docker-compose/2org1peercouchdb/docker-compose.yaml) or check the fabric docs for dynamically setting it if you want to keep the current network in place
</p>
<p><strong>Vgkmanju</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 15:27:25 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks:slight_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>curiousdude</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 10:09:04 GMT):<br/>
so is there any other benchmark tool for Iroha compatible with Rasp4?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 10:33:42 GMT):<br/>
unknown - is there a reason that you need to install caliper on a Rasp4? All you need is network connection to the Iroha SUT? Just because it hasn't been done, doesn't mean it isn't possible .. we run caliper on ubuntu quite happily, by which i mean that if you can get nodeJS based projects working on a Pi, then you can get Caliper running on a Pi
</p>
<p><strong>curiousdude</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 10:36:09 GMT):<br/>
Since I have installed Iroha on Rasp4, and now I need a benchmarking tool to analyse Iroha performance on Rasp4.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 10:38:08 GMT):<br/>
I would recommend *not* running the benchmark tool on the same device that Iroha is on
</p>
<p><strong>curiousdude</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 10:39:25 GMT):<br/>
Sorry I am totally new to Iroha and Caliper. Would you kindly guide me or direct me some links?
</p>
<p><strong>curiousdude</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 10:39:43 GMT):<br/>
What would you recommend?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 11:18:18 GMT):<br/>
since you are looking at testing iroha, you are restricted to the 0.3.2 version of caliper. (https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/getting-started/) due to the absence of anyone willing to maintain the iroha aspect, it was removed from the caliper code base in the 0.4 release. I would recommend getting the iroha network set up on the target platform (in your case a Pi) and then using a different system to test the performance, in theory you only need to be on the same network to connect and interact. Caliper running on the same system will steal resources and therefore skew your results
</p>
<p><strong>curiousdude</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 11:43:39 GMT):<br/>
@nkl199 Appreciate your feedback. Would you kindly direct me to some links/instructions regarding connecting my Rasp4 (iroha network) with caliper (different system).
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 11:53:06 GMT):<br/>
I would start with a basic connection to the iroha network on your Pi - and for that would direct you to the iroha docs/RC channel. Once you have confirmed the ability to transact from a different system, you will be able to use Caliper as a client without having to debug everything at once

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:28:12 GMT):<br/>
MVCCREAD_CONFLICT is what happens when the same item is being updated at the same time
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:28:47 GMT):<br/>
that assetId passed needs to be unique for each invokation
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:29:02 GMT):<br/>
yes，so in fact when i type "10"
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:29:32 GMT):<br/>
the vehicleid "10" has already existed
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:29:53 GMT):<br/>
if, in the same ordering batch of transactions that "10" is interacted with more than once, it means the read/write set can differe .. and it will be rejeected
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:31:08 GMT):<br/>
so init can not prepare any items any more
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:31:51 GMT):<br/>
so  how can i  do
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:32:35 GMT):<br/>
you can prepare unique items in the init stage, but they need to be unique for the clients too. For instance, if you just use 0->n each client will create the same thing ... you need to augment with the clientId that is passed in. Check out the sample-benchmarks for that being done
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:33:00 GMT):<br/>
if i do not use "10",the error will be:incorrect num ,else if the error wiil be this
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:36:25 GMT):<br/>
but that's a heavy workload,i want to init addvehicle function(put state api),and test the performance of querying info.But if i want to test with 1000 or more txs,i can not prepare so many unique items...
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:37:01 GMT):<br/>
this might help: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmarks/api/fabric/lib/batch-get-asset.js
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:38:52 GMT):<br/>
by the way,if i want to test the performance of adding sth,what should i put  towards "init"
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:39:38 GMT):<br/>
init can be empty, so just have the "adding" in the main run section
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 13:41:54 GMT):<br/>
ok,i will do some work and try to do the test as you said.Thanks a lot!
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 11:23:20 GMT):<br/>
excuse me...i can not understand what does "init can be empty" mean.If i delete this module,there will be a error saying"TypeError: cb.init is not a function"
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 11:27:08 GMT):<br/>
the function body can simply return without actually doing anything
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 12:28:24 GMT):<br/>
yes，that's right.And another question...Does“unfinished_per_client” means the total number of clients send request to the network?
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 12:40:44 GMT):<br/>
no,i think what i mean should be clients or workers..
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 13:07:28 GMT):<br/>
depends on the caliper version used, but that is a rate control parameter to indicate a backlog of pending transactions https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/rate-controllers/
</p>
<p><strong>yongmu-lol</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 13:36:08 GMT):<br/>
yeah,i am testing my network according to this

<p><strong>horsefall</strong> (Fri, 08 Jan 2021 03:11:14 GMT):<br/>
Hi there, I have a question with caculating TPS,  I read the source code of caliper, `tps=(successTx + failedTx)/spentTime`. Some failed transactions are time out, it means peers didn't handle this transaction, why still participate in the tps calculation?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Fri, 08 Jan 2021 12:30:17 GMT):<br/>
As well as timeouts, transactions can fail due to other reasons. The decision was made to include them here because even failing transactions incur a cost in the underlying system, and we have followed the PSWG definitions such that all transactions are considered when making summary information.

There's definitely an argument that perhaps more detailed information should be rendered like "passing txn tps" alongside "all txn tps", and it would be easy enough to be added if there is support for it

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 10:43:32 GMT):<br/>
the literal answer is "the get method is being applied to an undefined object". This could be for many reasons, from either a badly formatted prometheus monitor, or the round not being run long enough to get results into the prometheus store. Which caliper veersion are you using?

@nkl199 v0.3.2
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 11:30:26 GMT):<br/>
@awsl999 0.4.2 is more stable with regards to the use of prometheus, and far more stable with regards to collecting aggregate statistics from multiple distributed workers, since the metrics are now collected direct from the workers via mqtt and aggregated by the manager. I would highly recommend moving to the 0.4.2 version

Which version of nodejs should I use when I use v0.4.2
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 13:05:52 GMT):<br/>
the latest v10 release, we are looking at moving up to v12+ but that will require dropping certain bindings due to compatibility issues
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 13:06:38 GMT):<br/>
(need to be 10.22 and above due to a nodeJS bug)

Hi everyone, I'm working on a project that focuses on blockchain and IoT integration using Hyperledger Aries and BeagleBone Black. I got everything working and my aries cloud agent deployed on my beaglebone and communicating with the host machine cloud agent and sending it sensor values. Now, I want to test the performance metrics of Aries Communication Protocol and Hyperledger Aries vs current communication protocols(MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, Matrix etc.) and blockchains (Public & Private). Can anybody help me with existing research in benchmarking Aries using Caliper or provide links that may help me. Any existing connector to Caliper?

Hi @prakharsr , thanks for reaching out and it's nice to hear that Beagleboards are still being used :D At the moment there is not an Aries connector, though it appears that there is an aries javascript sdk, so it is possible to add one. We would absolutely welcome the contribution, and would offer guidance in the integration with Caliper. At current no maintainers here have any direct experience with Aries (or at least to my knowledge they do not), so we would not necessarily be able to help with the underlying implementation details (aries-sdk) but would be able to help in all other aspects. If this is of interest, there is a fortnightly call you could join, or simply reach out on the caliper-contributors channel :thumbsup:

Hi all, I would like to use caliper to test my chaincode and I need help to set the yaml file related to the network. In the tutorial, under the "channels" section you refer to the "id" parameter which is set to "basic". In my case, I started the test network and then instantiated my chaincode via package generated with vscode extension. I can't figure out which "id" parameter to set to make the tests go successful. Thanks

Can anyone help me or give me a tutorial?

- MaxMessageCount on Blocks between 200-500, BatchTimeout at 500 ms

With 20 different Caliper Workers we get about 400 tps in the testrun "create-assets-100", while "empty-contract-evaluate" is at about 1k and "empty-contract-submit" at 500.
I was hoping for some experiences/hints about where potential bottlenecks could hide in a setup like the above :)

The worker remains blocked indefinitely waiting for the "unfinished" transaction.
My benchmark uses the Docker images with the distributed configuration  with the *MQTT broker*.

I assume this is a known error. Do you have any explanation?
Thank you for your help.

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 09:06:59 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, i've never hit this error before - what nodeJS version are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 09:11:03 GMT):<br/>
that's quite a serious setup! Are you using solid state drives? Depending on the way you have configured Caliper to drive the transactions, the endorsement policy could impact due to the overhead in network/compute. Certainly worth making sure that any logging in the peer/chaincode is turned off as well.

Are you able to hook up any monitoring to see if compute/network limits are being hit?
</p>
<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 09:36:42 GMT):<br/>
I use Caliper Docker image, so the NodeJS of this image, that seems to be   *node:10.22-alpine*.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 14:46:15 GMT):<br/>
when that error appears, are you able to get any useful logging information from the worker container?

<p><strong>akoita</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 14:58:11 GMT):<br/>
No unfortunately, the worker will continue to display these logs for minutes, I have to interrupt the test manually.

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 16:16:37 GMT):<br/>

yes, all the components are running in Docker (manager, workers, broker, Fabric network)
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 16:41:57 GMT):<br/>
any chaincode/peer logs that are helpful? and might point to a poorly handled error in caliper?

No, I don't have the execution logs anymore. The next time the error occurs I will try to capture logs.

Hey everyone.

I'm following this Caliper-Fabric tutorial: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/fabric-tutorial/tutorials-fabric-existing/

On the last step when running the `npx caliper launch manager --caliper-workspace ./ --caliper-networkconfig networks/networkConfig.yaml --caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/myAssetBenchmark.yaml --caliper-flow-only-test --caliper-fabric-gateway-enabled` command, I got a `TypeError: Cannot read property 'stat' of undefined` but fixed it when I used node v10.23.2. Thought it would be worth mentioning.

hmmm, yeah - we should make the Node version requirements more clearly available on the documentation pages ... but in our defence ... v8 has been unsupported for some time? In reality, there is not much life left in v10 either :worried:
</p>
<p><strong>Sara.r</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 23:30:02 GMT):<br/>
When I use caliper for generating workloads, almost 90% of transactions are successful and the rest are failing due to "failed to perform submit trasnaction, no valid responses from any peer." Any idea how to fix that?

Hi, thanks for the reply. 
1. Afaik the VM's do not use SSD's.
2. In Caliper 0.4.0 I'm using the fabric-api-node.yaml as my caliper config file, which does not explicitly state anything for contracts/endorsement-policy. In configtx.yaml isn't set anything either, which is why I assumed that by default it would use the 1-of policy (I hope that this assumption is correct).
3. Logging is disabled via

1. Afaik the VM's do not use SSD's.
2. In Caliper 0.4.0 I'm using the fabric-api-node.yaml as my caliper config file, which does not explicitly state anything for contracts/endorsement-policy. In configtx.yaml isn't set anything either, which is why I assumed that by default it would use the 1-of policy (I hope that this assumption is correct).
3. Logging is disabled via
```
FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=grpc=fatal:fatal
``` 
for orderers and peers and for Kafka via
```
        logging:
            driver: none  
``` 
4. The CPU usage seems to be relatively high for all peers and caliper workers, but since Fabric uses all cores to validate the transactions I'm not sure how meaningful this information is :sweat_smile: 

I've set up prometheus on the network, but I can only get the cpu usage of the local containers (running on the same vm as prometheus/cadvisor etc)

<p><strong>MrSE400</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:21:38 GMT):<br/>
Currently I run the network with 5 orgs (1 peer each), 3 orderers, 4 kafka, 3 zookeeper and 32 caliper workers (on 4 different VM's with each 8 vCPU's)
It is probably worth mentioning that the VM's are not located in the same data center, but split into 3 different ones.

With this setup I tried to follow the setup from:

You would need to look into the peer/chaincode logs
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 15:36:05 GMT):<br/>
Use prometheus and hook into the peer metric? have a network with only one peer? use peer targeting with your transactions so that only one peer is used?

I was able to setup Prometheus on my docker swarm network. The testruns are "empty-contract-evaluate", "empty-contract-submit", "create-assets-100", "get-asset-evaluate-100", "get-asset-submit-100".
The blue and orange line in the "peer_cpu_usage" image are noticeably higher, since they are only using 8 vCPUs, while the others can utilize 16 vCPUs. 

Is there something obvious I'm missing out on the kafka side? :sweat_smile:

<p><strong>MrSE400</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 10:29:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes, unfortunately our project is based on a modification on kafka from a previous project. 
Thus we need to compare the performance of the modified and unmodified network using kafka :sweat_smile:

Hello everyone. I have a problem with caliper when trying to connect to the IBM Blockchain Platform. My intention is to check performance of certain smart contract installed on IBM BP. The basic network on IBM BP and caliper project on local PC using ubuntu is set up according to provided tutorials. I have run a test with caliper on the local fabric network using Visual Studio Code IBM Blockchain Platform extension. But when I try to run the same test with IBM Blockchain Platform on the cloud, I get error from caliper: [ServiceEndpoint]: Error: Failed to connect before the deadline on Committer. Could anyone help me?
</p>
<p><strong>PauliusLT</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 12:51:27 GMT):<br/>
By the way, caliper shows a warning: [DEP0123] DeprecationWarning: Setting the TLS ServerName to an IP address is not permitted by RFC 6066. This will be ignored in a future version.

<p><strong>PauliusLT</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 12:52:12 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>PauliusLT</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 17:23:48 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for replay. Davidkel, are you asking for terminal log or the log caliper writes to workspace folder? There are many lines - should I just put them all in the chat?
</p>
<p><strong>PauliusLT</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 17:25:58 GMT):<br/>
nkl199, how could I change that flag to try another option? Should it be in some configuration file or as an option to cli command?
</p>
<p><strong>PauliusLT</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 17:32:42 GMT):<br/>
I see I can add as file so there they are - copied terminal log and log from caliper workspace.

@nkl199 is correct here, if you look at this output
```

```
you will see that the url it's trying to connect to says localhost. This is because by default the 2.2 node sdk forces all urls to be changed to `localhost`. You need to add another flag to your invocation
```
--caliper-fabric-gateway-localhost=false

Thank you very much! At last it worked. I wondered about that "localhost" in url:grpcs://localhost:32396. Strange, this option to stop conversion wasn't mentioned neither in tutorials nor caliper documentation!
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 21:57:57 GMT):<br/>
It's not mentioned in the tutorial because the tutorial relies on it to work with test network. It's briefly mentioned in the reference documentation for fabric however but not a great deal.

hello, i am beginner in hyperledger fabric and currently working in 2.3 version. i deployed the chaincode and my database is couchdb. i have created identities for wallet but i am confused how should peer of org 2 can interact with it. because only admin is able access not others identites. how they will interact with each other? can anyone please help me with it?

After some further tests, I was able to get up to ~650tps for create-assets-100, when deploying 1 orderer, 1 kafka and 4 peers (2 orgs) in one data center.

But after adding a third organization with 2 peers to the second data center (around ~150 km distance) it dropped to 570tps.
</p>

Hi, I am using fabric 2.2 setup using BAF in kubernetes cluster with 5 org (A,B,C,D,E) each with one peer and 1 orderer. I installed caliper version 0.3.2 and fabric sdk version 2.1.0. I tried to run caliper in my existing setup without service discovery. In the network config file, I have mentioned the client for org A. When I run caliper, I checked the peer logs of all the 5 peer orgs. I created client only for orgA. But in the peer logs I can able to see all the chaincode transactions. How is this possible? As per logic, the transaction should take place only in the org A peer. The chaincode is committed in the channel, it contains endorsement policy how come when the caliper tries to invoke it is not showing endorsement policy failure error? 

I have written a bench config,
name: Bank
  description: This is an Test senario for the module Bank
  workers:
    type: local
    number: 1
  rounds:
    - label: BankDetailsCC --  SaveBank
      description: Test description to store bank details through the deployed chaincode
      txNumber: 100
      rateControl:
        type: fixed-rate
        opts:
          tps: 20
      arguments:
      callback: src/fabric/scenario/BankDetailsCC/SaveBank.js
    - label: BankDetailsCC --  GetAllBank
      description: Test description for listing the bank details through the deployed chaincode
      txNumber: 100
      rateControl:
        type: fixed-rate
        opts:
          tps: 50
      arguments:
      callback: src/fabric/scenario/BankDetailsCC/GetAllBank.js

In this, I allocate one worker and 100 transactions. I got output report sheet.
The report shows, 100 successful transactions for invoke function with max latency 7.02s, send rate: 107.9tps, min latency:3.78s, avg:5.00s, throughtput:14.1tps.

I have a doubt in this. I mentioned above in the network config file I set client as org A but I can able to see all the transaction details in all the peers. Are these 100 transactions  executed in org A peer ?

Can you please clarify how caliper does this?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:30:08 GMT):<br/>
Caliper relies on the fabric node sdk to perform transaction submission. It looks like the fabric node sdk decides that since you haven't used discovery, targeted any peers or organisations that it will send the transaction proposal to all peers in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>Vgkmanju</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:32:30 GMT):<br/>
which means transaction was happened only in one peer but all the transaction details were gossip across the peers right?

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 09:23:12 GMT):<br/>
No, the fabric node sdk will send a proposal request to each peer and each peer will simulate that proposal and provide a response
</p>
<p><strong>Vgkmanju</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 09:24:57 GMT):<br/>
ok each peer will execute 100 transactions tps or it will split 100 transactions and executes?

<p><strong>Vgkmanju</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 09:24:57 GMT):<br/>
ok each peer will execute 100 transactions tps or it will split 100 transactions and executes? Because the final report i got 100 success
</p>
<p><strong>Vgkmanju</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 09:25:55 GMT):<br/>
In this case, caliper won't see endorsement policy right?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 09:28:41 GMT):<br/>
Each transaction is executed by all peers on the channel. Caliper itself doesn't do anything with endorsement policies, you either have to manage that yourself using peer/org targeting or turn on discovery and let fabric and the fabric node sdk manage it

</p>
<p><strong>Vgkmanju</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 09:28:41 GMT):<br/>
that 100 successful transaction is executed in single peer or all the peers
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 11:10:23 GMT):<br/>
you can use prometheus, or specify absolute urls to the remote container
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 11:14:55 GMT):<br/>
all peers execute same transaction, SDK merges results and submits to orderer. Caliper considers all of this to be a single transaction, and it is "just one" but is confirmed across all peers before being ordered and considered complete
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 11:20:09 GMT):<br/>
To be honest, I did not understand when should I go for docker containers or for prometheus
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 11:20:23 GMT):<br/>
What benefict one has over the other?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 11:30:04 GMT):<br/>
prometheus can collect more statistics, and target more sources, can show live views and integrate with grafana, plus it has persistence ... but it is more involved to configure

</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:16:48 GMT):<br/>
I am using a fixed rate with 10000 tps
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:17:52 GMT):<br/>
But no matter how many workers I add I always have the same number of TPS for a given stretch of time
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:18:20 GMT):<br/>
`fixed rate` is for the complete system, not per worker
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:18:39 GMT):<br/>
the total number is distributed across available workers
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:19:13 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:19:45 GMT):<br/>
(10k TPS seems awfully ambitios)
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:19:45 GMT):<br/>
(10k TPS seems awfully ambitious)
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:20:40 GMT):<br/>
But if I a set a rate at 1000 I would expect that no mattter how many workers that rate would be always met
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:21:10 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise I would see some of them failing
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:21:58 GMT):<br/>
-the workers attempt to reach that, depending on how long you run the benchmark for, you might see timeouts
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:29:58 GMT):<br/>
Well, I set txNumber to 1000000 and set a fixed rate of 100000
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:30:36 GMT):<br/>
I see the number of submitted transactions increasing but always at a constant rate
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:32:32 GMT):<br/>
i seriously doubt the ability of fabric to hit that TPS, 4k is the most I have seen published
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:33:28 GMT):<br/>
looks like you are targetting fabric, i seriously doubt the ability to hit the target TPS you are setting
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:34:42 GMT):<br/>
Right, but as I told the rate of increase is always the same no matter how many workers I have
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:35:20 GMT):<br/>
i suspect that is a CPU bottle neck on the target system
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:36:11 GMT):<br/>
are you running this in a kubernetes clister?
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:36:33 GMT):<br/>
Right, but what can I do if I want to check what is the system threshold
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:36:47 GMT):<br/>
The point where it starts rejecting transactions
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:37:07 GMT):<br/>
No, I am running  on docker containers
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:37:51 GMT):<br/>
I use a "fixed backlog" that aims to maintain a steady "pressure" of incomplete transactions ... then you will find out the maximum TPS at that pressure, you can also try a ramp TPS controller
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:38:29 GMT):<br/>
to my knowledge the correlation between the TPS and the point of transaction rejection is not yet possible using a ramp controller
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:44:57 GMT):<br/>
So,  when will I see the number of failed transactions increasing?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:46:05 GMT):<br/>
depends on configured timeouts on the underlying system, the driving tps, and the lag in processing the transactions
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:46:18 GMT):<br/>
normally after a few minutes
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:47:48 GMT):<br/>
Is not the failed transactions related to the threshold point of the SUT?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:50:10 GMT):<br/>
the SUT can configure a timeout value for processing a transaction, as can the SDK
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:55:26 GMT):<br/>
Ok, but what is the standard method for testing the maximum TPS of SUT?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:59:43 GMT):<br/>
not sure if there is an accepted standard yet, but common methods include:
- sequence of rounds, increasing TPS loading
- TPS ramp test noting time of first failure and correlating that with the driven TPPS at the time
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:02:50 GMT):<br/>
When you say TPS ramp test you mean using the maximum rate controller?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:03:45 GMT):<br/>
no, there is a linear-rate controller
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:20:37 GMT):<br/>
I did that but I have the same "problem"
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:20:37 GMT):<br/>
I did that but I had the same "problem"
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:21:08 GMT):<br/>
ok- try using "time based rounds" run for 10mins
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:21:22 GMT):<br/>
that is the `txDuration` option
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:22:22 GMT):<br/>
The increasing rate is always the same no matter what
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:24:29 GMT):<br/>
the first few mins will see an increasing rate as the system adjusts to the load, this is typical of most performance tests
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:24:55 GMT):<br/>
usually in performance tests, the first/last x minutes are discounted
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:36:04 GMT):<br/>
Let me see if I get it right
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:38:13 GMT):<br/>
I have to set several round with increasing TPS number at a fixed rate
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:38:22 GMT):<br/>
And run each one of them for 10 minutes?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:47:51 GMT):<br/>
minimum 5mins ... yes, it takes a while!
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:48:05 GMT):<br/>
you want the time to be long enough to reach a steady state
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:50:20 GMT):<br/>
Any suggestion for the TPS values on each round?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 19:16:33 GMT):<br/>
depends on the system hosting the SUT, on a "reasonable spec" VM you could expect to see maybe 1000TPS, so to investigate that one I would jump in 200 TPS increments
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 19:21:31 GMT):<br/>
And what should be the expected output as we increase the TPS rate?
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 19:28:13 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 19:29:10 GMT):<br/>
readAsset and readAsset2 had a fixed TPS os 2000 and 3000, respectively.
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 19:29:10 GMT):<br/>
readAsset and readAsset2 had a fixed TPS of 2000 and 3000, respectively.
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 19:30:00 GMT):<br/>
Can I assume the values shown on column `Send Rate (TPS)` are the maximum number of TPS my SUT can process?
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 10:16:34 GMT):<br/>
j
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 10:16:34 GMT):<br/>
Why `Send Rate` does not match the value I set for TPS when running a rate controller?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 10:50:34 GMT):<br/>
is it too low or too high? A single worker is only capable of around 100TPS before it is CPU bound. The workers are single threaded, so it is a hard limit - hence we scale the number of workers. Once the platform they are on is itself CPU bound, it just won't be able to go any faster
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 10:52:03 GMT):<br/>
Hi nk,
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 10:52:22 GMT):<br/>
I believe the bottleneck is the platform itself
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 10:52:59 GMT):<br/>
I am running caliper on a docker container and when I check the stats of that same container I see that the CPU (%) is around 140%
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 10:53:21 GMT):<br/>
ah, so taking up 1.4 cores
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 10:53:32 GMT):<br/>
there are some published perf results here: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper-benchmarks/fabric/performance/2.1.0/nodeContract/nodeSDK/configuration/
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 10:53:45 GMT):<br/>
so you can see the expected performance with a particular setup
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 10:58:19 GMT):<br/>
I'll take a look
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:00:48 GMT):<br/>
Just one more thing, If I start to see some unfinished transaction for a given TPS then I can assume the SUT is getting overloaded, right?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:01:17 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:01:33 GMT):<br/>
well, if the unfinished number starts to grow
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:02:09 GMT):<br/>
the nature of fabric is that it actually runs faster under a slight loading
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:02:28 GMT):<br/>
that was the main reason for the "constant load" style rate controller
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:05:47 GMT):<br/>
Are you talking about `fixed-load` controller?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:05:55 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:06:48 GMT):<br/>
Btw, I am not sure if I get it what it actually does
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:07:24 GMT):<br/>
think of the transactions being submitted into a queue for processing - that controller aims to keep the queue depth at a fixed level
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:09:39 GMT):<br/>
So, If the queue start growing beyond that level, then Caliper will decrease the TPS in order to keep the fixed load, right?
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:09:39 GMT):<br/>
So, if the queue start growing beyond that level, then Caliper will decrease the TPS in order to keep the fixed load, right?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:09:48 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:10:10 GMT):<br/>
whereas a fixed tps would carry on increasing the queue depth and eventually you will get timeouts
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:11:45 GMT):<br/>
it gets a bit tricky because the orderer batches things, so the queue depth is not continuous
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:14:53 GMT):<br/>
Based on what you have said I believe Fabric keeps that queue for a real life situation
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:17:08 GMT):<br/>
sort of, so Fabric will process transactions sequentially, but when they are submitted to be ordered, you have no control over which transactions go into which block
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:18:05 GMT):<br/>
Right, but if it starts getting overloaded it will push the transactions into a queue before timing out
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:18:10 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:18:43 GMT):<br/>
though there is more than one timeout in play - the SDK will have a timeout, and fabric will also have a "commit timeout"
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:18:45 GMT):<br/>
So, fixed-load is the most similar one can get to a production situation
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:19:20 GMT):<br/>
yes, ... or you can stitch controllers together as well if you wanted more complex scenarios
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:20:37 GMT):<br/>
By looking here I see you are mixing several fixed-load controllers with one fixed-rate
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:20:37 GMT):<br/>
By looking here https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmarks/api/fabric/base/get-asset.yaml I see you are mixing several fixed-load controllers with one fixed-rate
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:20:45 GMT):<br/>
What is the reasoning?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:21:46 GMT):<br/>
fixed-load for "general results"; fixed-rate for comparing system performance if you change the underlying infrastructure. They give slightly different perspectives
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:22:59 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:23:30 GMT):<br/>
But how did you get to the `Throughput (TPS)` present here https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper-benchmarks/fabric/performance/2.1.0/nodeContract/nodeSDK/evaluate/get-asset/
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:24:38 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:24:47 GMT):<br/>
just running ubuntu, no graphics etc
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:25:20 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:26:22 GMT):<br/>
I was more interested on how you get to those numbers
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:27:18 GMT):<br/>
What test have you run and which were the controllers
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:27:59 GMT):<br/>
ah right, they are in the github repo caliper-benchmarks .. the fixed asset ones
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:28:01 GMT):<br/>
Was it the result of running these tests for the `Get Asset` https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper-benchmarks/fabric/performance/2.1.0/nodeContract/nodeSDK/evaluate/get-asset/?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:28:41 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:33:42 GMT):<br/>
Any reason for setting the `transactionLoad` to 50?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:37:04 GMT):<br/>
this was (by trial) the upper limit of capability when investigating the larger size items being retrieved
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:47:35 GMT):<br/>
If you set a larger value for transactionLoad you would see a decrease in throughput for larger size items?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:48:00 GMT):<br/>
timeouts
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:48:52 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, I did not get it
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:49:51 GMT):<br/>
above 50, the queue depth was too great. as a result the transactions took too long to process and they timed out
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:50:19 GMT):<br/>
-> when trying to perform a 'get' on unreasonably large assets
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:55:24 GMT):<br/>
I see
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:56:13 GMT):<br/>
But why using that value for smaller size item?
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:59:30 GMT):<br/>
If I get it right, the smaller ones could have a larger value without timing out, right?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 13:27:02 GMT):<br/>
yep, that's right - the aim was to keep the run consistent
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 13:27:02 GMT):<br/>
yep, that's right - the aim was to keep the run consistent as the investigation was the impact on "asset size" being pulled through the system
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 18:00:20 GMT):<br/>
so this is a "get" which is different to the "put" (a put is much more expensive) so that is more accurately the highest rate that you can retrieve information
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 18:00:33 GMT):<br/>
no worries
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 18:00:51 GMT):<br/>
there are some tutorials in the docs for it too, which should help with the config files
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 18:05:09 GMT):<br/>
So, if now I want to test the maximum TPS per asset size, I must use the transactionLoad set to 300, right?

Thanks. I followed the tutorial on doc. In this (0.4.2) version I don't see any whereto put the details of the Orderer. Is it the  Org connection profile ?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:44:08 GMT):<br/>
ah, this is assuming a "discovery enabled" network, the complete details can be found https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/fabric-config/new/
</p>
<p><strong>tharindupr</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:46:07 GMT):<br/>
Here also I don't see a place to put Orderer profile.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:47:15 GMT):<br/>
ah - so if you are using the "new format" then all you need is the common connection profile reference
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:47:45 GMT):<br/>
otherwise it is this ref: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/fabric-config/legacy/
</p>
<p><strong>tharindupr</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:53:33 GMT):<br/>

Hi all, I'm currently trying to understand my performance test results:
I utilized 17 VM's, with 4 Kafka Broker, 3 Zookeeper (sharing 4 VM's with 8 vCPUs), 3 Orderer (one VM with 8 vCPUs each), 8 Peers (one VM with 16 vCPUs each) and finally 2 VM's with 20 Caliper workers.
The benchmark is Create-Asset with 1000 bytes payload, with "fixed-load" as the rate controller (x-axis for varying transaction loads)
The red line is Hyperledger Fabric 1.4.8, while the green line is our modification (where we biggest performance hit is an additional layer of computation for the validation phase).

Im mostly curious about two things in the plot above:
1) It seems like the two lines converge after which some saturation point is hit for Hyperledger. Is the assumption correct, that this is probably caused by some endorsement bottleneck? And is there some way to verify this hypothesis?
2) Furthermore, I do not fully understand the x=1500. Since I set the Kafka MaxMessageCount to 300 I would intuitively say that the maximum is reached at a multiple of 300

In addition to the above, I'm also still looking for various ways to stress test our modification. The main goal with the performance test above was to test the sut at different levels of workload.
I'm also running the same kind of tests for other payload sizes (100, 2k, 4k, 8k and 16k) (for 32k and 64k I get some kind of EventHub Timeout but nvm). I'm also planing on measuring the resource utilization for a fixed payload and throughput. 

Does anyone spontaneously know some further benchmarks which would stress test the validation phase of the peers or the capabilities of the orderer-service? 
Thanks in advance :grinning:

Hello! I am trying to create simple network by using ansible script (exactly as described in https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ansible-build). I am using Visual Studio Code and invoke commands in built-in terminal. When the script build_network.sh is run it stops at 08-import-ordering-service.yml with message:
TASK [Import the ordering service] *********************************************
fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Ordering service exists and appears to be managed by this console, refusing to continue"}
what does it mean and how to resolve it and proceed with the rest of this script?
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 10:12:34 GMT):<br/>
At this point I would be looking to expose the internal fabric metrics (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/metrics_reference.html). You can get prometheus to scrape this information and view it in grafana
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 11:34:01 GMT):<br/>
I think you are hitting just about everything there! Any "commit" action will bring involvement of the validation and orderer. Variation in payload size, and applied load will cover the max-size, max-number, and max-timeout aspects ... so I thinkk you are in the "finding the best loads" phase of the investigation
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 12:24:40 GMT):<br/>
quite possibly my favourite chart generated using caliper, ever :thumbsup:
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 12:27:53 GMT):<br/>
bottleneck could come from CPU restriction in endorsement phase, or perhaps a networking limitation
</p>
<p><strong>MrSE400</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:19:59 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the advice, prometheus is already set up (currently disabled). After the current benchmarks I'll focus on the resource utilization  :-)

<p><strong>MrSE400</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:20:49 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>MrSE400</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:26:20 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:27:12 GMT):<br/>
theres a caliper call every 2 weeks, if you get to the stage where you would like to present something, you would be more than welcome to join the call. Maybe share pain points etc that could help develop caliper

Hey, I'm using a basic shell script which scrapes those report.html files and simply puts them in one .csv file. Afterwards I simply use python to calculate average and standard deviation and plot the results with matplotlib :-)
</p>
<p><strong>MrSE400</strong> (Mon, 22 Feb 2021 20:35:16 GMT):<br/>
If you are interested in details you can have a look at my repo:
https://github.com/eggersn/fabricstar-benchmarks
where i use "evaluation.sh" and "Evaluation.py". You probably have to modify both files to match your paths (and Evaluation.py to fit your x-axis).

I'm currently a little busy, but maybe I'll find in 1-2 months some time to document all of those scripts :sweat_smile:

Hi all, I used caliper with fabric v1.4.x, I know with 2.x there are differences and you need to add parameters and override commands because there are restrictions. I tried executing the command but it still says I need to use the gateway parameter, I am a little sleep deprived :) second pair of eyes would help

thanks @MrSE400 , this is useful, i will give a try on this. wondering if you ever use caliper to publish the matrix the prometheus push gateway.  i am not able to get same result per setup in https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/caliper-monitors/
</p>
<p><strong>MrSE400</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 07:15:04 GMT):<br/>
I'm not quite sure what you mean. 

The test runs evaluated in the graph were all without any kind of monitor. If I add prometheus to the setup I also find a small decrease in performance (but for prometheus you probably should take a look at the fixed-rate controller). 
Additionally, if you look at the post below the graph I listed the specs of my setup. So this might explain some differences in the results.

i find it helpful to step through the explicit caliper "phases" one by one to help with the above (in the docs) and check the docker container logs. Depending on the docker version being used, the networks used are not correct (use latest docker) and so containers can't talk

@MrSE400 You officially win "Caliper chart of the year" with the above, which also takes "Caliper chart of the decade" with it at the moment!

thanks @MrSE400 , i am actually looking to capture the TPS and validation latency on peer level. i can get the peer TPS but not validation latency based on the fabric published prometheus matrix. for caliper the tps and latecy is more for channel level.. not useful for me to measure the peer level performance

Ah okay, what query are you using to get the peer TPS (just wondering what you actually mean with "peer TPS" :grinning:  )?
And for latency: Isn't "ledger_block_processing_time" going in the right direction?

hey guys I wanted to ask for the statement : "For a single publisher, among the three protocols, CoAP performs the best with latencies around 5-6 ms even at high throughput (10,000 messages/ second).", are the two terms "throughput" and "messages per second" same? I am calculating round trip latency and my concern is, while transmitting some packets might get lost and not reach the destination, so while the term "messages/ second" signifies the rate at which messages are being sent from the publisher, I am not sure if the term "throughput" carries the same meaning or is equivalent to "number of messages sent for which acknowledgement was received per second".

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 15:55:43 GMT):<br/>
Throughput means "the number of requests processed in a time unit", which usually means from a benchmarking point of view that the client received X number of replies (10k, for example) for its requests/messages in a time unit (second, minute, hour, etc.). So a 10k/1s througput means the client received an average of 10k replies from the server in a second.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 15:57:36 GMT):<br/>
This number usually includes both successful and failed requests. You will see the term goodput, in which case only the replies for the successful requests are counted. Similarly, failure rate denotes the number of replies for failed requests in a given time unit.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 15:58:23 GMT):<br/>
These are the usual meaning of the above concepts. However, a good benchmark evaluation should always include the precise meaning of the terms, how they are measured, what is included, etc.

The Caliper documentation is a good start: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/getting-started/

Then you can head to the Caliper-Fabric tutorial: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/fabric-tutorial/tutorials-fabric-existing/

background processing this one, the only thing i can think of we had that sounds familiar is if you are on an old version of nodeJS that had a memory leak and using distributed workers. You need to be on the most recent v10 of NodeJS, otherwise the caliper workers terminate without informing the manager, which then sits there waiting forever

Hi all, I'm currently performing some resource utilization tests and was wondering why we consider for metrics like "Network Out", "Disc Write" etc. the statistic "sum" instead of "avg".
If I understand correctly, the query itself already returns the average of transmitted bytes in MB/s (and the statistic itself therefore simply sums up all of these average values)

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 13:37:43 GMT):<br/>
Check whether the discovery mechanism is configured correctly on the Fabric side. If you recreate the network from scratch when starting a new benchmark, make sure you always use the up-to-date crypto materials (used by the Fabric side)
</p>

@swatim These look like Fabric-related errors, so you should try asking for help in the #fabric channel

I checked the log in peer0.org1.example.com, got an error:
</p>
<p><strong>zhuch</strong> (Wed, 17 Mar 2021 00:19:49 GMT):<br/>
```
Principal deserialization failure (the supplied identity is not valid: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "x509: ECDSA verification failure" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "ca.org1.example.com"))
```
</p>
<p><strong>zhuch</strong> (Wed, 17 Mar 2021 00:21:38 GMT):<br/>
So is it an Fabric-related error or my misconfiguration in  network_config.json? Could you please instruct me to identify that?
</p>
<p><strong>zhuch</strong> (Wed, 17 Mar 2021 00:40:02 GMT):<br/>
I'm new to Fabric and Caliper, so I may not have enough ablity to find it out myself. I'll appreciate for your patient help. You can send direct messages to me
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:19:03 GMT):<br/>
You probably regenerated the certificates between benchmarks, and you forgot to change the certificate PEM in your network config JSON. It's recommended to refer to the certificate with a path (not the content directly), so when it's regenerated, Caliper picks up the new certs automatically.
</p>
<p><strong>zhuch</strong> (Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:29:52 GMT):<br/>
Can you provide a sample on how to `refer to the certificate with a path`?
</p>
<p><strong>zhuch</strong> (Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:30:19 GMT):<br/>
here's my `network_config.json`

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 17 Mar 2021 09:56:24 GMT):<br/>
You've already used the path attribute at several places in your network config, but you should use it everywhere instead of the pem attributes. But there's still a tricky part: the certificate file names still contains varying parts when regenerated: c3427637d0c13b434b8c97da64b3d5554486f6026598a720997c0e9bac9a34d5_sk. You also have to make sure you update these. Here is a sample script that renames these files every to a consistent name: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks/blob/master/networks/fabric/config_raft/generate.sh#L19
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 17 Mar 2021 09:57:10 GMT):<br/>
So in summary, always double check that you point to the correct certificate files. And always clean up the previous certificates (that way you'll get an earlier error saying that the outdated file doesn't exists).

I followed your instruction, however, it doesn't work. I have edited my question in Stackoverflow, please check it for one more time :cry:

Dear Caliper maintainers,

I am trying to use caliper 0.4.2 with Fabric 2.2. It seems to me using the new connector implementation is better.
The documentation said that: 
> version: "1.0"
> would select the legacy connector and the file must conform to the old deprecated network configuration file format

> version: "2.0.0"
> would select the new connector and the file must conform to the new network configuration file format

However, when looking at caliper source code, e.g. https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/v0.4.2/packages/caliper-fabric/lib/FabricConnectorFactory.js
I am confused because there are LEGACY_V2_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR as well as NEW_V1_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR, that point to v1/ and v2/ folders in connector-versions/ folder.

I wonder if the v1 and v2 folders indicate the Fabric version, connector version, or something else.

Thank you in advance,
Hoang

V1 implies it uses the 1.x node sdk, V2 implies it used the 2.x node sdk. Legacy means it's using the old network configuration format (ie version 1.0) and New means it's using the new network configuration format (2.0.0)

Hey everyone,
I'm getting some weird results (as can be seen in the above plot). The plot shows the average network transmissions in KB/s (there's a typo in the plot title).
Using the benchmark "Create-Assets-8000" with a fixed-rate controller set to 200TPS, the prometheus query "sum(rate(container_network_transmit_bytes_total{instance=~".+"}[1m])) by (instance)" returns the above values (i.e. ~60 KB/s).
Shouldn't one expect to get around 1.2 MB/s?

Is there a tutorial how to benchmark Fabric 2.3.0 with Hyperledger Caliper? I have been searching for 2 weeks and found nothing.
I found a tutorial on Caliper website for version 2.2, but when I try withe version 2.3 it does not work and gives me the following error:
`error [caliper] [connectors/v2/FabricGateway] Failed to perform submit transaction [CreateAsset] using arguments [0_1,blue,20,penguin,500], with error: Error: No valid responses from any peers. Errors:
peer=undefined, status=grpc, message=Peer endorsements do not match`
</p>

That error indicates a problem with the chaincode you are using. If you are using the samples and following the tutorial make sure you check out the explicit tag as shown in the tutorial because there are problems with the node.js chaincode in the samples and the explicit tag will ensure you get a chaincode that wasn't broken. If not then the problem is whatever chaincode you are using, it's not deterministic

Hello David, 
yes, " git checkout 22393b629bcac7f7807cc6998aa44e06ecc77426 " was the problem, my chaincode was a few commits later in time.

Thanks a lot for your help. :D

Hi everyone,
I am trying to create a benchmark for the commercial paper smart contract using the new Fabric connector.
However, I am facing some issues to define the network configuration file. How can one define this file to say that:
-the "issue" transaction is carried out by the peer (isabella) in Org2 (Magnetocorp)
-the "buy" transaction is carried out by the peer (balaji) in Org1 (Digibank)

I tried to launch the benchmark with the files attached. I got the error: "No organizations have been defined"

If someone having this issue I highly recommend using the CLI version of Caliper. Just make sure you use all the port accessible from the Caliper host machine in the network configuration.  The CLI version worked for me while Dockerized version still has this issue.

For caliper 0.4.x here is an example

Thanks, @davidkel . It happens I am using version 0.3.2 of Caliper, and this "content" key does not work. Do you know some examples for version 0.3.x?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 15:29:56 GMT):<br/>
I don't, but I would also not recommend using 0.3.2 now either
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 15:29:56 GMT):<br/>
Looking at the 0.3.2 codebase that key should work. I would recommend moving to caliper 0.4.2 though
</p>
<p><strong>lucianocampagnoli</strong> (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 15:35:23 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>lucianocampagnoli</strong> (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 16:57:18 GMT):<br/>
Isn't there any examples with v0.3.2, @davidkel ?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 11:39:44 GMT):<br/>
I'm not really familiar with caliper 0.3.2 I'm more familiar with 0.4.2 as I overhauled the fabric connectors with a new config and better implementation. I've heard that there are other issues with 0.3.2 that have been addressed with 0.4 which is why I recommended it
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 16:05:29 GMT):<br/>
that is fabric side (block size is an orderer parameter) you would want to configure caliper to spread/distribute the transactions across the peers though

I was able to do that here with 0.3.2. The transientMap atribute is not properly a map, but a JavaScript object.

Make sure you use discovery, if not then you will have to peer targeting in you workload implementation

Why is the throughput of Fabric measured by caliper only 4? 4 orderers with Smart-BFT consusen, 1 peer

Hi I wrote a function which verify if the user has already sent a document. Is this kind of functions suitable for performance analysis with caliper? 
I tried that but apparently that constraint didnt work and the same tx issued by the same issuer was uploaded to the ledger, I mean, now I have 100 documents issued by one client when this client was supposed to issue one and only one document.
Thank you

Hi! The Caliper team doesn't have a Caliper-Besu tutorial currently. But you can check out the integrations test for Besu, that might help: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/master/packages/caliper-tests-integration/besu_tests
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 07:51:41 GMT):<br/>
Can you share more info about your setup and benchmark configuration (and workload)?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 07:54:22 GMT):<br/>
If this function is called on the smart contract side, then yes, you can include it in performance tests. Please share some more info about your Caliper workload module, but I think it's the smart contract's responsibility to handle duplications, even if clients submit the same documents again
</p>
<p><strong>oliveruas</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 10:23:01 GMT):<br/>
Here it is https://github.com/oliverRuas/caliper 
ppa.go is the chaincode and the function im trying to analyse is WritePayments, which queries with the function QueryIdentityHistory if the client has submitted a payment.
</p>
<p><strong>oliveruas</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 10:30:55 GMT):<br/>
I will try using the API SetEvent after the PutState. 
One more question, if my chaincode performance was like i want it to, caliper can't duplicate the document? 
Thank you @klenik
</p>
<p><strong>zeminzhou</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 03:29:04 GMT):<br/>
hi klenik, thinks for your reply. I have solved this problem by configuring only one sort node in the network config.

Hey everyone. Does the Caliper GUI dashboard support Besu networks?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sun, 23 May 2021 13:00:29 GMT):<br/>
@zeminzhou Caliper is written in JS at the moment. Once we stabilize the code-base, it will be possible to implement Caliper workers in different languages (golang, java, etc). But it's further down the road, unfortunately.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Sun, 23 May 2021 13:06:59 GMT):<br/>
@oliveruas Testing correct functionality is not the purpose of Caliper. You should use unit and integration tests for that. Caliper helps you in submitting multiple transactions from multiple clients concurrently (and with varying transaction parameters), to put a workload stress on your ledger infrastructure, while measuring its response times. What behaviors you deem correct, that should be a separate concern from performance testing.
</p>
<p><strong>nkl199</strong> (Sun, 23 May 2021 13:24:17 GMT):<br/>
the caliper GUI is still very much a prototype - i wouldn't recommend it for use with the main branch functions

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 24 May 2021 08:23:41 GMT):<br/>
You need to add `--caliper-fabric-gateway-usegateway`
Better still, use 0.4.2 and the new configuration format see tutorial https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/fabric-tutorial/
</p>
<p><strong>oliveruas</strong> (Mon, 31 May 2021 09:37:17 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I think Im getting it. If my network had a correct functionality, I just would have to concern (now) about the workload that submits multiple txs from one client (because I've proved its functionality and would be the same using one client ID or a hundred IDs).
Is this correct?
Thanks @klenik
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 14:12:59 GMT):<br/>
@oliveruas Yes, the "worker clients" of Caliper are just a scaling mechanism. You could use different DLT-side identities for each TX, even if you're just using a single Caliper worker.

Check out the docs for the besu integration. You probably need to supply the abi for the contract if you want to deploy it through Caliper 
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 17 Jun 2021 17:42:37 GMT):<br/>
In my experience, this usually means that the node can't accept request. You either provided the access point incorrectly, or the node is still doing some initialization, in which case you should wait a bit more before connecting with Caliper

What does your network config file look like ?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 08 Jul 2021 23:08:13 GMT):<br/>
It's a bug in the init flow using the new connector format. You should be able to get around it by specifying `--caliper-flow-skip-init` or by specifying `--caliper-flow-only-test`. With an SUT of 2.2 and the new connector format, the init phase doesn't do anything

What is the difference between the Send Rate (TPS) statistic and Throughput (TPS) ?
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 22:50:44 GMT):<br/>
I am getting the same value so I don't understand where they differ?

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 05:57:20 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for the late reply, I've added some remarks to the above issue.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 06:00:16 GMT):<br/>
The send rate is the number of transactions per second Caliper sends towards the backend system (so the input rate of the SUT). The throughput is the number of transactions per second Caliper receives a successful confirmation from the backend system (so the successful output rate of the SUT).

If the two are equal, that means that the SUT can handle the given sending/input rate without any problems.

What can I do for the SUT to fail some transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 07:56:55 GMT):<br/>
But sometimes even without failed transactions the send rate is not equal to the troughput?
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 07:56:55 GMT):<br/>
But sometimes even without failed transactions the send rate is not equal to the troughput
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:26:08 GMT):<br/>
Are the unfinished transactions the  ones responsible for that difference?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:49:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes. Sending transactions is easy, processing them on the SUT side is not, it's more time. Even if you can send 100 TXs per second, the SUT might be able to process only 50 TXs per second, depending on its configuration. While the processing time is under the timeout threshold for transactions, you won't see failed transactions just because processing is slower. When you really overload the SUT with transactions, then you will start seeing timeout errors.
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:50:40 GMT):<br/>
In case of timeout erros, I will start seeing some failed transactions, right?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:54:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes. However, there are different kind/sources of timeouts, depending on the SUT. For Fabric, the timeout can occur in the peer, on in Caliper, waiting for endorsement and/or ordering.
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:54:53 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:55:37 GMT):<br/>
How can I force the failed transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:55:55 GMT):<br/>
Tweaking the `transactionLoad` parameter?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:18:04 GMT):<br/>
Depends on what you want to achieve. You could increase the different timeout values to allow more time for processing. Or you could scale your SUT to gain more processing power. Or you could lower the transaction load to decrease the stress on the SUT.
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:51:49 GMT):<br/>
The transaction load sets how many transactions at most will be buffered before the SUT starts discarting them, right?
</p>
<p><strong>FilipeSilva</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:51:49 GMT):<br/>
The transaction load sets how many transactions at most will be buffered before the SUT starts discarding them, right?
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:52:27 GMT):<br/>
Is that a Fabric peer setting? I'm not familiar with it

I'd suggest setting the peer log level to debug to see what is the expected policy and what was received. And double-check you policy settings. Can you run any operational queries with the same client using the Fabric peer CLI? (Just to further locate the source of error: policy settings or Caliper.)

Hello, i am trying to run a benchmark with Caliper on multiple channels but i have kind of hit a wall. I am able to run the benchmark on a single-channel network, however when i add other channels to the my network yaml file, i get the following error "2021-08-11T22:00:09.668Z - error:                                                                                                                                                            [DiscoveryService]: send[mychannel1] - Channel:mychannel1 received discovery error:access denied

This is happening because Caliper is trying to use Users from Orgs that are not members of this channel. Did i miss something from the Documentation or is benchmarking multiple channels currently not supported?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                i would be very grateful for any advice.

caliper as part of it's initalisation builds a cache of gateways for each identity then attempts to build a set of contracts objects for each gateway against each defined channel and chaincode id which is why you see this warning. It does all this at initialisation so as not to include any overhead when running the workloads. 
These warnings shouldn't stop caliper initialising.
You need to make sure you include identities in your network config that are permitted for that channel and select that identity when you submit transactions for that channel as part of your invoke settings for your workload. Otherwise caliper just selects the first identity in the first org defined in the network config to use

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/caliper?msg=z9guNNC8emYDvaPF3) Create a file "caliper.yaml" and place it in the root folder of your benchmark, or wherever you are running the commands.
In the file, 
```yaml
caliper:
  fabric:
    gateway:
      localhost: false
      enabled: true
```

The command would look something like

```sh
npx caliper launch manager \
--caliper-workspace . \
--caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/config.yaml \
--caliper-networkconfig networks/networkConfig.yaml --caliper-flow-only-test --caliper-fabric-gateway-usegateway
```

In the network configurations, 

it is sufficient to to define the following under organisations:

```yaml
organizations:
  - mspid: Org1MSP
    identities:
      wallet:
        path: 'networks/Wallet'
        adminNames:
        - Org1Admin
    connectionProfile:
      path: 'networks/connection.json'
      discover: true
```

I assume you import the wallet and the connection profile and place them accordingly as per the paths defined above.

Hope this helps

Hello, im trying to run a benchmark with multiple channels and im getting this error : "Error: fabcar has already been defined in the configuration". i have deployed fabcar on multiple channels and i am trying to run a benchmark on these channels. This error happens due to my network config having the chaincode fabcar defined under multiple channels. Is it from caliper's view not allowed for the same chaincode to have the same name on multiple channels or did i miss something? Here are the channel definitions in my network config, i would be very grateful for any suggestions : ```
channels:
    - channelName: mychannel1
      created: true
      contracts:
      - id: fabcar
      contractID: fabcar1
      peers:
      - peer0.org1.example.com
      - peer0.org2.example.com
    - channelName: mychannel2
      created: true
      contracts:
      - id: fabcar
      contractID: fabcar2
      peers:
      - peer0.org1.example.com
      - peer0.org3.example.com
    - channelName: mychannel8
      created: true
      contracts:
      - id: fabcar
      contractID: fabcar3
      peers:

Hi everyone, I started multiple-round benchmark simulation with 8 workers, but I got randomly stuck in one of the rounds. For example: worker 1 and worker 5 still send transaction even though other worker already stopped in figure bellow. The same issue when using Empty Contract invoke transaction.

Hey Caliper team. I am trying to build caliper from source as starting point to extended benchmarking facilities for besu private transaction. But I can't get the build process run through. I tried a couple of node versions (8, 12, 14) but they all fail for various reasons. I usually would work out the correct version by starting from the CI process. But the travis link on the repository leads to nowhere--or is it just private? Is there an publicly available CI system for caliper that I could use to figure out some known good versions for software to get caliper build?

I think hyperledger stopped using travis and moved to azure pipelines but now it seems that may go away and it could be github actions, Hopefully caliper will get going again very soon and catching up with the infrastructure changes
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 14:46:01 GMT):<br/>
I think hyperledger stopped using travis and moved to azure pipelines (and so caliper has moved to azure pipelines too) there could a plan to move to github actions in the future
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Sat, 11 Sep 2021 11:44:17 GMT):<br/>
So check out https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml for how the build works, however because the build hasn't been run for a while there could be build failures that need to be fixed

I just added a PR to make onchain privacy groups a bit more usable: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/1156. The only box I did not tick yet is documentation. The existing private transaction support is scarcely documented, so I was not sure where to add documentation. As far as I am concerned the integration tests are a sufficient place to glean how privacy groups in caliper work. I did maintain that level of documentation but am of course open to suggestions to improve it further.

Have you check that your network config is picked up by caliper (e.g. insert invalid json and make sure it fails) and that the path is correct? As far as I see the configuration looks valid--that is, assuming all the parts not posted are in order.
</p>
<p><strong>vlaca</strong> (Wed, 15 Sep 2021 08:35:05 GMT):<br/>
I thinks it.means that you have no interface field in the JSON object which the string compiledFactory is parsed into. Print it (or simply open the file which you read it from), and find out what fields you have there, and which one of them represents a legal ABI.

I opened another PR that fixes a problem we had with the duration not being honoured in fixed duration rounds: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/1162. But it looks like that CI is broken. For both of my PRs it fails at the same very unrelated place (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/1162#partial-pull-merging) that shows problems when running locally. Any chance this is bitrot of the CI pipeline?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 16 Sep 2021 07:10:30 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the build process is currently broken

Hello everyone, I have some experience working on besu and already have an existing besu network where each node is running in a docker container. It has 4 nodes and one of them is a bootnode. To be noted websocket is enabled in that besu network.
I am completely new to caliper, and I want to start testing using it in that existing besu network. I have tried to follow caliper docs : https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/
It seems the doc is targeted for hyperledger fabric and got little info about besu ("Ethereum" under connector configuration). Can anyone please help me from where to start?
I will be grateful if anyone can provide me any easier ( :sweat_smile: ) doc which targets besu
Thanks in advance
</p>
<p><strong>iffathossain</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 03:41:27 GMT):<br/>
Finally I am able to configure caliper for besu. Feel free to knock me if anyone needs any help regarding starting of caliper on an existing besu network. To be noted, I may not be able to solve or understand all errors, I am still a newbie. I will try to write a doc on it and once I finish I will share it. Thank you @klenik for providing the caliper-tests-integration github link in one comment reply in this chat as a reference to start caliper on besu. I am pasting the link here as well: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/main/packages/caliper-tests-integration
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 09:28:43 GMT):<br/>
@iffathossain You're welcome :) If you feel like writing some documentation, you could extend the Caliper-Besu page with a FAQ section, or elaborate on descriptions you feel insufficient :)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 09:29:08 GMT):<br/>
You'd need to extend the following doc file on the gh-pages branch: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/gh-pages/docs/vNext/Ethereum_Configuration.md

Let me know if you need any guidance!

Hello everyone, I am new to Caliper and working on benchmarking an existing deployment and had a question. Is it possible to override the IP addresses for discovered nodes using dynamic connection profiles? I am running a modified version of test network (2 orgs with 2 peers each, 5 orderers raft with `asset-transfer-basic` installed and working) deployed multi-host across 4 machines (docker swarm) and am having trouble connecting my caliper instance. I followed the docs and had no issues benchmarking a local deployment of test network. However, when I use discovery with my profile, I receive connection timeout errors for the nodes running on other machines (I am running Caliper on the primary host, which is also running 2 orders and a peer). In the error, the url is always grpcs://localhost:xxxx which seems to be the issue because I am not running a purely localhost setup. However, I am unsure of how to rectify this after much searching and reading of the documents. For full disclosure I have already tried multiple times to write static connection profiles and turn off discovery, but all of my static profile attempts yield errors like _No valid responses from any peers_ or _failed to commit transaction %undefined, order response status: UNKNOWN_, which leads me to believe the hardcoded addresses in the static profile are also not working. If anyone can help point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated and I can provide any of the profile code if needed.

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:25:25 GMT):<br/>
To stop the node sdk (used by caliper) annoyingly by default converting discovered nodes host names to localhost, take a look at https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/fabric-config/new/
And specifically under runtime settings. It's the `caliper-fabric-gateway-localhost` flag you need to set to false or have your own config settings

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 04 Oct 2021 08:31:32 GMT):<br/>
@GergelyLengyel The first error indicates that you didn't run a bind command before executing your benchmark (https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/installing-caliper/#the-bind-command)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 04 Oct 2021 08:33:26 GMT):<br/>
The second error states that every element of your network configuration file is wrong. Based on which Fabric connector you use, the schema of the network configuration file differs a bit (for the new connector: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/fabric-config/new/)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 04 Oct 2021 08:34:13 GMT):<br/>
To get a high-level overview about the above concepts (binding, network configuration, etc), I'd recommend reading the architecture documentation: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/architecture/
</p>
<p><strong>GergelyLengyel</strong> (Mon, 04 Oct 2021 11:46:11 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 04 Oct 2021 11:50:52 GMT):<br/>
Did you run the bind command during step 1? (`npx caliper bind --caliper-bind-sut fabric:2.2`)
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 04 Oct 2021 11:53:39 GMT):<br/>

Which Caliper version are you using? v0.4.2 contains a binding configuration for the 2.2 Fabric SDK (https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/v0.4.2/packages/caliper-cli/lib/lib/config.yaml#L55)
Also, don't install and bind Caliper as root user, npm doesn't like that

If you're using the 2.x SDK, then Caliper won't install/instantiate the chaincode for you (the feature is missing from the SDK itself). You make sure that you correctly installed everything for the network (the tutorial contains the link for the corresponding Fabric docs, and also a quick list of required commands that should work)

Hi, I am planning to deploy a HLF environment on Raspberry Pi and I was curious if anyone tried to create a Hyperledger Caliper docker image compatible with ARM64 devices. Any links to existing images or instructions on how to do that would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

This is the Dockerfile that create the Caliper image: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/main/packages/caliper-publish/caliper.Dockerfile
Let us know if you succeed, it's an interesting idea :)

Many thanks! I just wanted to confirm that I managed to successfully build the Docker image on my Raspberry Pi without any modifications whatsoever.

<p><strong>maciejjedrzejczyk</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:51:24 GMT):<br/>
I need to test it but if the build goes fine then I believe that the execution looks promising as well
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 08:07:35 GMT):<br/>
Awesome! There's still one thing that could go wrong, the communication between Caliper processes (manager and workers). You should test the following deployment modes: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/architecture/#process-distribution-models

How should I setup the benchmark file to monitor resources on the fabric test-network? Currently I have the following but it gives no result for any resources (CPU, memory....)```

If it's API is web3js compatible, then you could direct the Ethereum connector to that network. If not, then you need to write your own connector

I didn't think it would be the node version. Ensure you do a repoclean and delete all package-lock.json files. If you still get the problem try cleaning the npm cache. It could still be a problem with the npm registry that you are using though

@barcellosrod Double check your network and/or benchmark configuration file. The error hints at a missing part of the configuration (hence calling `hasOwnProperty` on an undefined attribute)

This profile doesn't contain an MSP with the name `mspname`. Is this the network configuration file you pass to Caliper? The yaml content must follow the following schema: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/fabric-config/new/#network-configuration-file-reference

@neetusharma that connection profile is a static connection profile and as such doesn't require discovery I would suggest you set discover to `false` in your network config file, however it still doesn't explain where `mspname` comes from in your error message. It doesn't appear in the config files you provided and isn't part of the caliper or fabric-sdk code bases.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:46:07 GMT):<br/>
I think "mspname" was just a placeholder for the actual MSP name. But yeah, it's misleading

unless specified the default is true anyway so defining all those roles as true is actually redundant. Being able to define and set these roles was also dropped in the v2 node sdk

@neetusharma "ledgerQuery" means a different thing in this context (querying block data, etc). If you want to call a chaincode function as query, you need to set the "chaincodeQuery" attribute to true. If you also need to invoke read-write functions, then you also need the "endorsingPeer" attribute set to true.

@neetusharma The event hub could occur because you didn't specify a peer as event source (similarly to your previous errors). I'd suggest setting every peer attribute to true (which is their default value) in the network configuration and connection profile:
```yaml
channels:
  pharmachannel:
    orderers:
      - orderer.pharma-network.com
    peers:
      peer0.manufacturer.pharma-network.com:
        endorsingPeer: true
        chaincodeQuery: true
        ledgerQuery: true
        eventSource: true
```
Or just for one peer, depends on how you want to use your network. But I'd begin with allowing all peers to perform every role, and when that works, then you can restrict peer roles for the SDK if necessary.

<p><strong>neetusharma</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 07:08:42 GMT):<br/>

hyperledger fabric 1.4 as well as the client node 1.4, client java/gateway 1.4 and node/java chaincode 1.4 SDKs have reached end of life and are no longer getting new releases. All users of hyperledger fabric should have moved to the current LTS versions which as of now is hyperledger fabric 2.2 and the 2.2 versions of the client and chaincode sdks for node and java

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 08:12:29 GMT):<br/>
Not sure I understand what you mean by supported. caliper uses the fabric node sdk to interact with a hyperledger fabric network. When you issue a bind you chose the version of the node sdk to be used so as shown in the fabric tutorial `Step 1 - Create a Caliper Workspace` the bind command means that node sdk 2.2 will be used

Hi, is there a link for a tutorial on running caliper with fabcar-golang
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 17:42:14 GMT):<br/>
There is a caliper tutorial that shows how to use caliper and takes the asset-transfer-basic chaincode as an example. It demonstrates how to take an existing network which has a chaincode deployed and create the caliper assets required to benchmark it. The tutorial can be found here https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/fabric-tutorial/tutorials-fabric-existing/
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 17:43:42 GMT):<br/>
You would need to understand how your network was setup in order to create a network configuration, then you need to have an understanding of the chaincode in order to be able to write your workload modules and then create a benchmark file that utilises your workload
</p>

Thank toy for your reply and thank you for the references. All workload examples I found are in javascript. My understanding the caliper supports golang but could not fund any workload examples in go
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:59:24 GMT):<br/>
Oh right, so caliper workloads currently have to be written in Javascript, but can drive chaincode written in any language. There will be the ability to describe workloads declaratively in the future and some work on that has already been done.

Check the workload implementation, it parses and uses the `assets` argument somewhere (based on just the name, it could mean many things)

Because you have just pasted it without putting 3 back-ticks around it, all the formatting is lost and with yaml, seeing the indentation is vital, however it looks like you haven't defined the monitor correctly. Here is what I use
```
monitors:
  resource:
  - module: docker

      interval: 5
      containers:
      - all
```
This works for caliper 0.4.2

<p><strong>rejnol93</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 10:06:36 GMT):<br/>
The contracts can be listed in the config.json file, but I need a way to inject constructor arguments dynamically ( there are few different contracts which depend on each other)

<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 10:50:00 GMT):<br/>
@rejnol93 I checked quickly, and it looks like the Ethereum/Besu connector does not support contract arguments during deployment. I suggest that you deploy your contracts independently of Caliper, then provide the necessary contract data (in the network configuration file) for further interaction.

Yes u are right, I asked in the #fabric channel but no one has answered yet. I think i need to make changes in my fabric project script that was designed for 1.4.3v to make it compatible with 2.2v
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 16:10:08 GMT):<br/>
Well, looks like you need an ugly workaround to include such information manually.
1) Skip the contract installation part of the benchmark (`--caliper-flow-skip-install`), otherwise you will run into an error.
2) You must set the following attributes in the network configuration file for your contract (assuming it's named `mycontract`), under the `ethereum.contracts.mycontract` attribute:
2.1) `gas` (object) or `estimateGas` (boolean) attribute, as shown in the documentation (no hack so far)
2.2) `address` attribute, which is the address of your predeployed contract (undocumented, but should work)
2.3) `abi` attribute, as present in the contract definition file (https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/ethereum-config/#contract-definition-file). This is the ugly hack, you need to inlcude the ABI directly into the network configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 16:10:36 GMT):<br/>
And then you can just reference your contract from the workload module as `mycontract`, as usual
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 16:12:38 GMT):<br/>
You will be the first to test this workaround, so I'll eagerly await your results :) The Ethereum/Besu connector feature set is pretty limited currently, so feel free to raise a "Feature Request" issue in the repo
</p>
<p><strong>rejnol93</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 17:12:37 GMT):<br/>

hi everyone.. I've got Caliper configured as a subtree of my custom Fabric blockchain. I have it configured correctly in order to connect the network and am running a small set of tests at the moment. The arguments I'm providing are absolutely correct in terms of the custom chaincode being run, but whenever I try to create a transaction via Caliper I get the error:

`Failed to perform submit transaction [CreateAsset] using arguments [<ARGS>],  with error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'status' of undefined`

The closest thing I've been able to find is this ~2 year old issue which isn't exactly what I'm facing but it's the same sort of error at least... anybody encountered this before with Caliper V0.4.2? It's interfacing with a Fabric 2.3.3 instance on local machine via Kubernetes, with the latest SDK bound. Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated because I'm struggling to glean useful information.

The error occurs on line 237 of transactions.js inside the node_module fabric-network, where there is a strict property comparison on a commit object.

also it's worth noting that the querying part of my test rounds is yielding expected results... none of those assets get created due to the error thrown, and when querying for a given asset an error like so occurs:

@Quasso That error message looks like it's a bug in the fabric node sdk (and looking at the code it doesn't appear to be fixed in newer releases) in the fact that it should actually report an error rather than fail with a runtime failure. If it was addressed I think the error might say something like `No orderers are available to send the transaction to`. I would guess therefore that there is something not right with the way your fabric network is set up or that your network config is using a connection profile but you have specified `discover: false` and you have no orderer information in your connection profile

<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:38:02 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel thank you for your response! 

That's actually exactly what I've been thinking since I first posted this! At first, when I tried to connect Caliper with discovery enabled, my user could not even connect to the gateway... 

I disabled it and managed it to get it running, but I did tweak some configuration as I went along with it. Now, I've been able to revert to having `discovery: true` and the gateway is still connecting properly, but it can't connect to any orderers! So I am now debugging this. I have a sneaking suspicion that the documented way for v0.4.2 misled me slightly since I ended up configuring the main `config.yaml` to use the "Admin" user generated for a given organization... what I'm thinking is perhaps this configuration is also attempted for use with connecting to the orderer, in which case the TLS wouldn't match up. It's just a hunch I'm looking into for now though
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:38:53 GMT):<br/>
and if that's the case with the SDK perhaps I'll file an issue on there :)
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:42:40 GMT):<br/>
It's a minor bug in the SDK, regarding outputting an error message

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:44:25 GMT):<br/>
if a connection profile is defined as discover:true then it should discover your orderers if it doesn't find any orderers then that's a network setup issue
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:45:57 GMT):<br/>
I totally agree yes, in fact I know how to fix it very easily. The problem code is:

```
     // by now we should have a discovery handler or use the target orderers
            // that have been assigned from the channel to perform the commit
            const commitResponse = await commit.send(commitSendRequest);
            logger.debug('%s - commit response %j', method, commitResponse);
            if (commitResponse.status !== 'SUCCESS') {
                const msg = `Failed to commit transaction %${endorsement.getTransactionId()}, orderer response status: ${commitResponse.status}`;
                logger.error('%s - %s', method, msg);
                eventHandler.cancelListening();
                throw new Error(msg);
            }
```

as for your second response, the orderers are discovered correctly, they just don't connect. Before my log level on the orderer pods was INFO so I've set it to DEBUG and I'm experimenting with the TLS now since I gather that's the source of connectFailed

have modified the transaction.js library file inside my pod now to return a useful error in the event commitResponse is undefined, it now outputs a specific message in that case to guide the person to the fix (the msg contruct needed adapting too because it also uses `commitResponse.status` which needed handling properly based on whether `commitReponse` is defined or not)

@davidkel so this is strange, while debugging this without modifying my TLS just yet (since it connects et al) I've noticed this about the error being thrown when trying to connect to orderers...

```
2022-01-28T14:53:35.676Z - error: [DiscoveryService]: _buildPeer[allorgs] - Unable to connect to the discovered peer peer0.org3:7051 due to Error: Failed to connect before the deadline on Endorser- name: peer0.org3:7051, url:grpcs://localhost:7051, connected:false, connectAttempted:true
```

What's strange about that is that in my `caliper-network.yaml` file (my entrypoint for my tests) I have set `caliper.fabric.gateway.localhost = false` which works as expected with the peers (e.g. if I set it to true, I can't connect to my peers becasue it attempts to use localhost...)

<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 14:57:34 GMT):<br/>
is there some other setting I need to use in order to use the actual hostnames which are accessible in the Kubernetes cluster?
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 14:57:54 GMT):<br/>
it makes sense as to why I'm not seeing anything logged by the orderer now too
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 15:31:16 GMT):<br/>
@Quasso That error message isn't for an endorser, it's for a peer

ah sorry, that also happened with the orderer... before the peer was connecting, happens with the orderer too though

<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 15:50:13 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 15:59:05 GMT):<br/>
based on what I'm reading in the official documentation the answer to that is no, it says it's currently unused (https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/bench-config/)
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 16:07:15 GMT):<br/>
what does your network config file look like ?

<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 16:27:34 GMT):<br/>
it's worth noting that the `connectionProfile` is identical to my working API's connection
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 16:27:34 GMT):<br/>
it's worth noting that the `connectionProfile` is sharing the same json file to my API which connects properly
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 16:28:18 GMT):<br/>
as in, I have a custom NestJS API that I developed which connects using this same `../ccp/connection-org1.json` successfully and is able to create transactions on my network

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 16:43:29 GMT):<br/>
You can't put the fabric block into the network config file as it will be ignored. If you want to turn off the localhost conversion (I really do not like that this was chosen as a default by both the sdks and caliper but can't change it now) the easiest way to do that is to launch caliper with `--caliper-fabric-gateway-localhost false`
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 17:21:48 GMT):<br/>
oooooooooh YES! You're the man! It worked immediately when I ran it with that flag
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 17:22:06 GMT):<br/>
I agree about that wholeheartedly how confusing!
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 17:22:31 GMT):<br/>
:woo:
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 17:30:26 GMT):<br/>
thinking perhaps I could also submit a PR to the Caliper documentation which really led me to never consider the use of this flag (the docs actually explicitly show this flag being set in the YAML example in order to set `--caliper-fabric-gateway-localhost false`)
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 17:31:16 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure if this is covered somewhere in the docs or your expert knowledge but in reading the appropriate part, this quirk is certainly not obvious

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 17:33:16 GMT):<br/>
The section Runtime settings in https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/fabric-config/new/ talks about it a little. The config of caliper needs to be in a special file which you can then alter with cli options
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 17:49:23 GMT):<br/>
I see! Are you a core dev?
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 19:30:09 GMT):<br/>
thanks for that. I definitely feel the docs could be improved around this to be less confusing, especially because that setting in the YAML did have an impact when `gateway.enabled: false`
</p>
<p><strong>Quasso</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 19:32:55 GMT):<br/>
great to have it working as expected without any other surprising changes, though. Thank you very much for your input today, it's much appreciated.

If it is compatible with the Ethereum RPC API, then you can probably use the Ethereum/Besu connector. There's no dedicated tutorial at this moment, but you should be able to experiment with the connector based on [its docs](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/ethereum-config/) and the [Ethereum CI test structure](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/main/packages/caliper-tests-integration/ethereum_tests)

Hi! I am trying to use Caliper to test my besu network with multiple contracts.

<p><strong>Cai 238</strong> (Mon, 14 Feb 2022 11:53:16 GMT):<br/>
Hi! I am trying to use caliper to test my besu network with multiple contracts
But there is an error `Error: Returned error: Replacement transaction underpriced` when I running the launch manager command. 
as following
*When the contract is single there is no problem, but not when deploying multiple contracts. 

`2022.02.14-20:36:17.204 info  [caliper] [cli-launch-manager]    Set SUT type: ethereum

This is the networkconfig file
`{
    "caliper": {
        "blockchain": "ethereum",
        "command": {}
    },
    "ethereum": {

                "estimateGas": true,
                "gas": {
                    "open": 45000
                }
            },
            "simple2": {
                "path": "./src/simple/simple2.json",
                "estimateGas": true,
                "gas": {
                    "query": 100000
                }
            }
        }
    }
}`

Seems caliper is recognizing the two deploy transactions as the same and trying to replace the first deploy. 
Or do I need to change other configs?

I'm not familiar with ethereum but looking at the ethereum connector it looks like it just submits what is in simple.json and simple2.json so maybe there is something in those declarations which means it can't distinguish between simple and simple2

I checked the ethereum, to make a transaction it will check the sender address and nonce, if they are the same, ethereum will consider them as same transaction. But there is nowhere to set the nonce... 
The caliper homepage has an example of two contracts here, 
https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.4.2/ethereum-config/ <Contract configuration>
but no details...

Maybe the abi and bytecode have to be unique for different contracts ?
</p>
<p><strong>Cai 238</strong> (Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:02:33 GMT):<br/>
yes, the bin and abi are different. also tried different gas, ofcourse the name are different too

Caliper - Besu
hi, i changed my plan to run without contract installation, using `--caliper-flow-only-test=true`
but i still got an error `Error: You must provide the json interface of the contract when instantiating a contract object.`
i checked the config guide still couldn't get the clue where to set the path of abi file to worker. 
can any one help me?

I don't see this line output `Skipping initialization phase due to benchmark flow conditioning` which I would expect maybe try just specifying `--caliper-flow-only-test` (ie without the =true bit)
</p>
<p><strong>Cai 238</strong> (Wed, 16 Feb 2022 00:00:25 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel thank you, i dipped to the source code and changed the config file inside the node_modules to solved this problem. and i will try your idea, better do from command line.
