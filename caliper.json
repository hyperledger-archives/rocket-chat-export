{"msg":"There is no simple answer for that question. So here is a long \"answer\" :) And I hope the core devs will correct me if I'm wrong. \nCapacity planning/management is a broad topic. The required resource size depends on a lot of things, for example (in the context of Caliper and Fabric):\n1) The complexity of the transactions (basically the complexity of the deployed chaincode). Even if you generate thousands of transactions per second with Caliper, the endorsing peers might not be able to keep up with that kind of load. \n2) The number of transactions you want to generate per second. If you want a constant 100 TPS load with 1 local Caliper client, then between sending two transaction proposals you can only \"waste\" 10 ms to run other code, or you won't be able to keep up the 100 TPS (someone correct me if I miscalculate), and that's not a lot of time. So you have to \"smear\"  that TPS across multiple local clients (lets say 5 clients with 20 TPS each, that's 50 ms to waste between transaction proposals). But you are still using the same host machine, and maybe your network connection is not fast enough to generate that kind of TPS. Then you use Caliper with Zookeeper, and face the same challenge on multiple host. :)\n3) Same challenges for other Fabric components: orderer service, msp, channels, multiple chaincodes per channel, etc.\n\nYou could fill a PhD thesis by taking on these challenges :)","username":"klenik","ts":"2018-04-11T13:11:58.187Z"}

{"msg":"@RobertDiebels @lotty02cho The Fabric paper:\n- evaluated a different chaincode \n- used a custom system chaincode for some transaction validation (by-passing the grpc communication between peer and normal chaincodes)\n- used quite powerful (multi-core) VM instances\n- played around with the block size and block timeout settings\n\nIf you want to increase the throughput for the `simple` benchmark:\n- vertical scaling (stronger machines), as @RobertDiebels suggested, but it has its limits\n- horizontal scaling: increase the number of peers per organization (and probably use kafka ordering instead of solo)\n\nSince the endorsement policy for the `simpletest` chaincode is 2-of-2 (or n-of-n generally), you need one endorsement from every organization, but it doesn't matter, which peer gives it from that org. So you could send the 1st Tx to org1-peer1, org2-peer1, the 2nd Tx to org1-peer2, org2-peer2, and so on, in a round-robin (basically load balancing) manner. Currently Caliper doesn't allow the callback modules to chose the target peers for a Tx invoke.

{"msg":"@anant706 \nQ1-2) In the summary you see the client side observations. Your 5 clients (I think that's the number for the config you're using) submitted 1000 transactions in total. They sent these transaction at a rate of 49 transactions per second (TPS). The DLT platform (here Fabric) processed (endorsed, ordered and committed) these transactions at a rate of 47 TPS. So you could say that Fabric handled your transaction load (the 2 TPS difference aside). Peers don't contribute to the send rate, that's a client side load generated by the processes Caliper spawns. The throughput is affected by the peers (numbers, resources) since they commit the transactions, and the throughput is the number of transactions committed per second.\n\nQ3) First, the difference between the `peer...` and `dev-peer...` containers. When you instantiate a chaincode, every peer that instantiated the chaincode (thus becoming endorsing peer for that chaincode) creates and start a separate Docker container for the running chaincode (separation is good most of the time: robustness, security, etc.). So your `peer...` containers are the Fabric binaries, and they manage multiple channels, chaincodes, etc., so they consume some memory. Your chaincode container/binary on the other hand is (hopefully) not that complicated so it consumes less. \n\nQ4) I assume that you're also interested the resource utilization differences between two `peer...` containers. For every round (and for the entire round), Caliper selects a random peer from each organization to send the endorsements to. So it's possible that a peer is not (or just a few times) selected for the entire test. That's why you see this difference between peer containers. This limitation will be lifted soon.","username":"klenik","ts":"2018-11-24T10:08:41.013Z"}

{"msg":"@anant706 It is the average rate of all 5 clients. The sending rate is set in the rate controller section of the configuration and it's automatically distributed among the clients. For example, if you set a fix rate of 100 TPS, and you have 10 clients configured (in the clients section of the config), then every client will send transactions at 10 TPS. So just decreasing the number of clients won't decrease the sending rate.\n\nFor the second question. It depends. The throughput can't be higher than the sending rate, since the best case is that Fabric can process transactions as fast as you (your clients) send them (in this case sending TPS = throughput). But if you send at a really high TPS then it might overload the system, which may decrease the throughput if the system is not prepared for this (this phenomenon is called thrashing).

I'm interested in intelligent benchmarking for reasons that will be obvious to this group.  I have a few initial questions and will greatly appreciate any help or wisdom that anyone has to share!\nFirst - I read the papers published by the group who wrote BLOCKBENCH and noticed BLOCKBENCH is cited by Caliper.  As a performance analysis tool, does anyone have any notes about why I might choose to use one over the other?  Both? Pros and cons? Unique workloads?\nSecond - I've already run into trouble installing Caliper.  I'll take another stab and come back with specific errors.  Does anybody have any additional notes or resources beyond the main documentation page?  (I'm an npm newbie)  I'm installing on a linux system running Ubuntu 16.04.\nThanks in advance, and thanks for writing Caliper! it seems like a cool tool.","username":"amiec","ts":"2018-12-26T21:56:57.313Z"}

Caliper will record the submitting time and committing time (the time when the tx is committed on the ledger or when the failure occurred) for each tx.\nSo the send rate is calculated by (Succ+Fail) / (last submitting time - first submitting time).\nThe throughput is calculated by Succ/(last committing time - first submitting time), here only successful committed txs will be calculated. 2. Because the last committing time is greater than the last submitting time, and the (Succ + Fail) is greater than Succ, so the send rate is greater than the throughput. 3.

Clone the repo again, and take a look at [this Fabric adapter configuration](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/Fabric_Ccp_Configuration.html), for example. Nothing else should be changed (but you can remove the chaincodes from the config you don't need, so they don't take up time and storage in your nodes).","username":"klenik","ts":"2019-03-11T13:27:52.035Z"}
{"msg":"Hey all, a question about using the *Sawtooth* adapter...  The network configuration file specifies the URLs for the REST-api containers, and from what I can see in the code, it is important to provide a complete array of the REST-api URLs for all validators, otherwise the workload won't be delivered proportionally across the number of nodes in the network.  (right?)  The other URL specified in the network config file is the validator's URL.  From what I can see in the code, this is used to create an event subscription stream that is used to inform many of the other functionalities of Caliper - like the metrics and any errors coming from the validator (right?)  My final question is:  What if I have a larger network of dozens of validator nodes?  Is there a risk of having biased information by only taking event subscriptions from a single one of them??  For example, if it is used to get transaction commit times, but for some reason this particular validator is less-well connected to the network than other peers and is therefore receiving blocks a little later than others... or is on a machine that is squeezing it out in terms of resource availability.  What are people's thoughts on this matter?","username":"amiec","ts":"2019-03-11T22:42:41.463Z"}

{"msg":"1. The fork I created has some extra features that I used to get it up and running in k8s properly. For one it has a filter on image-names. K8s creates a bunch of similarly named containers for each peer-deployment. Since my configuration uses dockers-unix socket on each node Caliper needs to filter the image names. Otherwise it will catch a lot of bloat from other containers.\n2. I'm not sure whether or not you need to make any adjustments to caliper in order for this to work. I only ran Caliper from inside the same cluster as Fabric and using brand new clusters. Hypothetically it should work since it's just a url change. So long as each node exposes the docker unix-socket threw HTTP you should be good to go. Note: That exposing your docker unix-socket is generally considered a big no-no.

{"msg":"Hi all - there are quite a few questions about targeting existing Fabric networks using Caliper. Essentially the network config file is an augmented connection profile, with information on all orgs etc to enable chaincode installation. If we consider \"an existing fabric network\" to be a network that is ready to issue transactions to via a client (ie chaincode is already installed/instantiated), then we can possibly make the connection far simpler for you by enabling the use of:\n- a connection profile\n- a file wallet\nTo connect and transact with the network. These items should be readily available to you all, or at the very least trivial to construct. We should also put together a tutorial to make required steps easy to follow.\n\nAny thoughts/comments welcome!","username":"nkl199","ts":"2019-08-16T08:48:04.094Z"}

{"msg":"Well, the core problem is that a TX reads a key at version X, and during its life-cycle that key is updated to version Y by an other TX. Whether you can circumvent this problem depends mainly on your business use case.\n1. If you have financial-like logic, like the above transfer, then the more accounts you have in the ledger, the smaller the probability that two TXs would like to modify the same account/key in a short time window (which would cause a dependency between them, and probably MVCC conflict). This is the main motivation behind the execute-order-validate consensus style (and optimistic concurrency control in general). It scalable, and most of the time conflict free.\n2. If your TX batch timeout (or other) setting is large(ish), then the life-cycle of a TX will be longer (longer time between reads during endorsement and reads during validation). Thus increasing the probability of MVCC conflicts. You can shorten the batch times, but that has a limit of course.\n3. Sometimes you can circumvent conflicts by design, ensuring that they can never occur. A fine example for that is the high throughput chaincode example: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/v1.4.4/high-throughput\n\nN.B.: The above points are based on my experience with Fabric, I don't have the measurements (yet) to support those hypotheses.

{"msg":"Hi.\nI am planning to test on Hyperledger Besu with Hyperledger Caliper.\nAccording to Doc( https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/vLatest/installing-caliper/ ), it says that it supports Besu version up to 1.3.2.\nIn our project, we plan to launch the service before May by applying 1.4.0 or 1.4.1.

{"msg":"Hi @jongyoon,\n\nI'm afraid that I wouldn't use v0.3.0 of Caliper to test Besu. It will run, but the results you'll get out of it aren't indicative of real performance. I submitted a PR yesterday to address this issue. https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/780\n\nIf you test using that PR, be sure to set up your benchmark to connect to Besu via websockets, as otherwise you'll see poor performance and quite a few errors. This is because of a problem with a library that Caliper uses, not because of a problem with Besu.\n\nHope this helps!","username":"benjamincburns","ts":"2020-04-01T16:13:46.042Z"}

Each Worker is indeed *successfully* submitting 40 transactions, and publish the *testResult* message on the MQTT broker\n3. The *mqtt-master-messenger* gets correctly each testResult message from the Worker \n4. The *RoundOrchestrator* on the Master, once it received the results from the WorkerOrchestrator, calls `await this.report.processPrometheusTPSResults({start, end}, roundConfig, index);` for the round index: this function makes *queries* on Prometheus using the *prometheus-query-client*\n5.

{"msg":"I am pretty sure I solved the problem.\nSo, the reason why the Caliper report won't print out ALL the transactions submitted by the Workers when using Prometheus is the following:\n1. When the `CaliperLocalClient` (Worker) executes `doTest()`, at the beginning of the function it sets the *txUpdateTime*, which can be configured in `caliper.yaml` (otherwise the default is 1000ms)\n2. The *txUpdateTime* is the frequency the `CaliperLocalClient` calls the `txUpdate()` function, which will *push* transactions statistics on the Prometheus push gateway\n3. Inside `doTest()`, the Client will call either `runFixedNumber()` or `runDuration()`: these functions execute the workloads (submit txns) and when all the Promises resolve, they set the *endTime* variable\n4. When these functions completed, some clean up is performed inside `doTest()` and `clearUpdateInter(txUpdateInter)` executes the last `txUpdate()` call\n5. The *endTime* variable is sent along with the results to the Master, where it is returned to the `RoundOrchestrator`\n6. The RoundOrchestrator now wants to build the report, and calls `await this.report.processPrometheusTPSResults({start, end}, roundConfig, index)`, where *end* is the *endTime* recorded above: through this function, queries are issued to Prometheus in order to retrieve the Caliper txn metrics at *time = endTime*\n7.

{"msg":"@dporto Some additional insights, since I've been using Caliper with Swarm for a while now.\n1. The start/end commands should be lightweight commands for basic init/cleanup tasks. Since Caliper has its own container, these won't be necessary probably. The commands are definitely **not** for swarm deployments. \n2. You'll need the distributed deployment model of Caliper:https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/v0.3.2/architecture/#distributed-message-broker-communication\n3. Once the Fabric services are deployed, then you can deploy your MQTT broker, your Caliper Worker services (using the `launch worker` command for the service), and the Caliper master service (using the `launch master` command for the service).\n4. Once the Caliper master service starts up, that will be the automatic start of your benchmark, targeting an already running Fabric (as Nick said). \n\nSo I wouldn't touch the Caliper image, since you won't need docker-in-docker in a well-designed scenario.

I'm confused right now, does that mean the connection between peer doesn't actually mean they connected between hosts? (because when i ping from inside the peer container, all of the other containers have IP 10.0.2.x even containers from different hosts, so I doubt they actually pinged the real host). does that mean caliper aren't actually connecting via multi-hosts???","username":"hazbiy97","ts":"2020-07-20T20:23:45.833Z"}

The long answer is that percentile calculation would require storing TX results, and Caliper is currently \"stateless\" to support long running benchmarks (approximating the percentile would be possible with limited state storage).

{"msg":"hi, a few questions above so will try to answer them:\n- MVCC_READ_CONFLICT is a fabric thing, because you are trying to change something based on out of date information. More/less of these is simply a result of the system being able to process transactions such that there is less occurrence \n- Not familiar with the benchmark you are running, but it is possible that the workers are not adding worker UUIDs to help make transactions unique\n- For monitoring docker resources, the docker sock mapping is required by the master container","username":"nkl199","ts":"2020-08-19T07:34:20.876Z"}
{"msg":"thanks for replying @nkl199 , here are some answers:\n- the MVCC behavior is consistent and the only thing I made different in both benchmarks was that one run in containers and the other dont. I ssh into the machines, open terminals and type the commands manually (tmux). There are 4 clients connected via mosquitto each one connected to one peer. There are 4 peers in total.\nWith the fabric network up, I run the baremental benchmark several times with the same result. \nCaliper has initialized the benchmark only once to install the smartcontracts. and the command line run only the --caliper-flow-only-test\nAfter installing the contracts, I run either the baremetal command (master and workers) or start each container manually\nIn all cases they connect and issue transactions","username":"dporto","ts":"2020-08-19T08:14:10.531Z"}

In your workload module, you can choose a target chaincode and invoker identity for every TX.

I tried to run caliper in my existing setup without service discovery. In the network config file, I have mentioned the client for org A. When I run caliper, I checked the peer logs of all the 5 peer orgs. I created client only for orgA. But in the peer logs I can able to see all the chaincode transactions. How is this possible? As per logic, the transaction should take place only in the org A peer. The chaincode is committed in the channel, it contains endorsement policy how come when the caliper tries to invoke it is not showing endorsement policy failure error? \n\nI have written a bench config,\nname: Bank\n  description: This is an Test senario for the module Bank\n  workers:\n    type: local\n    number: 1\n  rounds:\n    - label: BankDetailsCC --  SaveBank\n      description: Test description to store bank details through the deployed chaincode\n      txNumber: 100\n      rateControl:\n        type: fixed-rate\n        opts:\n          tps: 20\n      arguments:\n      callback: src/fabric/scenario/BankDetailsCC/SaveBank.js\n    - label: BankDetailsCC --  GetAllBank\n      description: Test description for listing the bank details through the deployed chaincode\n      txNumber: 100\n      rateControl:\n        type: fixed-rate\n        opts:\n          tps: 50\n      arguments:\n      callback: src/fabric/scenario/BankDetailsCC/GetAllBank.js\n\nIn this, I allocate one worker and 100 transactions.

I am calculating round trip latency and my concern is, while transmitting some packets might get lost and not reach the destination, so while the term \"messages/ second\" signifies the rate at which messages are being sent from the publisher, I am not sure if the term \"throughput\" carries the same meaning or is equivalent to \"number of messages sent for which acknowledgement was received per second\".","username":"prakharsr","ts":"2021-02-28T03:59:21.901Z"}

{"msg":"Hello everyone, I am new to Caliper and working on benchmarking an existing deployment and had a question. Is it possible to override the IP addresses for discovered nodes using dynamic connection profiles? I am running a modified version of test network (2 orgs with 2 peers each, 5 orderers raft with `asset-transfer-basic` installed and working) deployed multi-host across 4 machines (docker swarm) and am having trouble connecting my caliper instance. I followed the docs and had no issues benchmarking a local deployment of test network. However, when I use discovery with my profile, I receive connection timeout errors for the nodes running on other machines (I am running Caliper on the primary host, which is also running 2 orders and a peer). In the error, the url is always grpcs://localhost:xxxx which seems to be the issue because I am not running a purely localhost setup. However, I am unsure of how to rectify this after much searching and reading of the documents. For full disclosure I have already tried multiple times to write static connection profiles and turn off discovery, but all of my static profile attempts yield errors like _No valid responses from any peers_ or _failed to commit transaction %undefined, order response status: UNKNOWN_, which leads me to believe the hardcoded addresses in the static profile are also not working.

{"msg":"@davidkel thank you for your response! \n\nThat's actually exactly what I've been thinking since I first posted this! At first, when I tried to connect Caliper with discovery enabled, my user could not even connect to the gateway... \n\nI disabled it and managed it to get it running, but I did tweak some configuration as I went along with it. Now, I've been able to revert to having `discovery: true` and the gateway is still connecting properly, but it can't connect to any orderers! So I am now debugging this. I have a sneaking suspicion that the documented way for v0.4.2 misled me slightly since I ended up configuring the main `config.yaml` to use the \"Admin\" user generated for a given organization... what I'm thinking is perhaps this configuration is also attempted for use with connecting to the orderer, in which case the TLS wouldn't match up.
