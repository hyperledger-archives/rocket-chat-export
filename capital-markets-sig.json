{"msg":"@here \n\nThe Capital Markets SIG is live. We need your contributions and collaboration to make it a success.\nThis is the very first real post on #capital-markets-sig . \n\n\nAll are welcome!\nPlease note that you can join the Community even if you or your company are not formal paid-up members of Hyperledger or the Linux Foundation.\n\nPrerequisite for effective participation in the Hyperledger Community is the creation of a Linux Foundation ID which is needed for joining the rocket chat channels, email lists and for editing wiki pages.\nPlease follow directions for the creation of an LFID, if you do not have one.\n  \nThe following resources have been created for the Capital Markets SIG\nA Rocket Chat channel  - Please  join this channel(sic)\nEmail list for Capital Markets SIG communications - please sign up! Announcements and interactions will happen on this list.\nThe Capital Markets SIG wiki page. This is the location listing all the resources as well as the links relevant to the SIG. \nI propose that the first audio call of the SIG on Wednesday the 17th of July at 9 am. EST (13:00 UTC). \nDetails of the zoom channel and the complete Agenda will be posted on the wiki as well as the channel and the email list.\nI chose the time based on the composition of the interested parties and my best guess for their location.\nWe can pick a better time if people have other suggestions. If needed, we can also use a poll to determine a better time that suits people.  \n\nWe need a volunteer for the vice-chair to support and fill-in for the chair as needed. If there are multiple volunteers, we will need an election.\n\nI proposed the SIG and worked with @KOttoni  from Linux Foundation and Hyperledger to launch the SIG. Karen will be the Point Of Contact from the Linux Foundation for the SIG.\n\nWe had able assistance from the Community Architects of Hyperledger to create the SIG resources for collaboration as well as guidance on the governance of the SIG. \nSpecial thanks to @rjones , @Silona  and @Daniela_Barbosa \n\nGiven below is the tentative Agenda of the first call.\n\nAnti Trust Policy & Code of Conduct\nIntroductions\nVolunteer to scribe and record.\nTopics for the SIG\n\n\nPlease introduce yourself on the SIG email list; with views on the SIG aims and direction.

The community is working on a series of projects under the SIG umbrella. They deal with regulation, standards, structure and life cycle of instruments like equities and bonds. One of the most important areas of investigation are the tokenisation of assets. We meet regularly on a zoom conference call every two weeks, Wednesday at 10 am. Eastern Standard Time which is 15:00 UTC.\n\nThe Token Taxonomy Initiative (TTI) has been working to develop a set of common terms and a framework around tokens. They have just released a version 1.0 of their Token Taxonomy Framework.  Marley Gray, Principal Architect, Azure Blockchain Engineering, Microsoft; who is also the chair of the TTI working group will make a presentation of TTI's work to the SIG on Wednesday the 20th at 10 am.

Platform specific data will be at the end, so that the extensions do not break the implementations. this follows the standard for extensible interactions; i.e. have a standard header, so that you can interpret this across the board and call the specific implementation if it is available.

Motorcycle loans from a pool of 5000 loans have to track cashflows.\n    Vipin talked about the eThaler project, motivation and implementation timeline with a call on Friday. Any securitization project consists of three items 1. Identity 2. Assets and their management 3. Payment rails through CBDC or attachments to stablecoins or other tokens.\n    Mani talked about 1.
