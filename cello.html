I guess same

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:39:09 GMT):<br/>
aha, seems in the image building, you're using cache.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:39:28 GMT):<br/>
can u help remove all those related images and try redeploy again?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:40:08 GMT):<br/>
you mean use docker rmi 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:40:12 GMT):<br/>
yeap
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:40:45 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:41:56 GMT):<br/>
Removed all now
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:42:05 GMT):<br/>
using sudo make setup again
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:42:52 GMT):<br/>
sure, let's see what happens
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:52:07 GMT):<br/>
Its setup stage now. It would take some time.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:52:27 GMT):<br/>
Meanwile I did a `sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker` and docker restart to start afresh
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:53:09 GMT):<br/>
just to rule out any old images issue

<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:08:38 GMT):<br/>
it is using python3.5
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:10:22 GMT):<br/>
can u try get the version of compose inside the container?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:10:31 GMT):<br/>
seems it has issues
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:11:21 GMT):<br/>
I cannot login to container itself it is in "Restarting" mode
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:11:35 GMT):<br/>
also I guess I saw similar bug before
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:11:37 GMT):<br/>
pip install docker-py
pip install docker-compose
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:11:41 GMT):<br/>
this seems to fix it
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:11:47 GMT):<br/>
shall I try this in the requirements.txt
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:11:53 GMT):<br/>
docker-compose
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:12:01 GMT):<br/>
i know, u can just start one container with that image using docker run -it xxx_image bash
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:12:25 GMT):<br/>
ok I would try now
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:12:36 GMT):<br/>
Here're the original requirements.txt content: ```docker-compose>=1.7.0

gunicorn>=19.0.0
pymongo>=3.2.0
requests>=2.0.0```
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:12:50 GMT):<br/>
On the top line, we did install docker-compose
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:13:06 GMT):<br/>
i suppose whether the latest docker-compose changes sth
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:15:02 GMT):<br/>
`docker-compose version` inside the container
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:15:11 GMT):<br/>
ERROR: Dependency conflict: an older version of the 'docker-py' package is polluting the namespace. Run the following command to remedy the issue:

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:16:48 GMT):<br/>
One quick test is to update the top line of the original requirements to 'docker-compose==1.7.0',  then try rebuild. to see if it works
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:18:19 GMT):<br/>
also I noticed this message
</p>

yeah

Ok, strange, the compose complains about the docker-py it installs. I will try to explore why those two do not match each other.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:48:17 GMT):<br/>
is there a particular docker-py version you are using?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:48:29 GMT):<br/>
like 1.7 or 1.8
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:48:45 GMT):<br/>
with docker compose 1.7
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:48:58 GMT):<br/>
docker is notorious in breaking with version numbers
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:50:47 GMT):<br/>
currently the container is using 1.10.6 of docker-py
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 07:52:13 GMT):<br/>
the docker-py is a dependency by docker-compose, should be automatically matched. I'm trying to find a clean server to have a fresh installation. To see if meet similar issue
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 08:24:52 GMT):<br/>
@Amjadnz sorry for the waiting, i'm still downloading the docker images... bad network...

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:00:27 GMT):<br/>
the latest docker-compose 1.10 seems build failed in its repo https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docker-compose/1.10.1
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:01:05 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:01:58 GMT):<br/>
i also met the similar problem with latest docker-compose, and i update the requirements with a new fresh installation, it works.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:02:03 GMT):<br/>
removed all images and containers and also the /var/lib/docker
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:02:16 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:02:16 GMT):<br/>
docker-compose==1.7.0 works with clean installation.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:02:22 GMT):<br/>
ok lets try that
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:02:34 GMT):<br/>
docker-compose==1.9.0 also works
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:02:54 GMT):<br/>
oh, sorry, 1.9.0 not work
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:03:34 GMT):<br/>

my bad
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:18:34 GMT):<br/>
actually it has to be make redeploy service=dashboard
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:18:36 GMT):<br/>
doing that npw
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:18:38 GMT):<br/>
now
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:19:14 GMT):<br/>
this is what i'm using: "make stop; docker rmi cello-dashbard cello-watchdog cello-restserver; make start"
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:19:34 GMT):<br/>
with 1.7.0~1.9.0, it works
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:23:02 GMT):<br/>
retrying that again now
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:23:11 GMT):<br/>
I mean your command
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:23:45 GMT):<br/>
with compose==1.10.0, it does not work
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:25:47 GMT):<br/>
Now after this change I have the restserver up
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:25:53 GMT):<br/>
watchdog up
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:26:00 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:41:50 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 09:42:08 GMT):<br/>
atleast with this exercise we could make watchdog and restserver working

we might have to update the requirements - if somebody needs it down the line

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 10:32:17 GMT):<br/>
yea
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 10:32:39 GMT):<br/>
need to update that, thanks!

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 10:40:33 GMT):<br/>
would u like to take the honor to submit a patchset :grinning:
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:06:06 GMT):<br/>
Surely - but its such a small find. Your project is pretty fast.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:06:37 GMT):<br/>
vast and I should have really something substantial to take credit. thanks anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:07:00 GMT):<br/>
but you did all the work. great work by the way.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:11:00 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, it would be nice if you can help fix the problem, and do remember to add the "fix #CE-11"  in the git commit msg. Also, I can also help do that if not convenient to u :)
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:14:53 GMT):<br/>
Sure no problems
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:27:39 GMT):<br/>
Yang - I've done the git commit 
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:27:59 GMT):<br/>
when I'm trying git review its saying "review" commad not find
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:28:27 GMT):<br/>
`git review
git: 'review' is not a git command. See 'git --help'`
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:28:51 GMT):<br/>
as per the documents - I have to do a git commit and then git review
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:35:14 GMT):<br/>
aha, u may need to install git-review manually, remember it's a python lib, too
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:35:56 GMT):<br/>
where's ur patch? cannot find it.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:36:53 GMT):<br/>
i submit in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5561/, FYI. 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:37:15 GMT):<br/>
pls see the commit msg for reference, i can drop my submit when u've done :)

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 11:54:59 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 12:11:09 GMT):<br/>
Shall I do the commit again
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 12:17:32 GMT):<br/>
but you said 1.9.0 is not fine right?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 12:18:44 GMT):<br/>
so its 1.7 or 1.8
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 12:18:55 GMT):<br/>
i need to check with 1.8 too
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 12:27:47 GMT):<br/>
actually, 1.7.0~1.9.0 works. while 1.10.0 does not work. Pls see my submit as an example. U can just revise the submission with `git commit -a --amend`, after that, `git review` again. See docs on how to contribute.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 12:42:03 GMT):<br/>

Hi, I ran cello with the docker-compose file in the git repo (without changing anything).
I connected to the dashboard via the default login/pass. But I get a jinja2 exception about index.html template not found

If I follow https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/deployment.md I have the same error. Maybe the problem is that "git clone https://github.com/yeasy/cello" is not perfect? There is "dasbard" (without o) again in cello/docker-compose.yml. The error remained the same: I can not log in to dashboard, it receives login and pwd, but then: Not found.
</p>
<p><strong>SzaboZoltan</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 13:48:57 GMT):<br/>
(I meant: "dashbard"). A made a screencast while I installed the stuff to a scrach fresh EC2 image. Maybe the user permissons are not perfect also? (If I install everything as root...)
</p>
<p><strong>SzaboZoltan</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 14:02:23 GMT):<br/>
Now I see that "git clone http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/cello" is the better choice. PLEASE CORRECT it in the deployment.md, because it's very frustrating installing again-and-again, with the promise that it should work (and, in fact, it should not, with the "old" cello).
</p>
<p><strong>SzaboZoltan</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 14:11:23 GMT):<br/>
Now it really works. :-)

Please help to start at least one compute node. If I try to start it via 127.0.0.1:2375, it writes in log: The daemon_url is inactive:tcp://127.0.0.1:2375. (If I try docker -H 127.0.0.1:2375 version, it shows itself nicely.)

Hi, just like to say nice work with cello - been playing with it for a couple of days
</p>
<p><strong>brett09</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 01:02:53 GMT):<br/>
Some items I have come across - like SzaboZoltan the git reference in the deployment doc is out of date - either http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/cello or https://github.com/hyperledger/cello seem to be the primary now
</p>
<p><strong>brett09</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 01:03:09 GMT):<br/>
also I had issues deploying chains - compose_up()] - Exception when compose start=.FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './_compose_files/local/cluster-4.yml'
</p>
<p><strong>brett09</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 01:03:43 GMT):<br/>
I changed cello/src/_compose_files/syslog to cello/src/_compose_files/local and it worked

@baohua Do I have write permissions? :-) [For now, it would be easier if You could do it instead of me.]
</p>
<p><strong>SzaboZoltan</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 17:57:51 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal  Did you try NOT to use the officially documented "git clone ...cello" but instead of it: git clone http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/cello ? Then (or before) delete everything from /var/lib/docker/, pull the images again and it will (hopefully) work.
</p>
<p><strong>SzaboZoltan</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:00:38 GMT):<br/>
@brett09 Could you add more compute nodes also? Which way?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:55:38 GMT):<br/>
I used the "documented" way...

Are the "System Requirements" actually required and/or enforced?  I mean for testing/development it seems 8c16g100g is pretty hefty
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sat, 11 Feb 2017 23:51:10 GMT):<br/>
This actually depends on the workload. And the requirement is a recommended one for most cases. 
</p>
<p><strong>SzaboZoltan</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 06:27:38 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @toddinpal But until you get to a working one it's enough a cheap or a free tyer virtual machine also. (The "8c16g100g" costs a LOT on Amazon, I tried for a few hours.)
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 12:12:25 GMT):<br/>
Yang - this is Amjad again. Got all working fine now.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 12:12:46 GMT):<br/>
Question : we have to deploy a chaincode - and if my understanding is correct
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 12:12:53 GMT):<br/>
I follow these steps
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 12:13:15 GMT):<br/>
1. 4 node setup (1 Master Cello and 3 Worker Nodes)
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 12:13:31 GMT):<br/>
2. Startup Master, All Worker Nodes
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 12:13:47 GMT):<br/>
3. Conenect to dashboard and add all nodes
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 12:14:28 GMT):<br/>
4. On Dashboard add the Active Chains
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 12:15:02 GMT):<br/>
5. Connect to NODE01 and deploy my chain code (REGULAR DEPLOY REST API)
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 12:15:29 GMT):<br/>
6. I should be in a position to see the Nodes get auto populated and in working condition on all ndoes?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 12:15:38 GMT):<br/>
I'm in 2 minds on step 4
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 12:15:56 GMT):<br/>
Should I create an active chain or it would auto populate
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 00:40:47 GMT):<br/>
Regardless of the workload, are the requirements enforced?  Those requirements are very substantial.  For experimentation it's hard to believe you need an 8 core 16 GB machine.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 01:05:37 GMT):<br/>
@Amjadnz In step 4, you can find a auto-fill checkbox at the host property. if u check in that, then will fill up with chains automatically. otherwise, need to manually create chain on specific host :)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 01:05:56 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal aha, the requirements are not enforced if you just need some simple test :)
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 01:23:31 GMT):<br/>
@baohua Thanks!  I'll look for other reasons I'm having problems.  :-)   I'm sure I'm suffering from network problems.  I'm running one Virtualbox VM as the Cello master on my laptop and was hoping to add 4 CoreOS Virtualbox VMs as my worker nodes.  My plan was to have each VM have a NAT network connection (to get to the outside world if needed) and a host only network connection for inter-node communication.  I suspect that is doable, but I also suspect I've not got something configured correctly.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 01:24:43 GMT):<br/>
yeap, it should work, and i also encourage u help update the doc if you make it work. I never tested at CoreOS, but seems it's interesting :grinning:

Hi Yang - Please note that there is no documentation of how to deploy a chaincode to the WORKER Node. and get it auto replicated in multiple nodes. 
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 09:53:55 GMT):<br/>
Seems there is some issue with my understanding and the available docs are not giving a clear picture. 
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 09:54:10 GMT):<br/>
So this is what I did
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 09:54:28 GMT):<br/>
1. Setup the 4 node setup
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 09:54:44 GMT):<br/>
2. Added them one by one to the dashboard - ALL FINE here no issues
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 09:55:26 GMT):<br/>
3. this is starting the 4 containers at WORKER_NODE 01
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 09:55:43 GMT):<br/>
the moment I create a ACTIVE_CHAIN
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 09:55:58 GMT):<br/>
docker ps command output
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:01:28 GMT):<br/>
Now I would like to deploy the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:01:36 GMT):<br/>
so I login to bash the first container
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:01:48 GMT):<br/>
sudo docker exec -it 58a17f46f113a9000a123ee3_vp0 bash

build my chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:02:05 GMT):<br/>
and exit
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:02:24 GMT):<br/>
from the mac I issue a deploy command

<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:13:12 GMT):<br/>

So far the chaincode is deployed
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:26:44 GMT):<br/>
But I'm not able to query it
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:27:48 GMT):<br/>
My Question is 2 fold and that we might have to add to the documentation as well
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:28:20 GMT):<br/>
1. In traditional hyperledger scenario - I startup using docker-compose with 4 nodes with a yaml file
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:28:43 GMT):<br/>
And that is listening on the port 2375 and all nodes are up
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:29:17 GMT):<br/>
I use the deploy method to deploy the chaincode and the guest OS Creates a seperate container with the GUID of the vm.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:29:59 GMT):<br/>
So if I had 4 nodes - the guest os now has 5 nodes (4 hyperledger nodes + 1 node for new chaincode)
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:31:18 GMT):<br/>
Now if I had 4 machines connected to the network - and they are communicating - the same VM is copied automatically to all the machines and all is fine and dusted. I did all these and there seems to be no confusion there on the HYPERLEDGER front.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:32:14 GMT):<br/>
Question 1: In CELLO the dashboard server is started up by using "sudo make restart" - all nodes are up *dashboard, *nginx, *mongodb, *watchdog , *restserver
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:32:47 GMT):<br/>
So it does not involve in any chaincode deployment - correct?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:35:22 GMT):<br/>
Question 2: In CELLO the worker node is suppose to have the chaincode. But the worker node is actually creating 4 VMs with same ID 58a17f46f113a9000a123ee3_vp0 , vp1, vp2 and vp3 - where should the chaincode go
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:36:00 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for my long post - but these show my excitement with cello I guess :grinning:
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:39:12 GMT):<br/>
So when I do a CURL to query
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:39:14 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:12:08 GMT):<br/>
@Amjadnz aha, seems lots of question. In brief, we do not provide a ui to support chaincode deploy/management. We currently only have the admin ui to help manage chains. And certainly any such developer ui is welcome.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:06:46 GMT):<br/>

I have a chaincode now deployed on the node0 - how do I get the same chaincode in node1
Is it automated?
I can see 4 containers created by the Node01 once I deploy the chaincode
But Node02 has no references towards it
Chaincode instances containers are created on the SINGLE HOST Node only with no copies on the other nodes? Is my statement correct?

Do you have an idea if this might change in near future as this is a pretty needy feature
</p>

Or is it community driven

<p><strong>SzaboZoltan</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 17:44:51 GMT):<br/>
Can I get an example docker-compose.yml for setting up some (4) worker nodes just for test? With the appropriate ports open? :-)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 01:39:29 GMT):<br/>
no, that's not the correct way. the worker nodes need to be setup manually before u can use it, as described in the documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 09:22:23 GMT):<br/>
@SzaboZoltan Why u need to remove the .gitignore file in this change?

@baohua I set up a test project with a new JIRA workflow, could you try it out and let me know if you want something like it for cello? https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/WFT/issues/?filter=allopenissues
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sat, 25 Feb 2017 02:00:28 GMT):<br/>

Hi! The whole Cello project looks very cool to my eyes, thanks for starting it and hope it will grow. I didn't use it much, but for spinning the network on the local vagrant it was very usefull (then we moved to bluemix to continue experiments). I believe it has great potential for those who start working with Fabric and in future consortiums based on it
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 23:30:03 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @akm4 , yes, that's why we start that project, to help save time/effort to provision and manage those blockchains. Welcome for more feedbacks, and any type of contribution including bug fix and documentation.

By the way, is there any plans to collaborate with fabric-composer team? I think, the projects are close by the idea (with some key differences of course)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 06:26:23 GMT):<br/>
yeap, cello will definitely collaborate with other hyperledger projects, welcome for any idea and discussions :)
</p>
<p><strong>akm4</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 07:01:32 GMT):<br/>
the idea is simple - to deploy and manage chaincode installations, like fabric-composer allows to (though in a bit unusual way). Would be handy for the administrators of the "consortium" 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 14:40:05 GMT):<br/>
IMHO, the main function of composer is to help generate chaincode, then cello may help the usage of those chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>akm4</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 14:53:51 GMT):<br/>
sure! i meant that it would be cool to manage the chaincode lifecycle in the network - deploy, instantiate etc. And of course to have an audit (in blockchain style perhaps!) of what has been done to the CC and by whom. That will please ops and security services of traditional companies who are not ready to trust blockchain technologies 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 01:56:58 GMT):<br/>
good suggestion, akm4, would u like to create a jira task on this?
</p>
<p><strong>akm4</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 06:46:02 GMT):<br/>
done
</p>
<p><strong>akm4</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 06:46:25 GMT):<br/>

I noticed on the peer's log that "grpc : time out when dialing". Also, I found this error frequently when I was trying to deploy the fabric on my own. I think it should be a problem with docker dns. What do you think and any solutions? @baohua 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 09:00:47 GMT):<br/>
strange, what cello and docker version are u using?
</p>
<p><strong>YE.Yaocheng</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 09:30:08 GMT):<br/>
docker 17.03.0-ce；docker-compose 1.11.2
</p>
<p><strong>YE.Yaocheng</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 09:33:39 GMT):<br/>
I started fabric with docker-compose, "four-peer-ca.yaml" the file at github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/docker-compose/four-peer-ca.yaml at branch v0.6
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 12:20:10 GMT):<br/>
no, this is the channel for cello project. would suggest u ask this question at fabric or twg-china channels.

yeap, the ip and port is from the worker node you set as the chain host. e.g., for a docker host, just use `ifconfig` to see the ip. and defaultly, set the port to `2375`

fail mean there are some peers that do not see other nodes in the network.

</p>
<p><strong>rohitbordia</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 17:46:57 GMT):<br/>

@baohua : I have also did what you recommended to vishwass ifconfig even that didnt worked
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 01:46:18 GMT):<br/>
that means u cannot access worker_node from the master_node. pls check ur docker daemon setup on worker_node and network connection, e.g., firewall rules to block 2375 port?

</p>
<p><strong>rohitbordia</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 19:37:07 GMT):<br/>
this works correctly : sudo docker -H 0.0.0.0:2375 version
</p>
<p><strong>rohitbordia</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 20:50:41 GMT):<br/>
is it a problem due to my docker version Docker version 17.03.1-ce , I don;t see it comes with docker machine and have only 1 node
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 30 Mar 2017 01:34:16 GMT):<br/>

Hi all,  I was trying to solve CE-5 - updating REST API yaml files - Looks like I have reached a deadend .The restserver_v2.md specifies multiple calls under a single path. But this link https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/854 says that swagger cannot does not allow multiple operation(with different parameters) under a single path. Does anyone have any idea or a work around for this problem.

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sat, 01 Apr 2017 04:38:29 GMT):<br/>
@vishwass i would suggest we doc base on the existing implementation for this version of API (v2), while leading the discussion on the new spec/format of next version (v3). How do u think? personally, i would prefer the openAPI's work around, as sometimes, it's more flexible to support various operations on single resource type.

<p><strong>mikezaccardo</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 07:22:25 GMT):<br/>
@here I'm having trouble invoking that REST API call. Can anyone help?

Attempt 1:
```
curl -X POST -u admin:pass \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "name=docker_host_1" \
  -F "daemon_url=<my-daemon-url-here>:2375" \
  -F "capacity=4" \
  -F "log_type=LOCAL" \
  -F "log_level=DEBUG" \
  -F "autofill=false" \
  -F "schedulable=true" \
  http://<my-master-url-here>:8080/api/host
```

with response:

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>400 Bad Request</title>
<h1>Bad Request</h1>
<p>The browser (or proxy) sent a request that this server could not understand.</p>
```

Attempt 2:
```
tee body.json <<-EOF
{
  "name": "docker_host_1",
  "daemon_url": "<my-daemon-url-here>:2375",
  "capacity": "4",
  "log_type": "LOCAL",
  "log_level": "DEBUG",
  "autofill": "false",
  "schedulable": "true"
}
EOF

curl -u admin:pass -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d @body.json http://<my-master-url-here>:8080/api/host
```

with response:

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>400 Bad Request</title>
<h1>Bad Request</h1>
<p>The browser (or proxy) sent a request that this server could not understand.</p>
```

For reference:

The REST API call definition: https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/resources/host_api.py#L49-L88
The invocation of that call from the GUI: https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/themes/basic/static/js/script.js#L19-L42

once we deploy manually the chaincode on worker nodes

@mikezaccardo I tried to follow https://github.com/cloudsoft/brooklyn-cello (great work really!) and make a cluster on AWS. It creates all the entities in the cloud but then the deployment fails due to ssh issues. "Error in task: ssh: Getting machine details for: SshMachineLocation...". It's funny that the EC2 instances have some kind of "jclouds#brooklyn-ooirql-amp-auto-gnn8-hyperledgercello-n2..." key pairs which is generated by the AMP/Brooklyn framework. Why are they not working?! Any experience?

@SzaboZoltan You are correct in that AMP is generating a key pair that it will use to SSH into the VMs that it creates. I'm not sure why you experienced that error. Can you please send me your location configuration (with identity + credential removed) and any additional output from the app inspector console that relates to the error?

@magg I am not a professional in this theme. I suggest you to have a look at https://github.com/cloudsoft/brooklyn-cello/blob/master/catalog.bom - in this file there is a part below "id: hyperledger-cello-master-node" and another part "id: hyperledger-cello-worker-node". There is an "install.command:" part in both section; it is really useful to follow this. You should do the steps of the *master-node on your swarm master, and the worker(s) the "worker-node".

A question: if I successfully deploy a Cello system via https://github.com/cloudsoft/brooklyn-cello , is there a possibility to log in via ssh into one of the AMP/brooklyn created AWS machines? (Which has automatically generatid public key like "clouds#brooklyn-oom8n2-root-apr18-e2x7-hyperledgercello-ophu#23".)

@SzaboZoltan Great to hear that you got it working! In order to manually SSH into the VMs that are created, you'll need to either configure the location to provide an SSH key from your machine or have an `~/.ssh/_id_rsa` key already there -- see this for more info: https://docs.cloudsoft.io/locations/reference/index.html

For the configuration using a specific key on your machine, the location configuration would need a line like: `loginUser.privateKeyFile: /path/to/your/privatekey`

2 questions: Iis it possible to put into the blueprint, that I would like to have "stopable" VMs? The default possibilities is now are only "reboot, terminate" due to the lack of EBS entity. When I try to change shutdown behavior: >>An error occurred while changing the shutdown behavior of this instance: The instance 'i-04aab97d9f4423c98' does not have an 'ebs' root device type.<<  |  And also I would like to have t2.micro VMs, not the expensive m3.large ones (due to minRam parameter). But if I eliminate minRam, it will be "...medium", not "micro".

1. Do you mean a way to get the VMs to stop and then come back alive at a later time? I don't think that is possible just now. You can of course get the VMs to terminate through AMP by "expunging" the application. See screenshot:

2. I recommend using a specific `imageId` value for a known AWS image with the specs that you want. You would replace `imageNameRegex` with `imageId` in the blueprint before you import it:

hello I made a successful deployment of Cello in Grid5000.fr but I have a question.  Can Cello only deploy a Blockchain in a Swarm worker machine ( 4 or 6 VP nodes)? We require to scatter the VP nodes of one Blockchain across different Swarm worker machine
</p>
<p><strong>magg</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 09:45:36 GMT):<br/>
Can I tell Cello to deploy say 20 VP nodes across 3 Swarm worker machines, for example?

</p>
<p><strong>magg</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 14:13:53 GMT):<br/>
ok yeah i meant to say peers... sorry. So I want to have many peers spread across the swarm... not only one swarm worker

@here -- high level question. Concerto became Fabric Composer, but does not actually manage fabrics, rather concerning itself with participants, data models, transactions (micro chaincode from my perspective) and ledgers. Cello has retained its name and concerns itself with fabrics and chains (channels).

It seems to me that these two should merge. Both are mostly stuck on v0.6 right now, although there are patches for v1 waiting to go into composer as soon as someone can figure out how to do that without killing momentum completely. 

So my question is whether Cello will be merged into composer (as it truly *is* a fabric composer), at least in name and style if not directly into the code base? And the second question is how the v1 port is going, as I find the differences to be rather staggering at the fabric and client levels (not so much at the chaincode level)?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 05:34:42 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the advice.  Because the scopes are quite different (concerto to help design/compose chaincode, cello to help manage/operate chains and do analytics), i do not think it's good idea. However, we can first see how each other can cooperate together in real scenarios.  The v1 support is in implementation. Also, there are on-going work to support more underly infrastructures like k8s.

@MikeMayori It is my understanding that Composer is going to work with all fabric deployments, and the v1 port is ready for merge according to discussion on rocketchat. Regarding Cello, not having the v1 port done yet is not quite the same as "abandoned". Could you specify more clearly why you think both technologies are effectively retired? Because that does not jive at all with my understanding. Thanks.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:16:48 GMT):<br/>
if you mean the hyperledger cello, no, it's ongoing with many new interesting features. you can find the information at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/cello.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:17:41 GMT):<br/>
@baohua I understand that the scopes are quite different, but they overlap considerably. For example, there is a great opportunity to link Participants in the Composer data model to organizations and channels in Cello. At the least, the two should work together seamlessly, and at best they should be one Fabric Composer tool with a complete set of abilities to define and deploy fabrics in various configurations.

Edit: Channels and chaincodes are tightly linked (many to many relationships of course) and that is another opportunity for integration. The composer runtime does implement JavaScript microservice transactions, but they are all linked in the service of one network definition (forgot the name they use). If we leave the concepts too widely separated, then we run the risk of slowing adoption when the two are used together. An **either / or** situation would be damaging I think.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:19:08 GMT):<br/>
thanks kletkeman, it would be interesting to see how to adopt ur mentioned model into Cello. Currently we do not cover much on the chaincode management, although there're some jira issues proposed by some people want to implement. 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:19:48 GMT):<br/>
So as the first step, we still wanna let Cello to handle well at the deployment and operation work over those blockchains like fabric, stl and iroha.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:21:12 GMT):<br/>
@baohua Ok, so the focus is swarms and traditional Go and Java chaincodes, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:22:06 GMT):<br/>
Then we would like to see if it can handle more onto the front end, at that time, it may be  interesting to see if people would like to use Cello to design and write the js transactions. I think I understand the fabric-composer project well as it's still incubated internally, and its target is to help design chaincode with high-level programming language like javascript, by removing the effort to write golang code from the scratch.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:22:47 GMT):<br/>
Similar discussions happen before in the community, actually.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:23:59 GMT):<br/>
The conclusion is that hyperledger is a collaborative projects, that would encourage the collaborations among various projects, and no need to group into unique one. e.g., the fabric, stl, iroha, all are ledger platforms, but we should welcome all existing. How do u think?

<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:24:12 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I am working with composer right now. It works with fabric definitions that enable security for Participants etc. Cello would never be used to design and write Composer chaincode, as that is what Composer does. But the business network definition (perhaps an instance of a system on a larger fabric) would be a good integration point.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:25:32 GMT):<br/>
Maybe, but pls know that we do not wanna limit to fabric itself, hence we need to evaluate whether it will block cello to manage other blockchains like stl and iroha, to import such a fabric business work definition.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:26:04 GMT):<br/>
For example ... define a complete system that uses smart contracts (or the finer grained transactions in composer) and export the BNA file, translating that as input to Cello, which orchestrates the creation of a working network based on parameters defined in Cello.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:26:14 GMT):<br/>
Something like that would be pretty useful.
</p>

BNA file seems like some template?
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:27:23 GMT):<br/>
Ok, if Cello wants to be all singing and all dancing then that could override detailed integrations to specific tooling etc. for some time to come.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:28:03 GMT):<br/>
BNA is a Business Network Archive, defining everything about a Composer based definition. Data model, Participants, Transactions and their implementations.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:28:20 GMT):<br/>
And would BNA support blockchain platform besides fabric? If so, i personally feel interested to see whether we can together design some common/abstract format on general blockchain platform.

</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:30:12 GMT):<br/>
Presumably, someone could support blockchains other than Fabric with BNA. But that requires significant development resources, and getting one to work well should take priority in my opinion. For example, while Fabric and Ethereum state similar goals, Fabric has quite a different view of how to meet those goals. Trying to stay at the 10,000 foot level just means that a tool cannot service either well ...
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:30:38 GMT):<br/>
And it's not about all singing/dancing, as we proposed from the beginning of the project, we wanna provide more opinions for those potential hyperledger users. You can see there're various solutions by using different hyperledger tools. There were some specific "tool-suite" discussions before, too.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:32:57 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I was not around at that time. I'm more focused on getting to the point where a detailed deployment with a complete definition can be performed easily. That requires pushing forward on one set of technologies. I will follow Cello as a non-integrated tool for now. It looks like it could prove very useful even without tight integration to tools like composer. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:32:58 GMT):<br/>
yeap, that's exactly what we are working on now. We noticed that such an abstract might be too difficult to finish everything. So we plan  to start by supporting several. And since there's long roadmap to take, it would be a little too earlier to say which is the "best-practice". Actually, best-practice is coming from practices. Would u agree that?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:35:00 GMT):<br/>
However, i would welcome u help open a jira issue to track the idea of letting cello support your BNA format.  We definitely would like to support/work with more hyperledger projects.  https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/CE/issues. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:35:07 GMT):<br/>
I think we are just now developing an understanding of the value of blockchains in certain scenarios, and we are moving towards the ability to deploy Fabric on multiple topologies using multiple container technologies etc. So best practices will change as the Fabric community gets experience with real deployements over time. 
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:36:19 GMT):<br/>
I'm not in the Composer team, but I will certainly look over them both if I can find the time. I have been hoping to find a tool to ease the pain of deploying complex Fabrics. Docker-compose helps a lot, but I don't think it's the solution ... just one piece.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:36:56 GMT):<br/>
yeap, it will change, we have tried many topologies also, and find the underly technique is important, while there are also many key values from business, management and security conditions. That's really helpful if we can give some guideline/spec. That's also why the TWGC is working on the guideline/spec.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:38:06 GMT):<br/>
I think u're talking about the operation, not only the deployment. the deployment usually happens once, while operations are more persistent and complex.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:38:38 GMT):<br/>
We wanna start from deployment, and then evolve with more operational supports
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:39:17 GMT):<br/>
That's what we talk about the "management of blockchain", open to the smart contracts, too, if we believe it's part of the blockchain. 
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:39:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I see them as the same thing, because deployments evolve over time. Added Participants usually imply added endorsers / orderers / observers ... that kind of thing. The ability to deploy all that automatically after updating a business network definition would be magical.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:39:47 GMT):<br/>
And added participants can join channels, so everything is interconnected.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:40:28 GMT):<br/>
Agree, let's help contribute into those hyperledger projects/tools, and make this real someday soon.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:41:14 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like a good idea ... I'll poke around a bit more. I also have a chaincode platform for IoT contracts that could benefit, and it is traditional Go language.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:41:32 GMT):<br/>
And would like to thanks a lot for proposing so many nice advices~~
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:41:55 GMT):<br/>
You are very welcome. We all have a lot to gain if anything like this can be made to happen.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:42:23 GMT):<br/>
Yeap, and the business value are more likely at the higher layers :)
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:43:16 GMT):<br/>
Even with limitations, orchestration of business networks (as defined by BNA format for example) is a big deal once extended to Fabric topologies.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:44:31 GMT):<br/>
aha, say how much would u like to pay for using the fabric-composer (BNA)?

Feel like I've missed out on a good debate here ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sat, 29 Apr 2017 14:48:43 GMT):<br/>
@MikeMayori where did you get the impression that "Composer will only work in IBM Bluemix Premises"? We work against all Hyperledger Fabric v0.6 and v1.0 instances. We would not have been accepted as a top level project by the Hyperledger TSC if we only worked on IBM Bluemix.
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sat, 29 Apr 2017 14:49:49 GMT):<br/>
And following on from that, Composer today does support Hyperledger Fabric v1.0... the pending work is to update the playground to support connections to real Blockchain platforms (which _should_ go in this week).
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sat, 29 Apr 2017 14:52:20 GMT):<br/>
> For example, there is a great opportunity to link Participants in the Composer data model to organizations and channels in Cello
This is something the Composer team is already discussing - we are talking about a "binding" between the Composer data model and the Fabric topology.
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sat, 29 Apr 2017 14:55:57 GMT):<br/>
> And would BNA support blockchain platform besides fabric?
The Composer code base is 90-95% independent of the Blockchain platform. The remaining Blockchain platform specific code is completely pluggable, so adding support for the Sawtooth, Iroha, Burrow platforms is something that is totally possible. Indeed I had a good discussion in DC last week with the Burrow guys about how we could link up Burrow and Composer.
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sat, 29 Apr 2017 14:56:34 GMT):<br/>
And I agree that Cello should continue to support multiple deployment formats and Blockchain platforms :)
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sat, 29 Apr 2017 14:57:07 GMT):<br/>
I understand people still wanting to write chaincode, but also the possibility of someone building a new higher level framework on top of Composer.
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sat, 29 Apr 2017 14:58:01 GMT):<br/>
But the idea of being able to give a BNA to Cello and have Cello deploy a Fabric instance and the BNA + Composer chaincode to that instance is very interesting...
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sat, 29 Apr 2017 14:59:20 GMT):<br/>
If/when we add the binding between the Composer business network and the Fabric "physical" network then Cello could consume that binding information in order to determine what nodes/channels to lay out
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sat, 29 Apr 2017 14:59:42 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @kletkeman ping for the above ;)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sun, 30 Apr 2017 13:45:13 GMT):<br/>
exactly, one interesting point is to use BNA model as the bridge. I would welcome if anyone wanna create a jira task on this.

<p><strong>duncanjw</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 01:12:36 GMT):<br/>
Most recently we have demonstrated that we can deploy the Hyperledger Fabric to an arbitrary Kubernetes cluster (in this case one created using IBM Bluemix but provided we have the Kube config file this should work with any cluster)

<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Sun, 14 May 2017 17:43:37 GMT):<br/>
as the tutorial says to add the host and port to Docker Service file, instead there is also an alternative without altering any service file
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Sun, 14 May 2017 17:46:12 GMT):<br/>
```
sudo systemctl stop docker.service

dockerd -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --api-cors-header='*' --default-ulimit=nofile=8192:16384 --default-ulimit=nproc=8192:16384 -D &
```
This will run the docker daemon on the specified host in the background, I've tested and working very well. 

Please share you opinion.

@indirajith would u have a look at https://github.com/yeasy/docker-compose-files/tree/master/hyperledger/1.0? I guess the exit is because the running of orderer cmd fails
</p>
<p><strong>bmkor</strong> (Sun, 28 May 2017 13:07:56 GMT):<br/>
I see. Thanks. 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sun, 28 May 2017 13:09:33 GMT):<br/>
are u feel interested with the project? Welcome for any question of fix :)
</p>
<p><strong>bmkor</strong> (Sun, 28 May 2017 13:33:51 GMT):<br/>
Yes. I am particular interested in how data analysis being carried out. 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sun, 28 May 2017 13:35:04 GMT):<br/>
sure, bmkor, currently we collect logs and analyze using ELK. more features are adding, welcome for any idea
</p>
<p><strong>bmkor</strong> (Sun, 28 May 2017 13:56:52 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. Would there be any graph analysis as well? Sorry that I don't familiar with ELK.

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 02:46:41 GMT):<br/>
aha, thanks for the comments, bmkor, i guess there's no limit on what we can do after collecting those data from the network. would u like to help create a cello jira task to see if there's more disucssion on this idea?

<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 05:51:20 GMT):<br/>
for this, I wanna know how swarm supports orchestration here!. anyone help please
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 06:28:13 GMT):<br/>
basically, the swam provided similar restful api with docker. and it also support overlay networking across hosts.
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 06:38:17 GMT):<br/>
@baohua  so we use any script to call those API of DOcker and Swarm ?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 01:36:18 GMT):<br/>
we use compose files to call those APIs to help boot up containers, you can see the code under https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/docker

Hi Hyperledger Cello team. I'm from the White Paper WG and we're looking for someone to write the overview section about Cello as well as perhaps include a highlighted feature for that section. If you're interested, or know someone I should contact, please send me a private message about it. Thank you for your time!

Hi. I have installed Cello using the manual here: https://github.com/yeasy/cello/blob/master/docs/deployment.md. Had some problems with docker daemons seeing each other, so from the file /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf I removed "-H fd:// $DOCKER_OPTS" (this stackoverflow resolution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44411828/cannot-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-port-2375?noredirect=1#44412406), and added '{"hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2375", "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]}' to file /etc/docker/daemon.json. I did everything else exactly per instructions, and the installation seemed go to through fine, without any errors. However, when opening the dashboard (hostname:8080), after entering credentials (admin/pass), I get "404 Not Found". Did I miss something? How can I debug this?
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 11:25:47 GMT):<br/>
have you confirmed that docker is running of port localhost:2375 ?
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 11:26:35 GMT):<br/>
netstat | grep "2375
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 11:26:35 GMT):<br/>
netstat | grep "2375"
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 11:44:10 GMT):<br/>
the netstat command doesn't get me any results
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 11:45:16 GMT):<br/>
however, "docker -H 10.101.35.60:2375 version" does connect successfully
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 11:49:45 GMT):<br/>
so u can access the dashboard at hostname:8080, but after the credential entering, the page show 404?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 11:50:58 GMT):<br/>
can u check if there's any error in the logs?  `docker-compose logs -f`
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 11:52:13 GMT):<br/>
and also `docker ps -a` to show the running containers
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 11:54:30 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that is correct - i can access it (get prompted for username/password), but the get 404

can u confirm ur docker-compose version?  docker-compose>=1.7.0,<=1.9.0
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:28:41 GMT):<br/>
there's known problem with latest docker-compose version, which conflicts with docker-py
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:30:23 GMT):<br/>
by the way, can u follow the steps at https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/install.md for a fresh installation? it's strange to have this problem. we will need to see the cause, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:35:15 GMT):<br/>
docker-compose version 1.13.0
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:35:25 GMT):<br/>
so I need to downgrade docker-compose?
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:35:33 GMT):<br/>
to 1.9?
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:37:37 GMT):<br/>
I followed the steps at that link exactly (I can of course do it again), except for this:
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:37:39 GMT):<br/>
Had some problems with docker daemons seeing each other, so from the file /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf I removed "-H fd:// $DOCKER_OPTS" (this stackoverflow resolution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44411828/cannot-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-port-2375?noredirect=1#44412406), and added '{"hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2375", "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]}' to file /etc/docker/daemon.json.
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:38:30 GMT):<br/>
I don't know much about docker so I don't know whether these changes could be the problem?
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:49:41 GMT):<br/>
@baohua should this be an issue on JIRA ?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:50:25 GMT):<br/>
sure, pls help create a jira issue first, let's explore that more...
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:50:52 GMT):<br/>
@dstarina usually as all codes are running inside container, the version is fixed inside those containers.
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:51:11 GMT):<br/>
I am using docker-compose 1.8  and it worked with the official documentation provided on github @dstarina 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:51:42 GMT):<br/>
can i know the os info on ur running host? @dstarina 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:53:17 GMT):<br/>
yeap, at least 1.7~1.9, we have tested that :)
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:49:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm running Ubuntu 16.04
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:49:48 GMT):<br/>
docker-compose was installed together with docker, what docker version should I install then?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:56:13 GMT):<br/>
aha, i suppose both docker 1.12 and 1.13 should work
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:56:47 GMT):<br/>
and the config u made should have nothing related to the error log, i guess
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:56:47 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:58:14 GMT):<br/>
@dstarina  I am using the exactly same environement
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:01:03 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:02:17 GMT):<br/>
@dstarina can u try `make clean && make restart`?
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:28:23 GMT):<br/>
@baohua just did that (before reinstalling docker). Same problem remains
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:28:59 GMT):<br/>
ok, so u're sure to have run the latest code, right?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:29:22 GMT):<br/>
i will find some fresh machine to test, sorry for the inconvenience.
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:29:40 GMT):<br/>
it was downloading bunch of stuff, so, probably yes
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:30:09 GMT):<br/>
hey, no problem, thanks for your help
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:31:19 GMT):<br/>
does it help you if I send the exact set of commands I used to install this?
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:31:55 GMT):<br/>
together with the docker install, can send you basically the whole set of commands I used to set this up from the fresh install

Wondering if we can connect IoT stuff to the fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 04:07:57 GMT):<br/>
i like IOT, but not sure ur idea, could u help provide more details?
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 06:19:18 GMT):<br/>
IOT in blockchain, I am curious to know how it can be achieved? @bmkor 
</p>
<p><strong>bmkor</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 06:20:50 GMT):<br/>
I am just wondering. Say I got many weather temperature sensors, distributed all over a region. Can each sensor serve as a peer?
</p>
<p><strong>bmkor</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 06:23:24 GMT):<br/>
Precisely, I got those sensors distributed all over the counties (or provinces). Each county would serve like an organisation in fabric and some sensors located in a particular country would be the peers under that organisation. No sure this analogy is appropriate.
</p>
<p><strong>bmkor</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 06:23:55 GMT):<br/>
just a wild thought
</p>
<p><strong>bmkor</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 06:41:19 GMT):<br/>
Any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 07:03:01 GMT):<br/>
That sounds only like peer to peer connectivity, and what about the transactions in Blockchains , whose ledger has to be maintained by Blockchains, what they can be related to ?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 07:09:24 GMT):<br/>
one way may be to serve the IoT device renting transactions atop blockchain... self-auto-renting
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 07:15:37 GMT):<br/>
@baohua  can you explain a bit, new to these words
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 07:40:39 GMT):<br/>
In this compose file, there are few environment variables

how can i get the values of these environement variables

<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 09:18:37 GMT):<br/>
got the query solved
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 14:02:21 GMT):<br/>
@chawlanikhil24 u mean the values of the environment in the docker-compose files? it was set in the environments section, and can read the value of env variables at the host platform.

<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 07:07:17 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @chawlanikhil24 which Ubuntu version, docker engine version and docker-compose version do you use in your environments?
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 07:12:37 GMT):<br/>
because docker engine 1.13 ships together with docker-compose 1.13, so I would love to know what you have installed
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 07:12:48 GMT):<br/>
do you also use an older version of docker engine?
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 12:19:41 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @chawlanikhil24 About the issue we were discussing (https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/CE/issues/CE-54?filter=allopenissues). I have created a new environment from scratch. I have installed docker 1.12 and docker-compose 1.8.1. Even with this, I have exactly the same problem. I am attaching the logs, but I think the problem in the logs is the same as before.

</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:22:20 GMT):<br/>
maybe this is the reason for 404?

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:27:10 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:48:20 GMT):<br/>
@dstarina i just find a clean ubuntu 16.04 os, and run `make setup` and then `make restart`.... seems everything is fine. so strange why your built out container has wrong issues. Can u help clean all the docker images, and run the cmds i posted?
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:04:06 GMT):<br/>
Try docker container prune
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:04:11 GMT):<br/>
docker image prune
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:04:51 GMT):<br/>

Then it seems there is something wrong with my installation process ... Because I made a fresh installation of Ubuntu from the installation CD and then followed the procedure once again ... could someone take a peek at my installation process? It is the exact process that I followed from completely fresh Ubuntu 16.04 installation. It is supposed to be following the procedure exactly, but maybe I misunderstood some step ...

@dstarina i will have a look, beside, can i know what you will use cello for? It would be nice and helpful if we know what adoption scenarios the users are from :)
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 10:44:37 GMT):<br/>
While Fabric on Bluemix is great, there are some companies that, even when considering using the cloud, don't want their data out of the country
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 10:45:06 GMT):<br/>
So we're making a deal with external cloud provider with data centers inside the country
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 10:46:22 GMT):<br/>
And we would like to use Cello so it helps us to quickly create blockchain networks to use blockchain as a service
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 10:47:12 GMT):<br/>
In the future, there will probably be an option to create peers for one network on seperate machines?
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 10:47:25 GMT):<br/>
And to maybe add another peer to an existing network?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 10:55:20 GMT):<br/>
understand, dstarina. would u like to share the adoption info at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/cello#adoptions? It would highly encourage the development team.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 10:55:49 GMT):<br/>
And to ur question, the answer if yes for the fabric 1.0 blockchain type :) we are rushing to finish the support of it currently 
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 10:58:51 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 11:27:56 GMT):<br/>
One question: can I also use the master machine as a worker or is that a bad idea? :)
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 11:37:26 GMT):<br/>
http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/cello and https://github.com/hyperledger/cello - are those two different repositories?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 11:49:14 GMT):<br/>
no they are the same, the github one is a mirror of the gerrit one
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 11:49:46 GMT):<br/>
@dstarina i would suggest use another machine, to keep everything clean. unless u can handle potential issues :wink: 
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 12:07:25 GMT):<br/>
I'm just going to use another machine ;) I have issues with that, too. I get "failed to create host". Could it be a problem that I'm using docker 1.13 on the master machine and docker 1.12 on the worker?
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 12:07:25 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 12:24:41 GMT):<br/>
Can I ask you a more "philosophical" question? Because I know I'm going to get asked this by a customer, and I don't even understand it myself. I understand the reasoning behind blockchain when each network participant (each company) has its own peer running. But on all the tutorial, and now even in Cello, we always install the network with multiple peers on one machine and I started doubting my understanding of this. Is this a viable production scenario, or is the reason behind it just creating a demo environment? Is there a scenario where having multiple peers on a single machine would make sense in production environment?
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 12:25:15 GMT):<br/>
Is my understanding (having one peer per company) correct?
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 12:33:40 GMT):<br/>
I'm asking because I only have an option of choosing either 4 or 6 peers when creating the chain :)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 01:49:24 GMT):<br/>
david, if you let cello run atop a swarm cluster, then it will support multi-hosts, as the native Docker host only support single node :)

Dear all, we plan to make a Cello meetup at the Hackfest in Beijing, pls feel free to join and share your thoughts, experience, and ideas.  Thanks!  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/twgc/hackfest-beijing

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=6J5E6Ti8D7t3MWhox) @baohua you mean, like each worker node in swarm running cello itself ? 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:01:36 GMT):<br/>
Cello treat each worker node as a pool of resource, and will deploy blockchain inside. While for the swarm mode, we treat a swam cluster as a "logic worker node". There cello will leverage swarm's overlay network to deploy among various hosts managed by the swarm. is this clear to u?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:02:47 GMT):<br/>
aha, it's a face-face event for the hackfest. but at the same time, welcome to having thoughts/comments post inside this channel, too.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=mdk9xDyHn75P46rQS) @baohua Yupp absolutely clear, its like, multiple blockchain like, b1,b2,b3....bn are all running on cello and managed by Swarm overlay network ?
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:06:25 GMT):<br/>
In this case, I suppose if there are n blockchains, then n ip addresses too, to manage each worker blockchain cello dashboard ?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:07:13 GMT):<br/>
sorry, not quite get ur question...
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:07:37 GMT):<br/>
in this case, 1 worker node === 1 swarm cluster (multi-hosts)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:08:00 GMT):<br/>
the ip address is managed in the swarm cluster (overlay networking layer)
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:08:17 GMT):<br/>
Guys, what is the reason the only options to choose when deploying a chain are 4 or 6 peers on HL 0.6 and 7 peers on HL 1.0? Is this because Cello is still in development - or am I wrong in assuming that in business network, each participant in a network (for example each company in a business network) should be responsible for one peer? Are peers supposed to be connected with network participants or are they only a way to achieve immutability and not really connected to business networks?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:09:57 GMT):<br/>
david, as it's still under development, we provide some fixed number, to give some quick usage of a blockchain network. the dynamic joining feature will be supported soon.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:10:14 GMT):<br/>
after we got the fabric 1.0 supporting feature done  @chawlanikhil24 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:10:17 GMT):<br/>
@dstarina 
</p>
<p><strong>dstarina</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:10:55 GMT):<br/>
ok, thank you for the answer, glad to hear
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:11:31 GMT):<br/>
cello will deprecate swarm for fabric 1.0 ?
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:11:51 GMT):<br/>
or wll it be a choice for the user to run on swarm or k8s ?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:18:19 GMT):<br/>
both will be available
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:18:47 GMT):<br/>
that'd be better for the users to choice their own underly cluster type :)

<p><strong>lujiang</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 09:05:58 GMT):<br/>
User-dashboard/public/js/lib/CSS3DRenderer.js is from example of Three.js source code , but it does not include the same license header as Three.js
</p>
<p><strong>lujiang</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 09:06:23 GMT):<br/>
Can we directly use it in our code? As it is?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 20:48:56 GMT):<br/>
@lujiang : Without a license, we cannot tell what the author intended the license to be. We either need to get the author to provide the license to determine whether it is compatible with the Apache 2.0 license or whether we will require an exception for inclusion of this file in the Cello source base. If we are unable to determine the license, is there an alternative that can be used?

Hi I just ran cello following docs `Instalation.md` an `tutorial.md` with 1.0-rc1
and I don't get the utility of cello...
there is a bunch of config files **src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0/local/** never used anywhere ?!
It's just an administration panel for deployed blockchains (1 BC on 1 Host) ???
If I'm wrong can you enlighten me ?
thx !

@zhasni if u setup successfully, the dashboard will come out, you can feel free to start chain through the web dashboard. currently the user dashboard is not by default connected. you can use the admin dashboard.

<p><strong>duwenhui</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 10:08:23 GMT):<br/>
@indirajith  it means  hosts data and chains data .

@duwenhui you can run `make restart` or `make redeploy`. just see the Makefile, there's clean command :)

@chawlanikhil24 which version of image are u using? Seems the address port is invalid? listen tcp 10.0.0.98:7052: bind: cannot assign requested address

@baohua  Ubuntu 16.04

Update /lib/systemd/system/docker.service like

[Service]
DOCKER_OPTS="$DOCKER_OPTS -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --api-cors-header='*' --default-ulimit=nofile=8192:16384 --default-ulimit=nproc=8192:16384"
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/docker
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// $DOCKER_OPTS
Regenerate the docker service script and restart the docker engine:

$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl restart docker.service
This operation does not seem to be successful？

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 21 Jul 2017 02:17:54 GMT):<br/>

@baohua I do not know what exact problem @duwenhui met. In my case, the DOCKER_OPTS does not work in ExecStart=/usr/... I have to replace that with the value, i.e. directly writing everything in the same line
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Fri, 21 Jul 2017 04:24:13 GMT):<br/>
@baohua It was unsuccessfull on my ubuntu machine as far as I remember, that's why I added one alternative in a PR

@duwenhui @baohua Yes I remember, I could not make `$ docker -H Worker_Node_IP:2375 info` work with the method provided for Ubuntu 16.04. Then I went with the all other linux distro option twice and it worked for me. 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 24 Jul 2017 02:00:35 GMT):<br/>
in recent ubuntu after 16.04, the os uses systemd to manage the bootup service, which is more complicated than the upstart. Hope we collect more usage cases to find a compatible way to add those docker options.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 11:42:58 GMT):<br/>
strange, why the minimal width is 78 in ur env? i guess 79 should be ok... that should be related to ur flake8 default checking rule. can u verify?

<p><strong>Andy Zhang</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 04:48:00 GMT):<br/>
I think so.  Looks like default max-line-length on Mac for flake8 is 78. Maybe we could configure this value and others in tox.ini file  as said in http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 05:28:15 GMT):<br/>
sure, feel free to help create a jira task and fix. i guess 79 is more common.

@smithbk 
I searched for the previous reply and still couldn't find the answer. I tried the ./fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://admin:adminpw@localhost:7055, which executed successfully. Can you tell a clearer solution?
 smithbk 2017年7月27日晚上8点09分
@duwenhui For some reason, the fabric-ca-server failed to start on port 7055. There must be an earlier error message indicating why.
```
Error: POST failure [Post http://localhost:7055/enroll: dial tcp [::1]:7055: getsockopt: connection refused]; not sending
```
</p>
<p><strong>duwenhui</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:27:45 GMT):<br/>
 In this case ,I think that whenever I start a second CA server with a command and register and enroll i will make this error
</p>
<p><strong>duwenhui</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:39:41 GMT):<br/>
i modefide INTERMEDIATE_CA=false  in  the file fabric-ca-cryptogen.sh

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 06:18:32 GMT):<br/>
@duwenhui wenhui, i guess the port should be 7054.

are u testing on a new chain started by cello?

<p><strong>duwenhui</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 06:23:07 GMT):<br/>
@baohua  Not port, I started multiple CA server one port is 7054, and the other port is 7055.
I haven't tested the new chain yet, and I will test it. I added the solo mode chuain a few days ago, but it was wrong when I deleted it.

@baohua 
I just tested the e Cello Add Chain and found that all the Peer nodes were not started properly because of the certificate problem.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 09:41:13 GMT):<br/>
have u mapped the crypto-config dir at the worker node, as the doc indicated?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 09:51:55 GMT):<br/>
Hello, how could I use docker swarm to setup a cluster ? I can't find any doc
</p>
<p><strong>duwenhui</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 09:52:03 GMT):<br/>
@baohua I can't find the instructions of the document, please help to attach a specific connection.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 12:52:47 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen not sure what your goal is, but if you like, please take a look at this project. https://github.com/litong01/fabric-deploy
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 12:53:07 GMT):<br/>
use that project you can either setup docker swarm like env or k8s.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 12:53:22 GMT):<br/>
the project then will deploy fabric on top of either.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 12:54:26 GMT):<br/>
if you only are interested in how the docker swarm like env setup, you can look at this role. https://github.com/litong01/fabric-deploy/tree/master/roles/deploy_compose
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 12:54:57 GMT):<br/>
it uses docker-compose to deploy fabric onto a docker + overlay network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 12:55:09 GMT):<br/>
which is very similar to docker swarm env.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 12:55:58 GMT):<br/>
but to truly look into how the overlay network gets setup, take a look at this role. https://github.com/litong01/fabric-deploy/tree/master/roles/env_flanneld/networksetup
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 14:00:07 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen are u asking how to setup a swarm cluster of setup a fabric network on top of a docker swarm? For the first question, pls refer to the docker documentation. for the second one, it's quite easy to do that using cello. Just import the swarm cluster as a worker node in cello's dashboard.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 02:57:47 GMT):<br/>
@baohua  Thank you , but could you please tell me more details about swarm cluster ? It's that mean add docker swarm manager node ? 
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 03:01:37 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Thank you for your response, I want to know how to trigger docker swarm mode in cello project.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 03:02:49 GMT):<br/>
yes, to add existing swarm cluster into Cello, just input the manager API like a single Docker Host
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 03:03:03 GMT):<br/>
like x.x.x.x:2376
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 03:03:25 GMT):<br/>
remember to enable the overlay networking mode, hence u can have fabric over multi-hosts
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 03:03:47 GMT):<br/>
@baohua OK thank you very much

Hi, is current cello supports Fabric v1 (previously it mainly supports 0.6) 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 07:24:48 GMT):<br/>
yes, fabric v1 can be run with cello now, with underly infrastructures can be docker or docker swarm cluster.

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:37:46 GMT):<br/>
yes, and i guess u've answered him. Would like to see if he has other comments. Do you mind we collect the advice from him? He has very professional experience in ansible.

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:55:10 GMT):<br/>
haha. cool, cool.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:56:01 GMT):<br/>
Thanks guys. this is to start the project with the battle tested tool for deployment.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:56:17 GMT):<br/>
I am sure people will like to use ansible. we can use cello UI to drive it.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:56:38 GMT):<br/>
Let's keep refining as the review comments, I believe this would be a good beginning!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:56:45 GMT):<br/>
there is an ansible driver in python to integrate ansible with python program.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:57:02 GMT):<br/>
yes, totally.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:57:13 GMT):<br/>
I am sure there are so many places that we can improve it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:57:53 GMT):<br/>
I will be thrilled to see if others starting patches based on this one to make the deployment of fabric like a breeze.

@here, need your advice, exposing peer containers to external endpoints will be a good move ? I guess its not safe from security point of view !
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:45:09 GMT):<br/>
well, peer and orders are eventually need to be accessible from client.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:45:43 GMT):<br/>
in a real world production setup, they should be exposed to outside of your network.
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:46:00 GMT):<br/>
I guess, cli container serves the purpose 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:46:07 GMT):<br/>
otherwise how sdks (which get used by client) will be able to use them?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:46:19 GMT):<br/>
ah?
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:46:30 GMT):<br/>
since, it can be connected to another peers and orderers 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:46:54 GMT):<br/>
cli container is something an admin may use.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:46:59 GMT):<br/>
client can not use that.
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:47:25 GMT):<br/>
cli has an endpoint ! in my case
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:47:46 GMT):<br/>
I make it deliberately external 
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:48:01 GMT):<br/>
so that , there should be only one accessible point to the whole cluster
</p>
<p><strong>chawlanikhil24</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:49:24 GMT):<br/>
cli -> peer
cli -> orderer
cli -> other PODS 

using, ClusterIP
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 25 Aug 2017 06:54:46 GMT):<br/>
no u needn't create manually. Could u help post ur steps and detailed logs with a jira bug under Cello project? jira.hyperledger.org, we will look at it, thanks!

Thank you

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:17:34 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen We have recently added ansible modules to cello which provisions VM against aws, openstack, azuer, VirtualBox.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:17:52 GMT):<br/>
if you like to support vSphere, (VMWare), it is very easy to do that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:18:16 GMT):<br/>
simply add a provision module (few playbooks) for the provisioning.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:19:03 GMT):<br/>
IBM lab uses vSphere (a bit of customized vSphere).
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:19:20 GMT):<br/>
Ansible provides VMWare ansible module.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:20:33 GMT):<br/>
I think you can probably think about that. Once VM(s) are provisioned, then the next step of setting up fabric network will be identical to do the same against other cloud as AWS, OpenStack.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:20:44 GMT):<br/>
let me know if you have more questions.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 16:44:59 GMT):<br/>
Does anybody know what the default login id and password for cello dashboard?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 16:46:43 GMT):<br/>
never mind, admin/pass

@baohua can you tell me how to configuration to cello is done? for example, if something needs to be set to a value, how the default is defined and how to specify a different value?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:47:57 GMT):<br/>
@tongli hi tong, can i know what kind of configuration? for the cello service itself or for the fabric network?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:48:15 GMT):<br/>
@baohua the docker port,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:48:24 GMT):<br/>
it may not always run on 2375.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:49:08 GMT):<br/>
yeap, when u specify a docker host as a "host" in cello?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:49:15 GMT):<br/>
thinking making that configurable, default will be 2375, but people can make changes to the configuration file (if there is one) or env variable, so that the port will be different.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:49:41 GMT):<br/>
I guess I am asking overall how configurable cello is.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:49:54 GMT):<br/>
right.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:50:56 GMT):<br/>
there are several places we using docker. If you mean importing a docker host, then it's simple. On the admin portal, you can specify the API url to whatever you want, e.g., 9.9.9.9:2376 (suppose there's a docker daemon listened)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:53:28 GMT):<br/>
I can verify that. but I think I am asking what is the general mechanism to config cello? for example, what if someone wants the dashboard not being on 8080 but on 9090.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:53:56 GMT):<br/>
is there a configuration file for cello so that once the installation is done, the dashboard goes to 9090 instead of 8080.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:54:10 GMT):<br/>
also say I do not want to use admin:pass, I want to use something else,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:54:19 GMT):<br/>
how is that getting done?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:54:41 GMT):<br/>
I think I am asking for the general configuration mechanism of cello.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:55:15 GMT):<br/>
if there is none, that is fine, we can add.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:57:13 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's another question. and we now have a src/config.py file, which mainly configs web/mongo info. I guess we can feel free to extend from it. thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 14:11:55 GMT):<br/>
cool. as long as there is a general way of configuration anything, that is good.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 14:12:33 GMT):<br/>
the only drawback with python code is that people feel a bit intimidated changing code vs changing a yaml file or flat text file.

<p><strong>waaagh</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 02:26:53 GMT):<br/>
@baohua if no host_type specified at FE, we will try to detect the type via docker api, not the default value
</p>
<p><strong>waaagh</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 02:27:46 GMT):<br/>
there's also a test case cover this case
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 02:28:18 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, i will recheck, and maybe we can add some host_type choice at FE? Then can make sure there's value from it. how do u think? in another pr?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 02:28:53 GMT):<br/>
And could u help add the license header at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/13127/4/test/cases/test_host_create.py
</p>
<p><strong>waaagh</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 02:28:57 GMT):<br/>
Yes, as u mentioned yesterday, a pull-down box is a good idea

@All, I have already set up Kubernets Cluster which is running Fabric 1.0. Now, I want to set up and run Cello on it...from where can I get Cello manifest file for Kubernets? Please help...I searched a lot but could not find it.

Hi everyone, can i use cello with Hyperledger fabric to move from virtual to physical machines ?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 12:22:56 GMT):<br/>
@rubi_1432 you want to do a relocation without losing the chain, I assume , is that right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 12:25:06 GMT):<br/>
In theory , you could add more peers from physical nodes, then run for awhile so that new nodes will establish the chains, once new nodes catch up, you could shutdown the virtual node
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 12:25:33 GMT):<br/>
I do not think you can do a direct copy sort of move.
</p>

@tongli Yes, i want to add peers from physical node. But i can't figure out how to do it. I am starting with connecting physical machines and then creating a channel over it using *Build your first network* tutorial. Is this the right direction ?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 14:14:39 GMT):<br/>
@rubi_1432 I thought you already have a fabric network running, then you want to move to physical servers.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 14:15:18 GMT):<br/>
if this is brand new env, then following the instruction should have worked since cello did not care if your node is virtual or physical
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 14:15:52 GMT):<br/>
or you can utilize what I recently contributed to setup multi-node fabric network by using ansible.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 14:16:01 GMT):<br/>
which is at src/agent/ansible.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 14:16:28 GMT):<br/>
look into a doc at src/agent/ansible/vars/README.md file for dealing with physical servers.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 14:17:17 GMT):<br/>
if you need some help using the ansible script, I can certainly help out.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 14:17:56 GMT):<br/>
at the end, you will be able to layout a fabric network on your physical server very easily.
</p>
<p><strong>rubi_1432</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 14:20:07 GMT):<br/>

yes, there is
</p>

maybe can take as a quick workaround until our user dashboard is done.

<p><strong>erNail</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 09:16:28 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible to run master node and worker node on one machine ?

Hello guys ! 
I was wondering if Cello was able to simply connect to a fabric instance instead of creating it?
we already have fabric deployed and are considering adding cello to it. Is it possible to integrate it or should we start from scratch via Cello?

@yoyokeen there're different, so no such kind of plan.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 10:57:18 GMT):<br/>
@AuHuR can u check the logs of the containers on the master node?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 10:58:11 GMT):<br/>
@sk mostly they are the same, except the docker installation part. after that, it's safe to run `make start`. and remember to create the db dir manually and mount to docker at MacOS.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 10:58:48 GMT):<br/>
@ArvsIndrarys currently cello deploy fabric, instead of connecting to one. you may try the blockchain-explorer project.
</p>
<p><strong>sk</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 10:59:07 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @baohua mainly facing issues to find Docker config file /etc/default/docker on Mac OS
</p>
<p><strong>sk</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 10:59:28 GMT):<br/>
there is no Docker config file /etc/default/docker on Mac OS its only exist on Ubuntu/Linux
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 11:00:38 GMT):<br/>
no worry about it, as at MacOS, things are different. just follow the official steps to setup Docker.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 11:01:07 GMT):<br/>
and remember to create and mount the db path into docker. and change its privilege to ur user role.
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 11:01:10 GMT):<br/>
@baohua thanks ! I'll look into it
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 11:01:34 GMT):<br/>
sure, and welcome to help add some docs to describe the steps on use Cello at MacOS.

maybe the problem is to use kafka, can u try solo?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=KFw2osKgnkt5ZyG3K) @baohua The problem evolves when you use react as the view controller, as soon as I stoped using it, I was able to login
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 23:31:59 GMT):<br/>
@AuHuR thanks. Yes, since react has license problem, we now use the basic theme by default. @hightall could u help confirm?
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 23:36:31 GMT):<br/>
@AuHuR yes，now we stopped dev on react theme，and will rewrite basic theme with vue framework. So will you contribute code for the UI？:grinning:

Okay, really stupid mistake, i didn't realise that i have to execute '$ make setup-worker' after running the docker deamon. It works now, thank you very much for the help :).

Is there any way to manage running chains created via composer ? Or any way to deploy business networks to chains created via cello ?

@baohua, you asked me to provide a bit more details on what I suggested being an interface between UI and backend agent.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 14:17:23 GMT):<br/>
Since I need to give you an example on what I meant, I thought that doing it here is probably a bit easier.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 14:22:15 GMT):<br/>
The UI is a component which allows users to specify how nodes or fabric network should look like, it is a component gathers user request/intention, once the user request is collected, then that request gets sent to backend agent to perform actual work. So if we have a clear spec for user to describe their intention, then the UI can be developed any way a dashboard developer wants, the backend agents (fabric, sawtooth, Iroha, or whatever) can take that request, then perform the actual work accordingly. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 14:22:43 GMT):<br/>
For ansible deployer agent, what I have is this.

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 14:22:50 GMT):<br/>
I believe that I have showed you.

this type of file serves as a spec between UI and backend agent. regardless what backend you may have, a blockchain network can be specified as such. the spec can be quite different for different agents, but it will be a single yaml file.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sat, 16 Sep 2017 02:46:03 GMT):<br/>
@tongli thanks for ur comments. Now i get ur idea. The dashboard discussed is actually for creating a new host. But i guess we can use some config files as u suggest to maintain the clusters we created. Currently we only suppose fixed size of network, this config file can be a good start for supporting use-defined blockchain network. One problem might be is it general enough for all blockchains (for fabric, it should be OK as adopted in those SDK projects already). 
</p>
<p><strong>waaagh</strong> (Sat, 16 Sep 2017 06:25:46 GMT):<br/>
@hightall @baohua plz help review this patch, i add a pull-down box to let user chose the host_type https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/13461/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 02:55:24 GMT):<br/>
@baohua for different type of block chains, that file can be different even in format. As long as the ui knows all it needs to do is to craft necessary field values from a file, the. The back end different agent will understand particular type of config file, then it is ok. For example, the ui for fabric may look quite different from the ui for sawtooth, but that is ok. The architecture is still intact. The server basically take ui fields from the dashboard component and pass to the corespondent agent. That flow won't change at all. With that, we can support any type of agent and ui.

Hi. If I add chain with default certificates it initializes fine, but if I generate new certificates from a given crypto-config.yaml create channel gets unexpected status BAD_REQUEST.

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 19 Sep 2017 01:18:39 GMT):<br/>
@baohua for the performance test, we have been doing it manually. Now with the ansible agent, we can automatically provision vms, built and deploy fabric network with different layout, so that performance test can be done automatically. We are in process to run the entire performance test on ci and collect data for each run and make the result public

I could setup and run Cello (master + worker) successfully and also created host and active chains. (1) How can I deploy chaincode (*.go files) program into active-chain network? (2) how can I access different method of that deployed chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 22 Sep 2017 01:14:50 GMT):<br/>
@sk currently we do not enable the user dashboard for help operate the chaincode. but after the chain bootup, it will expose the access API url, and you can feel free to use the sdk to call those API's.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 22 Sep 2017 06:35:41 GMT):<br/>
yes, then u can use sdk to operate the chaincode using the API.
</p>
<p><strong>sk</strong> (Fri, 22 Sep 2017 06:43:37 GMT):<br/>
Right, I already tried hitting that API with PostMan e.g. https://10.*.*.*:7050/chaincode with required POST body but it does not work
</p>
<p><strong>sk</strong> (Fri, 22 Sep 2017 06:55:14 GMT):<br/>
Also will try with https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/ - (is this SDK are you referring, right?)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 22 Sep 2017 07:18:12 GMT):<br/>
there're several sdks in diff languages, feel free to pick one u prefer, good luck :)

Hi, I'm Miyoung.
I want to login user dashboard page, but it has an error.
When i tried to login or register, "System maintenance, please try again later!" message is printed.
How can i access user dashboard page?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 05:26:21 GMT):<br/>
@miiiiiyoung the user dashboard is not connected yet. you can only use the admin dashboard now. http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
</p>
<p><strong>miiiiiyoung</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 05:34:11 GMT):<br/>
Then, when can i use user dashboard?

@baohua @david_dornseifer I fixed the issue. The build failure in 14177 is real: trailing whitespace
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 06:36:04 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the confirmation @rjones, and i believe this will help use fix it soon @david_dornseifer :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 06:37:01 GMT):<br/>
the issue was the current version of Jenkins doesn't support the older version of Java we have baked in, so I need to build a new image to fix that. I have a workaround in place though :)

Hello @baohua , I was wondering, if its possible to take out docker from cello, and use VMs instead

Hi guys, I'm new to Cello and Fabric, so sorry if my questions are basic
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 08:51:44 GMT):<br/>
I'm installing the cello master node on OSX, on my mac
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 08:51:56 GMT):<br/>
I am able to start the localhost:8080 web interface
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 08:52:13 GMT):<br/>
but the default login is not accepted
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 08:52:34 GMT):<br/>
looking in the logs of the mongodb container
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 08:52:40 GMT):<br/>
i get this message that 
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 09:02:05 GMT):<br/>
"chown: changing ownership of '/data/db': Operation not permitted"
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 09:02:11 GMT):<br/>
any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 09:03:20 GMT):<br/>
I'm running Docker 17.09.0-ce-mac35 (19611) on OSX 10.12.6 (Sierra)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 13:37:17 GMT):<br/>
aha
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 13:37:33 GMT):<br/>
When using Cello on MacOS, the mongodb container may fail to start. This is
because the container will try to mount `/opt/cello/mongo` path. To resolve
the problem, users need to add `/opt/cello` to Docker's sharing path.
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 13:53:27 GMT):<br/>
Hi baohua, I added /opt/cell/mongo to the list of local directories that can be mounted from within Docker
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 13:53:38 GMT):<br/>
the container starts succesfully
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 13:54:42 GMT):<br/>
and then throws a whole lot of "chown: changing ownership of '/data/db': Operation not permitted" in the log
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 13:59:13 GMT):<br/>
what I can see is that the mongo container is trying to use two volumes: /data/configdb and /data/db
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:57:30 GMT):<br/>
I think this line in the /cello/scripts/master_node/setup.sh might be the problem: 
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:57:32 GMT):<br/>
echo_b "Add existing user to docker group"
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER} 
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:57:42 GMT):<br/>
usermod doesn't work on OSX
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:57:55 GMT):<br/>
any idea what I could replace it with?
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 17:02:14 GMT):<br/>
I replaced the above line with this, and it worked
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 17:02:15 GMT):<br/>
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a ${USER} -t user staff
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 17:02:41 GMT):<br/>
Can any of you guys tell me if this wrong or not?
</p>
<p><strong>bogdancioc</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 17:02:53 GMT):<br/>

@bogdancioc we do not have much doc on using cello on mac... would appreciate if you wanna add some. And can u connect to ur worker api from master? `sudo docker -H 192.168.x.xxx:2375 info` return success?
</p>
<p><strong>Yixing</strong> (Sat, 21 Oct 2017 04:00:46 GMT):<br/>
@bogdancioc by default Docker 17.09 will not listen on port 2375, you should specify the port when start docker daemon.

@Abhijeet.K yes, u need to install docker first if you wanna add a docker host as worker node.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 14:36:28 GMT):<br/>
worker nodes can be some virtual server and combine as a single infrastructure pool, as a Host in Cello.

cello support multiple underly infrastructures like swarm, k8s, which will support cross-host networking. on top of that, we can deploy fabric on diff servers.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 17:02:55 GMT):<br/>
@sk cello doesn't provide additional support on chaincode rather than fabric itself, hence just use the network as fabric suggest to.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 17:02:55 GMT):<br/>
@sk Right now, cello doesn't provide additional support on chaincode rather than fabric itself, hence just use the network as fabric suggest to.

Currently Cello support deploy Fabric 0.6 and Fabric 1.0 cluster.

But the image tags used in the docker compose file are missing. 

For example : image: hyperledger/fabric-peer
This will cause our work node can only run one version of facbric, Ideally the work node should be decouple with what is running on it.

Is there any background that we don't specify the image tag in the docker compose file?

I know that the chain-code image always use latest tag, is this the reason ?

<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 06:21:10 GMT):<br/>
The workaround for it is ```I WANT TO CONNECT FROM A CONTAINER TO A SERVICE ON THE HOST

The Mac has a changing IP address (or none if you have no network access). From 17.06 onwards our recommendation is to connect to the special Mac-only DNS name docker.for.mac.localhost which will resolve to the internal IP address used by the host.```

There is one question. Add a worker_node named docker_host in master_node and add a chain to docker_host, then worker_node is created a block-chain network. So, it means i can deploy a business network archive to this network in worker_node? or something else?

Hi @tongli . I would really like to run a Fabric network on multiple hosts. This is how I stumbled across Cello
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:06:43 GMT):<br/>
Will following the process you linked allow me to do this?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:09:13 GMT):<br/>
absolutely. the ansible agent was designed to support that natively. all-in-one is just a slight different configuration to allow people to get things up running very quickly when people do not have multiple nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:09:30 GMT):<br/>
see this doc. https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/vars/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:09:49 GMT):<br/>
and this doc. https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:10:32 GMT):<br/>
this doc explains a bit what all the configuration files mean https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/vars/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:10:49 GMT):<br/>
but you can always ask questions here on the ansible agent, I will be happy to help.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:11:39 GMT):<br/>
So I am currently using Docker, is ansible an alternative?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:12:06 GMT):<br/>
no, ansible is just a tool to get things lay out on multiple machines.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:12:16 GMT):<br/>
you will be still using docker.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:12:46 GMT):<br/>
docker is your container engine. ansible is just a tool to place and configure things at right place. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:13:46 GMT):<br/>
once your fabric network got setup, ansible is out of the way.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:26:45 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I have got up to the stage where I have to create runhosts.tpl
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:26:59 GMT):<br/>
 cloud ansible_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_python_interpreter=python

    $ip

    [builders]
    $ip
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:27:11 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:27:23 GMT):<br/>
run the little script 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:27:45 GMT):<br/>
I think you need to go to directory ~/cello/src/agent/ansible to run the two commands.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:27:57 GMT):<br/>
but do I have to replace all the $ip 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:28:01 GMT):<br/>
the instruction needs to be a little more clear on changing the directory.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:28:05 GMT):<br/>
yes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:28:12 GMT):<br/>
the little script does that for you.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:29:02 GMT):<br/>
create that tpl file and run these two commands in ~/cello/src/agent/ansible directory
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:29:07 GMT):<br/>
```ipaddr=$(ip -4 addr show | awk -F '/' '/inet / {print $1}' | grep -v '127.0.0.1' | awk -F ' ' '{print $2;exit}')
    sed "s/\$ip/$ipaddr/g" run/runhosts.tpl > run/runhosts```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:29:27 GMT):<br/>
that will produce a new file in run directory named runhosts
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:29:58 GMT):<br/>
if you replace the $ip manually, then you do not have to run the commands.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:30:30 GMT):<br/>
also, I think that the instruction missed how to setup ssh key in .ssh/authorized_key
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:30:46 GMT):<br/>
if you do not have that, then you can not use ssh to connect, the process will fail.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:30:57 GMT):<br/>
so you need to do that as well.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:31:04 GMT):<br/>
here is the process.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:31:30 GMT):<br/>
1. in your ~/.ssh directory , create a file named authorized_keys
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:31:47 GMT):<br/>
2. Place the content of ~/.ssh/fd.pub file in that file and save it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:33:28 GMT):<br/>
once you have done that before you start step 4, log out and log back in and make sure that you ssh-agent is running, then you can go on step 4.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:33:42 GMT):<br/>
I will make the steps a bit more clear in next patch set.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:34:38 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @hightall can one of you merge this? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/14999/ thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:35:49 GMT):<br/>
I already have an authorized_keys file. Is it ok to follow your first steps. Will it wipe important data?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:36:02 GMT):<br/>
no.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:36:28 GMT):<br/>
if you already have authorized_keys, then you just need to add the created fd.pub at the end of the file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:36:56 GMT):<br/>
or best yet, skip creating the new ssh key pair in step #1, just go ahead using your existing key.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:37:16 GMT):<br/>
but you will have to change couple files in vars directory as the instruction stated.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:37:47 GMT):<br/>
authorized_keys file simply have bunch of public keys, it is a text file, you can edit it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:38:02 GMT):<br/>
it would not mess up anything.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:38:06 GMT):<br/>
sweet
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:40:21 GMT):<br/>
@hightall thanks for merging the patch set, now we are supporting latest version of ansible and as old as 2.3.0.0
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:46:55 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  is it literally a copy/paste to the end of authorized_keys? or do I remove ssh-rsa before pasting?
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:47:08 GMT):<br/>
sorry for these newb questions!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:48:19 GMT):<br/>
@JoshuaRippon it is literally copy and paste to the end of the file. true statement.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:48:33 GMT):<br/>
should be on its own line.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:48:47 GMT):<br/>
each public key should occupy one line.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:49:05 GMT):<br/>
I suspect that you have quite few keys already there.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:49:16 GMT):<br/>
and I hope this is a ubuntu 16.04 system.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:49:31 GMT):<br/>
if you are using different OS, your miles will be probably very different.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:49:43 GMT):<br/>
may not even work.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:51:02 GMT):<br/>
yes ubuntu 16.04
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:51:38 GMT):<br/>
k. 
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:56:22 GMT):<br/>
when running `-i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=vb" initcluster.yml --skip-tags="resetconn"` I get error `ERROR! Unexpected Exception: 'module' object has no attribute 'SSL_ST_INIT'`

</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:56:42 GMT):<br/>
Is this to do with using a different userID?
</p>
<p><strong>kayadhami</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 15:58:55 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:01:46 GMT):<br/>
hmmm.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:02:04 GMT):<br/>
do you have ssh-agent running? in step #1
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:04:24 GMT):<br/>
I ran `eval $(ssh-agent -s)` and got `Agent pid 94714`
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:04:51 GMT):<br/>
```eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/fd```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:05:06 GMT):<br/>
do not miss the second part.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:05:52 GMT):<br/>
Yes I did that
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:06:00 GMT):<br/>
still same error
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:06:57 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. the full error log?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:07:33 GMT):<br/>
did you change the authorized_keys file?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:07:44 GMT):<br/>
if you did, you will have to log out and log back in.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:08:59 GMT):<br/>
Just logged out and in again
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:09:01 GMT):<br/>
if you did not, and use your own key, then you will need to change vars/vb.yml file.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:09:02 GMT):<br/>
still same error
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:09:27 GMT):<br/>
when you log back in, you need to do this again
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:09:32 GMT):<br/>
```eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/fd```
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:10:41 GMT):<br/>
did that, same error....
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:11:29 GMT):<br/>
ok. what is the full error msg?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:12:25 GMT):<br/>
and , if your userid is not ubuntu, you need to change vars/vb.yml file as well.
</p>

hmm. I wonder if your ansible version is not correct.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:13:55 GMT):<br/>
do this command.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:14:03 GMT):<br/>
```ansible --version```
</p>

hmmm. that looks ok to me.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:15:16 GMT):<br/>
you did this as well I assume ```sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip libssl-dev libffi-dev -y```
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:15:20 GMT):<br/>
my usierid is ubuntu
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:15:53 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:16:56 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. looks like that you pyOpenSSL may be old. I am not sure. let me check few things 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:18:49 GMT):<br/>
do the following
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:19:25 GMT):<br/>
run the following command to check your pyOpenSSL
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:19:28 GMT):<br/>
python
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:19:33 GMT):<br/>
import OpenSSL
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:19:39 GMT):<br/>
OpenSSL.__version__
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:19:45 GMT):<br/>
this should give you a number.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:19:56 GMT):<br/>
mine is 16.0.0 which worked fine.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:22:03 GMT):<br/>
The error is reported here. https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/issues/293
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:22:04 GMT):<br/>
when I do `import OpenSSL` I get `'module' object has no attribute 'SSL_ST_INIT'`

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:22:26 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. you can not even do that in the python prompt?
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:22:33 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:22:58 GMT):<br/>
hmm, your environment is having some issues.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:25:01 GMT):<br/>
maybe try this command 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:25:05 GMT):<br/>
```sudo pip install pyOpenSSL --upgrade```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:25:49 GMT):<br/>
or this
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:25:53 GMT):<br/>
```sudo pip install pyOpenSSL==16.0.0```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:26:05 GMT):<br/>
this should upgrade you to a version which I know works.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:26:19 GMT):<br/>
if you can not even do these things, then I am really running out of ideas.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:26:36 GMT):<br/>
normally, I would recommend using a clean ubuntu 16.04 system.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:27:06 GMT):<br/>
if your system can not do a simple python import, then something is really wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:28:07 GMT):<br/>
it looks like my pip install isn't working properly
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:28:21 GMT):<br/>
any time I try to pip install something I get the same error
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:28:41 GMT):<br/>
should I try to reinstall pip
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:28:44 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:29:22 GMT):<br/>
did you try this?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:29:25 GMT):<br/>
```sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:29:54 GMT):<br/>
after that, do this
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:30:12 GMT):<br/>
``` sudo pip install pip --upgrade```, hope that fixes your issue.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:31:12 GMT):<br/>
didn't work unfortunately
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:34:01 GMT):<br/>
your python env is not doing well.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:34:17 GMT):<br/>
hahaha
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:34:18 GMT):<br/>
probably fix your python issue.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:34:26 GMT):<br/>
first.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:34:54 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest to have a relatively clean system for this.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:49:12 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I removed OpenSSL and reinstalled it
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:49:30 GMT):<br/>
not getting that error any more!
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:08:58 GMT):<br/>
I ran `ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=vb" initcluster.yml --skip-tags="resetconn"` which was fine
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:10:09 GMT):<br/>
However when I run `ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=bc2nd" setupfabric.yml` I get the error ```TASK [Make targets] *************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:30:04 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. @JoshuaRippon seems that you can not run make to build the cryptogen.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:31:02 GMT):<br/>
Hmm why might that be?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:31:35 GMT):<br/>
can your user ubuntu do this?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:31:42 GMT):<br/>
```sudo su```
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:32:06 GMT):<br/>
yup
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:32:08 GMT):<br/>
without promote password, actually, that might not be the problem.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:32:49 GMT):<br/>
you may try to go to fabric directory, and run make configtxgen and see what happens.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:34:24 GMT):<br/>
can you check who owns this directory?
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:34:50 GMT):<br/>
`make: Nothing to be done for 'configtxgen'`
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:34:51 GMT):<br/>
can you check who owns this direct /opt/go/pkg
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:37:06 GMT):<br/>
hmm, you should have a directory like this /opt/gopath/bc2nd/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:37:21 GMT):<br/>
did you see a directory like that on your system?
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:37:41 GMT):<br/>
It is owned by root
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:38:11 GMT):<br/>
then there should be build/bin, in that directory, you should have configtxgen amd cryptogen
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:38:17 GMT):<br/>
which should be just built.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:38:20 GMT):<br/>
yes I have that
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:39:16 GMT):<br/>
even configtxgen?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:39:22 GMT):<br/>
but it said that it failed
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:39:39 GMT):<br/>
it has cryptogen but not configtxgen in it
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:39:56 GMT):<br/>
right.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:40:09 GMT):<br/>
it only has cryptogen, no other files
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:40:36 GMT):<br/>
can you try ```make configtxgen``` in this directory /opt/gopath/bc2nd/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:46:28 GMT):<br/>
you have go installed in different directory, that messed up the go build.

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:50:29 GMT):<br/>
make sure it is really clean.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:50:42 GMT):<br/>
no go installed.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:50:53 GMT):<br/>
you can install docker if you want to.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:51:10 GMT):<br/>
before you do anything on that machine, you can simply do this one thing.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:51:21 GMT):<br/>
```apt update```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:51:30 GMT):<br/>
```apt install docker.io```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:51:36 GMT):<br/>
this will help
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:51:44 GMT):<br/>
So I guess I should find out what the end result will be once I have it up and running. Will I be able to simply edit that runhosts file to add multiple hosts to the network
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:51:44 GMT):<br/>
make sure that go lang is not on it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:52:00 GMT):<br/>
exactly.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:52:34 GMT):<br/>
runhosts is considered as a configuration file.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:53:05 GMT):<br/>
Damn I have Go on this one too haha
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:53:12 GMT):<br/>
you will also need to change couple of other files in vars directory to make it working.

Hi @tongli I read your conversation with @JoshuaRippon 

I too am trying to run nodes on different hosts. But this is only for the Hyperledger Marbles demo.
The idea is to make sure if one host fails,  the blockchain is not affected as there are supporting nodes on n number of hosts.

I have installed Cello on one host(a) and the marbles demo on another host(b).
I am trying to add the marbles host(b) to cello host(a) with docker port 2375
Is this the way to do it?
Could I add more nodes on other hosts(c&d) ?
Thanks

Sorry for these newbee questions.

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:33:03 GMT):<br/>
@ajksharma actually I am not really sure. I think the way you use cello is different from what the ansible agent does.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:33:24 GMT):<br/>
@ajksharma cello ansible agent sets up multiple node fabric network in one go.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:33:36 GMT):<br/>
regardless it is 3 nodes or 300 nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:34:17 GMT):<br/>
currently the agent can not add new nodes after initial fabric network started running. we need to add that function.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:34:59 GMT):<br/>
with multiple nodes in fabric network, multiple peers, orderers, one peer goes down should not affect the availability of your fabric network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:36:31 GMT):<br/>
btw, ansible agent uses kafka for orderers.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:36:45 GMT):<br/>
kafka and zookeeper be exact.
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:39:06 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @tongli . So in one go I can add  n numbers of nodes on n number of hosts?
I have 5 hosts with me. Marbles demo is working fine on one host.
If i can't add more nodes, can I run the ansible script with marbles somehow and create this multi-node setup?
Question is , can the marbles demo be run on multiple nodes on multiple hosts?
Its on github and easy to setup on  one host.

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:40:04 GMT):<br/>
@ajksharma ansible agent can not add nodes to an existing fabric network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:40:25 GMT):<br/>
it stands up multiple node fabric network.
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:40:41 GMT):<br/>
I understand that.
I am ready to run on a clean state
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:41:42 GMT):<br/>
right. in that case, say you have 5 machines, you can use cello to stand up a 5 node fabric network with multiple orgs, multiple peers and orderers in each org.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:42:23 GMT):<br/>
the easiest to do this if you have AWS account, you can use cello against AWS cloud.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:42:55 GMT):<br/>
cello will do provisioning of VMs, establish secuirty rules, and eventually get your 5 node fabric network up running.
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:43:07 GMT):<br/>
yes, I have an aws account and have 5 hosts already made.
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:43:28 GMT):<br/>
So cello would spine "new" VMs?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:43:31 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/src/agent/ansible
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:43:52 GMT):<br/>
yes, Cello will spin up new VMs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:44:41 GMT):<br/>
```1. make changes to vars/aws.yml according to your aws cloud
2. export AWS_SECRET_KEY="your secret key of your aws account"
3. To stand up the fabric network::
    ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml
4. To tear down the fabric network::
    ansible-playbook -e "mode=destroy" aws.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:45:40 GMT):<br/>
if you have a aws account, and allow you to create new VMs, then you can run cello ansible agent from your own laptop.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:46:09 GMT):<br/>
your own laptop will serve as an ansible controller.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:47:40 GMT):<br/>
@ajksharma please also look at this doc which deals with aws cloud. https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/src/agent/ansible/roles/cloud_aws
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:48:26 GMT):<br/>
ansible aws cloud module requires boto and boto3, please install using this command before you run 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:48:38 GMT):<br/>
```sudo pip install boto boto3```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:48:50 GMT):<br/>
that is only required on your ansible controller.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:49:26 GMT):<br/>
where you actually run the ansible command, it is not needed on actual AWS VMs
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:49:52 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:50:12 GMT):<br/>
ansible agent does not setup any apps.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:50:39 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest that you pick one of your AWS VMs and get your actual app up running.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:51:39 GMT):<br/>
I will be really happy to see a patch to cello ansible agent for deploying marble app on top of the fabric network which cello ansible agent sets up.
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:52:16 GMT):<br/>
yep, I would select one VM and install marbles.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:52:42 GMT):<br/>
right. these VMs will have a local DNS services setup.
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:52:53 GMT):<br/>
but then do I have to install marbles on all VMs?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:52:56 GMT):<br/>
you will be able to refer their dns name for access.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:53:23 GMT):<br/>
that I do not know. I would assume no. your app just need to access  a fabric network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:54:07 GMT):<br/>
should not matter how big the fabric network is or if runs cross multiple nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:54:10 GMT):<br/>
yes, If I could n number of nodes working for the marbles demo, that is teh goal.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:54:52 GMT):<br/>
I would think it depends how marbles demo were setup. can marbles demo app be spread out to multiple nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:55:20 GMT):<br/>
it should not have anything to do with how fabric network gets setup or how many nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:56:09 GMT):<br/>
I don't know. But I hope it doesn't matter.
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:56:31 GMT):<br/>
The chain-code would be one one VM.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:57:03 GMT):<br/>
chaincode can be installed on many peers.
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:57:53 GMT):<br/>
if chaincode is absent on other hosts, the blockchain wouldn't run? right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:58:59 GMT):<br/>
I think it is per peer, not host
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:59:10 GMT):<br/>
one host can run multiple peers.
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 19:00:49 GMT):<br/>
yep, so maybe install the chaincode on all peers.
I read on my post that docker swarm works.
Though I am not sure how to add more nodes to the fabric network

@tongli though I know golang and was thinking that by now (3 weeks) I would be able to design and code hyperledger networks, I am still stuck in configuration issues.

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 19:24:17 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 19:25:24 GMT):<br/>

It may be due to low memory. While configuring ansible on aws file I decided to give `t2.micro` instead of `t2.medium` beacuse of free tier I am using. On kafka logs I got an error `OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: INFO: os::commit_memory(0x00000000c0000000, 1073741824, 0) failed; error='Cannot allocate memory' (errno=12)`

Hi, i am having problems. I have setup ssh and added key to authorizedd_keys on other machines and i am still getting errors below ```fabricnodem1@fabric001:~/cello/src/agent/ansible$ ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=os" initcluster.yml --skip-tags="resetconn"

@OlliKasari here are tutorial to start cello: http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/. for using fabric, pls see fabric documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:08:01 GMT):<br/>
@rubi_1432 how did you set up these 3 machines? they need to have the ssh public key on each machine in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:08:15 GMT):<br/>
without the file, you can not access them.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:08:35 GMT):<br/>
I mean that ansible can not access them using key paires
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:23:37 GMT):<br/>
@tongli without kafka channels and chaincode wont be initialized properly . Am I right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:24:55 GMT):<br/>
kafka(solo) is to allow orderers to work correctly, without either, orderers can not work and channels can not be created. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:25:07 GMT):<br/>
I mean kafka or solo.

<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:36:00 GMT):<br/>
Alright. what is the purpose of last two containers?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:41:33 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid the last two containers actually are what magic happens.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:41:50 GMT):<br/>
for containers to communicate with each other using names, we need registrators and dns services.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:43:02 GMT):<br/>
each node will have a registrator container and entire fabric network will have one dns services.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:43:10 GMT):<br/>
dns service container.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:44:08 GMT):<br/>
this way, all containers will be able to simply use their names to address each other, other than IP addresses , in many cases IP addresses are unknown before fabric network is up running. but names are known. 
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 17:59:07 GMT):<br/>
and fabric001 will be consider as dns service container as mentioned in aws.yml file `builders: ["fabric001"]` right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 18:01:24 GMT):<br/>
skydns.fabric001 is the dns container
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 18:01:32 GMT):<br/>
it runs on fabric001 node.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 18:01:47 GMT):<br/>
this should be the only container for dns service for your entire fabric network.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 18:05:53 GMT):<br/>
Alright . Thanks for detailed info :)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 18:25:33 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid from your image posted above, it does not look like your network is running, the kafka container is not doing well.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 09:36:49 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Yeah you are right. Basically in my aws.yml file I change  this `flavor_name: "t2.medium"` to `flavor_name: "t2.micro"` which causes kafka container to break because kafka required 1 GB RAM and t2.micro dosent provide enough to run kafka properly

@tongli I have three physical machines. With hostname fabirc001, fabric002 and fabirc003. I installed openssh-server on fabric002 and fabric003. Then i used made sure that every user was able to use *sudo su* without password. Then on fabric001 i executed these commands *mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen -t rsa -f fd -P ""
    eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/fd*     After thiso made sure that they are able to ping eachother and then i executed following command from fabric001 *cat ~/.ssh/fd.pub | ssh fabric002 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"*    *cat ~/.ssh/fd.pub | ssh fabric003 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"*

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:34:43 GMT):<br/>
@rubi_1432 it seems to me that you are using fabric001 also as your ansible controller, is that right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:35:20 GMT):<br/>
the step you referenced above only is needed where you run the ansible project.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:36:14 GMT):<br/>
the fd.pub file will need to be on all the servers .ssh directory in file authorized_keys file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:37:01 GMT):<br/>
the private key only needs to be on the ansible controller (in your case, fabric001).
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:38:06 GMT):<br/>
looks like that your command above did that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:38:46 GMT):<br/>
if all the steps are correct, after you did this ``eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/fd```     
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:39:15 GMT):<br/>
you should be able to simply do the following to hit fabric002 and fabric003.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:39:35 GMT):<br/>
```ssh fabric002_ip``` from fabric001 machine.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:39:48 GMT):<br/>
if you can not do that, then your setup has not been correct.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:40:27 GMT):<br/>
good news is that if you are using cello ansible agent against a cloud like what @MohammadObaid has done, all these things will be done for you by the project.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:40:42 GMT):<br/>
a cloud like AWS or OpenStack cloud
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:41:53 GMT):<br/>
all you have to do will be just change few things in vars/aws.yml file, and run one command to get things going. see things at this link. https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/src/agent/ansible#on-aws-cloud
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:42:49 GMT):<br/>
when you have physical servers or Virtual Machines, it will be a bit tedious because ansible agent has to know where your servers are and how to access them.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:43:54 GMT):<br/>
what you are trying to do in these manual steps are basically setting up ssh access so that your ssh client (which ansible depends on) can work with these machines.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:44:32 GMT):<br/>
the reason that ansible was chosen is because when you have very large numbers of servers, ansible will still be able to handle them regardless you have one or 100.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 14:44:47 GMT):<br/>
and the way to handle one or 100 is absolutely identical.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:02:58 GMT):<br/>
Hi @tongli I am going to try your method again with a fresh ubuntu server!!
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:04:21 GMT):<br/>
I am confused at the point of the key pair. I think this time I should just keep the key pair that I already have and include it in the vars/vb.yml and vars/bc2nd.yml files
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:04:25 GMT):<br/>
@JoshuaRippon sure, sure, if I remember you are using one node , right?
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:04:30 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:04:53 GMT):<br/>
if you like, I was trying to get the all-in-one doc improved so that it will be easier to follow.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:05:07 GMT):<br/>
unfortnately it has not been merged but you can still follow it if you like.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:05:10 GMT):<br/>
here it is https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15133/3/src/agent/ansible/vars/All-in-one.md,unified
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:06:01 GMT):<br/>
crap, that link has older and newer version all merged together. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:06:04 GMT):<br/>
not good.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:06:18 GMT):<br/>
hold on, let me see if there is a way just to see the latest version.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:06:21 GMT):<br/>
haha
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:07:38 GMT):<br/>
I think that link let you see the only the new version.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:08:00 GMT):<br/>
you can follow that. please make sure that your ubuntu system is clean.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:08:32 GMT):<br/>
if it is polluted, you will have some strange issues which will be hard to figure out.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:08:47 GMT):<br/>
yes its completely clean
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:08:59 GMT):<br/>
I strongly suggest that you install VirtualBox on your laptop or desktop, then using it for the work.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:09:14 GMT):<br/>
VirtualBox is free and will save you a lot of headaches down the road.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:10:06 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:10:56 GMT):<br/>
so this bit i am still really confused about. The key pair part. I already have a key pair. If I want to use that one instead, how do I include it in vars/vb.yml and vars/bc2nd.yml files
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:10:59 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 15:12:35 GMT):<br/>
Where abouts do I put the key pair in here? ```---

@JoshuaRippon you include the key pair in vars/vb.yml file.

<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:13:53 GMT):<br/>
what do I change here?

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:16:45 GMT):<br/>
you see the public key and private key?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:17:09 GMT):<br/>
public_key_file, private_key_file,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:17:28 GMT):<br/>
you change the value of these two things.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:17:55 GMT):<br/>
but the important thing is that you have to put the public key in .ssh/authorized_keys file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:18:13 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, you can not ssh to this machine.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:19:52 GMT):<br/>
ok cool so can I just leave that file and just create fd.pub and fd with my keys?

Will I run into problems as `sudo apt-get install docker.io` gives me `Docker version 1.12.6, build 78d1802`
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:37:20 GMT):<br/>
@JoshuaRippon I am not following, you can either use your own key pair or create brand new key pair.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:37:33 GMT):<br/>
I do not know what you mean by create fd.pub and fd with my keys.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:38:51 GMT):<br/>
when i run ```mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen -t rsa -f fd -P ""
    eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/fd``` aren't I just creatin new keys 
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:39:22 GMT):<br/>
with public key in fd.pub and priv key in fd?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:40:41 GMT):<br/>
right. that creates new key named fd.pub and fd
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:40:49 GMT):<br/>
one is private key and one is public key.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:41:20 GMT):<br/>
to be able to allow ssh to a machine, you have to add the fd.pub content into this file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:41:44 GMT):<br/>
it has nothing to do with whatever keys that you might already have.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:42:03 GMT):<br/>
if your system is new, then you should not have any keys I would assume.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:43:12 GMT):<br/>
yes I have keys already set up
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:43:21 GMT):<br/>
k.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:43:35 GMT):<br/>
before you do anything, you can verify if you can actually ssh to this server.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:43:49 GMT):<br/>
simply do ssh ubuntu@theIPaddress.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:43:59 GMT):<br/>
or the userid that you have.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:44:10 GMT):<br/>
I use ubuntu as an example.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:44:31 GMT):<br/>
notice that vars/vb.yml file also has ssh_user, make sure that is also changed,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:44:38 GMT):<br/>
to match whtever you have.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:44:51 GMT):<br/>
without changing that to what you have, ssh will also fail.
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:45:50 GMT):<br/>
Haha you know what I'll leave it till tomorrow when my colleague is in. He sets up all the servers so will know about this stuff way more than me! My background is physics! lol
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:47:46 GMT):<br/>
@JoshuaRippon good try though. 
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:48:01 GMT):<br/>
cheers!
</p>
<p><strong>JoshuaRippon</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:50:04 GMT):<br/>
Just quickly though, will I run into problems connecting to Fabric as fabric requires Docker version 17.03.0-ce or greater?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:51:18 GMT):<br/>
the process will install the right version of golang and docker on this clean system.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 16:51:25 GMT):<br/>
it will be all taken care of for you.

This one is to add supported ansible version .https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15435/ this 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 17:24:33 GMT):<br/>
this one is to add a playbook to allow automation to display current fabric network status.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 17:24:52 GMT):<br/>
this is the second one. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15437/

Hi. We are experimenting with Cello for the first time, and wonder about some features:
- add more peers to a chain, but on a different physical host
- add more organizations to an existing chain.
- add a couchdb backend for the peers
- deploy chaincodes to peers with Cello
Are these on the roadmap? Or, they should be handled by another process?
Thanks.

@tongli When ansible create hyperledger network on aws , a chaincode container  `dev-peer1st-orga-firstchaincode-1.0` runs on two host `fabric001` and `fabric002` but not on third host `fabric003` ALthough there is no problem in invoking transaction or doing other stuffs but is there any specific reason that chaincode container would only run in two host?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:41:02 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid the example chain ode was installed on all peers and there should be one Chaincode container for every peer of each peer was accessed either by a query or a transaction 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:41:27 GMT):<br/>
Of=if
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:43:54 GMT):<br/>
Yeah. I understand but one thing strange for me is that no chaincode container runs on my fabric003 instance but still I was able to invoke transactions and run queries.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:11:30 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid if you should have containers on fabric003 depends on how you layout your fabric network. I can take a look at your configuration file.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:14:45 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  which configuration file ? bc1.yaml file in `ansible/vars` directory or `aws.yml` filr in vars directory?

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:45:24 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid that file basically says you wanted to build a 5 nodes cluster and it looks fine to me.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:45:49 GMT):<br/>
then there should also be the vars/bc1st.yml file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:45:54 GMT):<br/>
did you change that file?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:46:33 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid if you did not change that file, then fabric004 and fabric005 should be empty and you should have few containers on fabric003.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:47:22 GMT):<br/>
by default, you are using this file to layout your fabric network.https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/vars/bc1st.yml
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:47:48 GMT):<br/>
if you did not change anything in that file, you should have two peer containers
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:47:59 GMT):<br/>
one rom orga and one from orgb.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:48:33 GMT):<br/>
when you query or do a transaction against these two peers, each of them should spawn another container.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:48:38 GMT):<br/>
chaincode container.
</p>

Could someone explain to me the usage of CA (certificate authority) in hyperledger fabric? Do I need one for each organisation or can I use a centralized CA? How (and why so) would you set up the CA servers?
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 09:16:23 GMT):<br/>
@tongli thanks . I changed my bc1.yml file also may be that's the reason. Here is the gist which contain two files one is bc1s.yml and other network-config.json which is needed for node sdk . 
</p>
<p><strong>ajksharma</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 11:22:37 GMT):<br/>
Hi @MohammadObaid  did you use the aws.yml file from the cello git repo?  as it looks different. Could you post a link for the source?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 11:32:35 GMT):<br/>
@ajksharma @MohammadObaid bc1st.yml file controls how the fabric network layout look like. your fabric003 will have 2 containers from orga and orgb.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 11:34:37 GMT):<br/>
@ajksharma @MohammadObaid general rule of thumb for both zookeeper and kafka is that you should have odd number of nodes for them, normally 3 for each will be good enough, 5 is a overkill.  
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 11:50:32 GMT):<br/>
@hightall can you please review these two patch sets? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15435/, https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15437/

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:27:15 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid the fabric network layout looks fine to me.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:27:34 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid do not know what the network-config file is for.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:28:24 GMT):<br/>
network-config file is for node sdk . Basically I need to tell node sdk about my fabric network so thet node api's can communicate with my network
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:39:00 GMT):<br/>
k. @MohammadObaid any more issue in terms of fabric network standing up?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:39:24 GMT):<br/>
config file looks fine to me.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:39:39 GMT):<br/>
Nope. I tried transactions , retreive results. Everything works fine for me uptill now
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:39:43 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. wait.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:40:02 GMT):<br/>
actually you have two ca1st.orgd container
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:40:30 GMT):<br/>
one on fabric004 and fabric005
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:40:58 GMT):<br/>
I think that you @MohammadObaid should remove one ca container.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:41:20 GMT):<br/>
two containers using exact same name will get dns confused.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:42:01 GMT):<br/>
you also have ca1st.orgd on fabric003, cat1st.orgd on fabric004.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:42:21 GMT):<br/>
hmm. One thing I am confused in it some server have one ca containers , some use multple ca's . What logic behind constructing such file?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:42:24 GMT):<br/>
yeah, you have total of 3 cas for orgd, all named same ca1st
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:43:00 GMT):<br/>
cas on each node (fabric001, fabric002...) indicate what ca do you like to create.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:43:20 GMT):<br/>
in your config file, you have the following
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:43:41 GMT):<br/>
```fabric003: {
      cas: ["ca1st.orgc", "ca1st.orgd"],
      peers: ["worker@peer3rd.orga", "worker@peer3rd.orgb"],
      orderers: [],
      zookeepers: ["zookeeper3rd"],
      kafkas: ["kafka3rd"]
},```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:43:51 GMT):<br/>
this configuration means the following
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:44:19 GMT):<br/>
1. you like to have two ca containers on this node, one ca is named ca1st.orgc, one ca is named ca1st.orgd
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:44:52 GMT):<br/>
2. you want to have two peer containers, one is named geer3rd in orga, one is named peer3rd in orgb
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:45:00 GMT):<br/>
3. no orderers for this node
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:45:16 GMT):<br/>
4. one zookeeper node named zookeerper3rd
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:45:26 GMT):<br/>
5. one kafka node named kafka3rd.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:46:06 GMT):<br/>
looking at all the node combined, you have 3 ca containers spread out to these 5 nodes, they are all named ca1st.orgd which will cause dns issues.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:46:27 GMT):<br/>
SO basically this network is running between 4 organizations and we have constructed different peers related to these organizations in random order right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:46:28 GMT):<br/>
ultimately inconsistence when you use that ca to register new users.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:46:41 GMT):<br/>
Alright
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:46:45 GMT):<br/>
right, you will have orga, orgb, orgc and orgd.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:47:47 GMT):<br/>
you should just have 1 ca per org, if you want to have multiple ca per org, then you have to figure out how two cas communicate with each other, which is not the concern for cello.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:49:01 GMT):<br/>
to fix the issue , you simply need to remove ca1st.orgd from fabric003 ca array, and fabric005 ca array.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:49:27 GMT):<br/>
just leave one ca for orgd on fabric004 maybe or on fabric005 depends on where you want it to be.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:50:37 GMT):<br/>
also I wrote earlier, having 5 containers for both kafka and zookeeper is an over kill, it will work fine, but you do not really have to do that. anyways.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:51:07 GMT):<br/>
Yeah got it. 
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:51:13 GMT):<br/>
orgc and orgd is used as ordering service while orga and orgb is used as two organziation for transfer asset right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:51:28 GMT):<br/>
correct.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:53:00 GMT):<br/>
you can actually specify an org for orderers. so it is like a third party (company) is responsible for orderers, kakfa and zookeepers, other orgs are just participating in the network for transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:53:37 GMT):<br/>
but it is really your call. multiple orgs for orderers are fine. but zookeepers and kafka are not really having anything to do with an org.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:53:40 GMT):<br/>
Alright. Thanks for helping me out :) Initially I modify that file considering fabric001 ,fabric002 as organizations .That's why I got everything wrong
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:53:53 GMT):<br/>
haha.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:54:13 GMT):<br/>
fabric001, fabric002,etc are physical or virtual machines
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:54:48 GMT):<br/>
Yeah. Now I understand . 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:56:01 GMT):<br/>
great. let me know if you need any more help.

Hey @tongli till yesterday everything works fine for me but today when I relaunch fabric network I am seeing my kafka containers not properly running and seems to be `restarting again and again` Initially I thought that it may be due to changes I done in ansible files however after fresh download of cello and ansible and using default configuration files I am still facing the same issue. Seems like root issue is kafka is unable to communicate with zookeeper as you can see in kafka logs below

<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 12:31:50 GMT):<br/>
May be I need to increase timeout period of zookeeper but I am unsure how to do it or any alternative solution to solve this?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:23:21 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid mostly the network issues. nodes can not communicate with each other.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:23:42 GMT):<br/>
Means an aws issue right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:24:09 GMT):<br/>
the best way to confirm that is to start a busybox container and ping other containers by ip and name
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:24:17 GMT):<br/>
not necessarily aws network issue.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:25:02 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid cello sets up an overlay network (using flanneld), which allows us sets up a small network on top of aws network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:25:19 GMT):<br/>
this way your network is not accessible from outside of your network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:25:39 GMT):<br/>
and you do not have problems with conflicting ports since each container gets their own private ip.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:25:48 GMT):<br/>
in 172.16.x.x segement.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:25:50 GMT):<br/>
Ideally from one server I should be able to ping every other container beacuse three server are connected to each other
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:26:01 GMT):<br/>
also we set up dns services.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:26:19 GMT):<br/>
that is why peer1st.orga can see peer2nd.orgb container.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:26:22 GMT):<br/>
by using names.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:26:38 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid that is exactly right.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:27:03 GMT):<br/>
using IP addresses in 172.16.x.x segement which is part of the cello ansible agent configuration file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:27:17 GMT):<br/>
not the IP address that AWS signed to your VMs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:27:35 GMT):<br/>
if you log in to one of your machines, you should see your VM ip address.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:28:01 GMT):<br/>
I will try to ping every other conatainer . Yeah ip address under docker0 tag in ifconfig section right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:28:10 GMT):<br/>
if you docker inspect fabric containers, you will see them having IP address like 172.16.x.x
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:28:38 GMT):<br/>
ifconfig to see your VM ip. or ip addr
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:29:18 GMT):<br/>
to see container IPs, you will need to run ``` docker inspect xxx```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:29:26 GMT):<br/>
that way you will see the ip address.

<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:29:30 GMT):<br/>
Hi All! Someone can help me in configuring the worker host in order to use it with MacOs
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:29:38 GMT):<br/>
I followed the guide 
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:29:44 GMT):<br/>
using the command 
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:30:05 GMT):<br/>
`$ docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 127.0.0.1:2375:2375 bobrik/socat TCP-LISTEN:2375,fork UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/docker.sock
``
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:30:05 GMT):<br/>
`$ docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 127.0.0.1:2375:2375 bobrik/socat TCP-LISTEN:2375,fork UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/docker.sock``

</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:30:39 GMT):<br/>
but I can't connect to the worker from the host
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:31:56 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid I would suggest to run the busybox container which gives you commands like nslookup and ping, so that you can test both dns services and container.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:32:10 GMT):<br/>
you can also do these things to do a bit more tests.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:32:32 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:33:03 GMT):<br/>
the little procedure can help you to test if a port is open or not.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:33:30 GMT):<br/>
even if it is a secure port like 7050 when tls is on.
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:40:08 GMT):<br/>
@tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:40:38 GMT):<br/>
@grapebaba hi, much better here for cello related discussions.
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:40:51 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:41:47 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15495/ that patch just got merged.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:42:14 GMT):<br/>
now you can use k8s versions starting 1.7.0 all the way to 1.8.3 (which is the latest)
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:42:47 GMT):<br/>
OK 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:42:49 GMT):<br/>
if you have an AWS account, to provision, setup k8s and fabric, you only need to do the following
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:43:33 GMT):<br/>
```1. make changes to vars/aws.yml according to your aws cloud
2. export AWS_SECRET_KEY="your secret key of your aws account"
3. To stand up the fabric network::
    ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" awsk8s.yml
4. To tear down the fabric network::
    ansible-playbook -e "mode=destroy" awsk8s.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:44:03 GMT):<br/>
notice the yml file to be awsk8s.yml
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:44:21 GMT):<br/>
that means you want to setup fabric network using k8s.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:45:24 GMT):<br/>
if you want to setup fabric network using docker swarm like network, simply replace awsk8s.yml with aws.yml, exactly same commands.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:45:32 GMT):<br/>
like the main agent doc says.
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:47:40 GMT):<br/>
Sorry but I didn't understand a simple thing! Where can I configure the topology (peers, orderer etc) of my fabric blockchain by cello?
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:47:53 GMT):<br/>
I have to modify some files
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:47:55 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:48:27 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox not sure how you stand up your fabric network. cello provides few different agent to create fabric network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:49:21 GMT):<br/>
the agent I have been talking about is the ansible agent. which can be found here. I am in the process of moving the doc to the doc directory. before that is done, you can find it here.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:49:40 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/src/agent/ansible
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:50:12 GMT):<br/>
if you really just have one server, you can also follow this article. https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/vars/All-in-one.md
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:50:43 GMT):<br/>
the all-in-one is a great procedure get you started if you do not have a lot of resources.
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:51:42 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for the guide 
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:51:56 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I will try those methods
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:52:01 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox seems to me that you are using mac os, to have multiple servers in a fabric network, you can also look at this doc https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:53:21 GMT):<br/>
like install virtualbox on your mac, and download this ubuntu image. https://ibm.box.com/s/xpvhmbozwjzn61vctyxp1eosku3bxx59
 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:53:29 GMT):<br/>
then you can have a VM running in few minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:54:07 GMT):<br/>
look for virtualbox section to stand up 2 VM fabric network either using docker swarm like netwokr or k8s.
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:54:22 GMT):<br/>
thanks a lot!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:55:03 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox yeah, not a problem. let me know if you run into any problems. I would strongly recommend using virtual machines for your daily work.
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:25:21 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=uZR58awsbSAxzP9JF) @tongli Where can i find the password to access to the VM?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:27:30 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox you downloaded my virtualbox image?
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:27:35 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:27:41 GMT):<br/>
the username and password is ubuntu and ps
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:27:45 GMT):<br/>
very easy.
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:27:45 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:28:53 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox  can you access this link? https://github.ibm.com/IBMCode/howtos/pull/78
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:29:33 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox probably not.
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:29:34 GMT):<br/>
No I don't have IBM credentials
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:29:42 GMT):<br/>
it is an ibm internal site. sigh!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:30:24 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox follow the all in one should be ok. if you have issues, let me know. I will help.
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:30:39 GMT):<br/>
Thank you very much!!!
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:05:02 GMT):<br/>
@tongli From busybox you mean creating busybox container then from that container bash , ping other docker conatiners like zookeeper etc right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:05:27 GMT):<br/>
yes. using nslookup and ping to test.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:05:58 GMT):<br/>
that way, you can see if your overlay network is working and dns services is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:15:49 GMT):<br/>
with busybox conatiner I am only able to ping localhost containers. Cannot ping those container which is running on other ubuntu  server 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:23:42 GMT):<br/>
you can do this.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:23:56 GMT):<br/>
```nslookup peer1st-orga```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:25:32 GMT):<br/>
and see if you can get the ip address for the peer. or any other peer, or orderer
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:25:59 GMT):<br/>
also after you find the ip address by using docker inspect, you can ping the container using ip
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:26:20 GMT):<br/>
if you can not do either of these things, that means that the overlay network is probably gone down.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:26:30 GMT):<br/>
when I did nslookup zookeeper2nd from fabric001 I get result `Address 1: 172.16.76.4 ip-172-16-76-4.ec2.internal`
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:26:41 GMT):<br/>
yeah.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:27:15 GMT):<br/>
172.16.74.4 is the zookeeper2nd address, right?
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:27:19 GMT):<br/>
but I didnt see any reply when I ping to that ip
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:27:21 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:27:21 GMT):<br/>
you can confirm that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:28:23 GMT):<br/>
right, if you can not ping by using IP address, that means that the flanneld overlay network has gone down for some reason.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:28:34 GMT):<br/>
you can try to run commands like this to see the service
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:28:45 GMT):<br/>
```systemctl status flanneld```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:29:03 GMT):<br/>
be able to do nslookup, means that your dns is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:29:17 GMT):<br/>
but it will be good to check that services as well.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:29:33 GMT):<br/>
```systemctl status etcd```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:29:42 GMT):<br/>
and also check dns container logs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:30:04 GMT):<br/>
worst case, do a destroy and apply again.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:30:26 GMT):<br/>
and keep close eye on the network and see what made the overlay network going down.
</p>

@tongli  I guess fabric require docker version 17 or above but network constructed by ansible installs docker 1.13.1 on ubuntu servers. Isnt this cause any problems?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 14:50:15 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid no. version 17 I believe is docker ce.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 14:50:32 GMT):<br/>
docker.io latest I think is 1.13

@tongli  Alright. Flannel uses port 8285. I should see some rules related to it in my iptables right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 16:54:15 GMT):<br/>
I believe our aws ansible script already does that.

hmm. I suspect my flannel network broken after sometime. From my busybox container I tried to ping flannel0 ip. ALthough ping is normal but tcpdump on other server shows nothing which lead me to believe that flannel network unable to communicate 
</p>

Finally fixed that issue. It was due to iptables setting which blocks icmp packets to be forwarded from flannel interface to docker interface. By adding iptable rules everything works fine for me . However everytime when ansible created Ubuntu instance I need to quickly ssh into my instances and need to add rules before ansible go for setting fabric architecture.

@tongli I observed that when I modify bc1.yml file as below , only organization1 being able to invoke transaction but when I moved all anchor peers to fabric001 , all organization can invoke transactions. Cant we define anchors peer in other server like one acnhor peer in each servers?   Here is bc1.yml code  ``` network: {
    fabric001: {
      cas: ["ca1st.orga"],

@sravs, u need to post the steps and logs, then the team can try to help give suggestions.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 15:59:31 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid I am not quite sure what you are trying to do. you did not have orgf when you setup the network, then you run the same script again after you added orgf? if that is the case, I am pretty sure something will be wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 16:00:25 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  I edit this bc1st.yml file and re run everything from scratch 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 16:00:38 GMT):<br/>
the ansible agent as of now, stand up a brand new network and assumed that the configuration such as bc1st.yml not changing. if you change it , then you will need to destroy the old one and stand up a new.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 16:01:06 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid did you run the destroy to get rid of everything and stand up a new one?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 16:03:38 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid from your network layout file, I do not see any problems.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 16:03:56 GMT):<br/>
each org can have a anchor peer
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 16:04:34 GMT):<br/>
Yup .I just want to know  we can define anchor peers in any ubuntu insatnce right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 16:05:42 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid yeah, anchor peer can be allocated on any node.

<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 16:09:33 GMT):<br/>

@MohammadObaid you can do that only when you need to set it up initially. I think you can change the policy after the network is setup. but I am not the expert on the policy.
</p>

Hello everyone, I am building "n" node cluster where 5<n<100. For container orchestration, I am researching on Docker swarm and Kubernetes. Anyone would like to share their insights on orchestration and pros and cons of using one and the other. Also, new suggestions are always welcomed.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 04:20:06 GMT):<br/>
Basically swarm is easy to start and supported by docker inc
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 04:20:54 GMT):<br/>
k8s is more complicated and powerful, design for app management and is spported by google
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 04:21:23 GMT):<br/>
if I are not familiar with container cluster the. Suggest start from swarm
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 04:22:01 GMT):<br/>

@rajasekharpippalla if you look for a brand new fabric network, please look at this doc.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 14:25:13 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/ansible-agent-all-in-one.md
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 14:25:37 GMT):<br/>
this doc takes you step-by-step to stand up a fabric network on one single node.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 14:25:47 GMT):<br/>
which by default uses 1.0.2
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 14:26:18 GMT):<br/>
If you want to stand up multiple nodes fabric network, then look at this https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/ansible-agent-how-to.md
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 14:27:07 GMT):<br/>
If you want to stand up fabric network on AWS cloud , or OpenStack cloud or Azure, then look at this https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:04:34 GMT):<br/>
Hey @tongli  I observed that in this ca file https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/roles/deploy_compose/fabricsetup/templates/ca-compose.j2 there is no port mapping as we seen in normal docker compose file for hyperledger fabric https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/examples/e2e_cli/docker-compose-e2e.yaml#L18  . Is this intentional? 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:05:55 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid yes. we built overlay network so that each container has its own IP address.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:06:13 GMT):<br/>
so no port conflict at all. Each will simply use their default port.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:07:12 GMT):<br/>
if you do docker inspect, you will find each container has different IP address.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:09:18 GMT):<br/>
and default port is ? 7054 ? or with respect to particular containers?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:11:28 GMT):<br/>
each type uses a different port I believe.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:12:54 GMT):<br/>
check files in this directory https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/src/agent/ansible/roles/deploy_compose/fabricsetup/templates
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:13:11 GMT):<br/>
such as peer-compose.j2, which tells you the port for peers.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:13:23 GMT):<br/>
look at order-compose.j2 to see port for orderers.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:13:49 GMT):<br/>
hmm, I take that back.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:14:21 GMT):<br/>
orderer-compose does not show orderer port. check the orderer container compose file for exposed default port.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 16:14:59 GMT):<br/>
The point is that each container has its own IP, no port conflict possible.

@zonkedhazmat cello doesn't add limit to support multiple instances, and need support from the underly cluster platform. Currently we support various cloud platforms. Take docker swarm/k8s for example, it can across multi-datacenters, and on top of it, cello can easily deploy fabric to multiple datacenters, too.

Hmm Seems like issue with my cello configuration. My ca server database is also empty with no admin entity
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 17:57:32 GMT):<br/>
make sure that you are hitting the right database.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 19:23:48 GMT):<br/>
Ok. btw I just cloned fresh cello repository and without making any changes ran ansible script and then tries to enroll user from ca container and got same `authorization error` .

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 19:39:24 GMT):<br/>
hmm. @MohammadObaid the init should have already run.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 19:40:04 GMT):<br/>
you should not need to do that again.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 19:40:18 GMT):<br/>
check the ca container log files, you should see something.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 19:46:10 GMT):<br/>
Yup . I got the same thing in ca container log as my previous screenshot. Regarding init command I ran as last resort to see if it works but no luck . I will try again tomorrow. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 21:24:39 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid  can you add the following into your ca configuration file and restart the container and try again?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 21:24:43 GMT):<br/>
```registry:
  # Maximum number of times a password/secret can be reused for enrollment
  # (default: -1, which means there is no limit)
  maxenrollments: -1

  # Contains identity information which is used when LDAP is disabled
  identities:
     - name: admin
       pass: adminpw
       type: client
       affiliation: ""
       maxenrollments: -1
       attrs:
          hf.Registrar.Roles: "client,user,peer,validator,auditor"
          hf.Registrar.DelegateRoles: "client,user,validator,auditor"
          hf.Revoker: true
          hf.IntermediateCA: true```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 21:25:08 GMT):<br/>
I was told that that section was needed. If that works, I will make a change to cello to include that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 23:40:43 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid  I have created an jira issue to track this and have also submitted a patch set to fix this problem. you can see the patch set here https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15755/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 23:41:09 GMT):<br/>

Hi Baohua, I am working on CE-136, which is Integrate blockchain-explorer into the started network, and I have some modification need to let you know.
1.	Currently cello/src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0/local/fabric-solo-4.yaml has defined a ca container, however, neither org1 nor org2 is relative to this ca, so I remove ca.example.com, and add ca.org1.example.com and ca.org2.example.com, just like this:
```
# ca.example.com:
 #   image: hyperledger/fabric-ca
 #   container_name: ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_fabric-ca
 #   hostname: ca
 #  command: /go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/bin/ca server start -ca testdata/ec.pem -ca-key testdata/ec-key.pem -config testdata/testconfig.json
 #   expose:
 #     - "7054"
 #   command: fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw

  ca.org1.example.com:
    image: hyperledger/fabric-ca
    container_name: ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_fabric-ca-org1
    hostname: ca.org1.example.com
    environment:
      - FABRIC_CA_HOME=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_NAME=ca.org1.example.com
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_CERTFILE=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config/ca.org1.example.com-cert.pem
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config/f2f5a08d5969b4a21f99b5667a426564a3e640a268d2f6bfe77a0e066efb426f_sk
    expose:
      - "7054"
    volumes:
       - ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_PATH}/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/ca/:/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config
    command: fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw

  ca.org2.example.com:
    image: hyperledger/fabric-ca
    container_name: ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_fabric-ca-org2
    hostname: ca.org2.example.com
    environment:
      - FABRIC_CA_HOME=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_NAME=ca.org2.example.com
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_CERTFILE=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config/ca.org2.example.com-cert.pem
      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config/4a56bcf64913e49a5d6a05de9a71f3fa1c39ff1c4371fbb3d923cd8e3e0f75bd_sk
    expose:
      - "7054"
    volumes:
       - ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_PATH}/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/ca/:/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config
command: fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw 
```
2.	I found some useless private-key files under cello/src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0/local/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp/keystore 
and
cello/src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0/local/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp/keystore
I removed them and left the one that correspond to public key.

3.	It seems we don’t mount any chiancode into cli container, so I created a ‘chiancodes’ folder with some chaincode examples in it, and mount this folder into cli container.

4.	Since we have mount TLS certificates into Fabric cluster, so I enable TLS by default.

I also found a bug during working on CE-136. For every “fabric-1.0” cluster, we assign a set of worker ports for them, however, we are not actually mapping the container port to worker port, furthermore, we don’t expose the hole cluster to external, only one peer and one ca was exposed. As far as I concerned, we should refine the mapping solution, make every component of “fabric-1.0” cluster can be accessed from external.

Hi, I'm trying to set up my HF network on a set of hosts using ansible. I have manually modified hosts file and the next step is to initialize and prepare the servers using the following command: `ansible-playbook -i hosts -e "mode=apply env=os env_type=flanneld" initcluster.yml`. But I am not setting it up on any cloud, so what `env` value should I choose?

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 14:49:05 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan you can use vars/os.yml
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 14:49:17 GMT):<br/>
but you have to change few things in that file to match your env.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 14:49:42 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan if you tell me a bit more about your existing machines, I can certainly help.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 14:51:32 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @hightall can you please take a look at this patch to fix ca configuration issue?

Oh, I see. What info should I give you? I run it on ubuntu 16.04
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 14:52:51 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:40:07 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I see, I have tried to run it but I have a problem regarding keys. There are private_key_file and public_key_file atributes in the cluster configs. I only have my key in .ssh/authorized_keys, no key files. Should I generate a new pair on hosts?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:41:12 GMT):<br/>
the private key and public key should only available on your ansible controller.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:41:25 GMT):<br/>
which is the machine where you run the ansible scripts.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:41:44 GMT):<br/>
Oh so the paths are to the keys on my local machine?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:41:46 GMT):<br/>
on the machines which you will install fabric , you do not need private key.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:42:11 GMT):<br/>
if "local machine" means where you will run ansible commands, yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:42:44 GMT):<br/>
these keys will be used for communication with the target machines (which fabric will be deployed onto)
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:42:49 GMT):<br/>
Yeah thats what I meant thank you
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:43:11 GMT):<br/>
you do need the public key in the target machine .ssh/authorized_keys file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:43:16 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, ssh won't work.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:43:25 GMT):<br/>
also make sure that your target machine has python installed.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:43:50 GMT):<br/>
I have done that
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:43:56 GMT):<br/>
ok, great.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:44:13 GMT):<br/>
and your target machines should be ubuntu 16.04 as OS.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:44:24 GMT):<br/>
check :)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:44:51 GMT):<br/>
ok. your target machine should not have golang or docker installed.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:44:57 GMT):<br/>
if you do, it may fail.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:45:10 GMT):<br/>
the ansible scripts will install all of them.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:45:28 GMT):<br/>
It has passed through that already so there should be no problem
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:52:51 GMT):<br/>
Hi @tongli thanks a lot for the patch. I am now been able to enroll users, peer easily :)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 16:00:40 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid happy to hear that. thanks for finding this issue.

@Hi. I have now successfully ran the initcluster on my three peers. Than I have also ran the setupfabric, but got errors in kafka saying it cannot connect to other kafkas, even though IPs have been resolved successfuly. I then went back and checked logs in etcd.servicer which was the following: https://pastebin.com/5QAqASuG (I think that is OK). Then I checked the ogs of flanneld.service and I kept getting `Nov 29 08:22:36 blockchainIIC flanneld[10209]: E1129 08:22:36.679522   10209 watch.go:43] Watch subnets: delete "/coreos.com": not a subnet, skipping`. I than used `systemctl restart flanneld which resulted in: https://pastebin.com/Mi2rNGwU (Looks OK, but I shoudldn't do that manually). Now I pinged container on a host that is running it and it was a success but when I have pinged it from another host it was unsuccessfull. Is that expected or should I be able to?
I have tried that because i then ran setupfabric and zookeeper kept getting connection timeout errors when trying to connect to zookeepers on other hosts.

<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:24:34 GMT):<br/>
I ran ansible-playbook -e "mode=destroy env=bc1st deploy_type=compose" setupfabric.yml -K, befor running it again. Should I also run `ansible-playbook -e "mode=destroy env=os password=XXXXX cloud_type=os" provcluster.yml` but then can I just omit password parameter?

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:26:36 GMT):<br/>
each time you deploy things on, you will need to destroy it before you run it again especially when you change something in your configuration file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:27:27 GMT):<br/>
since get it up running does not take long time, I would strongly destroy everything and start over.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:27:45 GMT):<br/>
provcluster.yml is to get things completely destroyed on your cloud.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:28:06 GMT):<br/>
including get rid of your VMs. I assume that you are using AWS?
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:28:43 GMT):<br/>
No I do not deploy to cloud
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:28:59 GMT):<br/>
I just have a set of Ubuntu hosts
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:30:07 GMT):<br/>
You said earlier that I can use env=os for initcluster but now when I tried destroy provcluster I got an ansible FAIL: "shade is required for this module"

@tongli  Regarding issue https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-173 I also face same issue everytime when ran ansible cluster with aws instances. Reason I found is that icmp packets donot pass from flannel interface to docker interface thus causing to break connection between dockers. This happens due to ipatbles settings. If you edit iptables setting with `sud iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT` it will fix the issue and all container then communicate to each other.

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:38:44 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan right, in that can you can not use provcluster.yml , that is for destroy VMs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:39:46 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid right, if you actually use aws provisioning modules , all these will be taken care of.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:40:16 GMT):<br/>
@tongli So how would I go about destroying everything, so I can deploy things on again?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:40:29 GMT):<br/>
when you manually setup your own VM, you may have missed some thing.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:41:22 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan what are you using and how did you get your cluster up running?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:42:05 GMT):<br/>
if you are using AWS, you should simply use the steps that setup whole thing which including set up security rules on aws.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:42:37 GMT):<br/>
if you manually create VMs, then start from initcluster and setup fabric, things can get messy if you do not really know what you are doing.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:42:55 GMT):<br/>
I manually edited hosts file, than ran `ansible-playbook -i hosts -e "mode=apply env=os env_type=flanneld" initcluster.yml -K -vv` and than `ansible-playbook -i hosts -e "mode=apply env=bc1st deploy_type=compose" setupfabric.yml -K`.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:43:39 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan right, so you may have missed steps setting up security rules on aws. which by default do not open many ports for things to work.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:43:59 GMT):<br/>
I do not use aws
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:44:23 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan ok, I thought you were using aws.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:44:35 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  by aws provisioning modules you mean running ansible playbook `ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml` or I should run some other commands along with that playbook command
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:45:03 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan if you are using a clean ubuntu 16.04 image, then you should not have iptable issues. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:45:18 GMT):<br/>
unless your existing server already have some firewall settings?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:45:23 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid right.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:45:33 GMT):<br/>
if you like to destroy on aws, doing this
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:45:52 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -e "mode=destroy" aws.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:46:24 GMT):<br/>
of course, in that case, you will have to change few things in vars/aws.yml file to make sure that few fields are matching your account stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:46:31 GMT):<br/>
like what the doc suggested.
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:46:36 GMT):<br/>
I was going to update CE-173, but you are chatting here about the same topic.   Mohammad and I see the same issue.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:46:53 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  Well I always ran same ansible playbook script and face same issue everytime . I have to manually ssh into servers and edit iptables setting. If I dont do that then containers couldnt communicate 
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:47:04 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:47:04 GMT):<br/>
@sdarwin are you also using ansible agent?
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:47:13 GMT):<br/>
ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:47:27 GMT):<br/>
the standard playbook
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:47:34 GMT):<br/>
that sounds good.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:47:52 GMT):<br/>
@sdarwin you are having same issue on iptables?
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:48:05 GMT):<br/>
right.  the solution appears to be "iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT"
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:48:15 GMT):<br/>
what aws ubuntu image are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:48:19 GMT):<br/>
16.04
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:48:25 GMT):<br/>
the image name.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:48:37 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Yeah the hosts are in an internal network
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:48:38 GMT):<br/>
it is the image from the ansible code.  Not modified.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:48:52 GMT):<br/>
oh. i c.
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:49:24 GMT):<br/>
The Docker codebase, fairly recently, began to set iptables -P FORWARD DROP
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:49:43 GMT):<br/>
and that has affected kubernetes, and other projects
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:49:56 GMT):<br/>
Still I need to know how to "destroy" everything? Is it already supported for cases like mine or should I write a new env file?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:50:49 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan you just need to run destroy for initcluster and setupfabric in reverse order.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:51:34 GMT):<br/>
it should be already there. I do not think you need to add anything assume that you know which env file and fabric layout file to use.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:52:07 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I use os.yml file even though I do not deploy to OpenStack
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:52:18 GMT):<br/>
I recently moved a doc here. https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/ansible-agent-how-to.md
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:52:19 GMT):<br/>
You told me to do so yesterday
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:52:33 GMT):<br/>
I followed that doc
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:52:42 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan right, you will need to use that, that file gets used for provisioning and initcluster
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:53:00 GMT):<br/>
Destroy for setupfabric works fine , but destroy for initcluster fails
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:53:08 GMT):<br/>
please read that doc, it can provide you some insight.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:53:19 GMT):<br/>
I read it all
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:53:32 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan oh, great.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:53:57 GMT):<br/>
Its just that there are just vb/aws/os/azure envs and I dont use any
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:54:36 GMT):<br/>
That is the destoy initcluster error:
```TASK [Destroy the OpenStack VM] ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
fatal: [fabric001]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "shade is required for this module"}```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:54:54 GMT):<br/>
right. these files in vars directory are supposed to be like template or example configurations. different env should have similar files but same format and variable names.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:55:25 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan that should only be needed when you deal with OpenStack cloud in provcluster
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:55:43 GMT):<br/>
if you never invoke provcluster, then you should not need it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:55:48 GMT):<br/>
if you do, then you need it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:56:42 GMT):<br/>
I assume that you are not doing all this on OpenStack cloud, then you should not run this command
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:57:15 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -i runhosts -e "mode=appy env=os" provcluster.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:57:28 GMT):<br/>
or this
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:57:35 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -i runhosts -e "mode=destroy env=os" provcluster.yml
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:57:46 GMT):<br/>
apply not appy above.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:58:12 GMT):<br/>
when you have existing servers , you only need to do these two steps.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:58:21 GMT):<br/>
That fails at gathering facts
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:58:31 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -i runhosts -e "mode=apply env=xx" initcluster.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:58:54 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -i runhosts -e "mode=apply xxxx" setupfabric.yml
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:59:21 GMT):<br/>
Still same error
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:00:33 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan I do not know why it could invoke these modules though since the initcluster simply uses ssh to install software and never calls any openstack modules.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:00:50 GMT):<br/>
At destroy I mean
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:00:55 GMT):<br/>
right.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:00:58 GMT):<br/>
understand.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:01:18 GMT):<br/>
so can you install shade and see if the error goes away?
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:01:18 GMT):<br/>
Still that one:
```TASK [Destroy the OpenStack VM] ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
fatal: [fabric001]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "shade is required for this module"}```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:01:36 GMT):<br/>
put your exact command here
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:02:24 GMT):<br/>
`ansible-playbook -e "mode=destroy env=os" provcluster.yml` That one?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:02:47 GMT):<br/>
sigh! I assume that you are not using openstack cloud, right?
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:02:58 GMT):<br/>
No
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:03:15 GMT):<br/>
then why are you running that command?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:03:48 GMT):<br/>
you should be running these two commands
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:03:48 GMT):<br/>
I am asking you how to destroy everything and you provided me that command
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:04:06 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -e "mode=destroy env=os" initcluster.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:04:56 GMT):<br/>
provcluster is to provision vms against a cloud.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:05:06 GMT):<br/>
initcluster is to initialize the machines.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:05:14 GMT):<br/>
setupfabric is to stand up fabric network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:05:23 GMT):<br/>
which clearly says in the doc.
</p>

https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/ansible-agent-how-to.md#provision-the-servers
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:05:58 GMT):<br/>
That ran successfully so everything is destroyed now?

https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/ansible-agent-how-to.md#initialize-and-prepare-the-servers
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:06:23 GMT):<br/>
it should.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:06:31 GMT):<br/>
Yeah you said that I probably didn't destroy everything and I told you I did run this
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:06:51 GMT):<br/>
And than I asked you if I should also run destroy init :)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:07:41 GMT):<br/>
that should do the trick I think.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:08:01 GMT):<br/>
if it does not, patches will be very welcome.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:08:14 GMT):<br/>
Yeah but I tried that before I wrote you the message so the problem isn't there
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:09:05 GMT):<br/>
Sure, I'm just asking you how to debug connectivity between hosts as there are connection timeouts between zookeepers on different hosts
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:10:56 GMT):<br/>
if containers can not see each other like fails ping to each other, most likely the problems are flanneld overlay network gets messed up.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:11:05 GMT):<br/>
it could be few causes to that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:11:32 GMT):<br/>
1. etcd data was not cleaned appropriately, since flanneld depends on etcd to work correctly.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:11:43 GMT):<br/>
2. dns container stopped running.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:12:04 GMT):<br/>
3. registrator containers which should be one on every node stopped running.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:12:12 GMT):<br/>
In the first message I have linked logs of etcd and flanneld services can you please look if something looks suspicious?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:12:32 GMT):<br/>
any of these issues can cause containers not to be able to communicate.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:13:21 GMT):<br/>
flanneld depends on iptables since it heavily manipulate iptables rules, so messing with iptables can cause issues very hard to figure out.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:14:35 GMT):<br/>
I saw that, and the msg says /coreos is not a subnet, that basically tells me that etcd database is messed up for some reason, you should not see that kind of error.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:15:07 GMT):<br/>
that is why I suggested to destroy and clean up things. also the issues with existing servers is that ansible agent has no idea what is on these servers.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:17:23 GMT):<br/>
That problem was solved by restarting flanneld.service, and once it worked even without restarting but the problem was the same. 
I'll try to deploy the project to a clean set of VMs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:21:29 GMT):<br/>
sure. when you found some problems, please try to figure out the problems and submit patches.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:22:17 GMT):<br/>
it will be way better than just me doing all these things.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:22:48 GMT):<br/>
I mean try to figure out solutions and submit patches. this is an open source project after all.

Thank you for the fix. 
and what if the server happens to be rebooted..? :-)
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 13:23:27 GMT):<br/>
Just to keep in mind.  Docker will launch. Docker will set the rule back to DROP.

@tongli @baohua @hightall Request for review https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15807/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:48:39 GMT):<br/>
@sdarwin  currently cello does not manage these containers after them started. Machine reboot is one area we need a bit help.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:49:53 GMT):<br/>
@sdarwin this also needs to be considered in two scenarios, one is the docker swarm like env (what you probably have), we use flanneld to setup overlay network (which is fine since it is a systemd service), and k8s env.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:50:35 GMT):<br/>
@sdarwin are you saying each docker service restart causes iptable rules to be changed?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:51:07 GMT):<br/>
@sdarwin I am not quite sure that is the case, can you confirm and see if there is a flag or something to change that behavior?
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:02:18 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I'd definately submit a patch if I find a bug. Thank you for your time.
I have now deployed the project on a new set of clean ubuntu VMs. Initcluster now runs without any suspicious logs (http://prntscr.com/hhai9s). Setupfabric also runs without an error but there seems to be no connectivity betweenen containers of different hosts. I suspect that I simply didn't configure the network configs right, but I just can't make it work.
My VMs are in a VLAN `172.16.64.0/20`, so I set my netmasks to netmask `255.255.240.0`. The addresses of the hosts are `172.16.67.237`, `172.16.67.246`, `172.16.67.247`. 
My os.yml: https://pastebin.com/kTZVXpaf . Please look at the container_network here to see if anything looks off. Also I have not modified service_ip_range or  dns_service_ip, as I don't know what to set it to.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:04:24 GMT):<br/>
hmmm.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:04:52 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan your VM IP segment duplicate with overlay network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:05:15 GMT):<br/>
your VM or physical machine should not use IP in that segment.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:05:41 GMT):<br/>
172.16.0.0/16 gets used by the flanneld overlay network for containers.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:05:57 GMT):<br/>
What changes do you propose? I'm not very good at networking
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:06:00 GMT):<br/>
your machines have to use something different or you change that segement to something else
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:06:45 GMT):<br/>
that says container network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:06:55 GMT):<br/>
your VM should not use any IP fall into that range.

<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:07:49 GMT):<br/>
@tongli You mean IPs of my host shouldn't start with 172.16.X.X? 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:08:00 GMT):<br/>
correct.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:08:44 GMT):<br/>
how many machines do you have? how do they communicate with each other?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:09:20 GMT):<br/>
normally you should not need to change anything about the network that you connect your VMs.
</p>

<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:13:08 GMT):<br/>
@smallant  use -k with your ansible command? Or push a public key to the host.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:14:01 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:17:15 GMT):<br/>
@tongli , that issue was not from restarting the Docker service.  However, a full machine reboot would trigger it.   The very first time Docker runs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:18:50 GMT):<br/>
@sdarwin I thought that the iptable command set to accept, just need to be done once, if machine reboots, docker services runs again reset that to drop as you indicated, then that is a big problem.
</p>
<p><strong>smallant</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:19:36 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=DGZ9jfj4ndwAmMM4f) @SimonOberzan thanks I'll try that :)
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:22:43 GMT):<br/>
@tongli , the most elegant solution could be systemd drop-in units to customize Docker.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:23:46 GMT):<br/>
you mean each time after docker service starts, run that command?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:24:05 GMT):<br/>
that command will be part of docker systemd service?
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:24:32 GMT):<br/>
ExecStartPost command
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:24:46 GMT):<br/>
that can be done, actually cello create docker systemd service already. but I am still skeptical about that has to be done each time.
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:25:15 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't have to be done each time.
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:25:19 GMT):<br/>
only at boot
</p>
<p><strong>sdarwin</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:28:16 GMT):<br/>
however, running it every time probably doesn't hurt anything.  
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:31:10 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=KTxiYG3h3Ks28cZ6s)  Also could I just change `172.16.0.0/16` in network_config to `172.17.0.0/16`?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:55:04 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan sure, you can change the overlay to somewhere else which does not conflict with your VM IP space.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:56:02 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan you would need to change the SubnetMin, SubnetMax and Network.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 16:12:43 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I'll try that, thank you

I have made my first commit to an OS project and looks like I did a mess :sweat_smile: . I guess my first commit failed because I have also changed the .env file by mistake? Then I tried to push a fix but I guess I didn't do it right. What would be the right actions now, to push a fix? Also if I made any other mistakes (like I didn't include jira tag at the start of commit msg) please tell me so my future commits will be like they should.

@SimonOberzan happy for you.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 16:01:24 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan you have to submit a patch set to gerrit for review. once maintainer approves your patch set, then your changes will be merged.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 16:01:53 GMT):<br/>
@SimonOberzan Not sure how you submitted your changes, I am sure it caused no harm at present.
</p>
<p><strong>SimonOberzan</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 17:44:58 GMT):<br/>
On gerrit there is a subject column. Each subject has a history of commits. If I want to push a new fix can I push it in a history of an exsisting subject? Or does each subject only show commits made before pushing with git review?

<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:30:53 GMT):<br/>
i rebooted the machine and those dockers will still run at startup and keep restarting, host status still inactive
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:32:18 GMT):<br/>
That's bcoz of the restart policy on the containers. 
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:32:41 GMT):<br/>
two things i'd like to know: 1. what does it mean by host inactive and what causes that.
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:33:04 GMT):<br/>
2. how to set things right. (and wether the state/chain is persisted)
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:33:04 GMT):<br/>
2. how to set things right. (and whether the state/chain is persisted)
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:33:28 GMT):<br/>
FWIW, I am figuring out things too with cello ;) so bear with me.. 
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:34:01 GMT):<br/>
hahaha ;) let's do it together
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:34:09 GMT):<br/>
BTW, can you reset from `Actions --> Reset`
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:34:10 GMT):<br/>
so what i just did: i stopped and removed them all.
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:34:14 GMT):<br/>
nope it doens't work
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:34:27 GMT):<br/>
now i rebooted, no more dockers auto start.
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:34:37 GMT):<br/>
Now all set ?
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:34:40 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:34:45 GMT):<br/>
they don't start now. they should no?
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:35:06 GMT):<br/>
i'm going to do "make start" on the master and see if i can reproduce up to active host.
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:35:14 GMT):<br/>
`make restart`
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:36:02 GMT):<br/>
Or, on the client, `service docker stop` and check the node status on your master
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:37:13 GMT):<br/>
now it's totally insane, same old inactive host and active running chain.
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:37:21 GMT):<br/>
but there're no corresponding dockers running.
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:38:55 GMT):<br/>
Can you kill/remove your running chain ?
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:46:12 GMT):<br/>
nope
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:48:00 GMT):<br/>
those dockers don't exist anymore, but the master cannot realize that
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:50:36 GMT):<br/>
Did you issue `Action-->Reset` ?
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:50:36 GMT):<br/>
Did you issue `Action-->Reset` ? which actually cleans-up stale docker-containers
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:52:05 GMT):<br/>
reset is greyed out
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:53:23 GMT):<br/>
you happen to know how i can reset the maste node? it remembers things that are long gone
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:54:29 GMT):<br/>
Try `make restart` else `make redeploy`
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 10:58:22 GMT):<br/>
tried `make restart` `make redeploy`  none work, it still remembers...
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 11:11:20 GMT):<br/>
now i got this ```Pulling mongo (hyperledger/cello-mongo:latest)...
ERROR: pull access denied for hyperledger/cello-mongo, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'
Makefile:168: recipe for target 'start' failed
make: *** [start] Error 1```

</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 11:15:23 GMT):<br/>
What exactly are you trying to do ?
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 11:15:37 GMT):<br/>
`make start`
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 11:15:54 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 11:16:05 GMT):<br/>
it didn't have that problem before, now this occurs
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 11:16:18 GMT):<br/>
assuming you are under `cello/`
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 11:16:27 GMT):<br/>
can you `rm -rf build`
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 11:16:34 GMT):<br/>
and issue `make start`
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 11:17:33 GMT):<br/>
thanks buddy very help, now let's see....
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 11:19:16 GMT):<br/>
i tried `make clean` surprised that it doesn't clear /build
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 11:19:58 GMT):<br/>
Target clean isn't clearing that.. Would request you to open a bug/jira item.

just to update on the restarting problem, it is a folder copy and chown issue. I'm testing the master node and the worker node on the same computer. need to make sure `/opt/cello/mongo` is owned by root and `/opt/cello/fabric 1.0` is owned by USER:USER

@tongli is presenting cello at lisbon hackfest! would like to hear more feedbacks there, good to instruct how we develop cello better for more user cases.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 06:26:23 GMT):<br/>
@baohua  I have gone through this document  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eRNxxQ0P8yp4Wh__Vi6ddaN_vhN2RQHP-IruHNUwyhc/edit# and saw a section `terminate channel` feature . Is this feature available or just in  theory for now ?
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 06:27:10 GMT):<br/>
I havent seen any implementation example on offical docs or in node sdk 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 07:07:02 GMT):<br/>
no, the channel cannot be terminated now
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 07:18:49 GMT):<br/>
Hmm , means  it is currently in development mode  and we might see in future right ?
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 12:40:05 GMT):<br/>
quick question on the peers generated from adding chains in cello. it seems that i cannot connect to them. when i look at `docker ps` the ports don't seem to be forwarded. thoughts on this or ways to mitigate?
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 12:46:08 GMT):<br/>
also another query: i found 4 _sk files in the keystore under the artifacts, am curious why. in the fabric BYFN example there's only one.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 14:50:53 GMT):<br/>
@yipcma it should be only one _sk file that correspond to the public key, others could be removed.
</p>
<p><strong>yipcma</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 16:12:52 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen guess i'll just rerun to cryptogen to get one then.

<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 17:56:02 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to create a fabric network using Ansible cello

in aws cloud

<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 17:56:19 GMT):<br/>
I ran the below command for initializing and got below errors the rest are successful:
Before I used private_ip and my process is stuck at Start the Flanneld service and throws the below first error, today I changed to Public_ip in the yml file and it still throws the first error but in went quickly to other steps and throwed the remaining errors as shown below, can you please help?

<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:10:54 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:37:03 GMT):<br/>
@sarifuddin I am in a meeting now, will look into your issue after.
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:41:38 GMT):<br/>
I have configured the yml file for aws details
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:41:59 GMT):<br/>
and then ran first the above single integrated command : ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml`
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:42:09 GMT):<br/>
it ran into issue at same step
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:42:50 GMT):<br/>
then I try to run each phase separately
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:42:53 GMT):<br/>
@sarifuddin the problem that flanneled service can not start?
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:42:58 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:43:26 GMT):<br/>
did you create new VM? or are you reusing already started VMs?
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:43:47 GMT):<br/>
the script created new VM's in AWS based on the aws.yml configuration file
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:44:09 GMT):<br/>
I have customized according to my account
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:44:22 GMT):<br/>
and then ran the provisioning command
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:44:35 GMT):<br/>
and it completed successfully with 3 nodes up and running
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:44:49 GMT):<br/>
so total 4 nodes: 3 nodes for the fabric and 1 ansible controller
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:45:00 GMT):<br/>
i ran the command from Ansible controller host
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:45:03 GMT):<br/>
ah! that is what I normally do.
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:45:15 GMT):<br/>
which then provision the remaining 3 hosts
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:45:17 GMT):<br/>
have 1 VM as ansible controller, so that you can use private_ip.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:46:09 GMT):<br/>
@sarifuddin so there was no error at all before you saw flanneld service errors?
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:46:22 GMT):<br/>
yep, there was no error before flanneld
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:46:37 GMT):<br/>
flanneld service is the first error
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:47:24 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. flanneld rely on etcd service to be running correctly.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:48:08 GMT):<br/>
sometimes when you run ansible repeatedly especially in cloud env, it gets a bit confused if you do not config ssh correctly.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:48:28 GMT):<br/>
can you post your config file in ansible controller .ssh directory?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:48:34 GMT):<br/>
if you do not have one, please create one like this.

it is not a shell file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:50:39 GMT):<br/>
also remove known_hosts file , you should have one like that.
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:52:32 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>

after you have all that in place, please destroy everything, let's run again and see step by step what is going on.
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:52:44 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:54:39 GMT):<br/>
in aws.yml file what option should I give
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:54:41 GMT):<br/>
 node_ip: "public_ip",
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:54:47 GMT):<br/>
last time i put public_ip
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:54:52 GMT):<br/>
instead of private ip
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:54:59 GMT):<br/>
in your configuration, you can use either.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:55:12 GMT):<br/>
since your ansible controller and new VMs are on the same network.
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:55:34 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:55:49 GMT):<br/>
you should use public_ip when your ansible controller and VMs are not on the same network. such as using your laptop as ansible controller.
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:56:31 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:56:59 GMT):<br/>
in aws.yml, if I set availability zone to a specific one, will it take that or it will take random
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:57:03 GMT):<br/>
with in a region
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:57:20 GMT):<br/>
i try setting a specific availability zone to match same as my ansible controller
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:57:35 GMT):<br/>
but its picking different availability zone
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:58:04 GMT):<br/>
set the availibility zone to empty
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:58:40 GMT):<br/>
region needs to match your region, like I am in east coastal, I use N. Virginia 
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:00:16 GMT):<br/>
yaa, its matching
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:00:39 GMT):<br/>
if you have run this before and VMs were created successfully, these settings should be fine.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:22:24 GMT):<br/>
Hey @tongli  does ansible script work in kubernetes environment ?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:22:45 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid it sets up k8s env, then deploy fabric onto it.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:24:58 GMT):<br/>
Oh . Just one more question . If one of my aws server goes down completely then I have to create flannel interface manually and add other flannel interface ip right ?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:40:41 GMT):<br/>
no, if one server goes down, your fabric network should continue to work.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:41:10 GMT):<br/>
are you talking about recovering the system that goes down?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:41:35 GMT):<br/>
or are you talking about adding a brand new node?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:48:26 GMT):<br/>
@sarifuddin how is it going?
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:58:54 GMT):<br/>
server provisioning completed
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:59:02 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Sat, 09 Dec 2017 20:36:05 GMT):<br/>
@sarifuddin We can check few things, I am not sure if your aws VM actually use IP like 172.31.0.0/16.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Sat, 09 Dec 2017 20:36:26 GMT):<br/>
if your AWS VMs are fall into that IP range, you will have to change your container_network IP segment.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Sat, 09 Dec 2017 20:37:24 GMT):<br/>
I noticed that you have used 172.31.0.0/16 which is not the default from cello. You are free to change that but you will need to make sure that IP range does not conflict with your AWS VM private IP Address space.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Sat, 09 Dec 2017 20:37:55 GMT):<br/>
I tried same thing so many times in my AWS account, I had no issues whatsoever setting things up.

Thanks Tong, I have now changed the container_network IP segment to be different than my AWS instance ip and it worked now and able to standup all 3 nodes. Thanks for your help

<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Sun, 10 Dec 2017 18:06:41 GMT):<br/>
Now my next task is to Deploy Business Network, for that I need to know the URL of my CA server. I can see there are multiple CA servers created, so how can I find out what is the URL i need to use, can you please guide?
</p>
<p><strong>sarifuddin</strong> (Sun, 10 Dec 2017 18:07:49 GMT):<br/>
Another question: Since I stopped my AWS instances, when I power on , how can I start the network again, I don't have to run the same procedures right, its already created, I just need to start my fabric, please guide?

welcome everyone to help review
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:40:08 GMT):<br/>
@sarifuddin for CA url, you just need to find the CA container IP address.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:40:32 GMT):<br/>
All CA containers work at their default port.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:41:14 GMT):<br/>
Once you stop your AWS Instances, when you power them back up. these containers can not start by themselves, you will have to manually start them up.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:43:37 GMT):<br/>
unless there are ways to deal with container auto start like using --restart unless-stopped or always.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:43:57 GMT):<br/>
which we do not do right now. we may need to add that flag as a parameter.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:44:07 GMT):<br/>
should be easy to do.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:45:27 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/16101
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:47:28 GMT):<br/>
this should only need to be done by changing these files https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/roles/deploy_compose/fabricsetup/templates/peer-compose.j2
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:47:59 GMT):<br/>
all compose files in this directory https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/roles/deploy_compose/fabricsetup/templates/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:50:04 GMT):<br/>
@sarifuddin if you can submit a patch on the container restart policy, I will be happy to review and help.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:50:40 GMT):<br/>
having a flag for restart policy will be better, deployer can choose to have the restart policy or not.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:51:17 GMT):<br/>
then in the following, you can simply add a line
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:51:21 GMT):<br/>
```container_name: {{ orderer.name }}
    image: hyperledger/fabric-orderer:{{ thetag }}
network_mode: bridge```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:51:33 GMT):<br/>
```container_name: {{ orderer.name }}
    image: hyperledger/fabric-orderer:{{ thetag }}
    network_mode: bridge```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:51:37 GMT):<br/>
like the following
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:52:39 GMT):<br/>
```container_name: {{ orderer.name }}
    image: hyperledger/fabric-orderer:{{ thetag }}
    restart: {{ fabric.restart}}```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:53:10 GMT):<br/>
fabric.restart should have been defined in bc1st.yml, bc2nd.yml and vb1st.yml file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:53:19 GMT):<br/>
default should have been "no"
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:53:22 GMT):<br/>
hope that helps.

Hi folks, 
I still got the tox error in the cello directory when typing make check, 
make: Circular build/docker/baseimage/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 <- build/docker/baseimage/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 dependency dropped.
make: Circular build/docker/mongo/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 <- build/docker/mongo/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 dependency dropped.
make: Circular build/docker/nginx/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 <- build/docker/nginx/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 dependency dropped.
tox
make: tox: Command not found

I am using Ubuntu 14.04 in AWS

Hi, folks.

I met a few problems when installing and using cello.

1. I still got the tox error when typing 'make check' in the cello directory after installation.
I used the cello committed on Mon Dec (c0cefd002b4943213acff684329ed115e583f438) and doing it on ubuntu 14.04 in AWS.

ubuntu@ip-xxx-xx-xx-x:~/cello$ make check
make: Circular build/docker/baseimage/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 <- build/docker/baseimage/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 dependency dropped.
make: Circular build/docker/mongo/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 <- build/docker/mongo/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 dependency dropped.
make: Circular build/docker/nginx/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 <- build/docker/nginx/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 dependency dropped.
tox
make: tox: Command not found
make: *** [check] Error 127

2. In addition, it seems that mongo doesn't start when to type 'make start'. Here is the docker log of mongo

ubuntu@ip-xxx-xx-xx-x:~/cello$ docker logs -f mongo

Hi, folks.

I met a few problems when installing a master node

1. When installing cello (make setup-master), I sometimes got this message. Is it okay?

debconf: delaying package configuration, since apt-utils is not installed


2. I still got the tox error when typing 'make check' in the cello directory after installation.
I used the cello committed on Mon Dec (c0cefd002b4943213acff684329ed115e583f438) and doing it on ubuntu 14.04 in AWS.

@harsha @baohua Thanks, 

I tried what you instructed, but the result was same.
To make it sure, I deleted the old instance in my AWS and created a new one with Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type
Then, I log-in as root and installed docker engine and compose.
The corresponding versions are shown below.

$docker -v
Docker version 1.12.6-cs13, build 0ee24d4
$docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.12.0, build b31ff33


Then, I cloned the latest cello source code containing the following log

commit c0cefd002b4943213acff684329ed115e583f438
Merge: 8719a9b 7b5f99b
Author: tong  li <litong01@us.ibm.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 11 20:48:28 2017 +0000


I, then, installed prerequisite SWs (git, make, etc.) and typed 'make setup-master'
To make sure, I logged-out and logged-in again and typed 'make setup-master', again.
Then, I logged-in again and typed 'make start' and 'make check'

Unfortunately, I got the same error, 

Attaching to dashboard-test, mongo-test
mongo-test   | /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: line 27: /usr/local/bin/gosu: Permission denied
mongo-test exited with code 1

Any idea would be appreicated.

<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 07:13:51 GMT):<br/>
@KSLee Can you try issuing make start as root instead ?

@harsha Thanks for the comment, Harsha. I also repeated the installation and run as root (including installation by ubuntu ID and run by root also), however, I got the same result.
Thanks!

<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 07:17:51 GMT):<br/>
I presume you have issued `make image-clean` and issued `make start` and then you are stuck with above issue ?

About point 1) it can be ignored.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 07:32:53 GMT):<br/>
@KSLee i just run `make check` on my local mac with the latest master branch, and it passed. 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 07:33:14 GMT):<br/>
can u try with the latest code? `make clean check`

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 08:23:31 GMT):<br/>
i repeat again, but still not find the problem....let me think
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 08:23:38 GMT):<br/>
can u run `docker images`?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 08:23:55 GMT):<br/>
@harsha when building images, there's msg like "make: Circular build/docker/nginx/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 <- build/docker/nginx/.0.8.0-snapshot-c0cefd0 dependency dropped."
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 08:24:09 GMT):<br/>
is this normal as `Circular build`?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 08:25:42 GMT):<br/>
@KSLee after starting, should have containers like

@KSLee strange, i checked, seems the info is correct, only one diff is that u're using docker 1.12, while i'm using 1.17. could u help post ur steps and error logs to the maillist, i will take a look later.

@baohua the base tag has been increased to 0.4.2.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 01:27:04 GMT):<br/>
so what I have in the patch is correct.

<p><strong>KSLee</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 01:29:54 GMT):<br/>
@baohua Thanks, baohua. I used docker 1.12 as the instruction in the Cello Docs indicates
I will try more (upgrade docker version or use other machine, etc) and if it doesn't work, it will post the steps in the email.
Thanks for your help!

Hello All...I am new to hyperledger cello...I have one question, does cello dashboard works only on 8080 port
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 05:37:10 GMT):<br/>
@mvaibhavshah Right. By default it comes up on 8080 port
</p>
<p><strong>mvaibhavshah</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 05:38:10 GMT):<br/>
@harsha : Thanks .....can we change it...as blockchain explorer also I think can show dashboard on 8080
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 05:39:11 GMT):<br/>
You might want to have a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L32 
</p>
<p><strong>KSLee</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 10:33:19 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @harsha I finally got to success in running cello in my AWS. I used ubuntu 16_04 and the newest docker CE and docker-compose whereas the instruction indicated to used 14_04, 1.10~1.13, 1.8~1.12.0, respectively. (Those versions don't work for me) In addition, I modified download_images.sh to download Fabric images.
Anyway, thanks folks!
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 10:36:04 GMT):<br/>
@KSLee May I ask what you changed in download_images.sh ?
</p>

@harsha I just manually set ARCH as x86_64 as "ARCH=`uname -m | sed 's|i686|x86|' | sed 's|x86_64|x64|'" wasn't working for me in the script.
FYI, the result of  `uname -m | sed 's|i686|x86|' | sed 's|x86_64|x64|'` showed x64 instead of x86_64, which works for my env.

It seems that, using the ansible agent (I use ansible alone without the cello-UI right now), it is not possible to deploy an orderer belonging to a certain organisation (say orga) onto a server when there is also a peer belonging to the same organisatiion defined

Is there a way around this (or maybe I just did something wrong here), or am I limited to only deploying peers/orderes belonging to different organisations ?

<p><strong>maris.c</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:07:41 GMT):<br/>
I think there is something wrong with worker node setup scripts. I tried to pull images, but failed, because of this line https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/scripts/worker_node/download_images.sh#L16. I am running ubuntu 16.04, and ARCH variable is set to x64 and therefore it could not find docker images from dockerhub. If you see https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/fabric-peer/tags/ it has tag x86_64-1.0.5 not x64-1.0.5
</p>
<p><strong>maris.c</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:08:04 GMT):<br/>

The recent check-in wrt https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/16091/ and modifications to Dockerfile makes it tightly coupled with arch i.e x86 
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Sun, 17 Dec 2017 10:25:59 GMT):<br/>
The intent of leveraging the tag `hyperledger/cello-baseimage` is to ensure it is arch independent

good day. I'm a newbie in cello and i just want to ask if kubernetes is already supported? Based on the docs I can say it's supported but I can't find any docs on how to set it up. I'm don't know python either but i checked the codes and i can't find anything in the k8s agent.. i hope u guys can help. sorry for the newbie question

@rhansharief thanks for ur questions, currently we have several work for k8s support, one is by @tongli to use ansible to setup k8s cluster, the other is by @grapebaba to support k8s directly. Hope tong and kai can give some comments. Beside, we have docs at http://cello.readthedocs.io/. Thanks!

Hi to all, currently checking Cello for the first time.
I'm also new to Ansible.
I have a virtualbox with a ubuntu server 17.04 and running the all in one tutorial.
It's a clean installation and I'm receiving this error:

fatal: [10.0.2.15]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Permission denied (publickey,password).\r\n", "unreachable": true}


I have ran this before trying to connect, like the tutorial says:

    mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen -t rsa -f fd -P ""
    cat ~/.ssh/fd.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Hello everyone, i want to deploy hyperledger fabric network using ansible but i am confused about server machines. Like can i deploy it on physical machines ? If so, then is there any tutorial or reference for that ? Because i have looked at this *http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_worker_ansible/* but there is no instruction regarding deployment on physical machines . Thanks in advance]\
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 02 Jan 2018 00:50:11 GMT):<br/>
Ansible should not care the target is vm or server. IMHO the way is similar.

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 02 Jan 2018 15:12:26 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid most certainly. The first node in your cluster is used as the k8s cluster. if you choose to install fabric onto k8s, k8s gets installed and configured for you by cello. you should be able to see the dashboard off of the first node.

i used cello to install fabric network (2 org , 2 peers per each organization, 1 ca) then we followed the tutorial (https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/tutorials/deploy-to-fabric-multi-org.html) but we have only one ca instead of ca per org and when we run command 
*** composer network start -c PeerAdmin@byfn-network-org1 -a tutorial-network/tutorial-network@0.0.1.bna -o endorsementPolicyFile=endorsement-policy.json -A alice -C alice/admin-pub.pem -A bob -C bob/admin-pub.pem *** 
we get this error

 Hi I am trying to setup cello project on 2 servers on azure one as master other as worker node looking at https://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_worker_docker what should be the tcp://URL that needs to be provided here `DOCKER_OPTS="$DOCKER_OPTS -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --api-cors-header='*' --default-ulimit=nofile=8192:16384 --default-ulimit=nproc=8192:16384"` and also what should be the other paramerts
instead of 0.0.0.0:2375 I used vm address of my server
but I got this error

```

</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 13:15:28 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc cello acts as dashboard to manage lifecycle of your blockchain. in your case you have added a worker node on which you spawned a blockchain-network.

@SimonOberzan the ansible agent has not been integrated with the dashboard. @tongli might have more comments.

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:06:39 GMT):<br/>

Hi guys, I'm trying to use cello to provision my network, but it doesn't work as expected. I've created a test Chain on one host and I've then tried to delete it, but I always get this error message `Failed! Failed to delete cluster `. I don't understand where I can find more info on why it didn't delete the chain

Hi I am new to cello can any one explain how can we run the application on different host machines?

@rhansharief blockchain-explorer failed recently dueto code update, will fix it. could u help create  a jira bug?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 14:31:11 GMT):<br/>
@fabcan can u find the error log by `make log`?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 14:31:51 GMT):<br/>
@Lavanya5896 certainly, cello is distributed, see cello.readthedocs.org

oh, i know the problem, there's file missed. the solo one should work now.

@baohua by sifting only ERROR and WARNING (with `make logs | grep ERROR` or `make logs | grep WARN`) i get the following:
```

```
hope it helps
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:26:23 GMT):<br/>
yes, since the file is missing, it won't be able to clean the kafka mode chain now...

@baohua @harsha Do you have any plans to release `0.8.0` cello version.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 16:43:37 GMT):<br/>
FYI: release jobs in jenkins trigger based on the release tag event.. so, once you create release tag, Jenkins trigger `z and p` release jobs and publish images to hyperledger docker hub account

@DarshanBc let me work with you on that around 9:30am est.

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 13:47:48 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc if you have azure, you can use one command to setup everything and do not even have to deal with the runhost file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 13:49:03 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc you only need to deal with the runhost file when you have physical machines or VMs created not by cello ansible agent.

Hi @baohua

<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 02:29:48 GMT):<br/>
I do not see any responses in #blockchain-explorer wrt [CE-228]. However wanted to propose if we can build and integrate the docker-images via Cello ?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 02:56:41 GMT):<br/>
u're right. unless the blockchain-explorer team release the official images, we can only pick the 3rd ones temporarily.... have u discussed with those BE maintainers? i guess most projects release docker images now.

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 19:04:42 GMT):<br/>
well, if you do not have public IPs, it will be hard to do this because you have to run the ansible script from a machine.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 19:05:21 GMT):<br/>

I think the problem was with authentication I have priv keys to ssh to server there was no mention of them while running cello   
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Sun, 21 Jan 2018 13:10:24 GMT):<br/>
@tongli when I used ssh debug Password authntication is set to no and user name is set to ubuntu I need to change authentication method as well as user name how do I do it?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Sun, 21 Jan 2018 13:58:00 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc looks like you can not reach your host. the machine you are running ansible script has to be able to reach your fabric machines via ssh. You can try to manually ssh to these hosts and see if you can do that, if you can not do that manually, you won't be able to use ansible script.
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Sun, 21 Jan 2018 14:19:49 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I can ssh those servers manually through priv keys and pwd thing is I haven't mentioned either the path of priv keys or mentioned pwd before running the script so how do I include then while executing ansible-playbook command 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Sun, 21 Jan 2018 14:21:22 GMT):<br/>
so you can use your private key and pass phrase to access these machines, right?

are there any fixes we are waiting for?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:02:54 GMT):<br/>
let's give 1-2 weeks experience on alpha version, fixing user reported bug, after we think it's stable, we can consider the release. thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:02:57 GMT):<br/>
I like to integrate the ansible agent created cluster to dashboard, need a bit help.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:03:31 GMT):<br/>
i believe that won't be a easy work, so we may put it as after v0.8.0 release.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:03:31 GMT):<br/>
say the fabric network is running, how can we make the cluster(network) show up in the dashboard?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:03:46 GMT):<br/>
yes, it's useful
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:04:40 GMT):<br/>
@hightall @huiyingGong would u like to give some comments on this feature?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:04:57 GMT):<br/>
we should have all the information about nodes, where they are, how to access them,  where fabric components running,
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:05:07 GMT):<br/>
@tongli exactly! feel free to create a jira new feature task first, let's track there.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:06:46 GMT):<br/>
what I am a bit concerned is that we are going to be based on k8s, k8s dashboard provides already a great deal of information, we are going to use helm to manage the cluster, will that be a lot of overlap?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:13:05 GMT):<br/>
yes, but k8s dashboard is focusing on those container info, he won't know the service type
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:13:20 GMT):<br/>
that might be one place to differentiate 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:13:31 GMT):<br/>
@tongli just rebased to latest master: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17019/.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:14:06 GMT):<br/>
k8s dashboard has service information as well.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:14:46 GMT):<br/>
which tells you what fabric network services you have currently, either peer or orderer or kafka etc.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:15:08 GMT):<br/>
at least that is how ansible agent sets up things in k9s env.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:15:12 GMT):<br/>
k8s
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:15:14 GMT):<br/>
not that "service", i mean the app info, take fabric as example, k8s cannot know what is org, it can only know namespace. and it neither know blocks.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:15:47 GMT):<br/>
yeah detailed blockchain related info.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:15:54 GMT):<br/>
yes, as container level, k8s knows, it is a container cloud manager, but not a blockchain manager
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:15:56 GMT):<br/>
like channels, orgs.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:16:04 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:17:01 GMT):<br/>
but we certainly can leverage k8s as one of our underly infrastructure. that's cello's initial scope, we take advantage of existing platform techniques, but focus on the DLT layer.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:17:41 GMT):<br/>
not sure if k8s dashboard can be customized to introduce new segement.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:17:44 GMT):<br/>
currently, we can support docker host/swarm/vmware center/ ansible (hosts, vm, cloud...)/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:18:11 GMT):<br/>
if it does, we can develop a dashboard plugin which deals with fabric specific features such as channels, orgs etc
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:18:38 GMT):<br/>
yes. i'm not sure, but i believe from k8s's side, it will be a general container cloud manager.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:18:56 GMT):<br/>
as openstack to be a general vm cloud manager
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:29:44 GMT):<br/>
@baohua I believe Makefile with version info. should be updated to publish the docker-images.
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:33:27 GMT):<br/>
Alongwith `IS_RELEASE=true`which should be reset to false in next PR.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:35:27 GMT):<br/>
@harsha yes, let's follow that in the coming v0.8.0 major release. Btw, would u like to help enhance the doc on the release process?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:37:31 GMT):<br/>
for this alpha release, let's still follow the legacy way?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:37:54 GMT):<br/>
as we wanna quickly publish it for call for feedbacks and bug reports
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:38:04 GMT):<br/>
how do u feel?
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:40:10 GMT):<br/>
I've no problems with the approach, however the pressing point would be publishing the docker-images for non-x86 archs which aren't in the dockerhub yet, since we have made significant progress wrt v0.8.0-alpha we can do one-off publish, would be a good stepping point. 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:40:50 GMT):<br/>
sure, thanks, let's finish all arch support in the 0.8.0 major release.

i am trying to setup with ansible, suppose 13.115.186.233 / 13.231.77.57 / 54.64.163.73 is the same fabric001/fabric002/fabric003
</p>

@here Hyperledger Cello v0.8.0-alpha is released, and thanks to every developer. Welcome to try and report issues: https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/releases/tag/v0.8.0-alpha.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:01:40 GMT):<br/>
@baohua echo that. thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:03:57 GMT):<br/>
@ctyu ansible uses ssh to connect. you can set up ssh-agent , then you should be able to connect to these machines.
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:05:19 GMT):<br/>
i already setup ssh-agent so that i can create fabric 001/fabric 002
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:06:24 GMT):<br/>
@harsha would u like to add the dockerfiles for both v0.8.0-alpha and coming v0.8.0: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-202, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:06:36 GMT):<br/>
@baohua on it now. :)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:06:39 GMT):<br/>
great
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:06:59 GMT):<br/>
@cytu, it is easy to test this. if you set up ssh-agent already, you can manually test it, just do a ssh user@your_machine_ip, 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:07:24 GMT):<br/>
if that works, you should be able to access these using the ansible script.
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:08:28 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  i can access with -i option  ssh -i "key" user@your_machine_i
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:08:52 GMT):<br/>
right in that case, when you start up your ssh-agent, you would use that key and passphrase.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:08:57 GMT):<br/>
not your default one.
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:10:00 GMT):<br/>
that mean i need to set my key as default?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:10:40 GMT):<br/>
after v0.8.0, an important feature is to enable the hyperledger compose support: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-245. Welcome anyone interested to help. @Yixing 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:10:59 GMT):<br/>
@ctyu you do not have to.
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:11:19 GMT):<br/>
@baohua  * Enable user dashboard, can apply chain, query block/transaction,
    upload/invoke/query chain code; seem it is a very exciting feature haha
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:11:23 GMT):<br/>
just need to use it when you star tyour agent.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:11:43 GMT):<br/>
@ctyu exactly, it's great contribution from @hightall 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:11:57 GMT):<br/>
welcome to help report issues and advice
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:12:37 GMT):<br/>
@ctyu do this 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:12:43 GMT):<br/>
```eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Agent pid 59566
```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:13:07 GMT):<br/>
ssh-add -K "whatever_your_key"
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:13:38 GMT):<br/>
it will ask your passphrase, ssh will use the ssh-agent provided credentials to connect with remote servers.
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:14:44 GMT):<br/>
let me try
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:14:46 GMT):<br/>
haha
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:15:34 GMT):<br/>
ssh-add -K "the pid?"
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:16:04 GMT):<br/>
no. your key.
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:16:22 GMT):<br/>
then what is the usage of eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:16:31 GMT):<br/>
it start a agent.
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:16:39 GMT):<br/>
thz
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:17:35 GMT):<br/>
ssh-add -K "this should be the file path"?
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:17:36 GMT):<br/>
haha
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:17:41 GMT):<br/>
i am so stupid
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:18:25 GMT):<br/>
say your key is named and place here ~/.ssh/mykey
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:18:47 GMT):<br/>
then you do ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/mykey, it will ask you the passphrase.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:19:02 GMT):<br/>
after that you will be able to simply just do this
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:19:08 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:19:13 GMT):<br/>
``` ssh user@ip_address```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:19:21 GMT):<br/>
you will get logged in.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:19:42 GMT):<br/>
ansible agent just does that. only thing it can not do is it can not start your agent.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:20:55 GMT):<br/>
here is what I normally do
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:21:00 GMT):<br/>
```eval `ssh-agent -s`
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/fd```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:21:06 GMT):<br/>
fd is my key.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:21:34 GMT):<br/>
private key of course.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:21:50 GMT):<br/>
the public key should have been on your machine that you try to remotely access.
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:22:49 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:23:06 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:23:48 GMT):<br/>
just miss understand it will get the path from private_key

=m=
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:24:09 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:35:09 GMT):<br/>
seem working now!
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:35:14 GMT):<br/>
thz @tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:55:07 GMT):<br/>
after setup i suppose can access my k8s in (domain:8080/api)??
</p>
<p><strong>ctyu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 03:55:18 GMT):<br/>
i mean setup ansible?

@harsha @baohua seems cello 0.8.0-alpha is not followed the release process.. I see cello release tag is 0.8.0-alpha, but I see VERSION=0.8.0 and IS_RELEASE = false in cello makefile https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/Makefile#L35
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 13:12:34 GMT):<br/>
When you create a release tag, you have to make sure IS_RELEASE=true and you have to create the release tag mentioned in the Makefile.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 13:13:06 GMT):<br/>
I see Docker tag has been pushed like this because of the IS_RELEASE = false https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/cello-mongo/tags/
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 13:43:10 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Agree with you. 
@baohua We should update the flags accordingly as pointed out.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 14:21:42 GMT):<br/>
yes, @harsha let's update the doc and the dockerfiles for the releases. I look forward to seeing we can follow the new process for the v0.8.0 release.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 14:25:13 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc looks like that your server can not find where golang is. I had that issue when I was in Lisbon. For some reason the Europe countries have different location for downloading go, if you are in us, then this should not be an issue. You need to verify if your server can access that location.

@harsha I have captured fabric release process here https://github.com/hyperledger/ci-management/blob/master/docs/Release_Process.md.. required some fine tuning to this but that's the overall process

@harsha thank you so I'll try to walk through it did I miss it Cello dashboard should be integrated bu when i do deploy the AWS cluster there is no dashboard 
</p>
<p><strong>gesaleh</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 10:56:32 GMT):<br/>
how do you link both I installed dashboard on another instance 
</p>
<p><strong>gesaleh</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 11:25:26 GMT):<br/>
can you clarify when i do the awsansible cluster deployment it is only fabric (3 instances AWS) it doesn't deploy any of the dashboard, cmposer, explorer 
</p>
<p><strong>gesaleh</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 11:26:02 GMT):<br/>
but i can add these on another instance or one of the 3 instance it is not clear in the docs how you hook between these elements

On AWS cloud::
1. make changes to vars/aws.yml according to your aws cloud
2. export AWS_SECRET_KEY="your secret key of your aws account"
3. To stand up the fabric network::
    ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml

    ansible-playbook -e "mode=destroy" aws.yml

@DarshanBc If you can allocate a block of time, then we can work together on this.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:17:29 GMT):<br/>
I am on US East coast. The information you provided is not enough for me to go on. need to know if you have successfully created VMs on AWS, if they can communicate, if the overlay network is ok. The message you posted there does not really tell me much.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:20:46 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc from your earlier message, it seems to me that you are having trouble to get golang packages. not sure why, but you can setup apache2 very easily to host golang package. you can download the golang package and placed on your apache2 server, then use the url in your configuration file, doing that is to pass the golang download issue. I do not know why you are having trouble to do that. I know that in Europe countries, golang download sites get redirected somehow.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:21:13 GMT):<br/>
any way, allocate a block of time which I can attend, then we can go step by step.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:25:30 GMT):<br/>
@hightall @baohua please review this, it is to make changes according to the recent fabric changes in capabilities. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17103/
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:26:51 GMT):<br/>
@tongli capacity is introduced in fabric 1.1, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:27:37 GMT):<br/>
@baohua that is right, 1.1 need the capabilities in the configtx file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:27:46 GMT):<br/>
without it, chaincode wont instantiate.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:28:29 GMT):<br/>
the added code will detect if the code level is above 1.1 (version_compare), if it is, then it will add the capabilities, otherwise, as before.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:28:35 GMT):<br/>
it will work for all levels.
</p>
<p><strong>gesaleh</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:28:43 GMT):<br/>
@harsha ok i restarted docker with 2375 but it doesn't see any of the cluster chain i can add the host 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:28:49 GMT):<br/>
yes, and now 1.1-alpha has not been released, so i'm afraid we do not have the official code to test the feature?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:29:14 GMT):<br/>
we are using the head to test.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:30:00 GMT):<br/>
if you are using ansible agent, you can set a commit level to test every commit.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:32:28 GMT):<br/>
i hope there will be documentation to guide users for that, certainly can be added later.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:33:42 GMT):<br/>
we need a bit documentation to explain the yaml configuration file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:33:49 GMT):<br/>
let me create a jira issue for that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:33:56 GMT):<br/>
will add

more i read the docs more it is confusing : you provide ansible aws that deploy a clsuter of 3 (I assume this are workers) then when i check the docker is running normally with all instance but it is not running on 2375 port , if i change this to that port i can add the host at the master node but still it doesn't see the fabric chains , why it is not a discovery mode

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=5LfoWRaNhx2HYjoLP) @tongli Hi let me explain : 
I wanted to deploy a cluster on aws : i used ansible aws that deployed 3 instances with blockchain , then looking at cello i thought i'll have access to dashboard to see my instances and chain 
this wasn't the case since docker with ansible aws doesn't listen on 2375 port 
i thought these instances are workers and when i bring the master cello it should see the workers 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:22:19 GMT):<br/>
@gesaleh ansible agent does not currently support cello dashboard.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:22:45 GMT):<br/>
@gesaleh it sets up the multiple node cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>gesaleh</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:37:11 GMT):<br/>
ok it is clear
</p>
<p><strong>gesaleh</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:37:39 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  but i can do the same manually from cello dashboard right ?
</p>
<p><strong>gesaleh</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:38:03 GMT):<br/>
and ansible cluster i can deploy on top explorer composer or marbles right 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:38:35 GMT):<br/>
right. you can use command line tools to do these things.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:38:50 GMT):<br/>
but the organizations will be different.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:39:22 GMT):<br/>
using the ansible agent deploys the organizations and many peers and orderers based on vars/bc1st.yml file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:39:33 GMT):<br/>
you may change that and redeploy.
</p>
<p><strong>gesaleh</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:39:58 GMT):<br/>
ok so if i chnage that bc1st to have other org 
</p>
<p><strong>gesaleh</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:40:16 GMT):<br/>
and then deploy on top of it composer explorer or marbles 
</p>
<p><strong>gesaleh</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:40:31 GMT):<br/>
in fact i want to test creating chaincode on the fly if possible
</p>
<p><strong>gesaleh</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:40:48 GMT):<br/>
like a new smartcontract needed i can add it to the chain
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:49:31 GMT):<br/>
sure. you can do that against that cluster.

@Amir you can ssh to your own host manually and see if you can do that. if you can do that, then the script will be able to do that.

@Amir what is the command you run to produce that error? I am pretty sure you did not change the something in that file.
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 23:47:25 GMT):<br/>
the error was from this command 'ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=vb" initcluster.yml --skip-tags="resetconn" ' I followed the example from here  (http://hyperledger-cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ansible-agent-all-in-one) 
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 23:48:44 GMT):<br/>
I also checked the "run/runhosts" file it contains my IP, which is correct I assume 
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Sat, 27 Jan 2018 00:07:24 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I think the error was my user name, in /var/vb.yml it expects user name "ubuntu", I was trying with root. when I change the value  ssh_user: "ubuntu", to root it seems working. Thank you for the help

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 01:20:01 GMT):<br/>
@tongli would u like to keep the fabric 1.0.0 support, together with the coming 1.1.0 release? people are possible to use 1.0.0 release for quite a while until the 1.1.x become stable.

Hello, I have an issues with my running cello setup, I have a setup of a master node and two worker nodes.  Whenever I create a chain the health column in the dashboard indicates "Fail" while the status indicates "running". what does the health indicates ? And I tried to see the containers created for this chain. If I used a solo consensus plugin all containers are UP (still the health shows fail) but when I use kafka the peer nodes are always on restarting mode. docker logs command for these containers shows the following error   `error when setting up MSP from directory /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp: err Could not load a valid signer certificate from directory /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp/signcerts, err stat /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp/signcerts: no such file or directory`

@baohua Hi, I'm planning to use Cello to deploy Fabric on a Kubernetes cluster. Can you share the status of k8s support? The document at http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/#worker-node says "Currently we support Docker Host or Swarm Cluster as Worker Node. More types will be added soon." Does this mean it does not support k8s at this point?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 01:15:59 GMT):<br/>
@tkueda the support of k8s is via ansible now, and you may would like to read `docs/setup_worker_ansible.md`.

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 04:05:43 GMT):<br/>
you can log in to these machines and see what went wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 04:05:57 GMT):<br/>
I suggest that you do this first.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 04:06:23 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -vvv -i run/runhosts -e "mode=destroy env=azure env_type=flanneld ansible_ssh_user=hyperchain" initcluster.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 04:06:34 GMT):<br/>
notice the mode is now destroy.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 04:06:40 GMT):<br/>
which will actually do some cleanup.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 04:07:00 GMT):<br/>
I suspect that you have run this thing many times, you may have some bad data or files somewhere.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 04:07:09 GMT):<br/>
try run that command first,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 04:07:15 GMT):<br/>
then run your apply command.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 04:07:59 GMT):<br/>
before you run these commands, you can ssh to one of the machines and run this command to see what went wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 04:08:12 GMT):<br/>
```sudo systemctl status flanneld```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 04:08:23 GMT):<br/>
that command should give you some hint what was wrong with the services.

Hey @tongli  if we have multiple computers and we have ip address of all these computers and all these computers can ping each other. In such cases we need to define those ip address in runhost file and then run that file using ansible right ?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:03:32 GMT):<br/>
yeah. make sure that you have python installed onto these machines since ansible rely on python for tasks.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:03:57 GMT):<br/>
and make sure these machines can use a ssh key for ssh communication.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:04:27 GMT):<br/>
you will need to do this once ssh public key is setup correctly on these machines.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:04:41 GMT):<br/>
```eval $(ssh-agent -s)```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:04:55 GMT):<br/>
ssh-add your-private-key file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:05:18 GMT):<br/>
you will need to do this before you run initcluster.yml and setupfabric.yml playbooks.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:09:45 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid see the msg above.

<p><strong>saeedi</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:12:08 GMT):<br/>
Hey @tongli What does fabric deployed by cello, comprises of ? I mean in terms of peers, orderer, kafka or ca etc
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:13:35 GMT):<br/>
@saeedi cello ansible agent is a tool to stand up fabric network from zero to a working fabric network. It can provision VM from clouds such as AWS or OpenStack, then build, deploy fabric onto these nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:13:58 GMT):<br/>
@saeedi you can choose deploy onto existing VM or physical servers as well.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:15:26 GMT):<br/>
but with existing servers regardless VM or physical machines, you will need to do a bit extra work before you run the ansible playbooks. these tasks include setup ssh-agent on the ansible controller which is two lines of code and inject your public ssh key onto the servers which you will use
</p>
<p><strong>saeedi</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:18:22 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  Thanks :-) 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:20:48 GMT):<br/>
let me know if you have any questions.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:20:58 GMT):<br/>
will be happy to take you through the process.
</p>
<p><strong>saeedi</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:22:13 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  Yes sure. Thanks a lot. I will be starting with *aws* and then move to physical machines without use of cloud. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:22:28 GMT):<br/>
yeah. using aws is the easiest.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:22:54 GMT):<br/>
basically change few things in vars/aws.yml and vars/bc1st.yml file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:23:01 GMT):<br/>
then fire it up by doing this
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:23:23 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:23:39 GMT):<br/>
at the end you should have a working fabric cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>saeedi</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:24:38 GMT):<br/>
Oh okay . Thanks a lot. 
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:25:13 GMT):<br/>
@saeedi  Also I have added basic explanation of some main files related to aws deployment incase you need it

I have been following your work also and waiting for your next post regarding cello:smiley:
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:28:20 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I am extremely sorry for delay. My startup is incubated in local accelerator so I was busy in that. I will complete in this coming weekend :)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:28:34 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid good instructions.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:29:09 GMT):<br/>
currently we need to document to explain both vars/aws.yml and vars/bc1st.yml, I wonder if you can take that task?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:29:14 GMT):<br/>
the jira issue is here.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:30:17 GMT):<br/>
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-253
</p>
<p><strong>saeedi</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:30:32 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid looking forward to that. :-) 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:30:49 GMT):<br/>
currently we need a document to detail what each field means in these two type of files
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:31:14 GMT):<br/>
cloud/env configuration file such as vars/aws.yml vars/os.yml.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:31:49 GMT):<br/>
fabric network configuration file such as vars/bc1st.yml, vars/bc2nd.yml and vars/vb1st.yml.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:32:33 GMT):<br/>
each run needs two configuration files to specify how you want to layout your fabric network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:33:05 GMT):<br/>
I had a doc before, for some reason, the doc was removed, but the content is now out dated. we need update anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:33:21 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid @saeedi any of you like to take that challenge?
</p>
<p><strong>saeedi</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:36:55 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I would love to, me and @MohammadObaid can work together on it. I am a newbie so i believe it will be a good learning experience as well.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:37:54 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:38:37 GMT):<br/>
I will take a look in this coming weekend . Is that ok or their is urgency ? 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:38:38 GMT):<br/>
in that case, can you login to jira to change the owner to you two?

@tongli I have one more general question, is it possible to combine *cello* and *composer*, i mean deploying *business network archive* on network deployed using cello ?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:25:14 GMT):<br/>
@saeedi I am not familiar with composer. cello standup a fabric network. if composer is to add apps on top of the fabric network, I do not see why it can not.

I restructured quite bit to make things a bit more efficient. and also allow cello go get the artifacts such as binaries and images from any docker hub regardless it is docker hub or a third party hub or a local hub. only needs to be configured in the configuration file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 03:41:44 GMT):<br/>

@baohua the baseimage_tag is for downloading docker images for peer, orderer images, it is not the base image to build other images. It is a bit confusing but since it has been used since day one of the project, it will cause a lot of changes so I kept it. It is not the base image tag 0.4.5

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 14:34:38 GMT):<br/>
@Darumada looks like you can not ssh to the hosts. can you manually ssh to any of the hosts after you saw the errors?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 14:35:43 GMT):<br/>
if you already uses the ssh agent, the only thing I can think of maybe the hosts do not have the public key? If you are doing this on AWS, then these keys should have been injected automatically.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=Bmaw9qe9QLKy2Lpyj) @baohua Makes sense. The documentation says 1.0. Does that include 1.05 for instance?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:31:48 GMT):<br/>
@FiratSertgoz the ansible script has a role called setupcerts , you can take a look there.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:32:33 GMT):<br/>
in the role, cryptogen is called to generate all certificates and keys for all parties.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:33:48 GMT):<br/>
@william123 if you want to have a taste of 1.1 now, you can use latest ansible agent to build everything off of the master, then ansible agent can help you stand up a fabric network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:34:22 GMT):<br/>
It won’t be 1.1 but it will be using the latest fabric code.

<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:44:29 GMT):<br/>
but I can’t create a chain in cello dashboard, when I create the chain the health status shows fail  
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:44:51 GMT):<br/>
can someone help me please, I'm stacked with this for few days now 
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:47:31 GMT):<br/>
I tried to find the source of the error, from the log output (make logs) I saw that `[cluster.py:802       refresh_health()] - check MY--WORKE-IP:8150 result 111`  which is not returning _0_ making the status fail 
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:48:29 GMT):<br/>
but from the worker node, using `netstat` I can see that port 8150 is open

Hi guys. I have some question, can you help me?
With Cello user dashboard, we can Install and Instantiate smart contract (.go file) to chain. Can we do the same with bna file that generated by Hyperledger Composer? How can we do that? Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>fiendster</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 04:52:46 GMT):<br/>
Composer generator only create .go file for cto and some system struct, don't create code for transaction

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=a4BnkWQquqk68pMmB) In case someone have the same problem, I resolved this issue as follows   
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Sun, 04 Feb 2018 10:58:57 GMT):<br/>
After setting up everything correctly whenever I create a chain from the operator-dashboard the health status was always on “fail”. It seems that the container providing explorer service was not responding. 
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Sun, 04 Feb 2018 10:59:06 GMT):<br/>
 I resolved the issue by removing `sleep 30;` command from  (src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0/local/fabric-solo-4.yaml) under the section of explorer.

it makes the health is FAIL.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=AJ2geLaXrrXndsyzT) @Norberthu can you post the log, specifically the output generated  while you create the chain (for my case I used the Makefile to setup the master and worker nodes as shown here (http://hyperledger-cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_master/). I can see the logs by running `make logs` from the master node). If you can post the log it may help to see why the health is failing, Also as Baohua pointed there is ongoing work to change health check logs hopefully the update may fix such issues

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:34:09 GMT):<br/>
you may notice that we have more cello images at https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/?.
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:34:36 GMT):<br/>
Agreed.
</p>
<p><strong>lujiang</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:47:42 GMT):<br/>
@harsha changed according to your comment, thanks! https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/17577 
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:51:29 GMT):<br/>
@baohua Any CE for v0.8.0 ?
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:51:29 GMT):<br/>
@baohua Any JIRA numbe for v0.8.0-beta release ?
</p>
<p><strong>lujiang</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:57:51 GMT):<br/>
@harsha for https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17575/ , do you mean we can use git tag as docker image tag? there is no change for baseimage and user-dashboard, just need to create docker tag?
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 15:02:37 GMT):<br/>
@baohua Would be manually creating the tag in docker-hub space, and link it to https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/dockerhub/baseimage/Dockerfile . So we may not need to create baseimage for each and every release.
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 15:02:37 GMT):<br/>
yes and @baohua Would be manually creating the tag in docker-hub space, and link it to https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/dockerhub/baseimage/Dockerfile . So we may not need to create baseimage for each and every release.

hello! i believe this is the right place to ask this question... I am currently working on a project with Hyperledger Composer, which runs on top of Fabric. I should be able to orchestrate a blockchain with Cello, right? If so, is there any tutorial out there??? I am very lost here...

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=8MumXwbmjAR4Fup6c) @pacoard you can start from this doc http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 21:43:45 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @hightall as I have promised, I reworked this document heavily to document the ansible agent. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17607/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 21:44:22 GMT):<br/>
I reworked the most of the content so that the document will be easy to follow. Please review. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 00:16:51 GMT):<br/>
great, documentation is very important, thanks! @tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 00:17:40 GMT):<br/>
@pacoard if composer can connect to an existing chain, then it will be easy. cello boots up fabric chains, and then expose the services port for usage.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 01:30:53 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @hightall please take a look at the patch when you have few minutes. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17607
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 01:42:08 GMT):<br/>
will do today, it's a bit long to read through....
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 02:24:59 GMT):<br/>
it is a long document and trying to be very thorough.

cello-operator-dashboard | Compose does not use swarm mode to deploy services to multiple nodes in a swarm. All containers will be scheduled on the current node.
cello-operator-dashboard | 
cello-operator-dashboard | To deploy your application across the swarm, use `docker stack deploy`.


[ All containers will be scheduled on the current node.]  --> Is that ture ?

@yoyokeen can u help paste the steps to reproduce the problem? e.g., following http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING/, 1. git clone 2. blabla.... 3. Problem happens!

Hey @tongli  before runnning ansible scrirpt we need to generate key pair from aws and use their name in aws configuation file right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 15:42:16 GMT):<br/>
no. actually you can simply generate ssh key pair from your ansible controller, ansible will upload and create, then inject into vm automatically

I was testing the ansible  agent on three separate physical machines (1 for ansible controller and the other two for fabric network). I setup the ssh keys and created manually the `run/runhosts` file and started the `setupfabric.yml` playbook as `ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=vb1st" setupfabric.yml`  but the play book stacks on `TASK [Pull certificates from the builder machine]` just hangs there no error or warning

</p>
<p><strong>lujiang</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 02:56:41 GMT):<br/>
and one more concern about your comment on "we may not need dockerhub/engine/Dockerfile & dockerhub/engine/requirements.txt", I might think they are used for latest tag 
</p>
<p><strong>lujiang</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 02:59:37 GMT):<br/>
and the dockerfile used for latest tag image, I think we don't need to specify the baseimage tag, see dockerhub/mongo/Dockerfile, we need to remove "x86_64-0.8.0-alpha" in line 1 : FROM hyperledger/cello-baseimage:x86_64-0.8.0-alpha
</p>

@baohua need your comment
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 03:01:07 GMT):<br/>
Sounds reasonable to me. besides, do we need some separate  `latest` dir under `dockerhub` to make it more clear?

<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 14:50:34 GMT):<br/>
@lujiang We should always publish the built docker-images on release branch. The master branch can be built locally on the machine. The reason `latest tag` in dockerhub namespace should rather be pointing towards newly cut branch as opposed to master branch, given the default nature of `docker github automated build` it always publish new docker images unless turned off for every potential merge into master code, which results in unnecessary publishing of docker images. As `cello-baseimage:RELEASE_TAG` is built first and components like mongo,nginx leverage `cello-baseimage:RELEASE_TAG` and build on top of this.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sat, 10 Feb 2018 10:04:14 GMT):<br/>
@harsha the reason we use docker image in dockerhub is to save the effort of building images locally by users. So the latest tag can safely point to the latest code at master branch, to allow users to quickly pull down and start to use cello. does this make sense?

<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Sat, 10 Feb 2018 17:21:02 GMT):<br/>
@baohua , et al, I do not disagree with the approach, however I feel we should not let experimental or WIP features get exposed and published in dockerhub, rather let users build/compile them locally unless those features are thoroughly tested and published in release-based approach to dockerhub. Also latest tag only points to x86 images, and since manifest aren't in place this would pull x86 images onto non-x86 platform. However i wouldn't mind publishing other way around too (ie latest tag pointing to latest code on master branch)

@harsha @lujiang  `non-x86` cannot be supported by dockerhub today, hence we need to use other workarounds. For x86 one, let's use dockerhub to help users avoid local building (developers might wanna build locally, but as far as i know, other users just wanna a open-box-to-user solution).

@hightall about your https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17761/ patch I have a question
 we hard code the FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE on fabric1.0-solo.yaml(https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0/fabric-solo-4.yaml) so far, if we allow crypto-config directory generating dynamically, the CAs will totally break away the chain of trust, because the CA won't find the hard code private key file and will generate a brand new pair of pub/prv keys.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=iQ2JmkuRYGsGLwX2u) @Amir This method didn't work. The docker log indicated the following error "python: can't open file 'dashboard.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory". Anyone know the reason?
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 07:39:06 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen Yes, If we dynamic generate crypto-config, then when compose start docker, the CA_KEYFILE will use env from operator dashboard, that will be dynamic variable, and the user-dashboard will also do that, and develop can download crypto-config files for development

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=nQmbcEHXZz2X4Qep8) @zsmartc I'm now having the same issue and `make redeploy service=SERVICE_NAME` is not resolving it. I'm trying to do diagnosis it, I will let you know if I have something and please let me know if you resolve it too.  any one having the same issue ?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 07:52:27 GMT):<br/>
@hightall Thanks, I explained my concern because I am working on hyperledger/composer intergration, which is strongly relative to fabric-ca.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 07:54:06 GMT):<br/>
@Amir have you clean up the /opt/cello dir on your worker node?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 07:54:58 GMT):<br/>
@Amir maybe try to clean up /opt/cello on your master node first.

@baohua baohua, what would you like me to update cello on at LA?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 12:37:05 GMT):<br/>
i think maybe u can help share the latest release/feature/progress, and help encourage more developers to use and join develop.  As a provision and operational management tool, we wanna help community adopt and manage blockchain techniques in more efficient way.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 12:37:48 GMT):<br/>
any good idea from ur side?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 13:35:30 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17783/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:27:22 GMT):<br/>
@baohua same goal here. Thinking if we can integrate cello dashboard (chain management UI) with k8s dashboard.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:27:34 GMT):<br/>
if we can do that, it will be really exciting.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:28:04 GMT):<br/>
yeap, l remember there's a jira issue related to it
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:28:17 GMT):<br/>
we hope can have it in v0.9
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:28:46 GMT):<br/>
yeah. if you can give me a list of things I would be really happy to get in front of the people giving the updates.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:28:51 GMT):<br/>
we got 20 minutes I think.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:28:53 GMT):<br/>
Seems we need enhance our frontend dev team, lots of work to do with the dashboard recently.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:29:04 GMT):<br/>
aha, a quick sync talk
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:29:36 GMT):<br/>
@tongli as maintainer, one special responsibility is to help more people to join to contribute and adopt.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:30:14 GMT):<br/>
right agreed.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:30:56 GMT):<br/>
I very much like to have ansible agent as part of the docker image, so that people can simply start up the cello image, then they can start running the playbooks.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:31:27 GMT):<br/>
one of the issues that people have is to setup ansible env. 90% of the times people stumbled on that.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:32:01 GMT):<br/>
yes, we should hide those efforts to make it easy for people to use cello.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:32:32 GMT):<br/>
if the cello image includes the ansible env, then people do not have to do that part, they can simply use pre-canned configurations or update the configuration,they will only have to deal with the configuration files, then it is a go.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:32:39 GMT):<br/>
big advantage doing that.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:33:19 GMT):<br/>
you mean those ansible play-books at Master node?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:34:35 GMT):<br/>
yes, I mean that the cello image you guys have been working on, we can have ansible and dependency installed into,
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:34:51 GMT):<br/>
the entire `src` is included in the latest baseimage now
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:35:07 GMT):<br/>
which is also the base for most cello service images
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:35:10 GMT):<br/>
right. src is included but with no ansible runtime, right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:35:30 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. we are building multiple cello images?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:35:42 GMT):<br/>
I thought there is just one for everything.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:36:06 GMT):<br/>
oh, you wanna install the ansible env into the engine image? I think it should be ok.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:36:27 GMT):<br/>
yeap, there are images for different services
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:36:53 GMT):<br/>
we hope to make the future deployment to be easy to extend to distributed env.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:36:53 GMT):<br/>
we hope to allow the future deployment easy to extend to distributed env.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:37:33 GMT):<br/>
I am a bit concerned on making so many images, then people will have to choose which one to use etc.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:37:53 GMT):<br/>
that normally creates a lot of confusions.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:38:30 GMT):<br/>
but if that is the direction cello community likes to go, I can live with.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:40:14 GMT):<br/>
oh, that is because we got several service components now. keep a single image for each component make it easy to deploy actually, and more `micro-service`.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:40:51 GMT):<br/>
just like fabric, have several images for peer, orderer, ca....
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:40:52 GMT):<br/>
that is probably true, but requires people knows a bit more.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:41:14 GMT):<br/>
yes, i also update the doc to introduce those images
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:41:44 GMT):<br/>
the initial goal of using docker images is to allow people avoid provision efforts of using cello
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:43:01 GMT):<br/>
right, that I agree and I think it is a good idea, I was thinking the same thing.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:46:45 GMT):<br/>
yeap, since it's just introduced. pls help test the provision and documentation, to make sure that even beginners can successfully boot up cello to use easily.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:49:15 GMT):<br/>
@baohua good deal. back to the update items. please send me few lines so that I can emphasize when I give the updates.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:49:38 GMT):<br/>
or simply paste them here so that others can also have some knowledge.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:49:56 GMT):<br/>
you can find the highlights at https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/releases/tag/v0.8.0-alpha
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:50:23 GMT):<br/>
And after that, mostly we are working on enabling the docker images
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:50:32 GMT):<br/>
and bug fixes

Hello, guys. I have managed to deploy a fabric network with ansible-k8s-aws configuration. The next step for me is to somehow connect my local NodeSDK client to the network. However, I could not find a way to expose the ports of kubernetes. Is there a way to do this in the ansible configs or would it be wiser for me to just ditch k8s and go docker-host?
Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 15:41:50 GMT):<br/>
@FiratSertgoz when you use k8s to setup fabric network, you already have all the peers and orderers setup as k8s services.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 15:42:24 GMT):<br/>
these ports are already exposed. you should be able to see these services on your  k8s dashboard

the last push, which makes the production mode true i.e `DEV=False`,  uses `docker-compose.yml` and it doesn't allow access to operator-dashboard. when I use `docker-compose-dev.yml` by changing  `DEV=True` I can access the operator dashboard.

Folks!
Where can I find information about how to deploy fabric with CA server in cluster mode? I'm using ansible.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 20:51:04 GMT):<br/>
@krabradosty  if you are using ansible agent, and the default configuration file, you probably already have ca servers running. :-)
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 20:52:15 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Yes, but not in cluster mode
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 20:53:00 GMT):<br/>
are you setting up fabric network using src/agent/ansible playbooks?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 20:53:15 GMT):<br/>
if you are doing that, then ca should have been setup for you.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 20:53:28 GMT):<br/>
if not, then I do not know how to add ca.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 20:53:59 GMT):<br/>
by default, it gets you a 3 nodes fabric cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 20:59:31 GMT):<br/>
I thought it's a three CA of different organizations. Not a cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 21:00:50 GMT):<br/>
Can I configure CA to use not default DB as described here: http://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html#configuring-the-database ?

Q about the ansible playbook: The baseline Ubuntu 16.04 image that we default to doesn't include python2 by default anymore, only python3. I've tested the playbook and it works fine with python3 as long as you install `pip3` via apt, and tell ansible to use Ubuntu's `python3` binary

Should I A) Update the docs to mention this and leave it as-is B) Update the scripts to expect python3 C) Explicitly install python2 via apt?

Q about the ansible playbook: The baseline Ubuntu 16.04 image that we default to for fabric nodes doesn't include python2 by default anymore, only python3. I've tested the playbook and it works fine with python3 as long as you install `pip3` via apt, and tell ansible to use Ubuntu's `python3` binary

@tongli Well, when i check my kubernetes services on dashboard, I only see internal endpoints set, the external endpoints don't exist. Also when i cUrl the public ip address of the server with the port of the peer lets say i cant access.

<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Wed, 14 Feb 2018 14:06:28 GMT):<br/>
Hi team.. how does cello achieve multi-tenancy is it on chaincode level or on peer level ?
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Wed, 14 Feb 2018 14:07:07 GMT):<br/>
I mean on a same set of peers we start diff channels or different peers altogether when we want to deploy a new chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 03:53:10 GMT):<br/>
@AshishMishra 1 i guess this multi-tenancy is depending on the fabric features, and cello doesn't add any limitation to that.
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 06:50:30 GMT):<br/>
@baohua , I 'm not looking for the limitation but want to understand how cello is achieving multi tenancy. It can either do at chaincode level, where I 've diff chaincodes and channels for diff tenants but being served by the same peer or else I can spin new peers altogether so I 'm achieving multi-tenancy on container level. 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 06:52:35 GMT):<br/>
Not really, cello now provides two roles. 1) `operator`: that can manage the networks, and 2) `users`: that use a single fabric network to run chaincodes. Within the same network, there's no further tenancy roles.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 06:52:35 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 06:58:19 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @baohua . If I understood correctly so multi-tenancy is done on the chaincode or channel level only. So, when I deploy a new chaincode, I also have to fill chaincode size, which means on how many peers it will install the chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 06:59:15 GMT):<br/>
if you wanna install a cc to a peer, need to explicitly specify the peer address in SDK.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 10:34:33 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc aha, seems your question is about fabric: what these credentials be used, i would like to suggest you take a look at the doc here: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/build_network.html
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 10:39:59 GMT):<br/>
@baohua I have used hyperledger-Fabric in normal single host environment but setup of orga,orgb,orgc,orgd is unlike Fabric I am not able to find this folder /crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/example.com in allcerts.tgz that is present in builder machine apart from that all the files are similar to files under cryptoconfig/ in fabric
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 11:41:38 GMT):<br/>
which `allcerts.tgz`?
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 12:26:55 GMT):<br/>
`/opt/gopath/bc1st/fabric` in builder machine
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 12:27:43 GMT):<br/>
I think  its not using certs to bringup orderer
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 12:31:24 GMT):<br/>
is there any particular reason why its not used ?
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 12:39:00 GMT):<br/>
I see that  this parameter is not included    ``` - ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_PRIVATEKEY=/etc/hyperledger/crypto/orderer/tls/server.key
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/etc/hyperledger/crypto/orderer/tls/server.crt
      - ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ROOTCAS=[/etc/hyperledger/crypto/orderer/tls/ca.crt, /etc/hyperledger/crypto/peerOrg1/tls/ca.crt, /etc/hyperledger/crypto/peerOrg2/tls/ca.crt]```
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 12:41:14 GMT):<br/>
if it needs to be included how can this be added since all the peers are distributed in network ```- ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ROOTCAS=[/etc/hyperledger/crypto/orderer/tls/ca.crt, /etc/hyperledger/crypto/peerOrg1/tls/ca.crt, /etc/hyperledger/crypto/peerOrg2/tls/ca.crt]```

Hello again, I have found a way to expose the K8s services outside the cluster by using Nodeports and I got it working. However, even after I placed all the required certificates ( I am using tls) I am still getting SSL errors when I am trying to connect to the peers from my NodeSDK application. I am guessing it has something to do with the hostnames of the peers. When working with AWS should I be pointing the hostnames as the clusterIPs or the publicIPs given by EC2. Thanks

Hello, I'm deploying using `Makefile` as shown here (http://hyperledger-cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_master/). the deployment works fine and all services are running but the operator dashboard is not accessible, even if the docker providing that service is up and running. any idea why ?

And you can start up one in 3 steps: 
```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/yeasy/docker-compose-files.git
2. cd hyperledger_fabric/v1.0.5
3. HLF_MODE=be make start
```

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:48:32 GMT):<br/>
@Menniti if you have followed the steps in that doc, please tell me where you stuck.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:49:13 GMT):<br/>
@baohua that is based on that the fabric network is up running?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:49:23 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:49:54 GMT):<br/>
BE is a query tool that allows u query some basic info for a running fabric network using the sdk.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:50:15 GMT):<br/>
it cannot allow to operate the network, neither with the chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:50:30 GMT):<br/>
@tongli 

The step is: Stand up the fabric network

comands

ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=vb" initcluster.yml --skip-tags="resetconn"
    ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=bc2nd" setupfabric.yml
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:50:45 GMT):<br/>
read there again, i realize maybe i need to config the ssh
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:50:57 GMT):<br/>
reconfig or adjust the path
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:51:40 GMT):<br/>
@Menniti yeah, make sure that you can connect to the ssh manually, simply do command like this.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:51:57 GMT):<br/>
```ssh youruser@192.168.0.6```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:52:12 GMT):<br/>
if that is failing, you know that you did not even have ssh going.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:52:22 GMT):<br/>
that will not make you going far.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:53:39 GMT):<br/>
to diagnose, can use `ssh -v HOST_IP`, which will output more debug info.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:53:39 GMT):<br/>
to diagnose, can use `ssh -v USER@HOST_IP`, which will output more debug info.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:54:13 GMT):<br/>
@baohua if I stand up fabric network using ansible agent, how can I start using explorer?
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 13:33:14 GMT):<br/>
@tongli thank you very much, it is not working.. I will figure out and try to solve that

<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 15:00:05 GMT):<br/>
@harsha There is nothing interesting in the logs.  It seems if I go to localhost:80 I get the operator dashboard, but the tutorial says to use localhost:8080.  What am I missing?
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 15:18:57 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal I thought we get cello dashboard on 8081 per http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dashboard_user/#dashboard-for-user 
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 15:19:31 GMT):<br/>
And you can verify by looking at port forwarding on `docker ps -a`
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=ZxiLnkw4jrj9GGcoC) @toddinpal did you deploy using `Makefile`, like `make setup-master` in the master node ?
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:16:46 GMT):<br/>
I got the same issue while doing the same, and this seems an issue for me while using production mode. which uses by `default docker-compose.yml` to build the network. When I use `docker-compose-dev.yml` it is working fine

<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:20:12 GMT):<br/>
and to use `docker-compose-dev.yml` change `DEV` variable `True` in `cello/.makerc/operator-dashboard` file
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:33:06 GMT):<br/>
@Amir Yes, I used the makefile, make setup-master  and then make start
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:34:48 GMT):<br/>
OK, try this, change this line `DEV?=False` inside the file `cello/.makerc/operator-dashboard` to `DEV?=True` and do `make restart` in the master node

Is there anyone who is willing to demo Cello either via Skype or any other online means?
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 10:52:09 GMT):<br/>
Hi folks!
It is not clear to me from the documentation, can I bind master node with worker nodes that I deploy using ansible?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 13:44:35 GMT):<br/>
@paul.sitoh @hightall is preparing some video tutorial, hope that can help you later.
</p>
<p><strong>paul.sitoh</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 13:46:11 GMT):<br/>
Just need some primer to understand the basics for now. Hopefully from there we can pick up more knowledge by ourselves. At the moment, trying to guess what it does from source code is very painful
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:10:19 GMT):<br/>
@paul.sitoh sorry to hear that. have you had a look at http://cello.readthedocs.io/?
</p>
<p><strong>paul.sitoh</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:30:56 GMT):<br/>
I read it but I wasn't really sure what cello was supposed to achieve especially in relation to Fabric. For example, how does cello help in terms of 'consortium' based configuration. 
</p>
<p><strong>paul.sitoh</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:31:51 GMT):<br/>
Or is cello trying to solve another problem altogether?
</p>
<p><strong>paul.sitoh</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:32:47 GMT):<br/>
Or is it simply a container orchestrator with no reference to fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 19:03:40 GMT):<br/>
@paul.sitoh  This is my understanding of cello, anyone correct me if I’m wrong
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 19:03:46 GMT):<br/>
cello manages the infrastructure for blockchain network. i.e it provides the same view for blockchain network whatever the underlying system/server is. 

Assume you have a heterogeneous infrastructure (mix of physical and virtual servers/containers) and you want to build a blockchain network on top of these machines. You can manually configure each of them for your blockchain network or use cello and have the same view to create your blockchain network.  Plus additional features as described in the doc (hopefully more in the future)   

May be the best analogy will be if you take openstack for virtual machines cello is the same for blockchain networks (currently focused on Fabric)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=yEYbpHeYcpBuW6cny) @Amir Hi I can see the analogy to OpenStack. What I am not clear is how Cello can deal with the concept of Consortium based network in the context of Fabric. For example, in Fabric there is this concept of a participating organisation instantiating, for want of term, a Fabric instance (Peers, Orderers, CA) and as the lead organisation then invites another organisation to instantiate their own Fabric instance and then join the lead one to form a business network.

if you do not know what is the daemon url for a docker host, maybe can have a look at docker's documentation.

Are there instructions on how to use Cello with Swarm?
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 16:00:51 GMT):<br/>
@baohua Nice!! thank you for sharing, i will study a little more about docker.
Thankss
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sun, 25 Feb 2018 01:51:21 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal it supposes to be the similar way with docker, but i've not got chance to verify with the latest version yet. welcome for any feedbacks.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sun, 25 Feb 2018 01:52:30 GMT):<br/>
@Menniti sure. and blockchain is a very broad areas including several techniques. cello even has more like those container techniques, cloud computing and orchestration.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=s6G3acXZA4TBoMznH) @paul.sitoh as far as my understanding the main functionality of cello is one step lower than the fabric layer (i.e infrastructure level). The only thing cello can provide for the fabric layer (for the functionalities of HLF blockchain ) is a nice user interface to facilitate the things you listed.

whenever I run the awsk8s.yml file for the ansible cello agent I get to a point where I get this message UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Permission denied (publickey).\r\n", "unreachable": true}

<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 01:03:42 GMT):<br/>
does it have to have an ec2 key instead ?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=8ivihJRwx9dZ4Hdd8) @Dilip 25 yes the fabric deployment requires an ssh connection. If you are unable to connect using ssh, the deployment will fail  
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 02:31:44 GMT):<br/>
see that's the thing @Amir I can login via ssh to the ec2 instances created by the deployment
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 02:32:04 GMT):<br/>
it's just that the deployment fails for an unknown key error

<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 14:54:21 GMT):<br/>
Hey @tongli ... indeed I'm having the same issue above
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 14:54:41 GMT):<br/>
when buildinf fabric artifacts it seems that the builder instance does not have a public key

when building fabric artifacts it seems that the builder instance does not have a public key
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 14:55:45 GMT):<br/>
but when I check `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` after ssh'ing to the instance it says that it has my public key created in the VM controller instance from my laptop
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 14:56:06 GMT):<br/>
so maybe it's a key between instances ?
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 14:58:53 GMT):<br/>
at first I thought it might have been related to the fact that I was using a different username than `ubuntu` on my laptop's VM, but after changing it back to `ubuntu` stil didn't work as expected
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 16:44:31 GMT):<br/>
@Dilip 25 what env. do you have and how did you run the playbooks?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 16:45:02 GMT):<br/>
@Dilip 25 a bit more info can really help me to understand what you were trying to do and help you.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 17:33:46 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I did nothing more than installing ansible and hardcoded the AWS password in the aws.yml file for testing purposes
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 17:35:06 GMT):<br/>
could you provide me with a link to install it properly @tongli? because in your video you already have ansible installed
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 17:52:09 GMT):<br/>
@Dilip 25 this doc explains a lot and have step by step instructions on how to set up ansible. https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/worker_ansible_howto.md
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 17:52:51 GMT):<br/>
please take a look at the doc and ask specific questions such as how many nodes you like to create and what specific errors that you see when you run what commands.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:01:42 GMT):<br/>
thank you @tongli ! I just started a fresh VM and was using this as a reference http://hyperledger-cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ansible-agent-all-in-one/ but followed the same steps as the link you gave me so far, so now i'll switch to the github version
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:32:40 GMT):<br/>
you are following the all in one instruction?
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:32:59 GMT):<br/>
i'm following the https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/worker_ansible_howto.md#provision-the-servers link you provided 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:33:06 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, it seems to me that is not the case, you are doing 3 nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:33:24 GMT):<br/>
yup, i'm not doing the all in one, i'm doing the one you did in your video
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:33:33 GMT):<br/>
with fabric001 to fabric003
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:33:37 GMT):<br/>
ok.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:33:56 GMT):<br/>
so you have one VM as your ansible controller and trying to create 3 VMs to stand up fabric network?
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:34:13 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:34:33 GMT):<br/>
all 3 are currently running even after the error, but obviously can't access the builder k8s dashboard because of the error
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:34:39 GMT):<br/>
after that error, did you actually see any new VMs coming up from aws console?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:34:49 GMT):<br/>
ok.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:34:59 GMT):<br/>
did you start up your ssh-agent?
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:35:05 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:35:05 GMT):<br/>
on ansible controller?
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:35:30 GMT):<br/>
yup, it is running on the controller
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:35:44 GMT):<br/>
in that case, you can try to manually ssh to one of the server to test your ssh-agent.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:35:47 GMT):<br/>
do this.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:36:05 GMT):<br/>
```ssh ubuntu@54.89.133.106```
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:36:30 GMT):<br/>
i'm in
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:36:32 GMT):<br/>
if your ssh agent is running correctly, you should be able to do this from your ansible controller
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:36:43 GMT):<br/>
yup, I logged to fabric002
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:37:49 GMT):<br/>
good. good. actually I think you are following the right steps and setting up right stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:37:52 GMT):<br/>
the problem is this.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:38:23 GMT):<br/>
when you use a ubuntu 16.04 cloud image to create new VMs, there is a cloud-init script to install python during the provisioning step.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:39:05 GMT):<br/>
in many cases, the python installation does not finish after the machine is ready because apt install works in background.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:39:24 GMT):<br/>
to overcome this issue. you can do the following
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:39:39 GMT):<br/>
1. create a VM on your aws cloud using ubuntu 16.04 image
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:39:58 GMT):<br/>
2. once the VM is created, log in manually and do the following
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:40:05 GMT):<br/>
```apt update```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:40:14 GMT):<br/>
```apt install python```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:40:21 GMT):<br/>
then you can save that as an image.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:40:43 GMT):<br/>
all right
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:40:54 GMT):<br/>
a question though... VM as in EC2 instance ? 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:41:04 GMT):<br/>
yeah. EC2 instance.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:41:13 GMT):<br/>
oh okay, i'll do it right away
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:41:31 GMT):<br/>
once this is done, I am sure it will go as expected since all other steps are correct.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:41:59 GMT):<br/>
glad that you followed these steps.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:42:04 GMT):<br/>
by the way, should I use  that VM as the ansible controller instead of my local VM ?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:42:35 GMT):<br/>
the python issue is more serious now because ubuntu 17.10 was out for awhile, and any VM boots up, ubuntu will want to check updates and things and want you to upgrade.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:42:39 GMT):<br/>
this is a big headache.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:42:40 GMT):<br/>
or should I use it as a template for the fabric nodes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:43:16 GMT):<br/>
once you create an image, you will want to use that image to create all fabric nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:43:27 GMT):<br/>
change vars/aws/yml file to use your own image.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:43:37 GMT):<br/>
vars/aws.yml
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:43:53 GMT):<br/>
ooooohhh 
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:44:00 GMT):<br/>
now that makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:44:17 GMT):<br/>
i'll do it right away, thanks for taking the time so far @tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:44:19 GMT):<br/>
so that all the VMs will have python already in. you do not have to wait for anything.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:44:59 GMT):<br/>
I am planning to try using 17.10 but have no got time yet. but in any case, ansible requires python on the remote host, we will need python.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:45:58 GMT):<br/>
would this be okay @tongli ? http://prntscr.com/ik2lgw
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:46:09 GMT):<br/>
Canonical, Ubuntu, 16.04 LTS, amd64 xenial image build on 2018-01-26
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:49:07 GMT):<br/>
well, I think if you are doing this in aws, you will need to use a image that was provide as base to create your own new image which simply has python installed.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:49:18 GMT):<br/>
I have never tried to upload an image onto aws.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:49:47 GMT):<br/>
but 16.04 amd64 server is what we normally use.

<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:51:12 GMT):<br/>
so, I created the instance, ssh into it, install python then save it as a base for the fabric nodes, right ? 
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:51:21 GMT):<br/>
alright
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:51:57 GMT):<br/>
yeah. exactly.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:52:07 GMT):<br/>
that is how new images get created on aws.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:52:31 GMT):<br/>
you start with aws provided images.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:29:30 GMT):<br/>
okay so everything happened successfully
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:29:40 GMT):<br/>
only that I can't login to k8s dashboard on the fabric001 node
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:29:42 GMT):<br/>
@tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:30:23 GMT):<br/>
should be 35.153.103.169:8080/ui, right ? 
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:30:36 GMT):<br/>
(35.153.103.169 is the builder node as my log indicates)
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:31:17 GMT):<br/>
oh wait, provclusters.yml doesn't provide k8s dashboard
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:31:31 GMT):<br/>
I need to keep following the github tutorial I guess
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:32:27 GMT):<br/>
or destroy everything and run awsk8s.yml instead of provclusters.yml
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:34:03 GMT):<br/>
oh, cool.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:34:28 GMT):<br/>
the port is the https://<first nove ip>:32334
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:35:00 GMT):<br/>
@Dilip 25 if you want it to be really simple, destroy the 3 nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:35:04 GMT):<br/>
and run this one command
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:35:22 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" awsk8s.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:35:43 GMT):<br/>
but you will have to make sure that vars/aws.yml and vars/bc1st.yml are all correct.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:35:58 GMT):<br/>
that command is a short cut to have everything done in one command.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:36:11 GMT):<br/>
which has k8s setup and fabric installed.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:39:56 GMT):<br/>
alright lemme try that
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:39:59 GMT):<br/>
thanks @tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:45:34 GMT):<br/>
@Dilip 25 yeah, get rid of these 3 nodes first.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:45:47 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, it will create 3 more nodes and you will be paying a bit more.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:46:12 GMT):<br/>
the flavors that you choose should have 4 gb of memory
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:46:20 GMT):<br/>
the free tier is way too small.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:47:36 GMT):<br/>
yeah I did t2.medium 
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:47:43 GMT):<br/>
let's see if it works
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:50:55 GMT):<br/>
t2.medium is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:51:14 GMT):<br/>
btw I did a little modification to allow image_id instead of image_name... in cello/src/agent/ansible/roles/cloud_aws/prepare/tasks/apply.yml:22 change ami_name to ami_id then in vars/aws.yml change ami_name to ami_id
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:51:51 GMT):<br/>
because it's easier to point the AMI by id than by name
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:52:05 GMT):<br/>
that is fine. if these changes are necessary, u can propose a patch set.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:52:19 GMT):<br/>
so we can make the change in the repo and everyone can benefit.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:52:28 GMT):<br/>
yeah that's a good idea
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:52:38 GMT):<br/>
but you will have to make sure that we can do in either case.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:52:38 GMT):<br/>
will propose that when I get this working
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:52:47 GMT):<br/>
yes that's the point
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:53:34 GMT):<br/>
keep me posted , will be very happy to see it is working for you.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:53:58 GMT):<br/>
I am also planning to install composer on top of the fabric network which ansible sets up.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:54:36 GMT):<br/>
once that part is added, you will be able to start developing your business blockchain app after the script finishes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:54:43 GMT):<br/>
that will be really really nice.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:35:25 GMT):<br/>
it worked! @tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:35:43 GMT):<br/>
only thing different with your video is that it asks me for kubeconfig or token
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:35:49 GMT):<br/>
which should I choose ? 

</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:37:08 GMT):<br/>
http://prntscr.com/ik4a49
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:40:00 GMT):<br/>
use token,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:40:11 GMT):<br/>
the token is in the secrets/users directory file.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:50:59 GMT):<br/>
uhm this is odd
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:51:09 GMT):<br/>
I enter the token, press SIGN IN but no response happens
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:53:16 GMT):<br/>
even though on the network tab I can see a 200 OK response
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:56:46 GMT):<br/>
@tongli or should I inject it in the HTTP headers?
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 21:15:03 GMT):<br/>
weird thing is that I can skip it and it works flawlessly
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 22:38:29 GMT):<br/>
yeah. you probably won't be able to do anything?
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 22:59:51 GMT):<br/>
well i'm able to view every section 
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 23:00:06 GMT):<br/>
without the need to login
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 23:00:13 GMT):<br/>
which i'd say it's a no-no
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 23:00:50 GMT):<br/>
I searched for the token in secrets/user/token.csv 
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 23:01:11 GMT):<br/>
entered the first column (which is a encrypted string) to the textbox but with no luck
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 01:02:12 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. that is what is supposed to be.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 01:02:30 GMT):<br/>
it is very strange that it would work without token.
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 01:23:24 GMT):<br/>
yeah it kinda is
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 01:23:33 GMT):<br/>
i'll try now without inserting the token at all
</p>
<p><strong>Dilip 25</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 01:24:00 GMT):<br/>
because since it throws a 200 OK when I press the SIGNIN button then it might mean that it's working but it's not hiding the login modal
</p>

@baohua Hi baohua, we are going to contribute kubernetes agent code to cello, and I noticed that the status of jira item "Support kubernetes as the underly platform(CE-7)" is done, should I open a brand new jira item or create sub-project under that item?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 09:00:45 GMT):<br/>
sure, open a new one.

When I use ansible script to bring up containers there is a fabriccli container up and running to install and instantiate transaction after that it disappers when I try to bring it up again with `docker-compose -f file.yaml -up -d`  it says container is already running when I do `docker -it fabriccli bash `I says it container is not running If I start it with `docker start fabriccli` I starts but never shows up

@DarshanBc please take a look at the docker compose file on how to bring up the fabriccli.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 28 Feb 2018 19:19:13 GMT):<br/>
the file should be in the working directory in /opt/gopath/bc1st/fabric/run
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 28 Feb 2018 19:19:59 GMT):<br/>
do not have the exact path, but it should be there on the first node. take a look at that and see how fabriccli is brought up, you can do the similar thing

Hi, I have a question on how to connect Cello to an existing running fabric instance? I only see Cello as a tool to provision new fabric instances (worker nodes) but unable to connect to an instance which was not provisioned through Cello. Is this correct?
</p>
<p><strong>arunmitteam</strong> (Wed, 28 Feb 2018 23:12:39 GMT):<br/>
I have fabric instance node1 and would like it to be added as a worker node to my master. But there's no way for the master node to get the existing instance through the docker daemon. 
</p>
<p><strong>bleggett</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 15:51:45 GMT):<br/>
@arunmitteam It can be done, but at this point that is somewhat outside the scope of what Cello does. It is probably quicker and simpler to simply provision a new cluster from the ground up with Cello.

<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:37:00 GMT):<br/>
Is the ansible agent used to setup worker nodes or it is a separate tool (separate from Master-Worker architecture ) used to just setup fabric network ?  the doc (http://hyperledger-cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ansible-agent-how-to/) doesn't mention the relation. Thank you
</p>
<p><strong>bleggett</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 20:13:44 GMT):<br/>
@Amir This doc is a little more up to date: https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/worker_ansible_howto.md If that doesn't answer your question, let me know and maybe we can clarify
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 21:36:10 GMT):<br/>
@bleggett Thank you for the response. In fact I used that doc and I managed to setup fabric network on multiple physical machines. After setting up the network I was expecting to see active chains under cello operator dashboard  (assuming that the ansible agent is configuring worker nodes ) and the fabric network on top these chains. But I didn’t saw anything under the operator dashboard.     
I'm I correct or the ansible agent is separate from Master-Worker setup ?
</p>
<p><strong>bleggett</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:20:40 GMT):<br/>
@Amir I think you must manually point the Cello dashboard at your network.
</p>
<p><strong>bleggett</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:20:40 GMT):<br/>
@Amir I think you must manually point the Cello dashboard at your network, after you stand your network up with Ansible.

@arunmitteam ansible agent sets up a fabric network on multiple nodes but the network was not hooked up with the dashboard. It will be nice if someone started working on the integration.

@ashishapy probably go through the docs a bit, then pick an area that you have a feel with, then start fixing up things. I could use some help with the ansible agent.

I really like the cello operator dashboard, it helps us to spin off fabric instances very quickly.
</p>
<p><strong>arunmitteam</strong> (Sun, 04 Mar 2018 17:21:56 GMT):<br/>
I have two questions - 1. What is user dashboard? When should I use it? 
</p>
<p><strong>arunmitteam</strong> (Sun, 04 Mar 2018 17:22:21 GMT):<br/>
2. Can I use cello to create new channels? Or add peers to existing channel?

Hi @tongli , I have same problem than @Dilip 25 fatal: [XX.XXX.XXX.XX]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Permission denied (publickey).\r\n", "unreachable": true}
</p>
<p><strong>nolimitkun</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:33:21 GMT):<br/>
and I try to create a new AMI with python installed
</p>
<p><strong>nolimitkun</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:33:37 GMT):<br/>
but still the same problem
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:33:48 GMT):<br/>
Either your host does not support ssh or you do not have ssh agent running
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:33:59 GMT):<br/>
Please look at the docs
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:34:43 GMT):<br/>
So you are creating vms In aws?
</p>
<p><strong>nolimitkun</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:34:47 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:35:11 GMT):<br/>
Were your vms created?
</p>
<p><strong>nolimitkun</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:36:11 GMT):<br/>
yes, I created a ubuntu 16.04 with apt install python
</p>
<p><strong>nolimitkun</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:36:38 GMT):<br/>
so I need to do a apt install open-ssh?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:36:45 GMT):<br/>
So your vms were all created and you just can not connect to them ?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:37:25 GMT):<br/>
If you are using aws image, ssh is there.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:37:47 GMT):<br/>
You can try manually ssh to one of the vms and see if you can do it.
</p>
<p><strong>nolimitkun</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:38:16 GMT):<br/>
ok I'm testing
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:39:02 GMT):<br/>
Make sure that you have ssh agent running on the ansible controller which is the machine you run the script
</p>
<p><strong>nolimitkun</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:41:32 GMT):<br/>
ssh to fabric001 OK
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:42:20 GMT):<br/>
Yeah. That means you vms are ok. Go ahead ssh-add your vms private key to ssh agent
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:42:26 GMT):<br/>
You should be ok
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:42:54 GMT):<br/>
Again, the doc has all the steps how to do it

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:45:18 GMT):<br/>

this one right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:50:33 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:51:03 GMT):<br/>
Take a look at ssh agent section. Should solve your issue

<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 01:41:12 GMT):<br/>
hello all, I updated fabric-solo-4.yaml file (https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0/fabric-solo-4.yaml) to use couchDB as the state database (this is the file used to create chains from operator dashboard). But when I create chains it never starts the couchdb containers. any Idea on how to use couchDB ? thank you
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 03:01:11 GMT):<br/>
There might be sth wrong in ur updated yaml file. maybe u can have a look at https://github.com/yeasy/docker-compose-files/blob/master/hyperledger_fabric/v1.0.6/docker-compose-2orgs-4peers-couchdb.yaml

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=8yYahZ8djHPDA3hhX) @baohua Thank you for the reply. I will check with that file. In fact to test my file I did `docker-compose  -f fabric-solo-4.yaml up -d` and everything starts fine but then this will not be associated with the dashboard.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=8yYahZ8djHPDA3hhX) @baohua I tried to use these compose files (with both v1.0.6 and v1.1.0-rc1) to create fabric network from operator dashboard but the dashboard doesn't create the couchdb containers. It always create the following (4 peers, 2 ca, orderer/ kafkas, explorer and cli ).
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 03:31:02 GMT):<br/>
When creating fabric network (cluster) from operator dashboard, is the dashboard using these files (https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0) ?

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 02:53:01 GMT):<br/>
@Amir it's ok you do the testing, but a more recommended way is to open some jira issue for the bug, and submit a patchset, then people will feel easier to help understand the problem and situation.

<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 10:51:41 GMT):<br/>
@liujinzhong There are only some scripts so far, which can not be called by the Cello runtime
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 10:53:00 GMT):<br/>
but the feature to support kubernetes agent is under developing now.
</p>
<p><strong>liujinzhong</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 11:53:08 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen I read the document of setup_worker_ansible.md several times but cant't get what i want.
</p>
<p><strong>liujinzhong</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 11:54:50 GMT):<br/>
peer,order and so on deployed on different machines....this is what i need
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 11:55:42 GMT):<br/>
the ansible agent is different from the native kubernetes agent.
</p>
<p><strong>liujinzhong</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 11:56:22 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen  when i using dashboard，only create host and chain.at the same time they are on the same local machine
</p>
<p><strong>liujinzhong</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 11:59:26 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen cell,ansible,k8s....how to tie together?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 12:05:33 GMT):<br/>
There is a "agent" layer in cello's arch, some APIs are implemnted here to communicate with remote host, and the host can be the machine which is running the docker service or being the master the node of a kubernetes cluster.

Regarding the issue of using couchDB with the operator dashboard, I look the jira issues if someone added the case before and I found one from Jan  added by @harsha (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-250) , I updated the description on that issue. I will try if I can resolve the issue. Thank you

I hate to be annoying here but trying to wrap my head around this. Anyone encounter `404 Client Error: Not Found ("No such container: f9ff9571ebe8455b98b85e8219c7a43d_peer0.org1.example.com is the exact error message` when attempting to work with docker swarms

I don't think that Cello is ready for docker out of the box. The "hard-coded" example seems to be referencing peers by name that don't really get created by said name.

@AlexBA 6 @ChrisFowers if you use ansible agent, you can setup your own network anyway you like

does not matter you use multiple nodes or just one node.

if you follow these documents, you should be setup your own fabric network anyway you like.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 20:37:39 GMT):<br/>
in terms of docker swarm , ansible agent create a docker swarm like env (not exactly the docker swarm), it uses overlay network so that containers have their own IP address, it also sets up local dns and registrators so  that peers and orderers can work with each other by using names.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 20:38:02 GMT):<br/>
if you follow these documents and have issues, I can certainly help with.

<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 23:03:37 GMT):<br/>

Builds subsequent to today will allow you to hide Jenkins spew in the Gerrit UI natively. You need to be using the old UI. use the "hide tagged comments" button. if you want to see how it works, examine this change using the old UI: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/19059/

How do we create chain for Host which is on different network?

We used Ansible and could ping all the other worker nodes.Created a host for different VM but not able to add chain to the newly crated host.

<p><strong>yopep</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 10:07:24 GMT):<br/>
it is my understanding that cello master and worker can't co-exist on the same server. can the other guys chime in? :)
</p>
<p><strong>yopep</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 10:08:51 GMT):<br/>
i think that is the root cause of the errors that you are getting since master/worker are on the same machine.

Once a network is up and running with the Ansible agent, can it be added to the Cello dashboard?
</p>
<p><strong>AlexBA 6</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 15:14:06 GMT):<br/>
I mean using docker and flanneld. Or does it need to be a kubernetes cluster?

<p><strong>ctan</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 03:26:03 GMT):<br/>
in the user dashboard. we're using cello but with a different dashboard. so if there's an api for the uploading of smart contract we we're thinking of just calling that

@yopep  thanks for the contribution at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/19341/!

We now maintain all cello related images under the same cello naming prefix, which is to be unique and flexible to adjust based on other official images.

Hence, to update the cell-mongo image, i guess a better way is:

1) Remove installing mongo db in the base image Dockerfile;
2) Use mongo:3.4-jessie as the baseimage in the cello-mongo image building, and may remove the entrypoint.sh code.

This will be simpler to change, and won't need to update other code.

Thanks!

In a kubernetes environment, should cello-operator-dashboard be part of the cluster? Or should it be deployed outside of the kubernetes cluster?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 06:22:52 GMT):<br/>
@yopep In my opinion, cello-operator-dashboard should be outside of the kubernetes clusters, we should only use kubernetes as a Cello host to maintain Fabric cluster.

@Unni_1994 based on the logs it seems that port 8081 is already used by a running process. You may issue the following command to verify
```
netstat -avn | grep 8081
```
</p>
<p><strong>yopep</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:36:06 GMT):<br/>
on a centos server to get the process id
```
netstat -avnp | grep 8081

then
```
ps -ef | grep <pid_number>
```
to get the running application

@baohua @tongli Hi Guys, I'm trying to comprehend the design of Cello with respect to Kubernetes. Kindly comment on my observations/questions.

1. Currently Cello supports Docker (single node) and Docker Swarm. This is done via calls to docker-compose in src/agent/docker scripts. Can't comment on vSphere as I'm not familiar with it.

2. Support for Kubernetes is via CLI at src/agent/k8s scripts. It is not wired with the Operator Dashboard just yet.

3. There are ansible scripts that deploys fabric to different environments (Docker and Kubernetes)
   - Is the intention of these scripts is to replace current agent implementation? Operator Dashboard will then call these ansible scripts to provision a fabric cluster instead?

4. There is an empty src/agent/k8s-operator folder
   - Based on CE-68 the intention is to use an Kubernetes Operator (http://bit.ly/2FTDiDv) to provition a fabric network.

5. What is the planned design for supporting Kubernetes?
   - Items #2, #3 and #4 seems to be in conflict in my opinion
</p>

<p><strong>yopep</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 13:13:01 GMT):<br/>
it may be that there were errors during the creation of the chain. you can verify this by checking the cello-operator-dashboard logs
```
docker logs -f cello-operator-dashboard
```

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=pEcv7wXYwBcZxW9Bu) @divudivyansh It provisions a fabric network using docker, docker swarm, vsphere and soon k8s. By provision I mean it creates/teardown a fabric network with 2 orgs with 2 peers each. Haven't looked at the ansible scripts yet if it is capable of being flexible in terms of orgs and peers. There is also a user dashboard wherein you can deploy chaincodes and test function calls on the deployed chaincode but this is still a work in progress. Integration with Hyperledger Composer playground is also a work in progress.

<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 20:14:28 GMT):<br/>
But adding worker node to the dashboard doesn't guarantee a connection. what do you see if you do `docker -H Worker_Node_IP:2375 version` from the master node ?

i have configured the docker swarm cluster and tested it, do i need to run anything in the worker node related to cello?
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 21:01:49 GMT):<br/>
in the worker node you just need `make setup-worker`, nothing else  
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 21:05:16 GMT):<br/>
also note that the current version of cello does the setup only in one worker node, even if you have connected three nodes. If you need to use actual multi-node you have to use the ansible agent (Also note, the ansible agent is not connected to the dashboard, it is work in progress) 
</p>
<p><strong>walnemer1976</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 21:10:48 GMT):<br/>
dose it matter if i run make setup-worker before i configure docker swarm ? or i need to configure swarm first then run make setup-worker?
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 21:23:33 GMT):<br/>
I don't think the order matters (anyone correct me if I'm wrong), but you can always try to redeploy. To redeploy you can do `make stop`, remove /opt/cello  and do make setup-master / make setup-worker on master and worker nodes respectively

I managed to reproduce your error, There is some issue when adding a host with `host type =  swarm`. Try to add the host with  `host type =  docker` this should work at least

Hi everyone, any idea how to solve having cello working with docker Swarm cluster setup?

<p><strong>yopep</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 05:33:34 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=WKpbC7FZskNyFcN7N) @baohua Posted a comment on https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-286. Reposting it here so others who are interested are free to chip in. :)
```
Hi Luke Chan and allen yang,
I'd like to know the design on how do you go about implementing the code to deploy Fabric to a Kubernetes cluster. As I understand it there are three solutions existing in the Cello source codes.

Solution 1:
Use src/agent/k8s where deployment is via shell scripts
Solution 2:
Use src/agent/ansible where Ansible is used
Solution 3:
Use src/agent/k8s-operator where Kubernetes Operator will be used (No codes yet)

I'm asking because I would like to help in implementing it and so that our efforts can be harmonized.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=jQbTT2a47JdoYepAm) @walnemer1976 Can you try a single docker worker node? Based on the message from Amir it seems deploying to docker swarm has a bug for now.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:00:38 GMT):<br/>
@yopep well, we must assume that user already have a functional and configured kubernetes cluster before using kubernetes agent.
basically, our work is meant to intergrate `https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python` into Cello, and we created an agent base on the api from the `kubernetes-client python` 
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:03:43 GMT):<br/>
the api design is compatible with the module layer, which means module layer can call functions of this agent
</p>
<p><strong>yopep</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:04:21 GMT):<br/>
thanks @Luke_Chen 
</p>
<p><strong>yopep</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:04:21 GMT):<br/>
thanks @Luke_Chen i think that clears it up. :)
</p>
<p><strong>divudivyansh</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:04:25 GMT):<br/>
Can we use cello on windows platform as of now? And how soon will cello integrate with composer
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:04:26 GMT):<br/>
we don't need extra scripts to launch Fabric deployment on kubernetes cluster
</p>
<p><strong>yopep</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:09:32 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen I think your idea can also be implemented for docker swarm - via rest api calls. Currently it is based on some docker-compose.yml files which are somewhat static. What do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:10:00 GMT):<br/>
@yopep also, we will release design document of kubernetes agent soon,  please keep focus。
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:12:02 GMT):<br/>
@yopep we use the static deployment file too
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:16:44 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen yes, some sharing design docs (e.g., google doc) is a good way to collaborate!
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:17:13 GMT):<br/>
@yopep We have considerated let user config their Fabric network, but the the problem is, we need some tools to generate `crypto-config` and `channel-artifacts` which are not possible to be intergrated in Cello so far
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:17:50 GMT):<br/>
@baohua Yes, will release as soon as possible

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=G8spXkq6dXjM2by5m) @divudivyansh Haven't tried but in my opinion you can't because some of the tools used like make and python. And the scripts for configuring master and workers are all in bash scripts.
</p>
<p><strong>yopep</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 07:23:42 GMT):<br/>
@divudivyansh perhaps what you can do is to install virtualbox with a running linux vm. then you configure cello in there.

I am having DNS problems when running Fabric via Cello/Ansible. Everything seems to work until I try to join channel. I have containers on 2 VMs. The zookeepers (and others) cannot resolve addresses. "2018-03-20 18:52:36,844 [myid:] - WARN  [main:QuorumPeer$QuorumServer@155] - Failed to resolve address: zookeeper3
java.net.UnknownHostException: zookeeper3: Temporary failure in name resolution". I can ping all the containers by IP address, so it appears that the network is in good shape.
</p>
<p><strong>tonym1</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:26:39 GMT):<br/>
Also I get this messages in fabriccli: "2018-03-20 18:53:25.599 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 003 grpc: addrConn.resetTransport failed to create client transport: connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing dial tcp: lookup orderer1-org3 on 208.43.80.246:53: server misbehaving"; Reconnecting to {orderer1-org3:7050 <nil>}". Maybe problem is in resolv.conf - Im not sure what should be there - "ubuntu@tony-work1:~$ cat /etc/resolv.conf

@tonym1 looks like that you dns and/or registrator maybe down. you can check to see if these containers are still running.
</p>
<p><strong>tonym1</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 17:49:30 GMT):<br/>
@tongli skydns.fabric001 and registrator.fabric001 are up and running on one VM and registrator.fabric002 is up and running on the other. I don't know how to test them. I tried doing a nslookup like this ... "ubuntu@tony-work1:~$ docker exec -it skydns.fabric001 nslookup zookeeper1
Server:         208.43.80.246
Address:        208.43.80.246#53

** server can't find zookeeper1: SERVFAIL
"
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 17:57:19 GMT):<br/>
@tonym1 that is correct. dns only runs on one machine. registrator are running on all nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 17:57:43 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. your node IP looks strange.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 17:58:13 GMT):<br/>
your node IP should be in 172.x.x.x range.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 17:58:21 GMT):<br/>
looks like that your overlay network was not setup right.
</p>
<p><strong>tonym1</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 18:41:19 GMT):<br/>
@tongli The node_ip above (208.43.80.246) is the public ip of the Softlayer VM that is fabric001. There is a private IP 10.x.x.x but I could never get that to work - I assumed because 10.x is non-routeable. docker0 and flannel0 both have 172.16.x.x addresses.

<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 21:26:56 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=49FQNDEoiPSz2DoRX) @randallj Hey, yes if you deploy Cello using the Makefile you will get Explorer dashboard. Cello and Explorer are separate projects with different functionalities. Cello is focused on managing the underlining infrastructure for blockchain network. Explorer is used to visualize the contents of blockchain network

Hi @baohua , does cello support docker swarm based deployment yet? Since I need a multi-host deployment, swarm would be really easy to operate. If not is there a road-map I was not able to find it on JIRA or anywhere else. The script inside worker_node for swarm seems to be a work in progress.

@baohua , yes I was not able to add swarm nodes as worker nodes. I feel there is lack of documentation for swarm type nodes. I could only add docker type nodes.

@Nghiadt if you use ansible agent which can be found here https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/src/agent/ansible, the agent sets up k8s and deploy fabric onto it.

@dinesh.rivankar can u help elaborate the process of the crypto config generation?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 04:58:11 GMT):<br/>
i guess this is not that easy to just put the binary into operator dashboard.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 04:58:39 GMT):<br/>
Would you like to help create some google doc as the design spec? including the idea, steps, challenges and solutions.
</p>
<p><strong>dinesh.rivankar</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 05:00:30 GMT):<br/>
Sure. we wanted to include the  crypto-gen tool in the cello-operator-dashboard and during chain creation API call wanted to invoke the tool.
</p>
<p><strong>dinesh.rivankar</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 05:01:51 GMT):<br/>
based on the crypto-config.yaml for network we wanted to create crypto material 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 05:02:11 GMT):<br/>
several issues come to me to this topic: 1) how to define the organization structure? 2) how to distribute the crypto materials in a cluster env? 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 05:02:40 GMT):<br/>
Hence some design spec will be a good start. feel free to share the link here after initializing the first version.

hmmmm so @baohua I  dont know how to use that information you provided on the yeasy github. I was trying to make my own version of bc1st.yml  but ... I can't see what's wrong at all. It  looks right? But I keep getting this "ordererOrganization" error that is at the bottom of this: https://gist.github.com/collincusce/8efc21f216dad2114c4afd7e734e7209 
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 13:56:00 GMT):<br/>
which file in https://github.com/yeasy/docker-compose-files/tree/master/hyperledger_fabric/v1.1.0 did  you want me to look  at?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 13:57:13 GMT):<br/>
@collincusce if you are using bc1st.yml, it suggests to me that you are using ansible agent for setting up your network.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 13:57:33 GMT):<br/>
yesss
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 13:57:44 GMT):<br/>
@collincusce can you tell me what error did you see and when that happened?
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 13:57:52 GMT):<br/>
it's at the bottom of the gist
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 13:58:01 GMT):<br/>
there's three files
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:00:16 GMT):<br/>
it happens when I run  setupfabric
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:00:54 GMT):<br/>
I can  provision, I can  initicluster, but I can't get that  network setup to work ... says there's files that need to be copied, but they're already  there?

<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:00:59 GMT):<br/>
or  somesuch?

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:04:50 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:07:48 GMT):<br/>
@collincusce which cloud are you using? AWS?
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:08:41 GMT):<br/>
aws yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:09:46 GMT):<br/>
I looked at your aws.yml file, that looks fine to me.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:10:41 GMT):<br/>
where you using just one command like this to run the playbooks or few steps? ```ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:11:15 GMT):<br/>
I mean did you use one command like that or you used the step command?
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:11:31 GMT):<br/>
I can but I also can  run  it separately, that's how I know it's wrong at the setupfabric step
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:11:54 GMT):<br/>
either is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:12:11 GMT):<br/>
I want to know some details so that I can help you quickly.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:12:21 GMT):<br/>
not a problem!! Ask away!!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:12:40 GMT):<br/>
so the first two steps, you did not have any errors when you run the playbooks, right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:13:01 GMT):<br/>
like provisioning and initcluster
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:13:01 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:13:24 GMT):<br/>
zero errors
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:13:27 GMT):<br/>
I  watched,  I checked
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:13:43 GMT):<br/>
sure, good. that is what it should behave.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:13:47 GMT):<br/>
it  created 4 hosts in aws
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:14:04 GMT):<br/>
now, let me look at your bc1st.yml file,
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:14:10 GMT):<br/>
sure! Gimme a sec
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:14:12 GMT):<br/>
you have 4 nodes I assume.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:14:27 GMT):<br/>
no that uses 3
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:15:03 GMT):<br/>
but I  did modify to  make 4 nodes for this test... when  I run  bc1st I get an error because it tries to access something in network {} for the fabric004 node but does
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:15:09 GMT):<br/>
it does not fail the process,  though
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:15:12 GMT):<br/>
that is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:15:12 GMT):<br/>
itkeeps going
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:15:21 GMT):<br/>
you can leave one node alone

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:18:19 GMT):<br/>
from the fabric_config.yml file, you are using all 4 nodes.

yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:19:26 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:21:24 GMT):<br/>
yea
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:21:35 GMT):<br/>
I  just lazily named them  in gist
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:22:15 GMT):<br/>
that is fine, this should work.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:22:18 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:22:23 GMT):<br/>
weird error?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:22:27 GMT):<br/>
so you actually wanted to use k8s.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:22:47 GMT):<br/>
tbh for  now I'm  not picky
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:22:56 GMT):<br/>
I used  k8s but can  do  something else
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:23:10 GMT):<br/>
at this point, you should be able to access the k8s dashboard, can you do that?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:23:17 GMT):<br/>
that is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:23:20 GMT):<br/>
it should work.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:23:22 GMT):<br/>
gimme one moment,  I  have to see the state of the system
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:23:41 GMT):<br/>
I sent my original messages yesterday afternoon,  things have happened since then
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:23:57 GMT):<br/>
but yes  I could
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:24:01 GMT):<br/>
at one point
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:24:26 GMT):<br/>
if you will repeat this work (after you wipe clean everything), after step 2 (initcluster), you should be able to access the dashboard,
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:24:37 GMT):<br/>
gah  what's that  port  # again
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:24:42 GMT):<br/>
which should give you good idea if the cluster and k8s is working appropriately.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:24:49 GMT):<br/>
32334 I think
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:24:57 GMT):<br/>
to hit the very first node.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:25:31 GMT):<br/>
yeah, 32334 is the right port.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:25:36 GMT):<br/>
ah  needed https
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:25:37 GMT):<br/>
got it
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:25:38 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:25:40 GMT):<br/>
works
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:25:58 GMT):<br/>
so I hate  to do this but I h ave a meeting in 5 mins
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:25:59 GMT):<br/>
yeah. log in and see the state of your cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:26:08 GMT):<br/>
haha.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:26:22 GMT):<br/>
ok, so what is the error that you saw when you do setupfabric?
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:26:36 GMT):<br/>
two pods failed  on fabric001
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:26:56 GMT):<br/>
specifically orderer1st-orgc
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:26:59 GMT):<br/>
and
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:27:02 GMT):<br/>
orderer1st-orgd
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:27:09 GMT):<br/>
the error from ansible playbook run?
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:27:20 GMT):<br/>
this might be because I was messing with it,  this looks like bc1st stuff
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:28:26 GMT):<br/>
I'll tell you what
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:28:28 GMT):<br/>
noticed that you have 4 nodes for kafka and zookeeper,
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:28:31 GMT):<br/>
I'll run bc1st again
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:28:39 GMT):<br/>
and log i
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:28:40 GMT):<br/>
it
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:28:46 GMT):<br/>
generally speaking, these clusters should use odd number of nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:28:55 GMT):<br/>
like 3 or 5
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:28:55 GMT):<br/>
oh?
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:01 GMT):<br/>
but does that explain  the orderer issue
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:08 GMT):<br/>
that looks like a file copy issue
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:15 GMT):<br/>
not exactly sure.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:23 GMT):<br/>
need to see the exact error.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:28 GMT):<br/>
it's at the bottom of the file
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:38 GMT):<br/>
even number of nodes is fine but in production, you should not do that.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:40 GMT):<br/>
I'll replicate it again, destroying the hosts
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:44 GMT):<br/>
split brain issues.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:47 GMT):<br/>
ah
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:50 GMT):<br/>
yeah.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:50 GMT):<br/>
this is a PoC
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:29:55 GMT):<br/>
that is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:30:06 GMT):<br/>
even number of nodes should work.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:30:11 GMT):<br/>
not recommended though.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:30:32 GMT):<br/>
also, it is generally a good idea, to have orderers in its own organization.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:30:53 GMT):<br/>
wew, oh ok... I wonder  what else I dont know...
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:30:56 GMT):<br/>
but the way you setup, should also work.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:31:02 GMT):<br/>
we  just want  to set up 3 channels with  4 orgs
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:31:08 GMT):<br/>
just not how it is normally setup.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:31:11 GMT):<br/>
each  org connects to orga
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:31:31 GMT):<br/>
each  org would  also want their  own composer rest api
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:31:40 GMT):<br/>
say all your orderers go to orgo?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:32:12 GMT):<br/>
you are in luck because I just merged a patch set to deploy composer playground
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:32:21 GMT):<br/>
and generating the connection profile.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:32:32 GMT):<br/>
but that work has not be done for k8s.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:32:42 GMT):<br/>
you should use flanneld setup.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:32:54 GMT):<br/>
at least I have not tested against k8s yet.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:33:22 GMT):<br/>
if you use the latest code, you should see something like this after you successfully deploy everything.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:34:05 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:34:36 GMT):<br/>
notice that the ip address 192.168.56.101 is my private vmbox vm address.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:35:04 GMT):<br/>
@collincusce you will be able to connect to that the carauction-network to start the transaction.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 14:35:10 GMT):<br/>
it is awsome.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 15:03:52 GMT):<br/>
dude you're amazing thanks
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 15:04:01 GMT):<br/>
@tongli sorry I was away in that meeting
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 15:04:20 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to  send you a separate gist with  the output from the bc1st_test.yml
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 15:05:06 GMT):<br/>
https://gist.github.com/collincusce/b8c532b9a8fece6cf50411f31a536bea
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 15:09:05 GMT):<br/>
running it on the scrubbed
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 15:18:26 GMT):<br/>
is the patch available with  a standard git pull?
</p>
<p><strong>JoeN 6</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 15:22:48 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 15:31:12 GMT):<br/>
@tongli cool and I added the 4 node version: https://gist.github.com/collincusce/8e0887e7f2efcba98896f6076fcd062a
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:08:14 GMT):<br/>
seems to me that you are still using the old image
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:08:41 GMT):<br/>
you changed to 1.0.0, you probably want to use 1.1.0
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:09:10 GMT):<br/>
also I think this url to get the fabric binary may need to be updated to point to the latest one.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:09:18 GMT):<br/>
https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/hyperledger-fabric/linux-amd64-1.0.0/hyperledger-fabric-linux-amd64-1.0.0.tar.gz
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:09:57 GMT):<br/>
use this one instead. https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/hyperledger-fabric/linux-amd64-1.1.0/hyperledger-fabric-linux-amd64-1.1.0.tar.gz
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:10:34 GMT):<br/>
and change to base image tag to be x86_64-1.1.0
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:10:48 GMT):<br/>
then I think you should simply run this command
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:11:06 GMT):<br/>
ansible-playbook -e "mode=applu" aws.yml
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:13:03 GMT):<br/>
ok!
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:13:47 GMT):<br/>
@tongli what I'm doing is a fresh local copy of cello on my machine to use the ansible scripts to get jank into the cloud. Cleaned up images and all. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:14:07 GMT):<br/>
yeah.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:14:10 GMT):<br/>
the 1.1.0 version didnt work with what I was using.... so I'm going to switch after this new pull and using flanneld
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:14:24 GMT):<br/>
oh. that is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:14:30 GMT):<br/>
should not matter.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:14:36 GMT):<br/>
it did :-/
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:14:52 GMT):<br/>
no idea why though, so ... but yeah when we switched to that version and that binary things started working
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:14:54 GMT):<br/>
I mean from ansible agent perspective.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:14:58 GMT):<br/>
oh ok
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:15:15 GMT):<br/>
running master-setup now
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:15:26 GMT):<br/>
the binary should match the fabric release.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:15:38 GMT):<br/>
notice there is version info in the url?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:15:54 GMT):<br/>
if you use both what I gave to you, it will work fine.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:16:00 GMT):<br/>
you may had a mismatch
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:16:07 GMT):<br/>
you may have a mismatch
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:16:42 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:16:58 GMT):<br/>
and I git cloned from.... git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/cello.git

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:17:11 GMT):<br/>
hmmm.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:17:18 GMT):<br/>
this is what I'm doing now
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:17:20 GMT):<br/>
is this correct?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:17:38 GMT):<br/>
you are trying to use the cello container.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:18:03 GMT):<br/>
just following this: http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_master/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:18:04 GMT):<br/>
I normally do not do that since that container was not setup to run ansible.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:18:18 GMT):<br/>
hmmm well ok let me ask a direct question
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:19:00 GMT):<br/>
use this procedure to get ansible controller up running.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:19:01 GMT):<br/>
I have Companies A, B, C, and D. Company A is the bossman. It owns the stuff and has its own portal and such. B, C, and D are companies which interact with A
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:19:02 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/worker_ansible_howto.md#install-ansible
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:19:28 GMT):<br/>
I want to create a PoC which deploys a network for all three companies. Each company can talk to A, but none of them can see information from each other.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:19:28 GMT):<br/>
I want to create a PoC which deploys a network for all four companies. Each company can talk to A, but none of them can see information from each other.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:19:41 GMT):<br/>
I was going to display this through rest calls that exist on the host of B,C, and D
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:20:08 GMT):<br/>
can talk to A meaning?
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:20:24 GMT):<br/>
channels will be A->B; A->C; A->D
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:20:37 GMT):<br/>
NOT B->C and so forth
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:21:23 GMT):<br/>
so it's a decentralized network from the perspective of company A, that said in reality B could take to C, just not see the A->B sstuff
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:21:28 GMT):<br/>
cello only create one channel for verification purposes, once you setup fabric network, you can create channels as you see fit.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:21:45 GMT):<br/>
if that is the case, I would think you want 3 channels,
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:21:51 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:22:16 GMT):<br/>
1st = A + B, 2nd = A + C, 3rd = A + D.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:22:22 GMT):<br/>
yes!
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:22:24 GMT):<br/>
:-)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:22:30 GMT):<br/>
so transactions should be done that way.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:22:35 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:22:44 GMT):<br/>
B,C And D have no interaction in terms of transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:22:48 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:22:58 GMT):<br/>
just a proof of concept
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:23:06 GMT):<br/>
so, what is the problem?
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:23:10 GMT):<br/>
also forgive me, I come from the ethereum space, so if this doesn't make sense let me know
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:23:37 GMT):<br/>
the problem is ... so I want to throw up the network that can support that on  multiple hosts... I'd even love to automate the channel creation through tasks
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:23:40 GMT):<br/>
channel separate orgs, I think that is the right way.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:23:41 GMT):<br/>
but one thing at a time
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:24:14 GMT):<br/>
yeah so that's why I have the setupfabric config I sent you earlier: https://gist.github.com/collincusce/8efc21f216dad2114c4afd7e734e7209
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:24:17 GMT):<br/>
so you create channels, and join selected the orgs to the channel.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:24:19 GMT):<br/>
if you look at the network section
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:24:38 GMT):<br/>
remember that's what sparked all of this... that network layout wasn't working
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:24:52 GMT):<br/>
4 hosts each representing 1 org
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:25:11 GMT):<br/>
if I need to have 3 that's ok :-) or 5
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:25:29 GMT):<br/>
that is not a problem.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:25:41 GMT):<br/>
yeah figured especially since it's 1:1 channels
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:25:55 GMT):<br/>
the orderer org should not matter.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:26:16 GMT):<br/>
orderers can all belong to say orgo.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:26:21 GMT):<br/>
it is just a service.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:26:27 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:26:31 GMT):<br/>
it is the channel most important.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:26:37 GMT):<br/>
and who is in a channel.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:26:51 GMT):<br/>
yeah but I can't get past setupfabric if you recall
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:26:55 GMT):<br/>
that network layout bombed?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:27:02 GMT):<br/>
even if two org peers stay on the same node, that is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:27:07 GMT):<br/>
well I'll try again with new cello on my local system using the 1.1.0
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:27:21 GMT):<br/>
setupfabirc does not create channels.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:27:22 GMT):<br/>
still pulling down stuff
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:27:29 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:27:35 GMT):<br/>
it does not, I have to build that
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:27:46 GMT):<br/>
it only creates a test channel to verify if the network created fine.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:27:50 GMT):<br/>
just trying to get the network setup in AWS
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:28:10 GMT):<br/>
for the configuration that you want, you need to create these channels and joins peers on your own.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:28:13 GMT):<br/>
(with the playground rest api if possible!)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:28:15 GMT):<br/>
cli maybe
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:28:27 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:28:49 GMT):<br/>
(composer rest api)_
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:29:10 GMT):<br/>
cello, sets up playground and creates the connection profile assumes that all orgs will join the test channel.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:29:35 GMT):<br/>
cool, so did I do wrong by running setup-master?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:29:54 GMT):<br/>
if you are using ansible agent, you do not need any of these stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:29:58 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:30:00 GMT):<br/>
sweet
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:30:10 GMT):<br/>
setup ansible controller, run the playbooks, you got your own network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:30:13 GMT):<br/>
that is it.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:36:45 GMT):<br/>
so in bc1st.yml
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:36:47 GMT):<br/>
"GERRIT_REFSPEC: "refs/tags/v1.0.5" # 1.0.5"
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:36:54 GMT):<br/>
should that be 1.1.0 by chance?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:37:19 GMT):<br/>
leave what gerrit_respec unchanged.
</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:37:21 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>collincusce</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 20:03:34 GMT):<br/>
so I removed one... annnd same problem
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 00:59:58 GMT):<br/>
@collincusce I think this is a problem in ansible agent. please file a bug.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 01:00:20 GMT):<br/>
@collincusce at the same time, to let you go on, you can put all orderers in one org like orgo.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 01:00:44 GMT):<br/>
so peers and orderers won't share same org. that way, I believe you can keep going.

Hi @baohua  how about I create another k8s_agent dir to store my codes? there are too many thing under k8s dir
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:58:07 GMT):<br/>
`k8s` is the appropriate name to be aligned with other agents. can u check the k8s dir, they are some setup scripts of k8s, and should not affect u? And feel free to update the content too.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:02:38 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:18:52 GMT):<br/>
pls verify if any doc/code links to these scripts. i guess u can mainly check the `ansible` agent and the doc links.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:19:27 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 17:29:48 GMT):<br/>
 @rameshthoomu what was done to reduce the time?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 17:30:23 GMT):<br/>
Simply using different images?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 17:33:17 GMT):<br/>
caching the cello images instead of pulling them for every build
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 01:22:52 GMT):<br/>
cool, i guess it should apply to all projects that use Docker images?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 01:25:20 GMT):<br/>
And i think even with the `latest` tag, it should check to pull images every time, right? In case the dockerhub version is updated.

Hi together, I have some questions about Cello as we need something to provision a Fabric consortium network. We have a couple of organisations involved in the Fabric/Composer network, let's say 7. All of them should have their very own control about one (or more) peer Fabric nodes. Only one channel is needed with one Composer business network definition deployed.
Is this also possible with Cello? The documentation reads like Cello sees all added infrastructure as a blockchain cluster. All infrastructure is maintained/controlled by the ones who work with Cello. But the organisations themselves do not really have control about their very own peer node.
Is Cello considering those idiomatic architectures or is the usage of Cello really forcing me to do a "centralised blockchain operations"?
Thanks :-)

@jverhoelen currently, cello helps deploy the blockchain networks and add no limit on the cluster's ownership. It will depends on how people manage the underly infrastructure, i.e., is some server is controlled by an org A, then A can manage the peers in that server. We also consider to connect Cello to help manage some existing blockchain network, hope that feature can help in this scenario, too.

@baohua The purpose of using NFS server is not only for sharing the Certificate files, but also the channel-artifacts and explorer setup files, so it may be little difficult to take out the NFS server, beside, user may have multiple worker nodes, NFS server can be the shared storage medium for these worker nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 13:45:13 GMT):<br/>
and the NFS server will only against the kubernetes agent users, othere users don't need this NFS server.

It's good idea, but it still need some config file to start the fabric-ca, am I right?

<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 04:58:28 GMT):<br/>
and If we want to introduce explorer and composer later, we need to find a place to store all these start up files, and share among the Kubernetes workers.

hi everyone, I am trying to setup my cello local environment using the tutorial https://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/ everything works (all docker containers are up) and can access the operator dashboard
</p>
<p><strong>mvillalobos</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 12:02:57 GMT):<br/>
the problem comes when I try to create a new docker host (I am on a Mac) I get this error: cello-operator-dashboard | [2018-04-17 11:35:56,757] DEBUG [modules.host] [host.py:91               create()] - Create host: name=dam, worker_api=127.0.0.1:2375, host_type=docker, capacity=1, log=local/, autofill=false, schedulable=false

thank you @baohua, I figured that subnet mask is wrong in clonned /cello/src/agent/ansible/vars/aws.yml :```
  container_network: {
    Network: "172.16.0.0/16",
    SubnetLen: 24,
    SubnetMin: "172.16.0.0",
    SubnetMax: "172.16.255.0",
    Backend: {
      Type: "udp",
      Port: 8285
    }```
Let me check if it fixes the problem.

@rjones you mean that for each gerrit commit, needs to include the jira issue number like now?

yes
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 01:07:57 GMT):<br/>
it would be enforced by Gerrit

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=xCqA2whJWYMCpHZqn) @mvillalobos to check the docker demon in the worker node you have to pass the worker node IP. You did `docker -H 127.0.0.1:2375 info` this checks the localhost try `docker -H YOUR-WORKER-NODE-IP:2375 info`
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 14:40:12 GMT):<br/>

Hi @baohua , I talked to @tkuhrt last week about some code we (Luxoft) would like to contribute to the Hyperledger foundation. We have developed a yaml driven automation tools to configure and deploy a fabric network. All is written in Java. Our code has been leveraged on several projects, some in pilot production. 

Tracy suggested I talk to you about where we might fit in the cello project. There might be some crossover with cello but also useful new features. Also, we did a code walkthrough and a demo in the Netherlands with @mpiekarska and @sstone1 and it sounds like composer might also leverage some of our work. I can provide more details if you like. It would be helpful to schedule a meeting to go over what we have and what the next steps might be.

I am new to Cello. I just watched the two great videos below re. how to create a 3 worker K8 cluster on AWS to run a 2 Organization network with 3 peers each all in the same K8 cluster.  I would like some help understanding how Cello could help to create a real decentralized network where Organizations run peers on separate K8 clusters in the same or different clouds.

I am new to Cello. I just watched the two great videos below re. how to create a 3 worker K8 cluster on AWS to run a 2 Organization network with 3 peers each all in the same K8 cluster.  
Can somebody help me understand how Cello could help to create a real decentralized network where Organizations run peers on separate K8 clusters in the same or different clouds?

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 00:39:32 GMT):<br/>
@tgehrke thanks. We have discussed the issue last week, and feeling it's quite useful to one of our planed feature: allow user input the network parameters through the dashboard, and then generate some network template automatically. Then the agents (docker,k8s) can take the template to start a new network.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 00:40:00 GMT):<br/>
Since we will cancel this week's meeting due to the labor days holidays, let's discuss here.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 00:40:47 GMT):<br/>
One question is that most of cello's code is implemented in Python, is it possible to help create a python version based on the existing fabric-skeleton tool?
</p>
<p><strong>tgehrke</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 01:37:47 GMT):<br/>
@baohua we though fabric-utils was the component that fit into cello. That part wraps the fabric SDK to setups the crypto configuration. Calling fabric-skeleton uses fabric-utils. I don't think translating the Java code into Python is something we want to do on our side. Is it a problem supporting Java in cello?

</p>
<p><strong>tgehrke</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 01:40:49 GMT):<br/>
Would it be possible to schedule a meeting at another time? I'd like to include our development lead. Most of the team is in St Petersburg so their time zone is closer to yours. 
</p>
<p><strong>tgehrke</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 02:31:20 GMT):<br/>
@baohua  At one point @sstone1 was thinking parts of fabric-skeleton might be useful in composer. Do the cello and composer project leverage each others work? 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 03:15:56 GMT):<br/>
Not yet, but we've seen some possibility to integrate composer into cello. We can discuss in next week's meeting, hope not too late. 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 03:17:12 GMT):<br/>
And, there's no tech problem to support java in cello, but you know, multiple languages implementation may make the project hard to maintain in open-source way. The core dev team is focusing on python and javascript.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 03:18:26 GMT):<br/>
besides, it is not a 'translating', but more like take the existing code as reference, and implement the necessary functionality in cello. Does that make sense? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>tgehrke</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 04:22:17 GMT):<br/>
@baohua Yes I understand how it gets hard with multiple languages. That's the reason we implemented in Java, we don't develop our solutions in Python. I look forward to talking with you and Aleksandr I'll see if I can get him to respond on rocket chat today.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 04:46:18 GMT):<br/>
sure, thanks!  and we will be open for any volunteers that can help on this, too!
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:10:16 GMT):<br/>
@baohua while creating a Fabric cluster in Cello, there are two things need to do at module layer: 1. call the relative agent to create container 2. wait until the return from the agnet layer and update the db
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:16:41 GMT):<br/>
base on the current design of the module layer, the first operations I mentioned above will block the return of the module layer, if the container need to take few mins to create that will strongly affect user experience 
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:17:50 GMT):<br/>
this is actually happening in Kubernetes agent 
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:19:04 GMT):<br/>
so I propose to put the tow operations I mentioned above to a Thread, how do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 08:27:58 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen you mean to create fabric using k8s?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 08:28:14 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 08:28:40 GMT):<br/>
I think it's fine just check the response code by k8s API, and use some health field to track whether the network is up successfully?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 08:28:50 GMT):<br/>
e.g., make it async
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 08:29:00 GMT):<br/>
It need 1~2 mins to create a Fabric cluster
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 08:29:25 GMT):<br/>
if the k8s API response OK, then we will think the cluster is in "creating" status.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 08:29:37 GMT):<br/>
once the health check passed, then can mark it as 'ready'?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 09:00:50 GMT):<br/>
```containers = self.cluster_agents[worker.type] \
            .create(cid, mapped_ports, self.host_handler.schema(worker),
                    config=config, user_id=user_id)
        if not containers:
            logger.warning("failed to start cluster={}, then delete"
                           .format(name))
            self.delete(id=cid, record=False, forced=True)
return None```
cluster creation will block here
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 09:34:29 GMT):<br/>
It seem we need to put the response code to `containers` varible unless we add an i`f statement` to check weather the host type is kubernetes
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 09:37:14 GMT):<br/>
```        # start compose project, failed then clean and return
        logger.debug("Start compose project with name={}".format(cid))
        containers = self.cluster_agents[worker.type] \
            .create(cid, mapped_ports, self.host_handler.schema(worker),
                    config=config, user_id=user_id)
        if not containers:
            logger.warning("failed to start cluster={}, then delete"
                           .format(name))
            self.delete(id=cid, record=False, forced=True)
            return None

        # creation done, update the container table in db
        for k, v in containers.items():
            container = Container(id=v, name=k, cluster=cluster)
            container.save()

        # service urls can only be calculated after service is created
        service_urls = self.gen_service_urls(cid, peer_ports, ca_ports,
                                             orderer_ports, explorer_ports)
        # update the service port table in db
        for k, v in service_urls.items():
            service_port = ServicePort(name=k, ip=v.split(":")[0],
                                       port=int(v.split(":")[1]),
                                       cluster=cluster)
            service_port.save()

        # update api_url, container, user_id and status
        self.db_update_one(
            {"id": cid},
            {
                "user_id": user_id,
                'api_url': service_urls.get('rest', ""),

                'status': NETWORK_STATUS_RUNNING
            }
)```
more specific, is it a good idea to put above code to a Thread?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 09:37:54 GMT):<br/>

If k8s agent return a response code during the cluster creation, there must be a `if` statement to suite it need, rather than we wiil put the response code to `containers` varible which  cause confusion

@Luke_Chen are u saying `self.cluster_agents[worker.type].create()` is a blocking call？
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 06:39:55 GMT):<br/>
i guess we can change it to some async call.

if the call takes too much time.

@baohua @Luke_Chen Hi guys, I think I need to better understand the cello goals. The fabric-skeleton code we have is something we use to deploy a "production-like" fabric network. It is intended to launch multiple VMs and distribute the services across the network. The time it takes to set everything up can be quite long. We were looking at what @sstone1 and his team were doing with composer which primarily works with a sandbox and thought fabric-skeleton might be a good fit for doing a distributed network. Is deploying a distributed network something that fits into cello? The modules in fabric-utils just abstract the sdk calls and could be used for a smaller deployment. The fabric-utils might be more useful to cello. . .

@tgehrke Cello is mean to facilitate the application development among the Fabric network, and it has role called `operator` who is responsible to delpoy and maintain Fabric network, more important `operator` can deploy Fabric network on different platform like Docker swarm and Kubernetes, check this link for detials.

@tgehrke @Luke_Chen  thanks for the comments. Cello's goal is to help provision and operate blockchain networks ( think about cello, who plays music :) ), which we also call it some management tools. Now it is capable to support deploying blockchains into various physical infrastructures using the corresponding agent, like VM (using vcenter or ansible), baremetal (ansible), docker, swarm, k8s. Although we do not focus on how to install swarm or k8s, but the project is quite open to features that help people use blockchain in easy ways. Feel free to raise more questions or comments, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>tgehrke</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 06:43:14 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen @baohua thanks that helps. Do you see the code we provided as useful? It's mostly Ansible driven. It builds out a kafka base network. Is that something you are already doing? We also have some tooling to provision a network using AWS ec2.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 06:44:16 GMT):<br/>
yes, i believe it's useful, and we already have some ansible agent in cello, would you like to have a look?https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/src/agent/ansible

Hello everyone, I implemented a Fabric-Solution using Composer and I do have a deployable bna file which already worked on a local dev environment. Now I want to deploy a network using multiple AWS instances. Using Cello with ansible worker nodes seems to be good idea. 
</p>
<p><strong>Saschaka</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:28:21 GMT):<br/>
Am I on the right track?

<p><strong>Saschaka</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:48:34 GMT):<br/>
I updated the vars/aws.yml and set the env variable. Wheh I run "ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml" it stops after a few seconds with "fatal: [cloud]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "boto required for this module, install via pip or your package manager"}"

</p>
<p><strong>Saschaka</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:49:05 GMT):<br/>
even after I installed bote using 'npm install -g boto'
</p>
<p><strong>Saschaka</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:56:37 GMT):<br/>
solved this boto issue. installed using pip

@baohua the user-dashboard use the node ? what's the relationship host,cluster?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 13:57:26 GMT):<br/>
mainly javascript
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 13:57:34 GMT):<br/>
@hightall might provide more details
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 13:58:12 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain123 yes, it's written in node with express framework.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 13:58:16 GMT):<br/>
host is some resource pool that can be used by cello to run blockchain on, e.g., a k8s cluster, a vm cloud
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 13:58:30 GMT):<br/>
cluster is a blockchain network instance
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 13:58:45 GMT):<br/>
https://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain123</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 13:59:35 GMT):<br/>
the cluster can deploy in different host?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain123</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 13:59:35 GMT):<br/>
the cluster can deploy in different host? use the docker tcp 2375 port to manager docker?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:00:44 GMT):<br/>
no, currently, one cluster can only be deployed into one host
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:06:27 GMT):<br/>
can u help elaborate why need to deploy one cluster across, like multiple k8s clusters?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 14:38:08 GMT):<br/>
can this help @asaningmaxchain123 http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terminology/
</p>

@baohua I opened a ticket pertaining to cello, cello-analytics, and cmonit that you may have encountered: https://github.com/yeasy/cmonit/issues/1
</p>
<p><strong>coffeeplease</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 15:36:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure why there's a connection init error to the worker node
</p>
<p><strong>coffeeplease</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 15:38:43 GMT):<br/>
I just added to the ticket the results of running `docker -H WORKER_NODE_IP:2375 info`
</p>
<p><strong>coffeeplease</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 16:20:51 GMT):<br/>
One thing I noticed on cmonit is that you mention containers should have `label=monitor=true` but don't specify where this would go. Not sure if it's pertinent to finding a solution.
</p>
<p><strong>coffeeplease</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 16:25:58 GMT):<br/>
Separate question/thought. It doesn't appear as though there's been any updates in regards to adding support of v1.1 since March 15th. At a minimum there should be a branch that works on compatibility, no?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 21:56:41 GMT):<br/>
@coffeeplease it's for future usage in monitoring

Hello, I'm trying to run the cello ansible aws.yml and I'm stuck with the etcd not starting: TASK [Enable and start etcd services] ***********************************************************************************************************************

@baohua would you be able to give me some hints? I'm doing this in a fresh AWS account and not changed much in the vars/aws.yml file other than user key and region
</p>
<p><strong>careck</strong> (Sat, 28 Apr 2018 23:47:28 GMT):<br/>
OK, I did a complete fresh start. New ubuntu server and followed this guide: https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/worker_ansible_howto.md 
</p>

<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:35:46 GMT):<br/>
I have an odd question (new to Ansible here so making this hard for me) When trying to deploy a network I'm getting an error for `org_anchor` being undefined from https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/roles/deploy_compose/certsetup/tasks/apply.yml#L154
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:35:56 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to find reasons for why this might be the case. 
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:36:04 GMT):<br/>
It's really not obvious to me
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:43:27 GMT):<br/>
the only thing I can imagine is that the default we are giving it an empty object
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:54:06 GMT):<br/>
Ah the more I dig into this it looks as if there is an issue with the anchor_peers. Either I'm not getting any anchor peers to pull from or I'm not getting one for that org
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 16:36:38 GMT):<br/>
Looks like anchor_peers is empty and thus the root of my issues. We are going to continue to look deeper into this. I'll report back on the cause when I find it. If anyone knows of a quick place I should look please let me know. 
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 16:55:00 GMT):<br/>
I think we have isolated this down (credit to one of our developers Alex) 
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 16:55:04 GMT):<br/>
``` - name: Get peer object list
  set_fact:
    peers: |
      {{ peers | default([]) + [{'org':item.split('@')[1].split('.')[-1],
        'name':item.split('@')[1] | replace('.','-'),
        'role':item.split('@')[0]}] }}
  with_items: "{{ peerls }}"```
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 16:55:53 GMT):<br/>
This seems to be only adding one peer the the list of peers and overwriting that peer each time a new one is created for the list. 
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:25:05 GMT):<br/>
Syntactically this looks right though. So I'm confused as to why this is happening
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:53:25 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisFowers what does your configuration file look like? 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:53:34 GMT):<br/>
the empty list should work ok.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:54:11 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisFowers the code above is not doing what you suspected to do.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:46:48 GMT):<br/>
```
 network: {
    oceantest001: {
      cas: ["ca.speedydelivery"],
      peers: ["anchor@peer.speedydelivery", "worker@peer.speedydelivery"],
      orderers: ["orderer.speedydelivery"],
      zookeepers: ["zookeeper1"],
      kafkas: ["kafka1"]
    },
    oceantest002: {
      cas: ["ca.arrayofblocks"],
      peers: ["worker@peer.arrayofblocks", "anchor@peer.arrayofblocks"],
      orderers: ["orderer.arrayofblocks"],
      zookeepers: ["zookeeper2"],
      kafkas: ["kafka2"]
    }
  },```
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:48:26 GMT):<br/>
The code to set_fact for peers seems to only have `worker@peer.speedydelivery` for oceantest001 and `worker@peer.speedydelivery` for oceantest002
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:48:26 GMT):<br/>
The code to set_fact for peers seems to only have `worker@peer.speedydelivery` for oceantest001 and `anchor@peer.arrayofblocks` for oceantest002
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:48:48 GMT):<br/>
When we run the play
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:49:12 GMT):<br/>
So for ocean test one we don't ever get the anchor peer
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:49:40 GMT):<br/>
It looks as though as the play builds that list from the config it keeps replacing the one record in the array it's creating
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:49:44 GMT):<br/>
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:54:27 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=Ev2GBM5MXWc9tAxaB)  originally.. you're right
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:54:50 GMT):<br/>
The default empty object is fine afterall
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:56:09 GMT):<br/>
The real issue I see is that the ouput of `pearls` is 
``` 
 [
        "anchor@peer.speedydelivery", 
        "worker@peer.speedydelivery"
  ]
```

While the output of pears only contains the ` worker@peer.speedydelivery` peer. The anchor peer is not there
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:56:25 GMT):<br/>
So when we are trying to get the anchor peer from that list. It does not exist. 
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:56:56 GMT):<br/>
basically we are failing somehere here: 
``` 
- name: Get peer object list
  set_fact:
    peers: |
      {{ peers | default([]) + [{'org':item.split('@')[1].split('.')[-1],
        'name':item.split('@')[1] | replace('.','-'),
        'role':item.split('@')[0]}] }}
  with_items: "{{ peerls }}"
```
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:57:27 GMT):<br/>
However the code here looks to be right to me... So I don't really understand why peers ends up missing anchor@peer.speedydelivery
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:57:45 GMT):<br/>
Per the Ansible docs on appending lists... this looks right to me
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisFowers</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 22:58:40 GMT):<br/>
Btw... @tongli thank you for taking the time to reply to me earlier today. :joy: Wasn't sure if this was active anymore. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:31:38 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisFowers by looking at your config, I think the problem is that you have same peer name
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:31:41 GMT):<br/>
"worker@peer.arrayofblocks", "anchor@peer.arrayofblocks"
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:31:56 GMT):<br/>
your anchor and worker peer are the same peer.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:32:19 GMT):<br/>
If you want to have 2 peers there, you should have it like the following
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:32:32 GMT):<br/>
"worker@peer1st.arrayofblocks", "anchor@peer2nd.arrayofblocks"
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:32:50 GMT):<br/>
notice that the word before @ is really the role of a peer.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:33:01 GMT):<br/>
the name is actually the words after @ sign.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:34:00 GMT):<br/>
what worker@peer.arrayofblocks actually means the peer's name is peer in org arrayofblocks and is a worker.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:34:36 GMT):<br/>
vs anchor@peer.arrayofblocks, means the peer's name is also peer in org arrayofblocks, but it is allocated as anchor.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:35:14 GMT):<br/>
with your configuration, I think it is no surprising that you only see one peer, instead of multiple ones.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:35:26 GMT):<br/>
please change that as I suggested, then you should be fine.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:35:43 GMT):<br/>
glad that you are actually getting things going.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 23:35:57 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisFowers ask questions here, and I will try my best to help.

I checked the docker hub.There do not exist s390 images with version "latest" . Can we add this s390-latest image into official repo  ?
</p>

Hi all. Does cello support fab1.1 now ?

@bjwswang experimentally support

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:45:55 GMT):<br/>
@kiranarshakota what's the log?
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:53:31 GMT):<br/>
@baohua  { code: 400,

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:54:03 GMT):<br/>
oh, do you have the log when creating the new chain?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:54:28 GMT):<br/>
strange, this seems not directly related
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:56:03 GMT):<br/>
your post log is related to chain_apply, means no available chain in the pool when you wanna apply a new one
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:56:25 GMT):<br/>
@baohua in the operator dashboard logs i see this error , Not find matched available cluster for 5ae70a79ef4a2f00051d578e
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:56:46 GMT):<br/>
are you starting the service following our tutorial?
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:56:54 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:56:59 GMT):<br/>
http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:57:13 GMT):<br/>
i am trying to use this , https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:57:26 GMT):<br/>
it seems the chain started error, do you have the log when create a new chain?
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:00:00 GMT):<br/>
The steps i followed are , 1) Go to operator dashboard , 1a) Create a Host , 1b) Add a chain
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:00:19 GMT):<br/>
i can see the status of chain as running
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:02:34 GMT):<br/>
The i go to the user dashboard and do a Apply new Chain , then i am getting this error
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:03:04 GMT):<br/>
@baohua do you want operator dashboard logs or user dashboard logs
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:03:27 GMT):<br/>
oh, the service log. can be found by `make log`
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:03:44 GMT):<br/>
btw, is ur host active?
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:04:10 GMT):<br/>
yes it is active
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:07:03 GMT):<br/>
@baohua , in the Active chains , the Status shows as running , but the health shows as FAIL
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:07:31 GMT):<br/>
oh, that means the chain is started, but the health check is not passed.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:08:07 GMT):<br/>
after starting, cello will try to verify the blockchain service's health by checking whether the port is open to connect.
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:09:54 GMT):<br/>
what port should i open
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:13:20 GMT):<br/>
@baohua  what all ports from the member node should i open
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:13:57 GMT):<br/>
you need to check the worker nodes by `docker ps`
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:14:01 GMT):<br/>
to see the port mapped
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:14:12 GMT):<br/>
and make sure each blockchain container running successfully
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:23:05 GMT):<br/>
@baohua  , Thanks now i am able to Apply the chain
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:23:18 GMT):<br/>
I didn't open the ports required
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:23:51 GMT):<br/>
nice to know that

@tongli let's carry the discussion of the test net over here

@tongli I pointed you to the CNCF cluster: https://www.cncf.io/community/infrastructure-lab/

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 15:08:51 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I see someone filed a request: https://github.com/cncf/cluster/issues/62
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 15:09:56 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, taitao did that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 15:10:20 GMT):<br/>
that is fine. he is one of the cello maintainers.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 15:10:23 GMT):<br/>
@tongli that request was closed with a request for more information. I think there is clear synergy between Cello (especially with k8s) but the request was not very clear
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 15:11:18 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, that is fine. we can address that. thx
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 15:11:56 GMT):<br/>
@tongli if you use a successful request as a template, it might help you understand what CNCF and Packet want: https://github.com/cncf/cluster/issues/66

I have a concern about user and operator
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 04:52:01 GMT):<br/>
as mentioned in docs the user dashboard mapped to port 8081, but why I saw container mapping to 8080

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 13:41:21 GMT):<br/>
merged!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 13:56:19 GMT):<br/>
@baohua, @hightall WE have two directories one is called cello/docker and one is called cello/dockerhub. why do we have two and what are the purposes of each? thanks. Ry told me that the new ansible agent docker file should be in the dockerhub directory.
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:20:54 GMT):<br/>
maybe this need ask @baohua , dockerhub is used for images auto build on docker hub, docker dir is only for docker image build locally, I think it's redundancy. @tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:26:47 GMT):<br/>
@hightall I will look at the Makefile and see if we can remove this duplicates. it does not make sense to me, I may have missed some thing important.
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:27:12 GMT):<br/>
@tongli ok
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:36:29 GMT):<br/>
@tongli the reason is that the original docker dir is used for support multiple archs like ppc and s390. while Docker Hub only support x86 now. If you wanna dockerhub supports auto-build, then put under dockerhub as ry suggested.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:37:34 GMT):<br/>
we can not combine them together?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:37:53 GMT):<br/>
@baohua I am not seeing why there should be duplicates.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:38:47 GMT):<br/>
no, we cannot. as ppc and s390 have very different requirement from Dockerhub, hence we haven't find easier solution for that yet.
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:39:13 GMT):<br/>
@tongli we need docker build locally, because dockerhub build images from git code, but something you need local file, such as requirements.txt locally, so need use make docker instead of make dockerhub
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:39:40 GMT):<br/>
oh yeah
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:40:34 GMT):<br/>
if we stop the support on ppc and s390, then we can only have one dir. but i think we can keep them for now.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 14:40:49 GMT):<br/>
hmm. let me work with ry on this.

Can you point me on how/what has to be tweaked ?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 18:19:46 GMT):<br/>
@harsha are you doing this in vb or aws?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 18:19:57 GMT):<br/>
will need to look at your configuration files.
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 18:20:08 GMT):<br/>
I am doing this in vb.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 18:20:52 GMT):<br/>
oh. ok. in VB, it is a bit tricky, because VB has no many ways for your to control the VM.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 18:21:30 GMT):<br/>
in your VB env, you will need to have a vm which has docker and the user setup before you run the script.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 18:21:51 GMT):<br/>
it will be also helpful to look at your vb.yml file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 18:22:01 GMT):<br/>
remove your password in it if you have it.

from the UI of hyperledger explorer port 8150, transaction and block was produced, but the response to user dashboard UI port 8081 show error
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:42:39 GMT):<br/>
yes, seems there's problem when connecting to the orderer.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:43:59 GMT):<br/>
can u test in ur container (172.21.0.2), that can connect to orderer address (10.2.0.225) directly?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:47:22 GMT):<br/>
@baohua, IP 172.21.0.2 belong to 5f57ad230f004445b7f802654045f9df_peer0_org1 container and IP 10.2.0.225 is cello master
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:48:00 GMT):<br/>
yes, the error happens when peer connects to orderer service (10.2.0.225:51304)
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:49:54 GMT):<br/>
the traffics from cello master can reach 172.21.0.2 successfully
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:50:34 GMT):<br/>
because the Query request can be invoked normally
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:50:50 GMT):<br/>
but the Invoke request fails
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:51:16 GMT):<br/>
invoke will involve the orderer node, while query doesn't
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:51:57 GMT):<br/>
yes, anything I need to check here?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:56:56 GMT):<br/>
btw, can u confirm 172.21.0.2:7050 is peer, not orderer? as peer node should listen on port 7051 by default
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:57:14 GMT):<br/>
while orderer uses the port 7050
</p>

<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 02:59:59 GMT):<br/>
sorry, my mistake it's the IP of orderer
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 03:22:29 GMT):<br/>
ok, then that makes sense. there must be some thing wrong when client tried to connect to the orderer. can u test manually using the client?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 03:22:49 GMT):<br/>
and be noticed that use the 1.0.5 sdk, not 1.1
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 03:27:02 GMT):<br/>
@baohua, I think this issue may be related to this post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50134379/error-invoking-chaincode-using-node-js-sdk-typeerror-cannot-read-property-get
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 03:28:00 GMT):<br/>
ok, can u help create some jira issue, we will track the problem.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 03:28:32 GMT):<br/>
@hightall we should take care of this node sdk version problem.

<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 03:31:02 GMT):<br/>
@baohua seems that it's because grpc newest version

do I need to rebuild image for other services or I miss something here?
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 07:51:09 GMT):<br/>
because as I check the latest image of user-dashboard (3 days ago) in dockerhub containing the issue of grpc (1.11.3) with fabric-client
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 07:51:55 GMT):<br/>
and a fix for this has been provided recently, so I need to create a local image of user-dashboard containing the fix in fabric-client
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 07:52:22 GMT):<br/>
@hightall do you have any suggestion for mycase?
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 07:54:20 GMT):<br/>
@giniz you can use make docker build local image, oh, looks like there no Dockerfile.in in docker dir, or can you move the dockerfile into the docker dir and try to build user-dashboard locally?
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 07:55:59 GMT):<br/>
am using the dockerfile at https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/dockerhub/latest/user-dashboard
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 07:56:26 GMT):<br/>
do you mean I need to use another file or move this file to another dir?
</p>
<p><strong>giniz</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 08:13:51 GMT):<br/>
@hightall I tried copy Dockerfile in above path to cello/user-dashboard and built image here but still got error

<p><strong>acombeau</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 09:48:57 GMT):<br/>
Anyone know how is it possible to modify the READ/WRITE access to a peer ? I saw that there are two possibility one on the Chaincode, the other one on the config file. can anyone help me to find the right file?
Is there a link with this ? :
`You can also see that the endorsement policy has been modified to -P "OR ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer','Org3MSP.peer')".  `

The idea is to limit the access as for example in the sample : `parameter 1 : A` -> can invoke or query but ` parameter 1: B` can only query

@baohua @hightall please see this dockerfile to post the ansible agent docker image onto docker hub. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/21533
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 13:53:55 GMT):<br/>
it seems to me that DockerHub can not really produce a source code tree of a project, you will have to do everything in your Dockerfile. that is probably the most of the reason why we have two sets of docker files.

@here, cello developers, currently at ci we do very little for our build. I am planning to add at least the container build target as part of the ci gating process. I tried that process which takes about 4 minuets with all the docker containers getting built. I think that is an acceptable time. If no objections, I will make that change in a patch set.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 14:17:57 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @hightall The jira issue for that was created here https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-356. and the patch is here https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/21615. please review and comment
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 14:19:27 GMT):<br/>
looks fine

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 15:03:04 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @hightall after added the docker target, it indeed timedout, on my own machine , it only took 4 minutes to get everything done. (without any base images).
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 15:03:22 GMT):<br/>
but at the gate, it obviously took more than 15 minutes, the build failed.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 15:03:51 GMT):<br/>
I am debating if it is a good thing to build the docker containers for every patch set.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 15:05:13 GMT):<br/>
but I am thinking we should do some check at least, how about randomly pick one container to built? vs pick a specific container to build vs build all containers?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 15:05:18 GMT):<br/>
let me know what you think
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 15:05:43 GMT):<br/>
I think this is one task that we discussed at the last meeting, we can talk about it at this week's meeting.

Hello, some newbie doubts, in case I configure "docker host" Cello will deploy all containers only in that host (it will not use the other hosts available on the list to balance the amount of containers)?
</p>
<p><strong>Nicolas 51</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 15:20:15 GMT):<br/>
I added several docker hosts as independent workers but I'm seeing that when adding chains, all containers go to the same host

So I switched to kubernetes and when I set up a host I get this

So I switched to kubernetes and when I set up a host I get this

@Gvedam if you use ansible agent, the fabric network is not integrated with cello dashboard. it gives you a multi node fabric network and created a channel.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:45:13 GMT):<br/>
joined all the peers to that channel. at that point, you should start writing your own apps.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:45:31 GMT):<br/>
or deploy your own apps to the network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:46:23 GMT):<br/>
if you are using docker (not k8s), the composer should have been setup for you, you can use composer to see things.

@JordanDearsley why the worker_api is tcp://127.0.0.1:2375? that means the local addr inside the container.

@JordanDearsley if you use cello ansible agent, it does that already.

it will set you up with composer playground and hook it up with the fabric network it creates.

@Gvedam if you are using ansible agent, it uses overlay network, there is no port mapping whatsoever.

Hey guys, while trying to set up Ansible I ran into this bug at src/agent/ansible/roles/env_flanneld/fastinitnode/tasks/apply.yml:76. It couldn't find the ssh keys on the remote server, adding this to the copy line seemed to fix it:  remote_src:true
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 16:13:00 GMT):<br/>
@JordanDearsley look at this image https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/cello-ansible-agent/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 16:13:29 GMT):<br/>
it was built to help people avoid the ansible controller setting up
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 16:14:00 GMT):<br/>
if you simply download that, then you can pretty much running it just like you have everything setup local.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 16:14:21 GMT):<br/>
it includes a ssh-agent inside the container, so that you do not have to deal with that headache.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 16:14:53 GMT):<br/>
also look at the first part of this doc on how to use it. https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/worker_ansible_docker.md
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 16:16:52 GMT):<br/>
the image will be looking for the ssh key pair at /opt/agent/vars directory, so you can hookup that a directory there with all your other configuration files.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 16:17:17 GMT):<br/>
make sure that the key file name is fd and fd.pub, that is what the ssh-agent will be looking for.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 16:17:31 GMT):<br/>

@tongli I watched your youtube video and tried to recreate on an AWS instance, but I end up getting a permission denied error and the instances never actually start up. I created the ssh keygen in ~/.ssh/, fd and fd.pub. I put my aws ID and secret, then ran the same command you did. Any idea why it wouldn't work?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=H4jEGYp5hYGrGRHom) @Gvedam , it means that we need to run from the same machine when the fabric is setup right?
</p>
<p><strong>kiranarshakota</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 16:47:29 GMT):<br/>
@tongli , i have setup the network using Cello , now i am planning to integrate using Node SDK from other machine using the connection profile settings , but not able to connect to the peer because when i see the netstat -tulpn , i don't see anything running on 7051 , but the peer container is up and running , how do i connect from another machine to the system in which peer is deployed? 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 17:15:20 GMT):<br/>
@kiranarshakota if you are using ansible agent to setup fabric network, assumption is that your apps will run on the same network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 17:15:31 GMT):<br/>
and all fabric stuff running on the overlay network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 17:15:59 GMT):<br/>
simply looking at the network on the node may not reveal what you are looking for.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 17:16:45 GMT):<br/>
if you do an inspection of container, you should see them having ip address like 172.xxx
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 17:17:10 GMT):<br/>
which should not be the network segment where your servers are on since this is a virtual network.

@tongli Hi there, I try to run the ansible controller in a docker container to launch fabric on aws. I've configured the files, and the script runs successfully. However, no instances are actually running on aws during or after I run the script. Any Ideas? Here is my output:
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 14:59:43 GMT):<br/>
https://pastebin.com/HxtjPTQ5
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:00:32 GMT):<br/>
The dashboard is also inaccessible on all, so I'm assuming they are not running whatsoever
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:02:24 GMT):<br/>
seems to me that you run the only first step which is to provision 3 nodes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:02:42 GMT):<br/>
then next 2 steps are initialize the node and setupfabric.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:02:57 GMT):<br/>
if you do not really want to do that, there is one short cut.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:03:12 GMT):<br/>
do basically this
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:03:30 GMT):<br/>
```docker run --rm -v ~/Desktop/opt/agent/run:/opt/agent/run -v ~/Desktop/opt/agent/vars:/opt/agent/vars hyperledger/cello-ansible-agent ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:03:41 GMT):<br/>
that is just one step which accomplish all 3 things
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:03:46 GMT):<br/>
My end goal is to have fabric running with composer playground on the network
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:03:52 GMT):<br/>
after that is done, you should have a functioning fabric network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:03:57 GMT):<br/>
right.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:04:14 GMT):<br/>
Oh I see, let me give it a try. thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:04:20 GMT):<br/>
that one step does all that for you and composer playground should be working.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:04:32 GMT):<br/>
since you already run the step 1, you probably want to remove that first.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:04:50 GMT):<br/>
so the command to do that is this
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:04:58 GMT):<br/>
Another quick question, is it possible to have both Kubernetes and playground on the same network? I noticed they both use port 8080 for their dashboards
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:05:04 GMT):<br/>
```docker run --rm -v ~/Desktop/opt/agent/run:/opt/agent/run -v ~/Desktop/opt/agent/vars:/opt/agent/vars hyperledger/cello-ansible-agent ansible-playbook -e "mode=destroy env=aws cloud_type=aws" provcluster.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:05:17 GMT):<br/>
notice the word destroy instead of apply?
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:05:33 GMT):<br/>
Oh I see, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:05:40 GMT):<br/>
the above command cleans up everything you just did.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:05:55 GMT):<br/>
And about Kubernetes/playground?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:06:03 GMT):<br/>
then use the one command to do everything altogerher
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:06:20 GMT):<br/>
```docker run --rm -v ~/Desktop/opt/agent/run:/opt/agent/run -v ~/Desktop/opt/agent/vars:/opt/agent/vars hyperledger/cello-ansible-agent ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:07:01 GMT):<br/>
looks like that you have already got ssh key file in the right place, I think you should be ok.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:07:19 GMT):<br/>
if you see some problems, it will be always good to post here, so that I can take a look.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:24:34 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Turns out I was looking at the wrong region on AWS, had about 25 instances running when I checked, lol.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:25:01 GMT):<br/>
@JordanDearsley haha.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:25:28 GMT):<br/>
yeah, probably remove them all and change the vars/aws.yml file to use the right region or just look at the right region.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:26:11 GMT):<br/>
also it will be really useful, if you pick a ubuntu 16.04 image which already has python and docker ce installed.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:26:48 GMT):<br/>
it will save time. sometimes using cloud init, due to the network issues, the VMs may not get provisioned very well.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:27:12 GMT):<br/>
I normally just create my own ubuntu 16.04 image with whatever I need, then I use that image.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:27:28 GMT):<br/>
just a sort of trick if you want to try tit.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:27:32 GMT):<br/>
try it.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:28:58 GMT):<br/>
Okay, so now the instances run. but I get this error at  [Create the certificate files]:
fatal: [52.14.97.95]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "cmd": "/opt/gopath/bc1st/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/build/bin/cryptogen generate --config crypto-config.yml --output keyfiles", "msg": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory", "rc": 2}
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:29:58 GMT):<br/>
right.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:30:09 GMT):<br/>
you need to specify where to find the cryptogen,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:30:14 GMT):<br/>
this is actually a good sign.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:30:19 GMT):<br/>
you just need to configure it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:30:31 GMT):<br/>
in the vars/bc1st.yml file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:31:06 GMT):<br/>
this is the value for repo.bin I think.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:31:09 GMT):<br/>
```https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/hyperledger-fabric-build/linux-amd64-ff6f6dbffed57efb9f7d8886b4a47949ce2d4396/hyperledger-fabric-build-linux-amd64-ff6f6dbffed57efb9f7d8886b4a47949ce2d4396.tar.gz```

@tgehrke Ohai!

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:31:47 GMT):<br/>
it probably will be good to have that value in the bc1st.yml as a default.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:32:15 GMT):<br/>
if someone put up a patch to just change that value, I will +2 to it. easy contribution.

@tongli Is it possible to have both the kubernetes and playground dashboards available?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:49:54 GMT):<br/>
@JordanDearsley haha, I did not have time to get it in k8s land yet.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:50:00 GMT):<br/>
it will take some time to do that
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:50:41 GMT):<br/>
cello ansible agent also sets up k8s env and overlay network all that kind of stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:50:49 GMT):<br/>
it is pretty complicated.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:51:31 GMT):<br/>
Okay no problem! We're still in early development so we can live without it
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:51:34 GMT):<br/>
Also, thanks so much for your help with all this!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:51:36 GMT):<br/>
all this is for the users to be able to use it easily.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:52:07 GMT):<br/>
once you get a handle of this, you will like what you accomplished with just few commands.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:52:19 GMT):<br/>
It's quite amazing
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:52:36 GMT):<br/>
you can easily change the vars/bc1st.yml to make whatever fabric network you want.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:52:48 GMT):<br/>
such as number of orgs, peers, how you want to name them etc.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:53:04 GMT):<br/>
we are in process of deploy onto an existing k8s env,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:53:35 GMT):<br/>
once that is done, if you have a k8s cluster, cello ansible agent will be able to use the same configuration file to deploy onto the cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:53:56 GMT):<br/>
of course, if you want cello ansible agent to stand up a k8s env, it can do that as well.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 15:54:25 GMT):<br/>
any way, if you find this helpful, I hope that you can start help fixing bugs or issues for the ansible agent.

I was trying to run worker-node I followed every step and was able to regenerate docker service script and restart the docker engine. When I was trying to run docker -H worker_node_ip:2375 info at Master I was getting device not found, is the docker deamon running?
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 18:31:14 GMT):<br/>
I was running Master on one VM and worker on my physical ubantu 16.04. Could someone plz suggest me on this.

@baohua @hightall Please review the patch set. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22001/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:23:25 GMT):<br/>
docs have been updated to reflect this.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:24:20 GMT):<br/>
@here, we recently have added support to ansible agent so that you can deploy fabric network onto an existing k8s cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:24:47 GMT):<br/>
how recently?  Like within the past week or past day?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:24:48 GMT):<br/>
here is the patch set. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22001/ we are very excited about this addition.
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:24:56 GMT):<br/>
oh I see
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:25:05 GMT):<br/>
@vcoss still a patch set, need to merge.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:26:03 GMT):<br/>
before that, we have ansible agent sets up k8s, then deploy fabric network onto the k8s , but it can not deploy onto an existing k8s such as google container env.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:26:57 GMT):<br/>
with that patch set, you can choose either to stand up your own k8s using ansible agent or you can choose to stand up fabric network onto a third party created k8s cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:27:14 GMT):<br/>
it really just takes one command to do that.
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:27:22 GMT):<br/>
how do I patch?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:27:37 GMT):<br/>
git pull https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/cello refs/changes/01/22001/8

that is the one line command to do it.

<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:29:48 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:30:51 GMT):<br/>

with this patch will I be able to upload a .bna directly into the fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:07:32 GMT):<br/>
without playground
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:12:01 GMT):<br/>
do I run `ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply env=bc1st deploy_type=k8s" setupfabric.yml` inside or outside of the node?

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:28:03 GMT):<br/>
@vcoss that patch has nothing to do with composer.
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:28:32 GMT):<br/>
it allows you to upload fabrics to third parties
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:28:38 GMT):<br/>
that patch set is to allow users to deploy fabric network onto existing k8s
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:29:07 GMT):<br/>
to deploy fabric network onto 3rd party k8s cluster, yes.
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:29:38 GMT):<br/>
is there a reason I timeout when I upload to the fabric tho?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:30:11 GMT):<br/>
I do not know what you were trying to do and in what kind of env.
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:30:41 GMT):<br/>
im trying to upload a bna without playground.  I can upload the .bna with playground, but it times out when I attempt the samething with console
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:31:47 GMT):<br/>
upload an existing .bna to the fabric created by cello/ansible
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:31:59 GMT):<br/>
using console commands
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:40:26 GMT):<br/>
its on an aws, I log in and download composer and attempt to upload the .bna to the existing fabric
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:51:02 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I think @vcoss and I are having the same issue, deploying a bna onto a fabric network on aws. I've tried installing composer-cli on the master node and running "composer network install"... The response is timeout from all the peers. Am I trying to deploy the BNA correctly?
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:51:51 GMT):<br/>
For what we're working on it's necessary that we deploy via command line
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:52:00 GMT):<br/>
@JordanDearsley in a meeting right now.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 13:52:06 GMT):<br/>
can look at it later.

@tongli great! thanks so much. Sorry for the trouble

Hello, when trying to create a chain, I get the following error: ERROR [agent.docker.docker_swarm] [docker_swarm.py:274    get_swarm_node_ip()] - 404 Client Error: Not Found ("No such container: d690aa9db35b467a887c5c7d6bd51dee_peer0.[23/1805]
ple.com")
</p>
<p><strong>h0cin</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 16:16:16 GMT):<br/>
it seems that it create the container but it cannot find it, despite the container is created:
("No such container: d690aa9db35b467a887c5c7d6bd51dee_peer0.org1.example.com")

It could be a difference between the created name and the expected name on the status of creation check ?

<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 18:37:52 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Any ideas on how to load an existing .bna to the master node's fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:20:52 GMT):<br/>
I think before you run  setup fabric, you just need to place your own .bna file in  secrets/networks
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:21:07 GMT):<br/>
where you already see one .bna file, you can place your own there.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:21:14 GMT):<br/>
then do the following
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:22:03 GMT):<br/>
```export NETWORKNAME=thefilename of the .bna file```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:22:39 GMT):<br/>
this way, you specified network will be deployed instead of the carauction-network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:22:44 GMT):<br/>
@vcoss 
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:24:28 GMT):<br/>
Thanks!  How do you redeploy the .bna file after the network has started, is that even possible?
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:24:31 GMT):<br/>
via the command line
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:24:44 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:25:04 GMT):<br/>
possible.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:25:41 GMT):<br/>
I think you should do the following
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:28:06 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=bc1st NETWORKNAME=whateveryournetwork" setupfabric.yml --skip-tags="fabricbuild,certssetup,fabricsetup"```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:28:14 GMT):<br/>
give that a try, it should work.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:28:36 GMT):<br/>
remember place the .bna file in the same directory that carauction.bna is.
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 21:51:58 GMT):<br/>
@tongli for `export NETWORKNAME=thefilename of the .bna file` do I include the .bna or just the file name with out it?
</p>
<p><strong>vcoss</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 22:08:57 GMT):<br/>
I deleted carauction.bna and replaced it with mine however when I run it while exporting NETWORKNAME it replaces it with carauction in the fabric and my bna is nowhere to be found.
</p>

@baohua @hightall please take a look at the patch set .

</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 15:01:49 GMT):<br/>
Where do I specify the version? And how can I pull the latest from the bna?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 15:02:13 GMT):<br/>
add in -e "aaaa=stuff"
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 15:02:15 GMT):<br/>
try that.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 15:02:26 GMT):<br/>
exactly that?
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 15:02:29 GMT):<br/>
lol
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 15:03:00 GMT):<br/>
like -e "project_version=1.1.0" I think in addition to what already is there.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 15:03:34 GMT):<br/>
ah I see, thanks! Didn't see the variable name in the error. Really appreciate your help with this. I'll give it a go
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 15:03:48 GMT):<br/>
good luck.

My guess is that the environment variable is effective when running ansible locally, but the ansible plays ran on the AWS server don't have that environment variable set, and it defaults to carauction-network

@tongli I feel like ```ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=bc1st NETWORKNAME=whateveryournetwork" setupfabric.yml --skip-tags="fabricbuild,certssetup,fabricsetup"``` may still be a bit overkill just to update the chaincode.

I created an ansible play to upload the new bna, run composer network install, and run composer network upgrade. The install works fine, but when trying to upgrade the network, I get `"Response from attempted peer comms was an error: Error: 2 UNKNOWN: chaincode error (status: 500, message: cannot get package for chaincode (empty-business-network:0.0.6))", "Command failed"]}`

@miahfost great to see u today!
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:07:14 GMT):<br/>
related to the fabric-utils projects, it will be nice you can help create an tracking issue at https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/CE/
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:07:16 GMT):<br/>
Thank you very much!
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:07:23 GMT):<br/>
And add updates there :)
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:07:32 GMT):<br/>
Makes sense, I'll do that.
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:07:56 GMT):<br/>
I think our team needs to bring some more documentation as well so I'm working on that.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:08:12 GMT):<br/>
sure, and feel free to ping me or @tongli with questions, and feel free to use the maillist too: cello@lists.hyperledger.org
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:08:38 GMT):<br/>
definitely, we treasure document as important as code!
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:08:46 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I think I'll jump on the mailing list since the set of people who are here are not always the same set who are on the list.
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:09:22 GMT):<br/>
Makes sense, modern software is so complex in its configuration that good clear documentation is vital! :-)

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:09:45 GMT):<br/>
#miahfost, Jeremiah, ansible agent of cello seems do exactly what fabric util does if I heard you right.
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:10:13 GMT):<br/>
That may be the case @tongli, it appears they're very similar.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:10:25 GMT):<br/>
ansible agent uses ansible to produce k8s deployment files according to a configuration file (which defines wanted fabric network topology),
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:10:31 GMT):<br/>
From what I understand from our team however, there may be some things we do slightly differently.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:11:05 GMT):<br/>
@miahfost ok, happy to discuss and consolidate. 
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:11:10 GMT):<br/>
At the very least, I think our folks should look at the work that you've done so we can understand it. 
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:11:31 GMT):<br/>
Sometimes even our company suffers from "Not Invented Here" and that is not useful in open source
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:11:35 GMT):<br/>
will be very glad to hear the differences.
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:11:47 GMT):<br/>
But, on the other hand, if there is something useful in our code, we're happy to participate.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:12:12 GMT):<br/>
cello ansible agent can be run as a container as well.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:13:02 GMT):<br/>
@miahfost yeah, I am sure. will be happy to work together to improve
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:13:26 GMT):<br/>
@tongli What is the URL to the code you've created? I'm sure you've posted it here  a hundred times, but I didn't put it in my browser. :/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:13:36 GMT):<br/>
https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/cello-ansible-agent
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:13:50 GMT):<br/>
that is where you find the container if you want to give it a try
</p>
<p><strong>miahfost</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:14:18 GMT):<br/>
Cool, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:14:18 GMT):<br/>
all the playbooks for ansible agent is here https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/src/agent/ansible
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:14:23 GMT):<br/>

@miahfost users can create very big network or very small network, they can do that by changing that file or creating their own as long as they follow the same format.

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:19:42 GMT):<br/>
the specific command to do this is just one command.

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:19:51 GMT):<br/>
or something like this.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:20:01 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply env=bc1st deploy_type=k8s" setupfabric.yml```

Interesting. This is useful info.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:50:30 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Sorry to bother, any idea what would cause this error from the apply.yml I posted earlier? `"Response from attempted peer comms was an error: Error: 2 UNKNOWN: chaincode error (status: 500, message: cannot get package for chaincode (empty-business-network:0.0.6))", "Command failed"]}`
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:51:10 GMT):<br/>
The error occurs when I run `composer network upgrade`
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:51:22 GMT):<br/>
@JordanDearsley looks like the composer can not find where your .bna file.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:52:13 GMT):<br/>
Shouldn't `composer network install` install it in the correct place on all the peers? The installation task runs successfully
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:53:53 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I've been following these docs: https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/business-network/upgrading-bna
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:53:54 GMT):<br/>
I would think it depends where you run that command.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:54:11 GMT):<br/>
I run the command on the ansible controller from my local docker container
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:54:19 GMT):<br/>
I suggest that you do the following.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:54:25 GMT):<br/>
It moves the bna successfully
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:54:54 GMT):<br/>
1. use ansible agent to setup the network which comes with carauction.bna installed and configured. you should be able to verify that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:55:15 GMT):<br/>
and the playground should be up running as well. you should be able to run and test from a browser
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:55:34 GMT):<br/>
2. once all these things are confirmed, you know that you have a running network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:56:00 GMT):<br/>
3. to add more networks, you can log into the first node where composer is running.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:56:24 GMT):<br/>
during the process of step1, all necessary composer containers have been downloaded
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:56:33 GMT):<br/>
including the composer command line tool.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:56:41 GMT):<br/>
I've managed steps one and two, confirmed that it's installed on playground correctly as well
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:57:26 GMT):<br/>
Regarding step three, doesn't ansible take care of the login? I'm running on the builder node
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:57:27 GMT):<br/>
then you can log into the first node, with composer command line tool container (do not remember exact name of the container image), you should be able to follow the right process to add more things onto.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:57:51 GMT):<br/>
@JordanDearsley what login?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:58:03 GMT):<br/>
once ansible agent is done, it does not do anything more.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:58:44 GMT):<br/>
it gives you the connection profiles about the network,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:58:57 GMT):<br/>
after that, it is all on you when you need to add more things onto.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:59:16 GMT):<br/>
Okay I'll try it out
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:59:17 GMT):<br/>
Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:59:24 GMT):<br/>
yeah. good luck.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:00:13 GMT):<br/>
What directories would I need to mount when running the composer cli container?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:00:56 GMT):<br/>
take a look at the playbook which agent uses.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:01:05 GMT):<br/>
I do not remember off top of head.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:01:14 GMT):<br/>
Okay, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:01:29 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/roles/deploy_compose/composersetup/tasks/apply.yml
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:01:33 GMT):<br/>
should be in that file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:01:34 GMT):<br/>
I think
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:01:54 GMT):<br/>
maybe here https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/src/agent/ansible/roles/deploy_compose/composersetup/tasks/apply.yml#L32
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:02:05 GMT):<br/>
you can verify that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:02:22 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I think you should follow the exact same steps in that playbook to add new network.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:02:34 GMT):<br/>
missing any step probably will not work.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:03:09 GMT):<br/>
I think you should be able to just run the playbook with new parameter.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:03:42 GMT):<br/>
I am not sure why it wont work. you may just need to skip standing up the playground container since it is already running.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:03:47 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately, there's no plays that make use of `composer network upgrade`
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:04:01 GMT):<br/>
I was hoping to contribute that to the project
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:04:14 GMT):<br/>
yeah, that will be very nice.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:04:30 GMT):<br/>
Any idea why the code I posted earlier wouldn't work?
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:05:10 GMT):<br/>
Specifically, running this on the builder node fails:
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:05:16 GMT):<br/>
```- name: Upgrade network bna
  command: >-
    docker run -v {{ localhome }}:/home/composer/.composer
    -v {{ fabricworkdir }}:{{ fabricworkdir }}
    hyperledger/composer-cli network upgrade
    -c PeerAdmin@{{ peerorgs[0] }} -n {{ networkname }}
    -V {{ version }}
  tags: "upgradenetwork"```
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:09:19 GMT):<br/>
the bna is installed successfully on the network, it's just when I try to run the `upgrade` command, which tells all peer nodes to use the latest version, they can't seem to find the package.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:37:26 GMT):<br/>
@JordanDearsley I do not really know what problem might be. I wonder if you can manually do these steps to verify each step described by playbook, then you probably can get more info.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:38:22 GMT):<br/>
when you do these things manually, all things including your bna file should be available.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:38:46 GMT):<br/>
playbooks basically do exactly things but just automate it a bit.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:38:58 GMT):<br/>
Okay will do, thanks. I have a feeling I'll get the same result
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:39:15 GMT):<br/>
On the builder node, where should the bna be stored?
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:39:30 GMT):<br/>
prior to installation
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:39:36 GMT):<br/>
if you get same errors, then you can take the error to composer channel, they may provide some help.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:39:48 GMT):<br/>
Good point, will do
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:40:14 GMT):<br/>
in terms of where bna file, please look at the playbook.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 14:40:31 GMT):<br/>
how the nba file was copied to and where and how it is mounted.

Hey there, wanted to know if there is a basefabric VDI image to use? If not, how do we configure the network settings on VirtualBox? I have the ansible script starting the instances, but nothing past "Wait until the servers are up and running"

When I was trying to add host in the dashboard I was facing this error:  I have master running in one IP and worker on other IP.  Request Error 400: http://192.168.1.196:8080/api/host

Could some one please suggest me on this

When I checked the network it looked like

Does cello creates a network ? if so why the network is not created here? Do I get some suggestions
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 13:24:14 GMT):<br/>
Can I get some guidelines or links to start Cello from scratch.
Thank you in advance.

Any body can help?

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:23:01 GMT):<br/>
@Vanitha not sure what your goal is. if you like to stand up a fabric network on multiple nodes, you probably can try the ansible agent which makes that effort a lot easier especially we have created anisible agent docker container which help you to get all the stuff you need.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:25:06 GMT):<br/>
@Vanitha The problem is that ansible agent sets up fabric network which is not integrated with cello dashboard.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:25:26 GMT):<br/>
so that you do not see the things visually.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:25:45 GMT):<br/>
you will have to use command lines tool to do things.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:26:01 GMT):<br/>
but if you really want to learn fabric, I think that is the way to go.
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:26:11 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Can I get some links to start working on Cello. I also went through video on youtube I was trying to establish communication between master and worker node. I am in initial stage of learning.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:26:48 GMT):<br/>
you mean to start contributing to cello or start using ansible agent?
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:27:29 GMT):<br/>
Cello
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:28:11 GMT):<br/>
look into the cello wiki page please.
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:28:20 GMT):<br/>
I guess first I need to have a clear picture on cello and then ca move to ansible

wiki page
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:31:16 GMT):<br/>
I followed the same link and while adding the host I was getting the error is the docker deamon running succesfully
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:31:52 GMT):<br/>
in that case, it seems to me that you are already down the different path than using ansible agent.
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:31:56 GMT):<br/>
That is where I was stuck. I have master on VM and worker running on my local Ubantu machine
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:32:22 GMT):<br/>
@baohua and others probably can provide more help.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:32:36 GMT):<br/>
if you were using ansible agent, I will be able to help a bit more.
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:33:31 GMT):<br/>
Okay I will start working with Ansible part too, but would like to know y this is not happening to me
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:33:40 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:34:14 GMT):<br/>
just let you know, you do not have to use any other part of cello if you use ansible agent.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:34:38 GMT):<br/>
it is almost like a complete independent project and it uses ansible playbooks to setup everything.
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:35:49 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  I have a .bna file and I have deployed that into fabric network can I connect Ansible part to that fabric network?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:36:30 GMT):<br/>
ansible agent is the tool to stand up fabric network. once the network is up running, it does not do anything more. its job is done.
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:40:18 GMT):<br/>
if I connect my up end running Fabric part with the Ansible(that means I can have multiple organizations on multiple VM's right)? 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:42:43 GMT):<br/>
not sure what you mean "my up end running"
</p>
<p><strong>Vanitha</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:46:47 GMT):<br/>
It's running successfully without any errors

<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:04:22 GMT):<br/>
@tongli would you mind reviewing my patch if you get the chance? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:13:29 GMT):<br/>
@JordanDearsley yes, I will. thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:15:17 GMT):<br/>
@JordanDearsley looks ok.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:15:38 GMT):<br/>
this is simply do an update, not necessarily  adding a new bna, right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:16:07 GMT):<br/>
I was hoping that you can add some scripts to allow new bna to be deployed or improve what we have.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:16:29 GMT):<br/>
approved. need one more +2 though to merge it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:16:37 GMT):<br/>
please ask Baohua to do that.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:21:20 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I believe that the update will replace the existing bna. So you could put a different bna file in secrets/networks and it should update the same. Do you mean creating a separate new business network on the same nodes? If I find the time I'll write that as well
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:21:39 GMT):<br/>
@baohua Would you mind +2 to merge?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:21:42 GMT):<br/>
right.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:22:17 GMT):<br/>
It's just `composer install` and `composer start`, shouldn't be too bad
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:22:35 GMT):<br/>
adding completely new bna. which I think playbook already does it, but may need a bit doc, and test.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:23:04 GMT):<br/>
like I mentioned before once the network is running, it already has carauction going.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:23:08 GMT):<br/>
Yeah it may, I'll have to check on that
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:23:14 GMT):<br/>
if someone wants to add more bna
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:23:32 GMT):<br/>
Your command from last week may work then
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:23:44 GMT):<br/>
I am pretty sure it does that already, just need a bit more doc.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:23:48 GMT):<br/>
it should.
</p>
<p><strong>JordanDearsley</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:23:58 GMT):<br/>
I'll test it out when I get the chance

when execute command: $ MASTER_NODE_IP=xx.xx.xx.xx make setup-worker, the log error like this :family_mwgb: 
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on 192.168.1.49:/,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
       (for several filesystems (e.g. nfs, cifs) you might
       need a /sbin/mount.<type> helper program)

       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail or so.

HI Heroes: when I add chaincode use dashboard,just select one .go file, but my chaincode has more than one file, and as well more than one packet, so how can I install my chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>sunyoubo</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 12:27:06 GMT):<br/>
when I just select the main.go, the main can't import packet, so how can I let the chaincode container know all .go files? In other words, how can I mapping my chaincode into container?

playbook awsk8s.yml doesnot create public ip 's automatically as shown in the video @tongli ,Are there any additional steps which are required which are not mentioned in the video ? and btw the awsk8s ansible files are different from one in the video any update on that would be a great help.thanks

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 13:54:57 GMT):<br/>
@chandrakanthMamillapalli it has been creating public ips when vm gets created. I have not recently tried it on aws. It could be some package or api change

@phulei 
</p>
<p><strong>phulei</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 18:08:35 GMT):<br/>
only on the worker node 
</p>
<p><strong>phulei</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 18:09:33 GMT):<br/>
as we need 2375 to listen on the worker node :- as master node want it as it gives instruction to spin the instances there

<p><strong>phulei</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 18:31:54 GMT):<br/>
@chandrakanthMamillapalli - you need to do  "MASTER_NODE_IP=xx.xx.xx.xx make setup-worker" to overcome from the nfs error 
</p>
<p><strong>phulei</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 18:32:17 GMT):<br/>
ok !

<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 18:33:13 GMT):<br/>
I never used the interface to invoke, I do it from script  
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 18:33:42 GMT):<br/>
there was some issue with the invoking GUI, not sure if it is fixed

<p><strong>phulei</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 18:33:48 GMT):<br/>
hmm 
</p>
<p><strong>Amir</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 18:34:51 GMT):<br/>
under `src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0/scripts` there are scripts

Copying the text so it is more readable: Hi everyone, it looks like the most recent commit (85b39745e90a24a6ded4ce662e50e88954f9c0d6) to the Cello repo is messing something up with Composer. Running the most recent commit yields an error that looks like it has something to do with the generated configtx.yml file. (That recent commit does have modifications to the configtx.j2 file) Doing a git reset one commit back (to 9162c3dbdc47ebc270d3c07a4b932f2946504ba1) and re-running the playbooks is successful. Below is a screenshot of the error. Has anyone else had this problem?

Hello. I'm using ansible + AWS to deploy Fabric network. Cello 0.8.0. Could you briefly explain to me how do you create docker overlay network? I'm familiar with creating an overlay network using etcd or flannel+etcd. But I see that you use flannel+etc+skydns+registrator. What is the purpose of skydns and registrator? I can't find any information about how to build docker network using this tools. The reason I asking you is that I want to improve this overlay network as it is not a fault tolerant. 
BTW do you have any guide how I can contribute to the Cello project? I have some changes related to deploying CA cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 15:55:06 GMT):<br/>
I've found the guide how to contribute
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:51:39 GMT):<br/>
@krabradosty ansible agent uses flanneld to set up overlay network so that all fabric nodes can communicate with each other regardless which node they will be created on. It also sets up a dns server so that fabric nodes (peers, orderers,etc) can all reference names to reach each other.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:52:17 GMT):<br/>
@krabradosty not sure why you are saying it is not fault tolerant.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:52:38 GMT):<br/>
can you provide a bit more info why you make that conclusion? thx
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:53:15 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Because of this:
```
# only have skydns container running on the first node
- name: Start skydns service
  command: >-
    docker run -d --name skydns.{{ node_name }} --net=host --restart always -p 53:53/udp
    skynetservices/skydns:2.5.3a -machines {{ etcd_cluster }}
    -nameservers {{ nameservers.stdout_lines | join(',') }}
    -addr {{ node_ip }}:53 -local {{ node_name }}.{{ domain }}
  when: node_ip == hostvars[groups['allnodes'][0]].private_ip
```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:53:56 GMT):<br/>
so you want to have multiple instances of dns?
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:54:28 GMT):<br/>
I think yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:54:43 GMT):<br/>
sure, you could start many
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:54:58 GMT):<br/>
skydns uses etcd as backend
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:55:13 GMT):<br/>
which is already by default use 3 nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:55:26 GMT):<br/>
you can start one skydns per physical node if you want to.
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:55:56 GMT):<br/>
I will try, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:56:01 GMT):<br/>
there is nothing prevent you from doing that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:56:36 GMT):<br/>
but you may have to change your docker configuration so the docker dns will point to your own dns
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:56:51 GMT):<br/>
do not know if you can point to multiple dns servers
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 16:57:22 GMT):<br/>
normally the dns load should be really light, that is the reason why only one was setup.
</p>

@tongli I have 4 nodes where fabric network is deployed. On the fabric001 I executed `./etcdctl ls /skydns/fabricnet` and got output:

``` 
Entries for fabric002 containers are disappeared. I expected this. But what about fabric001 containers? It's strange. After I turned on fabric002, entries for both of nodes have been added to the etcd.
Also if I  switched off all the nodes for a while, Fabric network will never get up by itself.
That is the fault tolerance I talked about. I'm going to investigate this problem. Will let you know.

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 19:36:24 GMT):<br/>
the problem is that these fabric containers won't start automatically when machine they run on restart

@tongli I found out the reason of why etcd doesn't have entries for containers of two nodes if only one node is switched off:
```
- name: Start registrator service
  command: >-
    docker run -d --name registrator.{{ node_name }}
    --restart always
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock
    email4tong/registrator:v10 -internal -ttl 30 -ttl-refresh 20
    -resync 18
    skydns2://{{ hostvars[groups['etcdnodes'] | random].private_ip }}:2379/{{ domain }}
```
Registrator configured to send containers information to the one of the etcd nodes, not to the local.

<p><strong>YashGanthe</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 09:12:26 GMT):<br/>
When the user dashboard creates a channel, it gets all peers of the chain to join the channel. For this it must be accessing the private keys of the admins of each org right?
</p>

<p><strong>YashGanthe</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 10:43:26 GMT):<br/>
The definition of Chain Size given at http://hyperledger-cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terminology/ says that it is the number of nodes. Should it not be number of Peers in the Chain?

Hi @baohua and @hightall can you verify the patchset https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22915/ and do the needful

can anyone help with signing into cello dashboard? 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 12 Jun 2018 11:13:34 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @hightall Please  take a look at this patch to allow specification of mem, cpu and storage allocation when deploy fabric onto any k8s cluster. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22895/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 12 Jun 2018 11:14:03 GMT):<br/>
that is an bit improvement so that one ever deploys fabric can have a bit control how resources can be allocated.
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Tue, 12 Jun 2018 11:29:36 GMT):<br/>
@baohua , does the cello analytics work? I don't see fabric peer exporting any kind of metrics.

<p><strong>nasserfci</strong> (Tue, 12 Jun 2018 12:57:28 GMT):<br/>
Is there a way to deploy the same fabric network on multiple VM's  using Cello
i.e. (1 CA, 1 Order) on server 1 and (1 Peer) on server 2 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 12 Jun 2018 15:08:10 GMT):<br/>
@nasserfci ansible agent was developed to do just that.
</p>
<p><strong>nasserfci</strong> (Tue, 12 Jun 2018 15:19:08 GMT):<br/>
I see ansible agent i think and correct me if am wrong that it is used to deploy fabric network in multiple server i want to divide fabric network in multiple server example to it install each container in server

@SmartContract2018 Are you still having the docker error? I think you might need to upgrade you docker compose. The latest version is 1.21.2.
Running `sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o LOCATION_OF_YOUR_DOCKER_COMPOSE`
Running `which docker-compose` will give the location. I hope it helps

@LichenShen Do you still have your issue? I am also new to this and I ran into the same issue while running the setup the first time in DEV (`DEV=True make start`). In the logs (`DEV=True make logs`) I found this `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: 404.html`. I notice that I can log properly when using `make start` (without `DEV=True`) and start using cello

Hi all, I'm trying to follow the cello documentation and everything looks OK till I want to "apply new chain" in the operator dashboard. It says "Apply chain test fails". Any idea why?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=8Wp2x7gfqtHRawssK) @alexvicegrab FWIW, an equivalent helm chart has been done here https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/ibm-container-service

Hi @harsha, thank you for mentioning that repo.
I'm aware of the monolithic Helm chart created on that repository, but that Chart has a number of things I sought to improve upon:

1) it's not being maintained by anyone (at least for the last 5 months)
2) it's monolithic, and uses a single shared volume to store all the crypto material, making it unsuitable to a production deployment
3) it uses a single CA, rather than a hierarchy of root to intermediate CAs, which also leads to security issues
4) it does not enable a Kafka based ordering service
5) to implement a multiple number of peers you need to add extra deployments/services - I felt it would be better to have a helm chart per node, to enable flexible deployments.

To be fair, my own Helm charts themselves works in progress and would benefit from extra work to make them as versatile as possible, but I still feel they may provide a useful basis to others working on making deployment and orchestration easier.

Hi @harsha, thank you for mentioning that repo.
I'm aware of the monolithic Helm chart created on that repository, but that Chart has a number of things I sought to improve upon:

1) it's not being maintained by anyone (at least for the last 4 months)
2) it's monolithic, and uses a single shared volume to store all the crypto material, making it unsuitable to a production deployment
3) it uses a single CA, rather than a hierarchy of root to intermediate CAs, which also leads to security issues
4) it does not enable a Kafka based ordering service
5) to implement a multiple number of peers you need to add extra deployments/services - I felt it would be better to have a helm chart per node, to enable flexible deployments.

My set of charts is therefor not `equivalent`, since they are more modular. To be fair, my own Helm charts themselves works in progress and would benefit from extra work to make them as versatile as possible, but I still feel they may provide a useful basis to others working on making deployment and orchestration easier.

@baohua @hightall I found a bug in the ansible agent which does not do dns service correctly when container is trying to access external site. I created a bug and fixed it in this patch https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/23419/. Please take a look. This patch set also made some improvement so that chaincode container images can be downloaded before a chaincode vm is to be created which in many cases will timeout. With this patch, that problem will not happen. Thanks.

</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 03:27:41 GMT):<br/>
I will check it locally
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 03:28:27 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:46:54 GMT):<br/>
@frustrated-chain I have made some changes in the above patch set to address the problems that you had
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:47:29 GMT):<br/>
the error that you had few days ago won't happen for a k8s cluster when dns policy was set appropriately.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:48:04 GMT):<br/>
when you use cello to also setup k8s, the dns policy was not set in some cases.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:48:10 GMT):<br/>
you are the one hit that issue.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:48:40 GMT):<br/>
that issue caused the chaincode container not being able to pull images from outside.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:49:06 GMT):<br/>
the patch that I just put up solve all sort of the issues for you and also some other improvement.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:49:39 GMT):<br/>
it also exposes the peer and orderer service endpoint if you choose to.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:49:58 GMT):<br/>
this is a patch set you really want to use. hope it lands soon.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:51:17 GMT):<br/>
since you are doing this on aws
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:51:32 GMT):<br/>
you can easily do all the tasks with just one command
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:51:53 GMT):<br/>
``` ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" awsk8s.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:52:11 GMT):<br/>
giving that you have a clean account.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:52:47 GMT):<br/>
of course, you need to make sure that your vars/aws.yml file is correct.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:53:05 GMT):<br/>
and your vars/bc1st.yml is the latest
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:53:40 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest that you remove everything that you have and give it a try

Life will be much easier with kubernetes. I will do ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" awsk8s.yml

</p>
<p><strong>frustrated-chain</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:55:32 GMT):<br/>
Meanwhile, I did ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml with our chaincode.
And I have a question, after building the Fabric network with the ansible agent (with custom chaincode installed) without kubernetes, how can I make REST calls? I could not see the port 5000 binding!

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:58:08 GMT):<br/>
if you already have an existing k8s cluster,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:58:28 GMT):<br/>
you just need to place your kubeconfig file in vars/kubeconfig. then run the following command
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:58:54 GMT):<br/>
```ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply env=bc1st deploy_type=k8s" setupfabric.yml```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:59:12 GMT):<br/>
replace word apply with destroy to get rid of every thing
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:00:00 GMT):<br/>
when you use aws.yml, it setup everything using docker and overlay network. it has nothing to do with k8s
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:00:21 GMT):<br/>
all the endpoints won't be available to the outside of world
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:00:36 GMT):<br/>
unless you do proxy services which is a whole different ball game
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:00:58 GMT):<br/>
the assumption is that in that case, your applications will run on the same network that fabric runs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:01:13 GMT):<br/>
so you expose your application endpoint instead of fabric endpoint.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:01:25 GMT):<br/>
it was done that way with a lot of considerations.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:01:49 GMT):<br/>
with k8s , it is a bit different, since k8s already has the proxy for you to use
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:02:23 GMT):<br/>
you are using aws already, I strong suggest you use eks to get a k8s system up and running, then simply using the k8s deploy command.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:02:32 GMT):<br/>
that part I have not tested myself.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:02:44 GMT):<br/>
I have done it on ibm k8s and google gke
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:02:58 GMT):<br/>
I mean I have not tested it against eks.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:03:06 GMT):<br/>
but I have tested on ibm k8s and gke
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:03:36 GMT):<br/>
what you are doing now, is using cello and aws setting k8s yourself.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:03:50 GMT):<br/>
it will be a bit different from using AKS.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:03:56 GMT):<br/>
sorry EKS
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:04:34 GMT):<br/>
but all commands will be exactly the same once you have a k8s cluster, does not matter how or who set it up
</p>
<p><strong>frustrated-chain</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:07:25 GMT):<br/>
Alright, got it. I haven’t used EKS but I will try to learn! 

I don't have a k8s cluster and I am going to deploy a fresh install with fresh instances. Just to get your confirmation, that the following steps are correct, I am going to:

1)	change the chaincode in the  fabricsetup/templates/firstcode.go with ours
2)	ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" awsk8s.yml
3)	ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply env=bc1st deploy_type=k8s" setupfabric.yml

and live happily ever after!

2) does it all

<p><strong>frustrated-chain</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:08:51 GMT):<br/>
thank you!!
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:09:45 GMT):<br/>
you need to get that patch on your ansible controller first
</p>
<p><strong>frustrated-chain</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:10:24 GMT):<br/>
of course, will do that first.

<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 04:16:33 GMT):<br/>
Anyone know how to reset cello settings?

<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 04:16:39 GMT):<br/>
How to clear all information?
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 04:27:06 GMT):<br/>
@hightall Why cello keeps creating chain automatically?
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 04:27:10 GMT):<br/>
Is it a bug?
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 04:27:32 GMT):<br/>
and operator dashboard is loading very very slow
</p>

Anyone?

<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:02:54 GMT):<br/>
@hightall  could you please look into this if you have some time?

</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:03:31 GMT):<br/>
@pankajcheema do you create the host with keep filled option?
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:03:59 GMT):<br/>
you mean `Autofill`?
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:05:02 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:05:42 GMT):<br/>
if you select this, after you create the host, watchdog will keep the host full filled with capacity.

<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:13:16 GMT):<br/>
Ok ok

it was checked
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:23:09 GMT):<br/>
@hightall what `schedulable checkbox` means?
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:23:53 GMT):<br/>
mean whether this host can be scheduled when use want to apply in user dashboard
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:24:11 GMT):<br/>
I could not find description for some of the actions

</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:30:44 GMT):<br/>
Does chain size means total number of peers?
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:30:52 GMT):<br/>
@hightall 
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:31:22 GMT):<br/>
and does capacity means max number of chains that can be created in a host?
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 05:31:26 GMT):<br/>
yes, 2org4peers
</p>

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 15:56:25 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @hightall please take a look at this patch to fix ansible agent docker container image issue. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/23537/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 15:57:30 GMT):<br/>
the problem was that ansible agent container image does not allow sudo, but during the setup process, often user has to be changed to sudo to do things. this is a problem, that patch fixed the issue and also removed an unused package.

When I use the cello system, I can not add one peer or one orderer or one organization dynamically after the fabric network  built.
So, I suggest adding this feature. Is this feature included in the development plan?
If the rules permit, we are willing to participate in the development of this function.
Managing ca is also very important,Should it also be supported in cello?

At present, we are analyzing and arranging requirements, and at the same time we are doing some program design. We will complete it as soon as possible, and then we will share the design plan and hope to be helpful.

</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:05:59 GMT):<br/>
The network is running on 13 physical systems

Can I use cello for that?

<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:07:18 GMT):<br/>
sorry, I can't understand your mean.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:07:42 GMT):<br/>
@pankajcheema if you have few physical servers and wanting fabric to be up and running, you can use ansible agent.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:08:16 GMT):<br/>
@pankajcheema take a look at this doc https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/worker_ansible_howto.md
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:08:32 GMT):<br/>
I mean Can I use cello if my network is not setup on docker, docker swarm, kubernetes, vsphere.. I am just using physical servers and `peers`, `orderers` are running using their executables
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:08:54 GMT):<br/>
Ok So ansible is for that purpose only?
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:09:03 GMT):<br/>
I mean especially for this purpose?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:09:27 GMT):<br/>
@pankajcheema yes, that is what I am saying. even if your physical servers are only having base clean ubuntu 16.04 running, ansible agent was created to help getting fabric up and running.

@pankajcheema you can try master branch code, after this patch merged https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/23715
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 06:21:05 GMT):<br/>
@hightall How will I know the patch is merged. I have never used gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 06:21:09 GMT):<br/>
the step is 1. master node: make start
2. worker node: MASTER_NODE_IP=xx.xx.xx.xx make setup-worker

</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 06:21:49 GMT):<br/>
you can see this review status, or you can download the patch by yourself, and patch it into the master branch

</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 09:14:44 GMT):<br/>
@Tfabric did you create the chain pool in operator dashboard? If there is no available chain, you can't apply chain
</p>
<p><strong>Tfabric</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 09:25:06 GMT):<br/>
@hightall my operator dashboard is on other system and when I am providing Daemon URL it is giving me error
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 09:25:57 GMT):<br/>
you need set the docker configuration to expose the 2375 port,so that master can visit docker api.
</p>
<p><strong>Tfabric</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 09:26:41 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:23:55 GMT):<br/>
@rkrish82 yes. Please put the orderers in a different org. They will have their own certs anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:28:40 GMT):<br/>
@rkrish82 the error seems to be in the step that agent wants to put all the certs together. So try to put the orderers in an org which has no peers like what the sample configuration files such as bc1st, bc2nd etc
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:29:21 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rkrish82</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:29:47 GMT):<br/>
Ok thanks Tangli. But it has to be orderers and peers can be in one org right? Why this restriction?

Also I am not really sure your env. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:30:22 GMT):<br/>
Not they do not have to be in the same org.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:31:52 GMT):<br/>
My suggestion is try that first. If it works, then it means there is a bug. I suspect you may have some other issues.
</p>
<p><strong>rkrish82</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:33:06 GMT):<br/>
if orderers and peers in same org then i face this issue, otherwise there is no error

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=qN4zJy6xF9sm26uyf) @hightall , from the title, it seems interesting. but i can not know its exact purpose. 
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:13:39 GMT):<br/>
@qsmen currently the crpto config file is static, so for all deployed fabric network use same crypto files, it's not safe and not a good design, so we want to generate the crypto config file dynamic.

@luckydogchina so what's your question?
</p>
<p><strong>luckydogchina</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:15:46 GMT):<br/>
what is the function of the Object store?
</p>
<p><strong>luckydogchina</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:15:46 GMT):<br/>
what is the function of the Object store?  the crypto config files will be customized by the user?
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:18:32 GMT):<br/>
in fabric service, there will be a initial service which will generate the crypto config files, then copy the files into the minio object store service in a bucket, and minio service mount a local path same with user dashboard service, and the directory is named with chain id, so user dashboard can find the crypto files through the chain id, and call fabric api with the crypto config files, and user dashboard can call minio api with sdk to generate tmp url for download crypto files for user, so user can use the crypto files call api by themselves. 
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:18:54 GMT):<br/>
use can download the crypto files and use them .
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:19:09 GMT):<br/>
even user can upload crypto files
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:19:30 GMT):<br/>
upload crypto files is used for import existed fabric chain.
</p>
<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:21:42 GMT):<br/>
so for this function, we will need a initialize container for  generate crypto config files before fabric network containers started.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=wSN2yBo9tHm62GWEA) @hightall ,the crypto config file, you mean the crypto-config.yaml? to prevent depolyed fabric netwrok using the same crytpo files, some random elements can be added when implementing cryptogen command, then different cyrpto files will be generated for different deployment.

<p><strong>hightall</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:49:30 GMT):<br/>
@qsmen yes, use cyrpto-config.yaml with scripts byfn.sh to generate crypto config files and genesis block file
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 08:03:04 GMT):<br/>
ok, thank you.

<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 08:26:54 GMT):<br/>
It is good that  the crypto-config.yaml is formed dynamicaly in the new design.  It is better if the following problem can be solved. If all crypto files are not generated distributedly, but are still generated by one entity and then copied to different entitiesm like peer, order or client app user, it is still not safe.

yeah @qsmen

<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 08:39:43 GMT):<br/>
In fabric-ca channel, many people are concerned about this problem.  using fabric-ca server/client to generate crypto file, form msp and then form config.yaml is discussed very much
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 08:42:45 GMT):<br/>
@hightall , do you plan to include a solution to the problem in your new design?

@qsmen yes, I think this is a big problem for dynamic crypto config generation, I haven't tried to use the crypto config files generated by script byfn.sh, we need to test it. maybe will have many more problem.

Hi All,
</p>
<p><strong>mna2016</strong> (Sun, 08 Jul 2018 12:38:37 GMT):<br/>
The cello dashboard, menu and panels depicted in the documentation at https://cello.readthedocs.io are significantly different than the ones I am seeing after installing master and worker nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>mna2016</strong> (Sun, 08 Jul 2018 12:39:08 GMT):<br/>
Also, chain is not getting deployed. Always get some kind of server.

That second piece has been discussed. Will start development very soon.

Once that piece is done, an existing fabric network can grow easily.

Hi - I am wondering if there is currently a way that the cello project aligns itself with the different releases of fabric. How do I know what version of cello would support changes with release-1.2 vs. release-1.0, etc.? Is there any plan to sync the release versions in the different projects?
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 14:48:28 GMT):<br/>
@tongli @baohua @hightall ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 00:35:11 GMT):<br/>
@latitiah I think it is a good idea and cello should support and make that change. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 00:35:57 GMT):<br/>
Though cello ansible agent does support current and previous releases of fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 01:05:29 GMT):<br/>
@latitiah u can find all supported releases through the dashboard, currently, it's 1.0 and 1.1. 1.2 is on the road!
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 01:08:31 GMT):<br/>
@tongli That makes sense. I am beginning to see some divergence such that tagging now would make things a bit easier to note what cello version supports what fabric version
@baohua Is each cello build tagged accordingly?

</p>
<p><strong>WadeLu</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 01:33:11 GMT):<br/>
and one more question regarding the centralized deploy V.S distributed deploy, does Cello support distributed deploy worker node? now just using Docker to deploy worker node on a single physical server, but actually most deploys need be distributed on several physical server. .

Wondering what causes Docker to create a directory instead of a file for “configtx.yaml” ? 

Any ideas ?

Is there a way in fabric to get peers to load chaincode on initial startup as opposed to the first chaincode request?

@Russ.corsha after instantiate, you can do chain  code query against each peer to make sure each peer has the image and ready to go.,

I'm working thru the Tutorial to learn Cello. Questions:
</p>
<p><strong>kipharris</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 00:00:27 GMT):<br/>
I'm working thru the Tutorial to learn Cello. Questions:
1.) After "Adding" a Chain (a Fabric) in the Operator Dashboard, I go on to "Start" the fabric as well (using the "More" dropdown on RHS) even though that's not mentioned in the tutorial. Please tell me if I'm making a mistake.
2.) In the Operator Dashboard, I "Added" both a Fabric 1.0 and a Fabric 1.1. However, in the User Dashboard when I go to Apply a Chain, I only get an option for a Fabric 1.0. Is there some way to get the other network listed? I assume I'm using the "Basic" Dashboards since I don't supply any options on the "make start" command.

Thanks for any help - Kip.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 02:23:16 GMT):<br/>
@kipharris 1) by default, the chain will start after adding. 2) pls feel free to open a jira bug; 3) is there any error in the log?

This post explains how I worked through a problem that I've seen reported here in three other posts in last few months. The problem is characterized by an error of the following sort:

"Cannot start service cli: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:348: starting container process caused "process_linux.go:402: container init caused \"rootfs_linux.go:58: mounting \\\"/opt/cello/fabric-1.0/solo/configtx.yaml\\\" to rootfs \\\"/var/lib/docker/overlay2/6ed...b1d/merged\\\" at \\\"/var/lib/docker/overlay2/6ed6...b1d/merged/etc/hyperledger/fabric/configtx.yaml\\\" caused \\\"not a directory\\\"\"": unknown: Are you trying to mount a directory onto a file (or vice-versa)? Check if the specified host path exists and is the expected type"

When I encountered this, I found that  configtx.yaml had changed from a file into being an empty directory. Very strange. Although I don't have insight into root cause, I have noticed this happening after I stop and later restart either the Master, the Worker, or maybe both. It may be that I am not doing something that I should be doing to shutdown the worker "cleanly", so that it can be restarted without losing state. For reference, my worker is a Docker host. I am running my fabrics on an internal IBM cloud platform ("Fyre") where we are encouraged to suspend the VM's when we are not using them.

I have found that by removing all images on both Master and Worker, and then re-pulling them, it clears the problem. I suspect I only need to reset the state on the NFS file system, but haven't explored the issue further.

Guidance from the experts on gracefully suspending and resuming a running system may be helpful. I'm using the 'make {start | stop}' on the Master, but don't know what I should be doing on the Worker. Thanks.

I want to create a Fabric 1.1 or 1.2 network that spans multiple hosts. I'm comfortable using the Cello Docker worker, and wondering whether I can achieve my objective by creating multiple Docker workers. My motivation is that I haven't yet been able to create a multi-host k8s environment on my available computing resources. If I can get the job done using just  Docker workers, then I could defer the task of getting a k8s platform setup.

also, the way to have the containers up and running locally would be - ```make docker
make start```

@tongli @baohua How make peer as a endorsing peer in cello? What changes are required peer argument?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 05:58:52 GMT):<br/>
They should be endorsing peers by default.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 05:58:52 GMT):<br/>
All peers should be able to endorse by default.
</p>
<p><strong>rkrish82</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 07:13:23 GMT):<br/>
Then it means that even anchor peers can do endorsement job?

hi everyone!
I'm trying to get a fixed-size cluster running in k8s, but I am a newcomer to Fabric/Cello. If I kubectl apply all the files in https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/src/agent/k8s/setup-scripts/manifests/fabric-1.0/local, will that work?

@ameijer Hi, Are you using the NFS server that cello provided?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Thu, 09 Aug 2018 05:33:17 GMT):<br/>
If yes, than I think there is some thing wrong with your network, cause NFS server and Kubernestes cluster can not communicate with each other.

Hi, I'm using cello deployment using Docker Host. I want to know whether Cello supports K8s. If yes, in what version it is supported.

<p><strong>aroca</strong> (Sun, 12 Aug 2018 23:43:39 GMT):<br/>
looking at the code i can say it does support K8s. It creates the K8s cluster for you it seems

Guys, looking at the ansible agent deploy on AWS.. i see that by default it generates all the nodes in the public subnet. Is that configurable in an easy way? i will take a look at the ansible code now.. but i am new to ansible so it might take me some time.. hehe

hii people! I'm testing Cello locally, but my master node can't reach the worker node..... I have followed this guide to configure my worker node using docker
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 15:49:18 GMT):<br/>
when I execute from my master node `docker -H 192.168.50.22:2375 version`
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 15:49:56 GMT):<br/>
the result is ```Client:

any ideas?? port 2375 is open in worker node
</p>

@jk.ananth seems same error, do you solved it? thanks for creating cello!!
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 16:44:17 GMT):<br/>
I solved the problem modifing the docker systemd service config, this works fine: ```[Service]
DOCKER_OPTS="-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --api-cors-header='*' --default-ulimit=nofile=8192:16384 --default-ulimit=nproc=8192:16384"
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/docker
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd $DOCKER_OPTS```
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 16:45:28 GMT):<br/>
Maybe the guide from the cello docs 'Setup Docker Host as a Worker Node', should be updated

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=ytHSivQ9LYz24qggj) @Luke_Chen i have followed below steps in cello for integrate to hyperledger explorer latest version. 

Step 1 : cloned cello package

git clone http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/cello && cd cello

step 2 : setup the master node with the setup.sh.

cd cello/scripts/master_node/
./setup.sh

step 3 : make setup-master

step 4 : make start


opened another terminal (i have configured setup docker using my machine itself)

step 1 : sudo systemctl stop docker.service

step 2 : sudo dockerd -H tcp://192.168.1.103:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --api-cors-header='*' --default-ulimit=nofile=8192:16384 --default-ulimit=nproc=8192:16384 -D &

step 3: make setup-worker


After that i have created host and chain also started the chain too.

while checking "docker ps" in command prompt my peers are running sometimes only automatically it's stopping the chains and peers also not running.

when i check "docker logs CONTAINER_ID"  getting below error.

Cannot run peer because error when setting up MSP of type bccsp from directory /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp: could not load a valid signer certificate from directory /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp/signcerts: stat /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp/signcerts: no such file or directory

Please let me know did i miss any steps? Please help me

<p><strong>yzhivkov</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 17:41:12 GMT):<br/>
verify whether you have /opt/cello and that all the configuration files are there. The setup-worker script is supposed to copy those files there. look for any errors in the log

</p>
<p><strong>yzhivkov</strong> (Sat, 18 Aug 2018 13:09:37 GMT):<br/>
don't forget to run `make setup-worker` on the server where you are deploying fabric
</p>
<p><strong>YuanOwen</strong> (Sat, 18 Aug 2018 13:10:33 GMT):<br/>
so , the master node also execute make setup-worker?
</p>
<p><strong>YuanOwen</strong> (Sat, 18 Aug 2018 13:10:51 GMT):<br/>
i just have two nodes
</p>
<p><strong>yzhivkov</strong> (Sat, 18 Aug 2018 13:11:02 GMT):<br/>
no. only the nodes that would run fabric containers need it
</p>
<p><strong>YuanOwen</strong> (Sat, 18 Aug 2018 13:12:17 GMT):<br/>
ok , i'll try it , thanks 
</p>
<p><strong>YuanOwen</strong> (Sat, 18 Aug 2018 14:50:32 GMT):<br/>
excuse me , when i run the `make setup-worker` cmd , it present local artifacts path /opt/cello not existed , create one & no master node addr is provided will ignore nfs setup
is there something preinstall when i execute `make setup-worker`?
</p>
<p><strong>YuanOwen</strong> (Sat, 18 Aug 2018 14:52:55 GMT):<br/>
and the `make setup-worker` also output setup_worker_node_docker.sh : line 27 : MASTER_NODE: command not found , is there somebody have the same problem?
</p>
<p><strong>YuanOwen</strong> (Sun, 19 Aug 2018 10:16:24 GMT):<br/>
thanks , i fixed it .  brun `make setup-worker` command before should be `edit setup_worker_node_docker.sh , setting master node address . `
</p>

Hi, guys. I'm a new in Cello. I heard that cello is related to kubernetes, so that's why I am in here.
I want to make my hyperledger project more comfortable such as deployment, changing port or install chaincode.
I already made my network, but it is hard to fix these things I mentioned.
Does anyone try to run hyperledger project using cello? Furthermore, How u config your peers and org?

Hi - I have a fabric network running in k8s (on AWS), setup using the ansible playbooks. I've got peers, orderers, CA instances etc... But what I do not see is the operator dashboard. I've been looking around the docs for a while, and it seems like you do either ansible/k8s/aws, or run the dashboards and then create a network.    Is the Operator Dashboard mutually exclusive with the approach of setting up a network on k8s ?  Or is there a way to deploy it onto a k8s cluster?
</p>

do you have any idea ? by the way, the chaincode I installed is uploaded from the user dashboard.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 06:13:40 GMT):<br/>
When I deploy and execute chaincode in CLI pods, the transactions history can be correctly displayed in user-dashboard
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 06:24:30 GMT):<br/>
What? It seems the the user dashboard is working as intend right now, I deploy the existed chaincode_example02 instead in this time.

Hi, We developed a Helm/Charts  for deploying Hyperledger Fabric, please check this link for more details http://www.think-foundry.com/hyperledger-fabric-deployment-using-helm-chart/, beside we also consider to add this tool to Cello, take the fully advantage and flexibility of the Helm

@Ibraxos you can setup a minikube as a worker node
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:10:06 GMT):<br/>
a quite guide can be found here https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:10:27 GMT):<br/>

@asaningmaxchain123 fabfic-initial is just a test image, it's related to design of crypto-config files generated dynamic, it's just generate crypto config files for each fabric network at the initial step.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 05:12:10 GMT):<br/>
aha, for autofill that means you set a number of chains in a host, then cello will smartly keep that number of chains existed in the host. i.e., if some chain is removed, cello will help create a new one.

hello, I tried the bare bones hyperledger but realised installing the network and instantiating the chaincode is a huge climb. Then chanced upon cello. Could someone guide me to a book/pdf or step by step documention on using cello to bring up a fabric network with chaincode on it?
</p>
<p><strong>GowriR</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 05:23:42 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>Ibraxos</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 05:26:31 GMT):<br/>
@GowriR please refer to https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md
</p>
<p><strong>GowriR</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 05:27:55 GMT):<br/>
thanks @Ibraxos - how is this used? cello for deployment and composer for writing chaincode? and does explorer also come in the pyramid?
</p>
<p><strong>Ibraxos</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 05:31:05 GMT):<br/>
@GowriR first of all you have to setup a cello on master node then moving forward you will setup worker node with mutiple options like dockerswarm ,  kubernetes then your will able to deploy chain code on this network
</p>
<p><strong>Ibraxos</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 05:32:08 GMT):<br/>
@GowriR as for as explorer is concerned yes it is possible but complexity depends upon your type of cluster

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=D4YvpeMW2WMWHA9qv) @asaningmaxchain123 Oh, that means you can create new chain on that host. this is for maintenance purpose if you mark some host un-schedulable.
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain123</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 05:49:13 GMT):<br/>
@baohua can you use different host to build a chain?

Hi experts, I was using fabric in the net mode and dev mode. Then realised that it would be great to have the net mode sort of configuration (2 org, 2 peer, 1 orderer and 2 ca) with ONE chaincode and 2 CLI? I am assuming it is only one chaincode since i have only one chaincode and i would like to use the CLI instead of using a node js app to run my chaincode everytime. How do I modify my docker-compose to have 2-org, 2-peer to have chaincode container and 2 CLI containers? Is it possible? Is there an example that i can refer to? Can be done in cello?

Hey guys. I am trying to run both a master and a worker node on the same docker host. My master seems to be working fine, and I've created a worker node with no errors. When I try to add a host (127.0.0.1:2375) in the dashboard I get the following error: Request Error 400: http://localhost:8080/api/host The request was issued with an error. The server did not create or modify data.
</p>
<p><strong>miceiken</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 09:46:19 GMT):<br/>
How do I ensure the worker has started? I assumed it was added to docker compose and would start with "make start"
</p>
<p><strong>miceiken</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 09:48:58 GMT):<br/>
Seemes to work doing "ifconfig" and using the ip of the docker interface

<p><strong>miceiken</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 10:30:11 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Ibraxos</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 10:36:32 GMT):<br/>
@miceiken did you run `make setup-master`

Are you running of the git master branch @Ibraxos ?
</p>
<p><strong>Ibraxos</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 11:16:18 GMT):<br/>
Yes. I have 2 VM's, 1 for master and other for worker. On my master node I ran `make setup-master` and then `make start` afterwards. I am following this tutorial: https://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/
</p>
<p><strong>miceiken</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 12:52:03 GMT):<br/>
Okay, I have come a bit further. I am able to access both dashboards, but when I add a new chain it gets stuck on "Waiting" and when I run "docker ps", the new containers keep restarting every few seconds

<p><strong>miceiken</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 12:58:39 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Ibraxos</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 13:11:08 GMT):<br/>
Which type of worker are you trying to add?
</p>
<p><strong>miceiken</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 13:18:05 GMT):<br/>
How do you mean? It is a docker host set up using `make setup-worker`
</p>
<p><strong>miceiken</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 13:18:21 GMT):<br/>
I added the host in the operators dashboard

Hi all, I'm trying to setup Cello on my Mac and I successfully went through setting up the master and the worker nodes.

And once I ADD a chain to the host, I can see some "peers", an "orderer" and other containers.
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 08:41:44 GMT):<br/>
but nothing explicitly called "worker node". I guess I could check one of the peers or the orderer, but I can't enter them as they keep restarting :(
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 08:50:42 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen Actually, my Docker host is my worker node, so on my Mac that would be "Docker for Mac" ? in that case `/opt/cello` would be on my Mac FS?
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 08:51:50 GMT):<br/>
In case my assumption is correct, here is the result of `ls -l /opt/cello` on my mac:

```
baas
dashboard_mongo
fabric-1.0
fabric-1.2
mongo
```
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 08:53:05 GMT):<br/>
Not sure if certificates should be here. Also, at which point should the certificate be copied over?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:17:24 GMT):<br/>
@iMacTia certificates should be placed in the /opt/cello/fabric-1.0/crypto-config folder
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:18:38 GMT):<br/>
walk through the sub directory to see if you missed the *.cert file
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:23:17 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @Luke_Chen, here's the result of `tree /opt/cello/fabric-1.0/crypto-config`

I can only see `.pem` files and no `.cert` ones
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:24:12 GMT):<br/>
So you're probably right, that might be my issue :(
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:24:31 GMT):<br/>
However I still don't know WHEN these files should be copied over and by WHO/WHAT
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:24:58 GMT):<br/>
I followed every step of the guide on the Cello repository and didn't notice any particular error while setting up master and worker nodes
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:31:58 GMT):<br/>
:joy: sorry it should be .pem rather than cert

<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:36:42 GMT):<br/>
what did you find under the msp?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:37:17 GMT):<br/>
I saw you only list one sub directory, which is `keystore`
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:46:26 GMT):<br/>
that's exactly what I found :(
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:46:41 GMT):<br/>
and the folder looks empty
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:48:31 GMT):<br/>
That's where there should be a folder called `signcerts`, right? Hence the error I get
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:53:15 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen Something has probably gone wrong at some point but I couldn't see any error. Do you know which script is responsible for generating these certificates? If I knew that, I could investigate why that didn't happen
</p>
<p><strong>Ibraxos</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 12:13:18 GMT):<br/>
Is there any way we can use composer to deploy chaincodes for a chain on cello? @Luke_Chen @baohua @hightall

+1, that's the next thing I'd like to do :D Once I can get Cello up and running, that's it
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 14:04:31 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen Thanks for pointing me in the correct direction, after I manually copied the certificates from the repository into my `/opt/cello` folder, the peers are up an running now!

FYI - `cp -R src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.2/crypto-config /opt/cello/fabric-1.2/crypto-config`
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 14:04:50 GMT):<br/>
orderer is still not happy, but I guess it's something else and investigate it later on

</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Fri, 14 Sep 2018 09:26:05 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen Similar issue, this time the `orderer.genesis.block` was missing
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Fri, 14 Sep 2018 09:26:24 GMT):<br/>
or actually, it was created as a folder for some reason
</p>
<p><strong>iMacTia</strong> (Fri, 14 Sep 2018 09:26:53 GMT):<br/>
I deleted the folder and manually copied it over, and then the orderer was up and running as well :)!

I manged to setup cello master node and two worker nodes. Both the workers are visible trough admin (operator) dashboard. But chain creation gives some trouble.
1) selected  Consensus - KAFKA :  chain is not created and gets the error pop on the dashboard saying  "Request Error 400: http://178.128.80.210:8080/api/cluster/d86f2958fb4c47a487015d2445bdd1fe
The request was issued with an error. The server did not create or modify data."
2)  Selected Consensus  "Solo": Chain created but health is indicated as fail.

also there seem to be two versions of the docs:

both of which seem to differ slightly in some aspects. Is one more updated/supported than the other?

Thanks. Where do you suggest to have kafka cluster. 1) Master node 2) Worker Node.  On the owrker node i used Fabric and expectation was Fabric comes with Kafka as the consensus protocol by default. Also what's the recommended OS for cello Master and Worker Nodes. I have used Ubuntu 18.04

I used cello and got my operator dashboard working at port 8080, but when I try 8081 for the user dashboard I get a refused to connect, ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED. Is there something simple causing this? Note this is also hosted on AWS, so it could be my security group permissions or similar, but I can't seem to figure it out
</p>
<p><strong>ColeBoudreau</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 17:10:11 GMT):<br/>
Okay I figured the above out, it just wasn't configured properly on the master node. Although now a follow up: Under create new chain in the operator the chain size option defaults to '4' and can't be set of anything else.  Why is this?

I have the impression I missed a part on the installation steps or I use the wrong ports (:8080 and :8081) to connect to the dashboards. Can some one help me out a bit to get this running well.

Hi, I started exploring cello. My primary goal is to be able to setup multi-node Fabric cluster and manage the cluster add node/ delete node/upgrade... . I cam across cello and Ansible agent in cello. I read the documentation and also previous chat, i still have few pending questions. Hope someone can help me out here. 

1) Though Cello and Ansible agent are in the same repo they seem to completely different projects. Is my understanding true. When would you recommend using Cello vs Ansible agent to set up the network?   

2) If i use cello i couldn't find a way to design my network ( Select number of orgs, number of peers .... and so on). Is that part of some configuration file ??.

3) Once i setup the network is there a way i could add new org to the network through cello ??.

Hyperledger Cello – Need Help

 

Hi,

I am looking to deploy the Hyperledger Fabric using the ansible Cello Agent.

Referring to the below link

https://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/worker_ansible_howto/

 I am executing the below command

ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply env=mycloud cloud_type=aws" provcluster.yml



The above command is provisioning the Servers in AWS, however once the servers are provisioned, I am getting the below Error. I do understand that it is due to certificate configuration and I understand the I need to provided private key ( in my case “fd” is private key file name ) to the ansible playbook. Please do help in modifying the Ansible playbook.

 

Error is below

 

TASK [Wait until servers are up and runnning] **************************************************************************************

ok: [cloud] => (item=35.175.216.229)

ok: [cloud] => (item=34.206.72.196)

fatal: [34.206.72.196]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Warning: Permanently added '34.206.72.196' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\r\nno such identity: /home/ansible/.ssh/fd: No such file or directory\r\nPermission denied (publickey).\r\n", "unreachable": true}

 

Ansible code responsible for the above Error is  present in the plays.yml file

File Pathi - /home/ubuntu/cello/src/agent/ansible/roles/cloud_aws/plays.yml

 **CODE**

- name: change /etc/hosts files so that each node knows other nodes

  hosts: allnodes

  strategy: free

  user: "{{ cluster.ssh_user }}"

  become: true

  become_user: ubuntu

  vars_files:

    - "{{ playbook_dir }}/../../vars/{{ env }}.yml"

  tasks:

    - include_tasks: "../cloud_os/namenode/tasks/apply.yml"

  tags: "namenode"

  with_items: "{{ groups['allnodes'] }}"

 

the above code is calling the below playbook which is present in Cloud_os directory.

 

FILE Pathi - /home/ubuntu/cello/src/agent/ansible/roles/cloud_os/namenode/tasks/apply.yml



**CODE**  

---

- name: Setup /etc/hosts for the node

  lineinfile:

    dest: "/etc/hosts"

    insertafter: EOF

    state: present

    line: "{{ item }}"

  with_lines: cat "{{ playbook_dir }}/../../vars/fabrichosts"

 

Now I would like to use the private key certificate to login to the Hosts or need to do necessary modification for the code to work.

Nishanth Kumar

Hello everyone. Can I add organization peers on remote host with only Cello? Or I need swarm and/or k8s?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 11:59:26 GMT):<br/>
@dlarukov yes you need that, Cello could deploy Fabric cluster to docker or k8s, since Cello have different agents to handle that.

can you pass the checking locally? otherwise, needs to check the format problems.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 04:10:34 GMT):<br/>

ok, let's figure it out

@baohua yes, the CI server has a higher version of flask8 which is 3.6.0

Hi, everyone. Is there a workable release I can use for test ? I try to build in my local machine or my cloud servers using master and 0.9-alpha, I failed all of these works. Maybe wrong docker version? I try docker 1.13.0, but it didn't work. Thanks

health check will only ping these containers to see whether the service is alive, check your firewall provision and make sure all ports of your worker node can be accessed.

<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 06:39:11 GMT):<br/>
you should disable it first to avoid influence from the network policy.

Need help to resovle this issue.

<p><strong>meilier</strong> (Sun, 18 Nov 2018 05:56:09 GMT):<br/>
@manoj485 You need to make sure all ports needed in worker machine is open, better to restart your service and machine to make it work. I get the same error 'failed' for worker node. You can type 'docker log + your_container_peer_id', see if you get error like this '/etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp/signcerts: no such file or directory'
</p>
<p><strong>meilier</strong> (Sun, 18 Nov 2018 06:03:04 GMT):<br/>
@Gaurang I also found that Docker Daemon Setup won't work in new version of docker 18.09, so I back to 18.06. 
        https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/setup_worker_docker.md
</p>
<p><strong>Gaurang</strong> (Sun, 18 Nov 2018 07:17:45 GMT):<br/>
@meilier Thanks for your update. 
actually I am using ansible script to setup the fabric and I am running ansible scripts from my PC. I could see 2-3 places where we are setting docker.j2 templete for docker.service. 
Could you please let me know where should I update the above mentioned setting to make sure that we use docker version 18.06 ? 
</p>
<p><strong>meilier</strong> (Sun, 18 Nov 2018 08:17:46 GMT):<br/>
 I'm not familiar with ansible script. But you can install specific version of docker like this `apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION>` and some previous steps. https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce-1```
It should be executed on remote machine using ansible, isn't it?

@meilier Actually ansible script them self create ec2 instance and then install docker in it as a node initial setup. Thats the reason i can not go and install the docker version as you mentioned. I need to find the hook where exactly the step at which it is downloading the docker and installing it.  As per my finding I have found below two hook but not sure whether it will resolve the issue or not.

Hello!

I would like to try out Cello! I've cloned the repo and run make setup-master then make start.
I am not sure what's happening....most of the time I got the following error: env variable SERVER_PUBLIC_IP not set. If somehow the service starts (after a couple of restart and clean). The  dashboards are not reachable. (the user-dashboard exits immediately). What am I missing?

@Levilk "SERVER_PUBLIC_IP=0.0.0.0 make start" worked for me. At your Dashboard problem: Is everything up and running on docker ps? And what does you log (make logs) say?

HI All,
I have deployed the Hyperledger fabric on AWS using cello ansible with dockers. Everything works fine. I was able to do a transaction using composer playground. In a process for vertical scale-up the system, I have created a bigger AWS instance using old AMI. I have correct all the dns, docker and flannel settings. Updated /etc/hosts files on both the VMs. Brought all the docker container up and running. Now when I try to do a transaction, I am getting below error by composer-playground:

Error: Error trying invoke business network. Error: Failed to send peer responses for transaction '02be502e532dfe5c153fa2fc5ecbb599a387834e32f4eb5b1806949335cfcd26' to orderer. Response status 'SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE

I have even tried crearting participant user composer CLI but still getting same error.

I have checked all the docker logs(i.e. orderer, peer, kafka, zookeeper) could not able to find exact error.


Can anyone please tell me what I am missing here?

Thanks.

For temporary purpose you can run follow below steps to fix this issue ..

This issue is happening because of SSL which is enabled by default and we are hitting HTTP URL which redirects and throws error message.

Resolution After installation of Cello we need to disable SSL to Make it work on HTTP URL:

Login to cello-keycloak-mysql container :
docker exec -it cello-keycloak-mysql bash
use keycloak;
update REALM set ssl_required = 'NONE' where id = 'master';

Has anyone tried to setup a network with Cello on Azure? I am using principal method for authentication but it throws an Error "No valid tennant ID". I am able to access my azure account with the specified settings using powershell. Not sure why it's not working with cello.
</p>
<p><strong>nitishbhardwaj19</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 04:06:32 GMT):<br/>
Just found out that the default configuration just works with username and password. The Cello scripts for Azure tries to read and set username and password. It never consider any other authorization method. /cello/src/operator-dashboard/agent/ansible/roles/cloud_azure/prepare/tasks/apply.yml `- name: Setup env specific variables
  set_fact:
    azure_ad_user: "{{ auth.username }}"
    azure_ad_pwd: "{{ auth.password }}"
    azure_sub_id: "{{ auth.subscription_id }}"
    region: "{{ cluster.region_name | default('eastus') }}"

Just found out that the default configuration just works with username and password. The Cello scripts for Azure tries to read and set username and password. It never considers any other authorization method. /cello/src/operator-dashboard/agent/ansible/roles/cloud_azure/prepare/tasks/apply.yml `- name: Setup env specific variables
  set_fact:
    azure_ad_user: "{{ auth.username }}"
    azure_ad_pwd: "{{ auth.password }}"
    azure_sub_id: "{{ auth.subscription_id }}"
    region: "{{ cluster.region_name | default('eastus') }}"
res_grp: "{{ cluster.resource_group }}"`

Hey all. I am trying to setup hyperledger cello operator dashboard on a AWS EC2 instance. After both ` make setup-master ` and `  SERVER_PUBLIC_IP=<public ip> make start `, When i visit port 8080 I get ERR_INVALID_REDIRECT in chrome. I did a curl and got the redirect URL as ` http://:/auth/realms//protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=&redirect_uri=http%3A%2FXXXXX.... ` 

No host and port is present in the config. Can anyone help with this?

Cannot extend existing Fabric deployed using Cello Ansible. Cryptogen is failing because of Cello's use of  'mv' command to move signature (_sk) files to a new name. I think these files should be copied instead of moved to the new name. This is leading to loss of the info that is contained in the original filename.  Is there a workaround? @tongli @liuruifei @asaningmaxchain123

Cello ansible agent support all the fabric version starting 1.0, you just need to change the configuration to specify your desired version.

Hello! Just found out about this chat. I am currently trying to deploy Fabric with a custom chaincode onto AWS using the Ansible Agent in the Cello project. While I can get the network up and install the default chaincode onto the peers, I cannot switch the default with our custom chaincode that uses the Go extensions in the vendor folder (I think it uses fabric v1.3). Does anyone have any sources for deploying Fabric 1.3 onto AWS with a custom chaincode using Go extensions?

hi. I'm trying to run cello now. Should cello-realm be made automatically when I run "make start"? In my keycloak-myql, it seems that there is only master realm, so when I request user-dashboard or admin-dashboard, "404 not found" error occurs. What should I check additionally?

Would a dev setup with 4 cores, 16 GRAM, 100G disk (for master ) and 2 cores 8g RAM, 100G disk (for worker) work ? 
or will the resource requirements have to be tweaked in the docker compose files for it to work with the lesser hardware

<p><strong>clydedacruz</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 07:15:32 GMT):<br/>
@baohua @tongli @hightall   I tried the setup using both the master branch and the v0.9.0 .In both cases the user-dashboard does not work. 

1. using the "master" branch of the project, completed the master node installation using `make setup-master` followed by `make start`

Installation completes successfully. No indication of error.
This brings up all the containers. I'm able to access the operator dashboard. But when I go to the user dashboard, it redirects to the the authentication page, and after i enter the creds, it goes back to <IP>:8081 and just shows a `500 internal server error`. Not information about the error in the `user-dashboard` container log.

2. using the v0.9.0 tag of the repository. I tried the same steps as above to start up the services on the cello master. The user-dashboard container comes up and then dies. Ive attatched the log below.

Both these experiments were done on fresh Ubuntu 16.04 VMs, and exactly according to the docs here [cello master setup docs](https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/setup_master.md). 
Am I missing something here?

Hello everyone. For docker host, I setup docker daemon and I made fabric cluster successfully by fabric cello. For docker swarm host, what should I do? In your tutorial, you just link to document for setup docker swarm. And, cello/scripts/worker_node/setup_worker_node_swarm.sh seems not to do something special for making daemon and etc. I wonder what should I do additionally and what is proper value to SWARM type Daemon Url in Create New Host menu.

@baohua @hightall @Luke_Chen please review this one, we need to make a change to make sure that the cello produced prometheus configuration file work as is without further processing. here is the patch. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28932/ thanks.

Is it possible to build the Cello docker images from local code? At present, running 'make start' downloads the code from Github and then builds it. @baohua @hightall @tongli

When starting Hyperledger cello as master node, I have to set the SERVER_PUBLIC_IP to docker0 ip address e.g. 172.17.0.1 so that I can open operator dashboard and the user dashboard. How can I set the SERVER_PUBLIC_IP to eth0 IP address instead of using docker0 IP address.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=jPmyQnXyzcvvtgcW8) @jarvis26 No clue, but the `SERVER_PUBLIC_IP` should be set to a real IP in your server. Besides, are u trying to start from empty env?
</p>
<p><strong>chengloy</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 11:55:12 GMT):<br/>
@jarvis26 no any reason, I just think the latest version might be suitable, and I also found that the cello docs update the system reqiurment for docker version.

@baohua, I just found that the docker hub build for ansible agent container has been failing ever since we changed the structure of cello.

I mean moving stuff from under src to operator-dashboard.

@baohua I only found it is broken for ansible agent. the last succesful one was from 2 month ago.

@baohua @tongli @jarvis26 @lamnh2410 can you help to explain the api-engine module and what's the role of this api-engine, is it only used to make documents for api? I found everthing is good, when I docker stop cello-engine container.
</p>
<p><strong>chengloy</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 04:07:19 GMT):<br/>
sorry, it's my foolish, cello-engine used for operator-dashboard restfule server port:80 and operator-dashboard used for socketio server port: 8080, is it right?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 04:45:16 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=f53iLDHQG6SPKgsWN) @chengloy basically correct and for the latest master branch, the dashboard port should be 8080 (operator) and 8081 (user）

Also while running the initcluster step with env as k8s, I am getting the following error: @tongli, @baohua could you please take a look. Also when I logged in into the master node to check if the services were up and running - I executed the `kubectl get nodes` command which returned ```The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?```. On further investigation, I found that there was no kubeadm in /etc/kubernetes folder. I found some blogs which said executing `kubeadm init` created the admin.conf file which has to be referenced in `KUBECONFIG` environment variable for this the kubectl command to work. How do I fix this.

</p>
<p><strong>Gaurang</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 10:14:47 GMT):<br/>
@pikvik Surely some other steps are involved bringing up cello master mode. I am following "https://hyperledger-cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_master/" this tutorial. 
</p>
<p><strong>Gaurang</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 11:26:54 GMT):<br/>
@pikvik  I am also getting similar invalid parameter issue .  Also I have figure out that you have to start cello server with this command:  SERVER_PUBLIC_IP=x.x.x.x make start where as in documents it is mentioned make start only. 
</p>
<p><strong>Gaurang</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 12:09:04 GMT):<br/>
@pikvik Use this URL:  http://<IP>:8080/ 

It worked for me. after starting the server with below commands
sudo make reset
SERVER_PUBLIC_IP=x.x.x.x make start

@baohua I applied this patch(https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/30721/) on cello's current code to setup a network on 1.4.0. I am got the same error

Hi guys! Can someone please help me deploying cello? I've been trying over and over again by following the doc, but I can't access either the operator nor the user dashboard. For the operator dasboard, after loging in keycloack, I'm redirected to a blank page. Here are the container's log: 
```
cello-operator-dashboard | [2019-04-28 10:54:11 +0000] [23] [ERROR] Socket error processing request.
cello-operator-dashboard | Traceback (most recent call last):
cello-operator-dashboard |   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gunicorn/workers/async.py", line 62, in handle

cello-operator-dashboard |     raise socket.error(err, errno.errorcode[err])
cello-operator-dashboard | ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] ECONNREFUSED
```
For the user dashboard, I just get "Internal Server Error, real status: 500" in the browser with no error log on the container.
I'm trying to deploy everything locally; here's my configuration:
```
ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
docker version: 18.09.5
docker-compose version 1.13.0, build 1719ceb
```
I'm using the latest sources; I've been struggling with this for several days now. What am I missing?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=Si3pRHwT827r9hdSf) @rameshthoomu I think it may be because we are re-arching after the v0.9.0 release. There might need some change to the ppc64/s390x dockerfile.

@hightall , hi, I just run user-dashboard at my host, then i find the first page is blank when i login localhost:8081.  I check user-dashboard sources and get some problems,  the npm start application with load "index.tpl",  index.tpl load ”<script type="text/javascript" src="{{webRoot}}static/index.js"> </script>“  ,  but i can't find any "static" folder in user-dashboard project.  Is  it the reason for the first blank page?  How to fix it ? Thanks

Hi, so i am setting up a demo instance of cello.. uptill now i am successful in the configurtion of master and worker nodes and i can access the user and operator dashboard. I am also able to create host in operator dashboard but when i create the chain in operation dashboard it shows the status 'deleting' and health 'failed'. When i digged more into the detail so i found out that it initially creates the fabric containers but then they exit. Before exiting the containers have this error "ERRO 021 Cannot run peer because error when setting up MSP of type bccsp from directory /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp: could not load a valid signer certificate from directory /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp/signcerts: stat /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp/signcerts: no such file or directory". Now i am following all the steps mentioned in the guidelines and tutorial. I dont understand why these cryptographic sign certs are missing. Did anyone else faced the same issue too? if yes how to resolve this?

Another question that i have related to this is that i am not being asked to provide my own crypto certificates at dashboard. would these certificates be hardcoded then in the new blockchain? Or am i missing a way to provide my own configuration of crypto certificates and then spawn the blockchain according to them? Could not find anything related to this in the documentation..

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello?msg=DSoaT6oR4kT5Xpi6o) @Ulysses If you start cello using the make cmd, then the port mapping is specified in the docker-compose.yml file. 
</p>

And you can learn some knowledge on the docker-compose file here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/

:tools: If you can blindly trust other parties to have your infrastructure and centralize it for the whole network, then a blockchain is not what you need.

Hi...how do I check if chaincode containers are getting created in the pods in kubernetes cluster. Executing this command - ```kubectl get pod <peer-pod name> -o go-template --template="{{range .items}}{{range .spec.containers}}{{.image}} {{end}}{{end}}" ``` lists only the peer and the couch db containers.

hi experts here, what is the chaincode install path in peer?  Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 05:57:02 GMT):<br/>
the default chaincode install path
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 06:21:41 GMT):<br/>
maybe this is set by fabric sdk, not cell. sorry

Hi, what's the differences between `make start-old` and `make start-next`?    
</p>
<p><strong>bjwswang</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 03:43:41 GMT):<br/>
what should I use when start master service ?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 08:56:05 GMT):<br/>
`make start-next` is to use the latest code (on-going).
</p>
<p><strong>bjwswang</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 03:31:41 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @baohua  I am trying to start the master service on my virtual machine.  The command was `SERVER_PUBLIC_IP=x.x.x.x make start`  ,but when I tried to open the dashboard with link x.x.x.x:8080. It redirected to ` localhost/auth/realms/protocal/openid-conection/auth? ...   ` .

@baohua Hi..I am trying to setup new cello project and the chaincode deployment fails gracefully. One thing to notice is that all the peer, orderer and ca pods are being appended with `-0` in the end which is probably hindering with namespace resolution. How do I fix this?

which version are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 13:58:38 GMT):<br/>
I cloned the latest code in the master branch
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 13:59:44 GMT):<br/>
oh, it's on-going now, not finished yet. recently we will make some demo, please watch the meeting~~
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:00:34 GMT):<br/>
oo..ok
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:01:12 GMT):<br/>
could you please provide me with a link to a stable version that works with TLS enabled
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:01:45 GMT):<br/>
sorry, i remember the last release does not claim tls as a feature.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:05:22 GMT):<br/>
ok..I was trying to set that up but I keep getting this error: ```TLS handshake failed with error EOF``` I made a lot of changes in the code and was able to make it work till the instantiation of chaincode on a channel. TLS handshake fails between peer and the chaincode container while executing an invoke. Do you have any pointers here?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:07:20 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, for tls, there should be three things to consider: 1. config all nodes to enable TLS; 2. set correct tls cert/key files to right places. 3. set tls ca info of each org, which will be stored in the channel config.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:08:27 GMT):<br/>
I believe I did that
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:08:53 GMT):<br/>
I need to debug more on this, I guess.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:11:25 GMT):<br/>
Just a quick question, How do I check the grpc version which gets installed on the pods
</p>

Hi All, Can any one help me how to deploy hyperledger fabric(Production ready) using Cello services? @tongli @baohua 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 19:24:58 GMT):<br/>
@sureshtedla did you look at this doc? https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/worker_ansible_docker.md
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 19:25:12 GMT):<br/>
couple of steps to get it going if you have a k8s cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>bjwswang</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 08:24:18 GMT):<br/>
@HarryLovesCode  Were u using latest code ? Cello will do keycloak initialization before start master service. This is the initialization docker-compose file  https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/bootup/docker-compose-files/docker-compose-initial.yml#L26
the docker-compose file will add a volume `- $ROOT_PATH/src/operator-dashboard:/app`  , but `src/operator-dashboard` not longer exists in latest code... 

</p>
<p><strong>bjwswang</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 08:36:09 GMT):<br/>
@HarryLovesCode After  I  reset the commit level to `57f12abd9ae9a8c1997d791fa5de2525ce8530e9`  and start master service with `SERVER_PUBLIC_IP=x.x.x.x ROOT_PATH=${cello_root_path} make start` , the cello service start up successfully now .

</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:10:25 GMT):<br/>
yes, I am doing it in Azure
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:11:05 GMT):<br/>
kubectl exec -it <your peer pod> -- /bin.sh
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:11:21 GMT):<br/>
try to exec to a peer node which is up running.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:11:29 GMT):<br/>
once you log in,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:11:36 GMT):<br/>
cd to this directory
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:11:57 GMT):<br/>
go here /etc/hyperledger/artifacts/keyfiles
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:12:06 GMT):<br/>
then try to locate the tls file.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:13:00 GMT):<br/>
yes, let me try.. but its not able to find the keyfile... one difference from my earlier setup is msp paths are started by `keyfiles\...`  as compared to previous implementation which was `{{fabricworkdir}}\keyfiles`
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:13:59 GMT):<br/>
or, you can unzip the vars/certs.tgz file.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:14:20 GMT):<br/>
that file should be somewhere on your local machine where you run ansible script.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:14:34 GMT):<br/>
there should be a tgz  file which contains every certs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:15:11 GMT):<br/>
you can also do this
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:15:17 GMT):<br/>
```kubectl get pvc```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:15:24 GMT):<br/>
and see if the pvc was created ok.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:15:48 GMT):<br/>
i can find all the files in this directory `/etc/hyperledger/artifacts/keyfiles`
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:16:23 GMT):<br/>
checked pvc too.. created correctly
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:17:50 GMT):<br/>
great.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:17:57 GMT):<br/>
now check the permission of these files.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:18:24 GMT):<br/>
0775
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:18:57 GMT):<br/>
not sure what that means,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:19:08 GMT):<br/>
is it saying read for the world?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:20:50 GMT):<br/>
the file is there but for some reason the CA container can not find it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:21:03 GMT):<br/>
this is very strange.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:21:12 GMT):<br/>
it has read write permissions
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:21:19 GMT):<br/>
I have not tried this on Azure.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:21:39 GMT):<br/>
oo..ok
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:21:50 GMT):<br/>
it seems to me that things should have worked.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:22:16 GMT):<br/>
is it probably due to cange in msp paths?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:22:31 GMT):<br/>
change in msp path?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:22:35 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean by that?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:24:09 GMT):<br/>
in your vars directory or subdir, you should have a file named fabric-pod.yml ,
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:24:10 GMT):<br/>
now the commit has msp path starting by keyfiles\... as compared to previous implementation which was {{fabricworkdir}}\keyfiles
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:25:01 GMT):<br/>
no, it should not.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:25:17 GMT):<br/>
the ca container setting explicitly configured the path.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:25:40 GMT):<br/>
copy that fabric-pod.yml file here, so that I can take a look.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:25:59 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:27:18 GMT):<br/>

not the template.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:35:12 GMT):<br/>
the one actually was used to set up your cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:35:21 GMT):<br/>
you sent me the template.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:35:28 GMT):<br/>
oo..ok..
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:35:31 GMT):<br/>
that is one from the source.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:35:45 GMT):<br/>
simply copy and paste here so that I do not need to download it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:36:03 GMT):<br/>
should be in the keyfiles/run directory.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:36:18 GMT):<br/>
or keyfiles/fabric, I am not exactly sure.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:40:26 GMT):<br/>
its not there.. i did a find as well - `find . -name 'fabric-pod.yml'`
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:44:55 GMT):<br/>
ah?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:45:05 GMT):<br/>
it should be on your local machine.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:45:14 GMT):<br/>
vars directory.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:45:21 GMT):<br/>
or sub directory.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:48:34 GMT):<br/>
found it..
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:49:14 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:50:17 GMT):<br/>
does your cluster have enough resources for all the pods to be running?
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:51:05 GMT):<br/>
yes.. i have 14 vms, each with 7 gb memory
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:51:20 GMT):<br/>
oh, ok.that should be enough.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:51:25 GMT):<br/>
so you have 3 ca nodes,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:51:31 GMT):<br/>
all of them doing the same thing?
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:52:07 GMT):<br/>
yes..
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:52:28 GMT):<br/>
one for each org..
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:56:55 GMT):<br/>
can you try this command
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:56:58 GMT):<br/>
```create deployment myca  --image=hyperledger/fabric-ca:amd64-1.4.1```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:57:22 GMT):<br/>
this simply create a dep and I like to see what happens.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:57:37 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:58:21 GMT):<br/>
`deployment.apps/myca created`
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:59:17 GMT):<br/>
yeah. that means your cluster can run the image without problem.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:59:36 GMT):<br/>
oo..ok
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:00:51 GMT):<br/>
I think I know what the problem is.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:01:18 GMT):<br/>
oo really..what
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:01:31 GMT):<br/>
you have these lines
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:01:35 GMT):<br/>
```        - { name: "FABRIC_CA_SERVER_DB_TYPE", value: "mysql" }
        - { name: "FABRIC_CA_SERVER_DB_DATASOURCE", value: "root:password@tcp(ca1st-orgb-db-mysql:3306)/fabriccadb?parseTime=true" }
```
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:02:16 GMT):<br/>
you changed something to have these lines in.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:03:14 GMT):<br/>
nope..just added those to have mysql as db for fabric ca
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:03:32 GMT):<br/>
where did you make that change?
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:05:55 GMT):<br/>
I added this section for creating a pod to run mysql and reference it later in the fabric ca pod - around line 107
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:06:41 GMT):<br/>
i c.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:06:50 GMT):<br/>
well, I suggest you do this
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:07:19 GMT):<br/>
just use the file network spec file that you have, stand up fabric network and see if everything is ok
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:07:32 GMT):<br/>
once everything works as it should, you can go ahead make that change.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:07:43 GMT):<br/>
I am not quite sure what else you might have changed and where.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:08:13 GMT):<br/>
it is hard for me to debug the issue without knowing what changes that you have made and when and where.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:11:16 GMT):<br/>
ok..let me try it once
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:27:36 GMT):<br/>
ok. yeah. I will be online and let me know how it goes.
</p>
<p><strong>jarvis26</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:38:03 GMT):<br/>
I ran the setup again.. Now all the pods/containers are up properly.. But instantiation of chaincode is failing..

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:58:10 GMT):<br/>
you can remove this network,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:58:26 GMT):<br/>
I mean fabric network by running the destroy command.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:58:46 GMT):<br/>
once your cluster is clean, you can change the tls: true in your network spec file to false.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:59:00 GMT):<br/>
just to try the same thing and see if you can instantiate.

Hi...In the latest code, I see that a couple of k8s specific configurations are removed -such as `mem_req, mem_limit, cpu_req, cpu_limit`. How is the space within the cluster handled now?

Hi guys,
I have a problem with installing HF Cello.
My system:
Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
Docker: 19.03.1
Docker Compose: 1.24.1

Procedures I made:
- Got v0.9 from Github (https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/archive/v0.9.0.zip)
- run make setup-master (2-times)
- run chmod 777 -R /opt/cello
- run SERVER_PUBLIC_IP=192.168.1.10 make start

- first docker ps output:

I have no idea what I did wrong. I cannot start the master. V0.8 and the latest commit are also not working.
I hope you could help me, thanks.

@tongli Hi..  If I want to add a new peer in an existing organization, how should I do it? Is it possible after the network is already up with the certificates generated via cryptogen?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 18:31:17 GMT):<br/>
@jarvis26 currently ansible agent does not support adding new node
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 18:32:11 GMT):<br/>
You can set up a peer node, then use fabric config update to add new node

How do I ensure prevention of data loss. Currently, the chain data resides in production directory which gets created within the docker container within the pod. Should the storage be mapped outside the container so as to ensure persistence? 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 13:42:08 GMT):<br/>
@jarvis26 that is right. In the new k8s operator, we create stateful set for that. Coming up in couple of weeks

Here is an example fix of the move to AZP: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-693 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/cello/+/33843 https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/Cello/_build/results?buildId=554&view=results

@rjones thx
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 21:03:55 GMT):<br/>
@tongli thank you. Let me know when you're ready to move forward on https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-703 - https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/ci-management/+/33856 is part of that work
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 17:55:14 GMT):<br/>
@rjones for some reason I can only do +1 for this https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/ci-management/+/33856
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 17:55:27 GMT):<br/>
is it because I am not the committer for the repo?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 17:56:47 GMT):<br/>
if we merge this patch, does it mean we are starting building cello on Azure?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 21:47:01 GMT):<br/>
yes, please do not merge that patch. please read the JIRA - there is an order to do this
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 21:47:05 GMT):<br/>
@tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 04 Oct 2019 12:52:59 GMT):<br/>
ok, @rjones 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 18:04:01 GMT):<br/>
@baohua please review this dockerfile for building k8s fabric operator agent on docker hub. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/cello/+/33889
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 18:09:38 GMT):<br/>
@rjones good afternoon, I need to build two new images for cello. can you let me know what process should I follow?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 22:18:35 GMT):<br/>
+2!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 22:36:18 GMT):<br/>
@tongli are you ready to move to github or not? Until cello and cello-analytics move to GitHub, use your current process. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 22:37:11 GMT):<br/>
You will be building technical debt but the world is full of trade offs. @baohua @tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 22:37:39 GMT):<br/>
Building debt as you make changes to Jenkins I mean
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 13:56:06 GMT):<br/>
@rjones we need to still resolve these security warning before we move , right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 13:56:59 GMT):<br/>
I do not expect that all the builds will be working perfectly once we move over, but I think we can probably move then gradually making changes to the build scripts.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 21:45:51 GMT):<br/>
@tongli no, the security warnings can wait until you move. those issues are orthogonal.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 14:33:30 GMT):<br/>
@rjones   in that case, can we now move over?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 14:33:45 GMT):<br/>
Next couple of days I can watch and try to fix any issues we might have.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 14:34:15 GMT):<br/>
we do not have a lot of patches since many of the contributors are in China and just coming back from their national holidays.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 21:48:34 GMT):<br/>
OK. @tongli please merge or abandon any in progress patches; also, please merge the change in cello-analytics
</p>

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 17:28:43 GMT):<br/>
yeah. let's take couple of days, I will let everyone know in wechat channel as well, not to check in anything.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 17:35:00 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Do you know if there's any guideline for the new code contribution and ci usage process?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 17:41:32 GMT):<br/>
@baohua it is in GitHub now - https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 18:42:57 GMT):<br/>
@rjones so we can start doing the pull request to the repo?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 18:43:12 GMT):<br/>
(and pretend that gerrit never existed?)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 19:08:53 GMT):<br/>
@rjones seems all our patch have to be reviewed by Baohua, is that how it was setup currently? I tried one pull request, it says it required a code owner to review it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 20:53:24 GMT):<br/>
@rjones got some errors, may need your help.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 20:53:51 GMT):<br/>
I did not create fork but used the web ui created the pull request, but some how it produced a new branch.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 20:54:11 GMT):<br/>
I could not push to that branch since it gives me error like this.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 20:54:23 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 20:54:51 GMT):<br/>
and I could not remove the branch and could not get rid of the pull request,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 20:55:12 GMT):<br/>
it seems that I am stuck with it, can you provide a bit help? Thanks.

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 14:46:07 GMT):<br/>
@rjones good afternoon, since we’ve moved over, what is the process getting our images built and posting them onto docker hub ?

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 14:46:42 GMT):<br/>
Do we need you to create docker hub repo for each image first?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 22:02:58 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I don't think it will be any different - we can just add the auto build stuff like existed before, right?

@baohua I went through the docs https://cello.readthedocs.io/en/master/. I found the section where it says under Getting started section that For beginners, it is highly recommended to read the Setup first. When i went to setup docs, the links are not present for 2nd Steps step

Hi All,
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 07:43:31 GMT):<br/>
Hi All,  I am new to hyperledger cello. I am trying to implement it to our new project in production. However I am confused with some step like 1) which k8s version cello support as k8s 1.12 is deprecated  2) how will I connect with worker node with master node in k8s .                     
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 11:43:59 GMT):<br/>

@AbhijeetSamanta if you are using k8s to stand up your fabric network and using ansible agent, then the k8s 1.1 or newer are all supported. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:53:10 GMT):<br/>
@AbhijeetSamanta looks that you are using the cello dashboard, which currently is not using ansible agent.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:53:19 GMT):<br/>
please see the doc here about ansible agent.

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:19:57 GMT):<br/>
I wonder what k8s cluster do you have.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:20:14 GMT):<br/>
IKS, Azure or aws?
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:20:23 GMT):<br/>
I am using google cloud 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:20:29 GMT):<br/>
ok.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:20:33 GMT):<br/>
should work.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:20:53 GMT):<br/>
I tested awhile back. but now I do not have paid account so that I can not actually try it.
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:21:22 GMT):<br/>
yes sure thanks for help I am going though document now 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:21:35 GMT):<br/>
I remember that the default PVC on google cloud does not allow READWRITEMULTI.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:22:23 GMT):<br/>
you probably can setup a PV class like NFS to allow PVC to be READWRITE by multiple containers
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:22:38 GMT):<br/>
if I will use aws then it will work fine right?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:22:45 GMT):<br/>
things may have been changed on google cloud , but I am not sure.
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:22:53 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:23:11 GMT):<br/>
I had a lot of issues with AWS k8s, 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:23:24 GMT):<br/>
stich with google first probably
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:23:31 GMT):<br/>
stick
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:23:41 GMT):<br/>
ok same here I also faced it aws k8s
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:23:56 GMT):<br/>
once you get a handle on this, you can try on different k8s.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:24:07 GMT):<br/>
it worked great ok IKS.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:24:13 GMT):<br/>
IBM k8s.
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:24:42 GMT):<br/>
ok but I don't have access to it 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:24:56 GMT):<br/>
but IBM K8S mostly just like Google k8s. the only difference is the default PV restriction on google cloud
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:25:09 GMT):<br/>
but that was almost like a year ago. things may have been changed.
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:25:19 GMT):<br/>
also I don't know pricing of IKS
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:25:36 GMT):<br/>
yeah, if you have google, try it first.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:25:44 GMT):<br/>
we can get it through.
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:25:44 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks 
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:26:00 GMT):<br/>
thanks for your replies and help 
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:26:18 GMT):<br/>
:thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:26:29 GMT):<br/>
the only thing I am aware of is the PV restriction. even that we can resolve by adding our own pv class if the restriction is still there.
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:26:46 GMT):<br/>
ok

hi @tongli  could you please let me know how much memory and CPU need for master and worker node for run Cello with K8s
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 02:56:46 GMT):<br/>
@AbhijeetSamanta just to have them running without doing a lot of txs, you can give 0.5 CPU and 1GB ram.
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 13:41:00 GMT):<br/>
Hi @tongli  @baohua  I am trying to implement the Cello in google cloud with one master and 2 worker node. I am running the below command on master node(ubuntu 16.04 lts)) however  I am getting error as "docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/vars:/opt/agent/vars  hyperledger/cello-agent-ansible \   ansible-playbook -i hosts -e "mode=apply env=bc1st" setupfabric.yml" . Please help me to understand what wrong I am doing here. P.S : I have change the bc1st.yaml file. please see the below file bc1st.yaml.

hmmm.  you can change the baseimage_tag just to be this
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:25:02 GMT):<br/>
baseimage_tag: "1.4.3"
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:25:12 GMT):<br/>
and ca also to be the same thing.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:25:32 GMT):<br/>
can you also put the more logs here?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:48:24 GMT):<br/>
@AbhijeetSamanta from the error, it looks like that the peer container in the peer pod can not access the dind container which is how the chaincode container will be created. It seems to me you are not experiences the pvc issues, if indeed that is the case, that is really good.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:48:27 GMT):<br/>
can you confirm that?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:28:06 GMT):<br/>
not quite sure why there is permission denied error.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:28:42 GMT):<br/>
but want to point it out that when you use etcdraft as consesus method, you have to use tls to be true. tls to be false wont work for etcdraft.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:28:53 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:39:45 GMT):<br/>
BTW, with what you have, you are actually setting up 4 orgs total, one orderer org, and 3 peer orgs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:40:17 GMT):<br/>
each peer org has two peers
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:49:15 GMT):<br/>
with limited resources on your k8s cluster, I think you probably can remove few nodes , you actually will have 4 orderer nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:49:50 GMT):<br/>
I think you can simply remove orderers under orderers fabric002
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:51:10 GMT):<br/>
leave orderers under fabric002 empty just like orderers under fabric003.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:51:39 GMT):<br/>
or you can look at the vb1st.yml file as example to have less number of various nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:52:14 GMT):<br/>
also use goleveldb will reduce number of resources needed.
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 18:37:13 GMT):<br/>
thank you very much for your help, otherwise can I can increase the resource if yes how much cpu and memory need for master node and 2 worker node?
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 18:37:13 GMT):<br/>
ok thank otherwise can I can increase the resource if yes how much cpu and memory need for master node and 2 worker node?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 19:04:24 GMT):<br/>
well, I suggest that you go through the simple network setup and make sure everything works, then you can start running some txs and see how it will performe.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 19:04:59 GMT):<br/>
the resource.yaml file actually limit the resource requirements for each type of node.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 19:05:17 GMT):<br/>
you can manupulate that if you do not have a lot of resources.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 19:27:56 GMT):<br/>
but the error does not look like you run out resources.

Hi @tongli  thanks for advise, I have stuck in one thing actually I tried two way to implement the Cello 1st way I created 3 vm instances(ubuntu) [1master and 2 worker ]  and create cluster using k8s. In this approach I have kubeconfig file, however I got error as `_"TASK [Make sure that working directory exists] *********************************
fatal: [cloud]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "There was an issue creating /opt/agent/roles/deploy_k8s/../../vars/bc1st as requested: [Errno 13] Permission d

"  ` In 2nd approach I have create cluster using google Kubernetes engine but I got error as kubecofig file not found as I don't know where the file created as its done automatically by   Kubernetes engine. So could you please help me to understand which approach will good for cello?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Sat, 23 Nov 2019 19:36:14 GMT):<br/>
Hmmm, your kubeconfig file should be in your user root .kube directory.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Sat, 23 Nov 2019 19:36:52 GMT):<br/>
You should copy kubeconfig file to your vars directory when running cello
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Sat, 23 Nov 2019 19:37:07 GMT):<br/>
Which describes all this in the readme doc
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 15:49:25 GMT):<br/>
Hi @tongli  Thanks for the reply, however I am getting same issue which I received early  asd 1st way
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 15:50:07 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. did you name your kubeconfig file actually kubeconfig?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 15:50:39 GMT):<br/>
and place it in your $(pwd)/vars directory?
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:08:38 GMT):<br/>
yes I have change the file name and place it into  $(pwd)/vars  directory
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetSamanta</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:10:15 GMT):<br/>
Could  you please let me know which way will be the best for Cello implementation as I mentioned?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:22:21 GMT):<br/>
I am not really sure how you setup your k8s cluster,  I would think the google one is more reliable.

<p><strong>cmgabriel</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 16:47:29 GMT):<br/>
I am running into the same issue with regard to configuring the persistent volume claim from the ansible playbook.  It fails because on DigitalOcean the pvc access mode of ReadWriteMany is not supported, and thus the pvc hangs in the 'pending' state.  On DO, only ReadWriteOnce access mode is currently supported for the creation of the persistent volume claim (pvc). 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 19:50:55 GMT):<br/>
@cmgabriel you can create your own PV like using NFS based storage.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 19:51:53 GMT):<br/>
doing this is described here. https://docs.okd.io/latest/install_config/storage_examples/shared_storage.html

If there are 4 organisations in a fabric network then should there be a single k8s cluster connecting all of them or 4 k8s clusters talking to each other?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 18:14:56 GMT):<br/>
@AbhijeetSamanta you can’t connect to the k8s cluster. Most likely your kubeconfig file was not in right place. Please follow the instructions 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 18:15:24 GMT):<br/>
Or maybe your kubeconfig file was not created correctly

Hi @tongli, 
Thanks for the starting this project. Cello would really help us to manage our networks. I am new to cello. I just cloned the repo and trying to run it on my system(ubuntu 18.x). Executed _make start_ which spins up all the required containers perfectly. But, I am not able to login to dashboard on _localhost:8081-throws a 400 error_ and couldn't connect to operators dashboard at all at _localhost:8080_(as mentioned in tutorial of cello).

Hi Cello Community, I'm trying to setup the Cello Master Node and Docker Worker agent using latest v0.9 git repository. 
</p>
<p><strong>ddhulla</strong> (Fri, 27 Dec 2019 14:02:37 GMT):<br/>
Hi Cello Community, I'm trying to setup the Cello Master Node and Docker Worker agent using latest v0.9 git repository. As per Hyperledger Cello documentation there should be Operator Dashboard running on 8080 and User dashboard on 8081. I can only see dashboard running on 8081, but nothing running on 8080. 

I'm following steps mentioned in the link below:
https://hyperledger-cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/setup_master/

Moreover, the user dashboard running on 8081 doesn't seem to have Smart Contract option mentioned in the standard documentation:
https://hyperledger-cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dashboard_user/

Is this expected or am I missing something? Has someone successfully setup the Cello Master and Worker with latest version? Can you please share the steps?

Thank you
</p>

Does cello only function with k8s deployments of Fabric? When I looked around the user dashboard, it was the only option.

Hello everyone, I attempted to setup cello for the first time following the getting started documentation. Running 'make setup-master' for v0.8.0 and v0.9.0 informed me that several cello images (cello-mongo, cello-base, cello-operator-dashboard, cello-user-dashboard,etc) were not accessible on docker with the tag x86 64-latest. I'm not entirely sure what steps I should take to resolve this.

@rjones I do not seem have the access to configure the automated builds.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 16:57:17 GMT):<br/>
for some reasons, we have two hyperledger/cello-agent-ansible and hyperledger/cello-ansible-agent.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 16:57:51 GMT):<br/>
cello-agent-ansible is fine, cello-ansible-agent is not. all the docs we have are based on cello-ansible-agent.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 16:58:53 GMT):<br/>
ideally we should just have cello-ansible-agent working and remove cello-agent-ansible. but the builds have issues with the right one, I do not have permission to look into the automated build.

yes, please

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 19:03:49 GMT):<br/>
if you can't disable them, I can disable the other two builds if you like
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 19:07:13 GMT):<br/>
let me try.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 19:08:10 GMT):<br/>
OK. I'm interested to know, since it's connected already, if you can
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 19:08:16 GMT):<br/>
no, I cant disable them. same issue. I think because I can not access the auto build config
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 19:08:51 GMT):<br/>
I can only trigger a build. but cannot disable or make changes to any of them.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 19:11:03 GMT):<br/>
OK. So should I disable, or delete, the builds for latest-x86_64 and 080?

hello cello folks.  I am trying to deploy k8s through the ansible script in the repository.  I was wondering if you could redirect me to the binary releases that were up on nexus before that was taken down...https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/hyperledger-fabric/linux-amd64-1.1.0/hyperledger-fabric-linux-amd64-1.1.0.tar.gz, was where it was referenced
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 06 Mar 2020 20:58:21 GMT):<br/>
@cmonkeydo https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v1.1.1
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 06 Mar 2020 20:58:39 GMT):<br/>
@cmonkeydo the binary is at the bottom
</p>
<p><strong>cmonkeydo</strong> (Fri, 06 Mar 2020 20:58:46 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the quick response @rjones 
</p>
<p><strong>cmonkeydo</strong> (Fri, 06 Mar 2020 21:11:10 GMT):<br/>
in the documentation for working with ansible there is no provcluster.yml file 
ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply env=mycloud cloud_type=os" provcluster.yml 

My assumption is that this is wrapped up in the fabric_k8s plays in the first step?  Is my assumption valid?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 06 Mar 2020 21:13:08 GMT):<br/>
@tongli ^^ ?

<p><strong>cmonkeydo</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 19:42:30 GMT):<br/>
Hey all,  I see in the repo there is kubernetes, ansible and fabric operator agents available.  For my ansible deployment I get almost all the way through however when a peerlist pod attempts to pull from a resource eg docker.io/hyperledger/cc-env:1.4.4 it can't resolve it.  The context for this is a bare metal system so not in the cloud, however I am not sure that that is an issue or not. 
</p>
<p><strong>cmonkeydo</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 19:45:48 GMT):<br/>
All in another test I am going from the fabric-operator docs.  I get to the ca section (with defaults from the repo) and the ca pod never gets Ready.  From what I can tell it has to do with the storage which I have added default pvc storage.  Currently I have added the default config to have the same storageClass as the pv and yet the pvc does not currently mount.  Any help on this or the above question would be greatly appreciated.  
</p>
<p><strong>cmonkeydo</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:31:06 GMT):<br/>
I have figured out that the issue was because I didn't have the correct mode of ReadWriteOnce on my pv for each of the different types of systems.  This seems like something that should be added to the documentation for the operator.  I can write something up if that would be appreciated.
</p>
<p><strong>cmonkeydo</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:32:34 GMT):<br/>
On the documentation for the fabric-operator read me there is r
To run the operator using the cello API or dashboard follow the instructions here :- Fabric Operator Agent README

Which has a link back to the Fabric operator agent readmen (e.g. the same page I am reading)   Is there documentation somewhere on integrating the gui with the operator api?

using export DEPLOY_METHOD=k8s and running the start script did install things on the local k8s node, however I am unable to access the dashboard from the 8081 or  8080 ports....not sure if nginx is the issue on this or not

you can force push to your local repo after a git squash and it will update the PR

Hi Team,

We are facing issue while setting up cello master node. 
To setup the master node, we run the following command.

            make setup-master

Getting the following error while executing the " make setup-master" command.

Download required Docker images for Cello Services...
Downloading the docker images for Cello services: VERSION=latest ARCH=x86_64

Note:

After executing  "make setup-master" command, I'm able to open the user dashboard on port 8081 but operator dashboard not working. As per the documentation, operator dashboard should work on port 8080 by default.



Please help.

<p><strong>cmonkeydo</strong> (Mon, 16 Mar 2020 17:56:32 GMT):<br/>
Looking at the dockerhub repo of hyperledger/cello* it do es not seem that they are multi arch builds.  You can look at https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/cello-api-engine/tags to see what I mean.  The :x96_64 is not one of the tags available. 

Good luck

I tried going to the ReadTheDocs site for the same ( https://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/server/ ), but the documentation doesnt have content under 'Setup/Server'. Also 'Operations/Dashboard' tab doesn't have any information under the sections 'Operator operations', 'Admin operations' and 'User operations'.  Same goes for section 'Agent/Ansible' and I couldn't find the sample fabric network spec after it redirected to https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/tree/master/src/operator-dashboard/agent/ansible/vars/bc1st.yml

Hello All,
We are evaluating using Cello to deploy a HLF 2.x network. 
Is it supported by Cello? If yes, any latest deployment guide available to setup HLF network using Cello?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 17 Sep 2020 16:13:15 GMT):<br/>
HLF 2.x is not yet.

As far as I know, Cello still only supports Fabric. If you are interested in deploying a Hyperledger Besu network, you may want to check out #blockchain-automation-framework -- this is a lab that allows you to deploy networks for a number of different frameworks, including Besu

95% of all the software we have all made money off of and built business and empires off off, just worked, really it did, you followed the instruction in the docks and there was no guessing till you got your configs, Apache, CSS , HTML, PHP, NODE, Asterisk, Wordpress, Joomla, GIT, I mean I go on and on. I have yet to use one hyper ledger product that just worked
</p>
<p><strong>gameprofits</strong> (Wed, 29 Sep 2021 15:39:45 GMT):<br/>
you followed the instrctions which were simple enough for an engineer to understand or even a noob engineer, and you are set up and running ready to poke away at your own configs and products, Docker and Conatinerd, Work out the get go? Would it be nice if you had to sit there fugit with dockers underlineings before we started our own works, Just some food for thought, was this project not given money for this software to work ?

hi all, I am new to cello. One question I have after some reading on the internet is, is it possible to use Cello web interface to create a new peer in another server (in another organisation/region).

Hi All, quick question: would anyone from the Cello community be willing to help me by filling out a survey[1] for the TSC chat platform task force? I'm happy to do the typing if anyone would prefer to get on a call and just explain themselves instead of filling it out themselves. (I can't make it to the weekly call unfortunately because it's at 1 AM my time)

are you able to access the dashboard and perform any actions from the UI?
</p>
<p><strong>KavyaR</strong> (Fri, 07 Jan 2022 10:58:38 GMT):<br/>
Hi all,we are trying to setup Hyperledger cello for HLF(2.2). The thing is any action we perform in the dashboard, its routing to the same font-end api,the request is not passing to the api engine. is  there any workaround for this/any scripts available to validate our setup?
</p>
<p><strong>SkandaGurunathanR</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 09:46:56 GMT):<br/>
use "admin@cello.com" as email and "pass" as password

Cello-0.9.0h3c is a version that can be used, I think if main branch Can't run ,maybe,you can try 0.9.0h3c  branch
