{"msg":"@here -- high level question. Concerto became Fabric Composer, but does not actually manage fabrics, rather concerning itself with participants, data models, transactions (micro chaincode from my perspective) and ledgers. Cello has retained its name and concerns itself with fabrics and chains (channels).\n\nIt seems to me that these two should merge. Both are mostly stuck on v0.6 right now, although there are patches for v1 waiting to go into composer as soon as someone can figure out how to do that without killing momentum completely. \n\nSo my question is whether Cello will be merged into composer (as it truly *is* a fabric composer), at least in name and style if not directly into the code base?

{"msg":"Presumably, someone could support blockchains other than Fabric with BNA. But that requires significant development resources, and getting one to work well should take priority in my opinion. For example, while Fabric and Ethereum state similar goals, Fabric has quite a different view of how to meet those goals. Trying to stay at the 10,000 foot level just means that a tool cannot service either well ...","username":"kletkeman","ts":"2017-04-26T13:30:12.390Z"}
{"msg":"And it's not about all singing/dancing, as we proposed from the beginning of the project, we wanna provide more opinions for those potential hyperledger users. You can see there're various solutions by using different hyperledger tools. There were some specific \"tool-suite\" discussions before, too.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-04-26T13:30:38.203Z"}
{"msg":"Ok, I was not around at that time. I'm more focused on getting to the point where a detailed deployment with a complete definition can be performed easily. That requires pushing forward on one set of technologies. I will follow Cello as a non-integrated tool for now. It looks like it could prove very useful even without tight integration to tools like composer. Thanks.","username":"kletkeman","ts":"2017-04-26T13:32:57.542Z"}
{"msg":"yeap, that's exactly what we are working on now. We noticed that such an abstract might be too difficult to finish everything. So we plan  to start by supporting several. And since there's long roadmap to take, it would be a little too earlier to say which is the \"best-practice\". Actually, best-practice is coming from practices. Would u agree that?","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-04-26T13:32:58.381Z"}
{"msg":"However, i would welcome u help open a jira issue to track the idea of letting cello support your BNA format.

{"msg":"I think we are just now developing an understanding of the value of blockchains in certain scenarios, and we are moving towards the ability to deploy Fabric on multiple topologies using multiple container technologies etc. So best practices will change as the Fabric community gets experience with real deployements over time.

{"msg":"I'm not in the Composer team, but I will certainly look over them both if I can find the time. I have been hoping to find a tool to ease the pain of deploying complex Fabrics.

{"msg":"yeap, it will change, we have tried many topologies also, and find the underly technique is important, while there are also many key values from business, management and security conditions.

{"msg":"I think u're talking about the operation, not only the deployment. the deployment usually happens once, while operations are more persistent and complex.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-04-26T13:38:06.445Z"}
{"msg":"We wanna start from deployment, and then evolve with more operational supports","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-04-26T13:38:38.589Z"}

{"msg":"Yes, I see them as the same thing, because deployments evolve over time. Added Participants usually imply added endorsers / orderers / observers ... that kind of thing. The ability to deploy all that automatically after updating a business network definition would be magical.","username":"kletkeman","ts":"2017-04-26T13:39:20.026Z"}
{"msg":"And added participants can join channels, so everything is interconnected.","username":"kletkeman","ts":"2017-04-26T13:39:47.675Z"}

{"msg":"@baohua @tongli Hi Guys, I'm trying to comprehend the design of Cello with respect to Kubernetes. Kindly comment on my observations/questions.\n\n1. Currently Cello supports Docker (single node) and Docker Swarm. This is done via calls to docker-compose in src/agent/docker scripts. Can't comment on vSphere as I'm not familiar with it.\n\n2. Support for Kubernetes is via CLI at src/agent/k8s scripts. It is not wired with the Operator Dashboard just yet.\n\n3. There are ansible scripts that deploys fabric to different environments (Docker and Kubernetes)\n   - Is the intention of these scripts is to replace current agent implementation? Operator Dashboard will then call these ansible scripts to provision a fabric cluster instead?\n\n4. There is an empty src/agent/k8s-operator folder\n   - Based on CE-68 the intention is to use an Kubernetes Operator (http://bit.ly/2FTDiDv) to provition a fabric network.\n\n5. What is the planned design for supporting Kubernetes?\n   - Items #2, #3 and #4 seems to be in conflict in my opinion","username":"yopep","ts":"2018-03-20T10:44:39.363Z"}

{"msg":"Hi together, I have some questions about Cello as we need something to provision a Fabric consortium network. We have a couple of organisations involved in the Fabric/Composer network, let's say 7. All of them should have their very own control about one (or more) peer Fabric nodes. Only one channel is needed with one Composer business network definition deployed.\nIs this also possible with Cello? The documentation reads like Cello sees all added infrastructure as a blockchain cluster. All infrastructure is maintained/controlled by the ones who work with Cello. But the organisations themselves do not really have control about their very own peer node.\nIs Cello considering those idiomatic architectures or is the usage of Cello really forcing me to do a \"centralised blockchain operations\"?\nThanks :-) ","username":"jverhoelen","ts":"2018-04-10T19:03:05.411Z"}

Check if the specified host path exists and is the expected type\"\n\nWhen I encountered this, I found that  configtx.yaml had changed from a file into being an empty directory. Very strange. Although I don't have insight into root cause, I have noticed this happening after I stop and later restart either the Master, the Worker, or maybe both. It may be that I am not doing something that I should be doing to shutdown the worker \"cleanly\", so that it can be restarted without losing state. For reference, my worker is a Docker host. I am running my fabrics on an internal IBM cloud platform (\"Fyre\") where we are encouraged to suspend the VM's when we are not using them.\n\nI have found that by removing all images on both Master and Worker, and then re-pulling them, it clears the problem. I suspect I only need to reset the state on the NFS file system, but haven't explored the issue further.\n\nGuidance from the experts on gracefully suspending and resuming a running system may be helpful. I'm using the 'make {start | stop}' on the Master, but don't know what I should be doing on the Worker. Thanks.","username":"kipharris","ts":"2018-07-31T23:09:53.926Z"}
