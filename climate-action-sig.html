Hi @all my name is Martin Wainstein, and I'll be chairing this SIG alongside Tom Baumann. I run the Yale Open Innovation Lab, and climate finance projects at the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab. We actively work on climate across the whole scope and have been working closely with Hyperledger in recent months. Will be updating the wiki and mailing list soon. Great to have this launched and looking forward to some great discussions happening here!

Can anyone remember who posted the whitepaper "A DID for Everything" in the Zoom chat on the 11th. I have just read through it. The idea that lieterally everyhting can have an ID and that the provenance of data can be verified transparently will be extremely importnant when accounting for actions on planetary scale. The way in which DADs are namespacible also present

The way in which DADs are namespacible also present a lot of opportunities for standarisation. A standard for the way in which we identify data, data sources, data processors and curators within the context of climate change  mitigation and adaptation could be something that this group can work on that can benefit a lot of the work many of us are already doing

Zoom chat is great for certain things. In meetings, rocket chat is preferred over zoom chat because of greater transparency and persistence. Zoom chat is integrated and immediate, but disappears- can be recovered after the call, when recording-

<p><strong>ChristiaanPauw</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 08:20:38 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the links. I still have to think through the implications of the distintion between public and privte DID in the context on climate change mitigation and adaptiation projects. I struggle to see the connection between ReSpec.js and DIDs / DADs - maybe you can elucidate
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 16 Feb 2020 03:57:17 GMT):<br/>
you may want to look over the Trust over IP RFC in Hyperledger Aries ... https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack

We see this as the emerging stack for trustworthy data exchange. 

I believe that the most important packaging of data will be in Layer 3 of the stack ... a key one being Verifiable Credentials (a W3C data format standard). These will be the things that allow us to create trustworthy representations of constructs like a GHG Emmission profile. This is what we can "count". Then we can construct accounting systems that are able to track these constructs. Quite analagous to money and accounting practices.

DIDs will be a lower level construct that machines largely deal with. DIDs for public issuers and Peer DIDs to faciliate the DIDComm procotol at layer 2.

Have a look and see what you think. Happy to answer questions.

Hello all,  my name is Peter Clarke, and I'll be chairing this SIG alongside Robin and Sherwood.  I put together a blockchain startup about 5 years ago with alumni from LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics called Affine. Our mission was to develop  projects that would address global challenges by using emerging technologies. This started with Fabric v0.6 and connecting with central banks on 8 May 2016. Great to participate in CASIG and looking forward to serve the CASIG community! Peter

This is a good approach for debugging couchdb. Thank for adding this to the docs.
I'm currently working on the deployment Hyperledger Explorer.  Once we got the Explorer up and running in one of our Kubernetes clusters we can access some of the data more easily

@RobinKlemens Hi, Robin 
I'm working to modify https://github.com/opentaps/blockchain-carbon-accounting/tree/main/utility-emissions-channel/docker-compose-setup
to run it with external chaincode service, I've modified core.yaml, set
externalBuilders:
  - name: external-builder
    path: /builders/external

and I've put build, detect and release scripts into the /builders/external path on the peer container, i.e. everything similar to the aws kubernetes deployment,
but attempt to install chaincode says 'Unknown chaincodeType: EXTERNAL'
Are there any other parameters should be set to allow install external chaincode ?

Hi @robertjames77, our current setup runs on Fabric v. 2.2.1. Thus, we won't be able to join your network without adjustments.
In which environment are you operating your network? Are there any additional organizations participating?

What application are currently running on top of your network?
thx, Robin

@VipinB Yes, there is more information on the securitisation network posted on the CASIG wiki in Draft Form. We will provide you with a link to V2.  The structure is a hybrid multi-seller, 'cascading' or 'waterfall'  variable note programme.

By 'participating organisations' I assume you mean collaborators rather than organisations org1 org2. The answer to the first question is we are not collaborating yet with another team or organisation.  The second question - org1 and org2  orderer1 using Kafka and the application lawyer is 'Securitizaton' .

Also I cannot see a volumes mount in `docker-compose-carbonAccounting.yaml` which mounts the `core.yaml`.
Mount the `core.yaml` file to the following location:

<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 06:41:31 GMT):<br/>
I suggest you copy the `core.yaml` from https://github.com/opentaps/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/main/multi-cloud-deployment/fabric-config/core.yaml and rename the folder `./configtx` to `./fabric-config` and then also put the `core.yaml` there
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 06:45:07 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for forwarding my questions.
As long as we don't run the fabric networks at the same version, we cannot "merge" our networks.
However, I suggest you take a look at https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/tree/main/multi-cloud-deployment
That's our current configuration. We'll launch the network soon with three organizations. Each organization will host it's own fabric-ca, 1 orderer, and at least 1 peer
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 06:46:43 GMT):<br/>

@RobinKlemens Good morning Robin.  I am reading notes on handovers during the night. OK 1. No, v. 1.4 Fabric is not compatible with 2.0+   2.  Leave the Securitisation Blockchain at the Multi-Channel Level  3.  Peter (me) to provision new blockchain v 2.0 + testnet .
</p>
<p><strong>PeterCLARKE</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 06:50:44 GMT):<br/>
@RobinKlemens I took a quick look at Github and the Emissions Token Network has 2 organizations which appear to be auditors.
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 16:49:50 GMT):<br/>
@RobinKlemens Thank you. I've made those changes. It worked. I was able install external chaincode. Continue working on the modifications to use it.
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 16:56:28 GMT):<br/>
Correct. This is the configuration of the current setup for local testing. However, once we move to a production-ready system, more organizations will host the network (at least 3). If the act as auditors is not decided yet
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 16:57:12 GMT):<br/>
Glad to hear that!! Thanks for your contribution!!! :hyperledger:
</p>
<p><strong>PeterCLARKE</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 19:41:26 GMT):<br/>
@RobinKlemens I am in heated agreement!  Once you start to get to>15 organisations on Fabric, performance starts to degrade dramatically across all metrics. Latency, throughput, and the data validation pipeline. We can discuss at the peer programming meeting  1. Separating transaction data from metadata so that only transaction ID is needed to determine the transaction order 2) cache unmarshalled blocks at the committer  and 3. use a hash table for state storage are reliable approaches to actually improve performance. What we used was not really a consensus algorithm as Kafka+ Zookeeper never proved a bottleneck.
</p>
<p><strong>PeterCLARKE</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 19:45:14 GMT):<br/>
@Robinklemens on Besu, that degrades at the atomic cross chain .  This eThaler design is different as it is not ERC20. Thank you . Plan is to set up network to trade 'tokens (Account UXTO in our case) with main emissions channel.
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 20:20:30 GMT):<br/>
@PeterCLARKE Handover. It looks to me like we can try a test with @SiChen and @RobinKlemens to 'trade' tokens.
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 20:22:43 GMT):<br/>
@PeterCLARKE I will post to the Wiki my next draft of the securitisation document, handover to India and update the MURAL.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 21:12:51 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I will take a look, maybe you can discuss how we can take this forward including a presentation in the CMSIG about securitization
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 09:53:15 GMT):<br/>
As said, we start with three organizations and I think it will take a long time (if ever) that we cross the number of 15 organizations. 
Since Fabric v. 2.x, Kafka and Zookeeper are deprecated. Also, Kafka only works properly within one Kubernetes cluster. We run the network in three different and independent clusters. 
Fabric 2.2 LTS uses a Raft-based consensus algorithm.

In terms of chaincode performance, it would definitely make sense to review the chaincode `emissionscontract.js` 
If you could review the code and post your recommendations to GitHub in the form of issues, that would be great.

What are the pro and cons of using eThaler (EIP 1155 or EIP 20) vs. UXTO (ERC20) token? Having a list of arguments for each solution could help the group to decide on the most suitable token implementation
</p>
<p><strong>PeterCLARKE</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:04:57 GMT):<br/>
@RobinKlemens Morning.
</p>
<p><strong>PeterCLARKE</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:05:21 GMT):<br/>
I do not agree about 15 orgs but it is irrelevant .
</p>
<p><strong>PeterCLARKE</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:06:05 GMT):<br/>
The reason is that Fabric can be reconfigured to workaround the bottleneck.

@PeterCLARKE how do you think these documents fit into the mission of the CA2SIG? https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CASIG/Climate+Action+and+Accounting+SIG+Home
The use cases sound very interesting. However, I'm not sure if the Hyperledger Climate SIG is the right place for them. Yes, biodiversity has value to climate but I think more on a global scale than based on species like the Sumatran tiger.
</p>
<p><strong>PeterCLARKE</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 01:47:26 GMT):<br/>
@RobinKlemens Excellent point about "biodiversity having value to the climate ...on a global scale"   .  I see this identification of value as within scope of the Climate SIG , through the work of Nova.org (Christian) OS Climate (Tom, Martin) . The video of the tiger was to welcome new members joining from Indonesia and Malaysia.
</p>
<p><strong>PeterCLARKE</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 01:51:24 GMT):<br/>
A story about the Black Forest (and the acid rain from RWE) or the English countryside, California Coast, are other examples of the global value of these fragile ecosystems.
</p>
<p><strong>lewislinford</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 02:08:30 GMT):<br/>
What we are doing here is we are using the video. The video is a human interest story to welcome new members to personalise our own experience with climate change we want to share the message that computer sience is alot more inclusive than people think.

<p><strong>SherwoodMo</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 03:32:29 GMT):<br/>
@PeterCLARKE @lewislinford - I've got to agree with @RobinKlemens Peter and Lewis. It is important to keep our content and discussions related to the scope of the SIG. The video of the Sumatran Tiger is outside of the mission and scope of the SIG.
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 08:36:57 GMT):<br/>
A securitization is a form of financing. You pool little projects in Africa and Indonesia to get to a certain scale. These projects are typically off-grid solar projects. Pooling them is done by blockchain .
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 08:40:02 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>SherwoodMo</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:37:33 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your understanding :)
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:40:41 GMT):<br/>
Sherwood, I care about the big picture here. When we are asked to bring in Stanford or COP26, and do so, then it is embarrassing to ask them to wait. If Si needs projects, then you have to go to Indonesia or Latin America to get them. That's all.
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:42:46 GMT):<br/>
So, what would you like me to do with PandU of the Blockchain Indoneisa Society and Friends? Here, I can put together something in Bahasa, their native language. It is all about Si needing a project and I am here to help. Tigers notwithstanding.
</p>
<p><strong>SherwoodMo</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:44:33 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Robert, I think just use your best judgement. As long as the content that we publish and the conversations that we have focus directly focused on the work of the SIG, then we are in good shape.
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:44:34 GMT):<br/>
In the meantime, we can look at some of these programming issues as they are less ethereal.
</p>
<p><strong>sichen</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:45:40 GMT):<br/>
Robert thank you for your help here.  If someone in Indonesia is interested in working with us, would they like to join a call, email our list so we can find out what they'd like?
</p>
<p><strong>sichen</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:46:27 GMT):<br/>
The video idea is just to talk about the members of the group and what they're working on.  There are a lot of issues related to climate, but right now we need to focus a bit.
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:47:05 GMT):<br/>
The focus is on the international climate conference and a project involving blockchain.
</p>
<p><strong>sichen</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:49:32 GMT):<br/>
Robert I'm just confused.  What are you and your colleagues looking to do?  Are you looking to use our code to do a project?  Writing new code?
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:49:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes, we have the entire blockchain society of indonesia and a couple from malaysia, plus bankers and others expert in Shari'a finance.
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:49:57 GMT):<br/>
The confusion is because of separate email threads, no more.
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:51:03 GMT):<br/>
I believe we share the same purpose. Simplicity. We have a 11 blockchains, 1 in production. Some of the 11 can be cannabalised based upon the code in Hyperledger Labs.
</p>
<p><strong>robertjames77</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:53:41 GMT):<br/>
Rather than me type up stuff in a channel, why don't I send you a roadmap of one page!
</p>
<p><strong>sichen</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 16:18:36 GMT):<br/>
That's great.  Would you like me to join one of your group meetings so I could talk about what we're doing and learn about what they're interested in?
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 17:40:52 GMT):<br/>
@RobinKlemens organization: opentaps
OrdererEndpoints:
  - fabric-orderer.opentaps.net:443
AnchorPeers:
  - Host: fabric-peer.opentaps.net
    Port: 443

One question. I saw you committed *.pem and *.crt. Are they public keys ?
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 17:44:14 GMT):<br/>
yes, they are just public keys and we need them for TLS communication and Fabric's MSP.
See:
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/it/release-2.2/create_channel/create_channel_config.html#organizations 
and
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/it/release-2.2/create_channel/create_channel_config.html#orderer
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 17:45:17 GMT):<br/>
To be sure that you don't upload private information you can decrypt the certificates with `openssl x509  -text -noout -in ./path-to-cert-file` and check the information
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 17:46:46 GMT):<br/>
Ok, so what I need is just  commit same structure for organization 'opentaps' with keys which was used for cluster deployment. Right ?
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 17:48:08 GMT):<br/>
yes, right. Be sure to only upload as much certificates as needed.
Do the same for opentabs:
```├── emitras
│   ├── msp
│   │   ├── cacerts
│   │   │   └── fabric-ca-emissionsaccounting-emitras-de-443-fabric-ca-emissionsaccounting-emitras-de.pem
│   │   ├── config.yaml
│   │   └── tlscacerts

</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 17:48:23 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 17:50:40 GMT):<br/>
I'll update the `configtx.yaml` file once you and @pavelkrolevets have uploaded the public information. Also, I'll create the channel artifacts for the orderer and peer nodes and upload them as well. 
However, with all the information of the three organizations and the `configtx.yaml` file you could create the channel artifacts on your own
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Fri, 26 Mar 2021 18:21:12 GMT):<br/>
I've created opentaps network artifacts
they are here

@RobinKlemens Hi, Robin
I'm continue working on docker-compose-setup chaincode ext
Trying to deploy ext chaincode with new script deployCCExt.sh, it is similar we have in the deploy-aws
but got an error:
Error: failed to retrieve broadcast client: orderer client failed to connect to orderer1.auditor1.carbonAccounting.com:7050: 
failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded
Why do you think it could be happened ?
Can you take a look at my latest commits in the 
https://github.com/opentaps/blockchain-carbon-accounting
when you have a chance
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 15:19:56 GMT):<br/>
Can you send orderer logs, please?
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 16:31:43 GMT):<br/>
@KonstantinRybalko my orderer is up and runnig
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 16:57:15 GMT):<br/>
@RobinKlemens I've deleted orderer and peer
recreated system-genesis-block map
restared orderer but it is on the Init:0/1 status now
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:10:11 GMT):<br/>
what is the status of your orderer now?
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:10:32 GMT):<br/>
it is same
Init:0/1
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:11:38 GMT):<br/>
okay. Can you check the logs of your init container?
I have a feeling that the secret `orderer1-crypto` could be missing in your namespace
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:12:50 GMT):<br/>
I tried to see log, but it says
Error from server (BadRequest): container "fabric-orderer" in pod "fabric-orderer-6b94b74596-sx6jt" is waiting to start: PodInitializing
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:14:03 GMT):<br/>
what is orderer1-crypto ?
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:14:59 GMT):<br/>
See step 2
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/tree/main/multi-cloud-deployment/deploy-aws#42-orderer
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:15:37 GMT):<br/>
The secret is called `orderer-crypto`
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:16:48 GMT):<br/>
but it was there before
do you mean it should be recreated as well ?
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:17:29 GMT):<br/>
but it looks like nothing changed for it
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:17:43 GMT):<br/>
Have you created the pvc?
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:18:01 GMT):<br/>
Is the pvc used by any other container?
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:19:56 GMT):<br/>
PersistentVolumeClaim still be same
I've run
kubectl delete -f ./fabric-orderer-deployment.yaml -n fabric-production
recreated system-genesis-block
and run
kubectl apply -f ./fabric-orderer-deployment.yaml -n fabric-production
again
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:20:23 GMT):<br/>
You need to recreate pvc as well
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:21:03 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise you would use the old configuration, ledger data etc.
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:21:21 GMT):<br/>
i.e. it is better to create  new ec2 volume , right ?
</p>
<p><strong>pritam_01</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:22:54 GMT):<br/>
Is it necessary to have S3 cred in order to run api server ? or do we have in-Memory-Wallet implement?  actually I don't have a AWS account  
@RobinKlemens
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:24:35 GMT):<br/>
actually, when I deleted it , pvc also seems deleted
persistentvolume "pv-static-fabric-orderer" deleted
service "fabric-orderer" deleted
persistentvolumeclaim "fabric-orderer" deleted
deployment.apps "fabric-orderer" deleted
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:25:43 GMT):<br/>
okay. So the step `Create ebs volume` is done
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:25:58 GMT):<br/>
1 sec
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:26:07 GMT):<br/>
you have created `system-genesis-block`configmap
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:26:42 GMT):<br/>
and created a secret containing all the crypto material of the orderer called `orderer-crypto`
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:30:25 GMT):<br/>
I've created new volume
and run 
kubectl apply -f ./fabric-orderer-deployment.yaml -n fabric-production
again
and got
persistentvolume/pv-static-fabric-orderer created
service/fabric-orderer created
persistentvolumeclaim/fabric-orderer created
deployment.apps/fabric-orderer created
but orderer again in status Init
fabric-production   fabric-orderer-6b94b74596-n759t              0/1     Init:0/1    0          107s
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:31:21 GMT):<br/>
Are you able to retrieve the logs of the init container?
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:32:06 GMT):<br/>
log says 
Error from server (BadRequest): container "fabric-orderer" in pod "fabric-orderer-6b94b74596-n759t" is waiting to start: PodInitializing
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:32:11 GMT):<br/>
nothing else
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:33:42 GMT):<br/>
can you run `kubectl describe pod fabric-orderer-6b94b74596-n759t` and post the output here?
</p>
<p><strong>sichen</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:34:23 GMT):<br/>
No it is not.  We have the serverless option to run s3 locally
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:34:58 GMT):<br/>
1 sec, it seems it cannot mount a volume
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:35:03 GMT):<br/>
and run `kubectl logs fabric-orderer-6b94b74596-n759t -c init-container-orderer` please and also post the logs
</p>
<p><strong>sichen</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:36:17 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:40:11 GMT):<br/>
sometimes it cannot mount a volume
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:40:30 GMT):<br/>
so what do we do next ?
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:40:41 GMT):<br/>
starting a peer ?
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:41:48 GMT):<br/>
Check the logs fo your orderer and see if it's communicating with `fabric-orderer1.emissionsaccounting.emitras.de`
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:42:14 GMT):<br/>
It looks good in my logs :)
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:43:55 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:46:42 GMT):<br/>
Then we can both start our peers and then make them join the channel
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:47:17 GMT):<br/>
ok, I'll start a peer now

However, use the channel config stored in network-artifacts
</p>
<p><strong>KonstantinRybalko</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:48:01 GMT):<br/>
ok, let me see
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:54:04 GMT):<br/>
No we do this step https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/tree/main/multi-cloud-deployment/deploy-aws#44-test-your-infrastructure-against-the-test-configuration
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:54:12 GMT):<br/>
But don't deploy chaincode yet
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:54:44 GMT):<br/>
eeehm. Wait please

yes I will be applying for "Implement Client Side Security for Climate SIG Fabric Application" since I have already worked on fabric-client extensively in my previous internship with an start-up.
Fabric and ethereum  integration with Cactus also excites me, and will learn about cactus.

for time being (before internship starts in June) I will try to resolve as much as good-for-first issue I can, this will give me more clarity about the mission and the code-base.

I've fixed this error eventually. Did not notice that is was at the moment of the chaincode commit on the first place.
Added 20 sec pause after chaincode checkcommitreadiness and it worked.
So, utility-emissions-channel/docker-compose-setup works with external chaincode now, and I am able to record emission locally from opentaps_seas.

Last week, we launched our Hyperledger Fabric network running in two different Kubernetes clusters at the moment. We started with setting up the utility emissions channel (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CASIG/Utility+Emissions+Channel).

To check the current state of the network you can access https://explorer.emissionsaccounting.emitras.de/ (which is now secured with TLS)
Username: ca2sig
Password: ca2sig1234

If anyone wants to join the network, we have the readme ready for DigitalOcean and AWS EKS. The readme (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/tree/main/multi-cloud-deployment)  helps you to set up a fabric network in one Kubernetes cluster. If all the tests pass you're ready to join our production-grade network. 
Looking forward to onboarding more organizations, chaincodes, and use cases.
Cheers,
Robin

Hey folks --- the Standards WG call is - Tuesday May 11 8AM Pacific, 5PM CET

Please join us on the call -- https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CASIG/Standards+WG++-+Meeting+May+11
Zoom: https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community.backup?pwd=dkJKdHRlc3dNZEdKR1JYdW40R2pDUT09

Agenda:
Test our ontology against the simplest case of climate impact reporting, namely offsetting one's personal carbon footprint. We will discuss and compare two different methods for doing so. If you would like to prepare for the session, we suggest you look at the following two examples:
* https://www.footprintcalculator.org/
* https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/footprintcalc

Hi all! I'm Danielle and am new here. Nice to meet you all. This community was recommended to my colleagues and I, as we are working on an open source app to estimate carbon emissions for cloud usage (http://cloudcarbonfootprint.org - welcoming feedback and contributions, and happy to demo on a future call!). Excited to be here and hear about what everyone is working on!
</p>
<p><strong>sichen</strong> (Wed, 12 May 2021 00:07:11 GMT):<br/>
@derickso Thanks for joining and for making your cloud carbon emissions calculator open source.  We would definitely like a demo!  I will be looking through it as well to see how we could work with it.

Also, I recommend not having spaces in your chat handle, it makes it (seemingly) impossible to tag you in messages (might be just a UI bug in RocketChat, I'm not sure, but it doesn't highlight it the same way)

Hi everyone. My name is Evan - I discovered this community via the Blockchain DLT dev role posting for Open Source Strategies on angel.co. 

I am interested in learning more about the application of blockchain to the problem space of climate change in regard to how to design systems to avoid creating misaligned incentives (i.e. U.S. Organic certification, Dolphin-Safe).

Also curious to see how blockchain can be leveraged to track reforestation efforts over time. I have recently been writing an integration against the DigitalHumani Reforestation as a Service API, but I have concerns over the long term quality enforcement of underlying projects.

Hey everyone!
I'm Harsh Sharma, and I'm a pre-final year undergraduate student at IIIT, Gwalior. I've been working on an end-to-end project over the past three months using Hyperledger Fabric, Node.js, Express, Fabric Node SDKs with TypeScript, and Svelte for the client-side applications. I've learnt about a lot of new technologies in the process and I'm hoping to publish a paper about the same. I'm really excited about using Fabric and other blockchain technologies for decentralized applications, and when I saw this SIG I was really eager to be a part of the project. Thank you :).

@RobinKlemens I'm working on `https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/issues/263`. The task list specifies saving the passphrase used for encryption inside the middleware. Do you mean storing it inside of `res.locals`?

<p><strong>hs2361</strong> (Sun, 01 Aug 2021 12:40:12 GMT):<br/>
@RobinKlemens I had 3 suggestions for the utility emissions project:
1. Migrate all cryptographic operations from crypto-js to node-forge, since Forge supports 512 bit keys, SHA3 hashing, and has higher performance over crypto-js. Native crypto (Node) may also be used to avoid external dependencies altogether.
2. Enforce a style guideline with a Linter such as ESLint and add a config file.
3. Improve visualizations by integrating something like Grafana, or we can even consider developing a Fabric plugin for Grafana (for Explorer perhaps).

Do let me know if you have suggestions! These are just a few ideas I had in mind.

How climate action can drive our economic future’ also reveals how the country could gain US$11 trillion in economic value instead over the same period, by limiting rising global temperatures and realising its potential to ‘export decarbonisation’ to the world.

From 2030 to 2040, India and the world would need to complete large and coordinated shifts to reduce carbon emissions by tackling how energy is produced and consumed.

I am Aniket Dhar, currently an employee of NECI. I have 2+ years experience in working with DLT techs including various Hyperledger based frameworks like Fabric, Indy and Aries.
Right now, I wish to further my contribution footprint by getting involved in some good work that people are doing all over the world. CA2SIG, I felt is a clear choice in that regard, owing to how slowly policies shifts happen in this sphere.
Hoping to learn a lot while enjoying my experience with this amazing group of people.

Hi everyone,
I was working on issue #80 (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/issues/80). Thanks @pritam_01 for helping me with the step about editing the /etc/hosts file. The E2E tests are running normally (7 passing). However, as described in the issue, the automated tests are failing. I ran the tests using `npx mocha ./tests --timeout 10000` as described in the README. I'm attaching a screenshot here after running the tests. 3 of them are failing. Could someone please confirm whether these are the tests that are failing? I can look into them accordingly then.
</p>
<p><strong>pritam_01</strong> (Thu, 16 Sep 2021 03:20:21 GMT):<br/>
Please run end to end test, by npm run test
</p>
<p><strong>hs2361</strong> (Thu, 16 Sep 2021 04:06:17 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's what I did to run the E2E tests. They're passing. However the other tests inside of the test.js file are not passing.
</p>
<p><strong>pritam_01</strong> (Thu, 16 Sep 2021 04:23:27 GMT):<br/>
You can delete that, cuz e2e covers every case that test.js does.

Oh is that the case? Then the issue is no longer relevant.

Hello everyone,
I'm working on integrating a CI pipeline with GitHub actions to run the E2E tests on every pull request. However, I'm experiencing an unusual error during the step where the TypeScript app is run as part of running `./start.sh` in the `docker-compose-setup` directory:

`Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '../docker-compose-setup/organizations/peerOrganizations/auditor1.carbonAccounting.com/connection-auditor1.json'`

For your reference, here are the steps I'm running to set up the project:
`cd net-emissions-token-network/
npm ci
npx hardhat node --show-addresses &
cd ../utility-emissions-channel/docker-compose-setup/
./start.sh
`

I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 with Node v12.15.0 and npm v7.24.1 (I had to use a newer version of npm due to a bug in an earlier version of npm). I'm attaching the full server logs here as well for reference. If anyone has experienced this issue, I'd be really grateful if you could help me out.

I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 with Node v12.15.0 and npm v7.24.1 (I had to use a newer version of npm due to a bug in an earlier version of npm). I'm attaching the full server logs here as well for reference. If anyone has experienced this issue, I'd be really grateful if you could help me out.

Hello! I'm Aarjav Chauhan, a phd student at the University of Toronto in Computer Science. I'm researching open development for climate action and sustainable development and have found the Hyperledger to be an amazing project with potential for introducing blockchain technology to ensure transparency in sustainability within developing communities. I'm still learning about the Hyperledger ecosystem but I would really appreciate connecting further with people in the space!
