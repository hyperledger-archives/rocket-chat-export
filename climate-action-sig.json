These will be the things that allow us to create trustworthy representations of constructs like a GHG Emmission profile. This is what we can \"count\". Then we can construct accounting systems that are able to track these constructs. Quite analagous to money and accounting practices.\n\nDIDs will be a lower level construct that machines largely deal with.

{"msg":"Hello everyone,\nI'm working on integrating a CI pipeline with GitHub actions to run the E2E tests on every pull request. However, I'm experiencing an unusual error during the step where the TypeScript app is run as part of running `./start.sh` in the `docker-compose-setup` directory:\n\n`Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '../docker-compose-setup/organizations/peerOrganizations/auditor1.carbonAccounting.com/connection-auditor1.json'`\n\nFor your reference, here are the steps I'm running to set up the project:\n`cd net-emissions-token-network/\nnpm ci\nnpx hardhat node --show-addresses &\ncd ../utility-emissions-channel/docker-compose-setup/\n./start.sh\n`\n\nI'm using Ubuntu 20.04 with Node v12.15.0 and npm v7.24.1 (I had to use a newer version of npm due to a bug in an earlier version of npm). I'm attaching the full server logs here as well for reference. If anyone has experienced this issue, I'd be really grateful if you could help me out.","username":"hs2361","ts":"2021-09-25T20:08:00.934Z"}
