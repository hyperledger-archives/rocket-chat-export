@mboyd : Please send a request to helpdesk@hyperledger.org to create a new repo. Please document the decision (the pull request). Please include the existing GitHub team which will have a commit bit; alternatively, include a list of GitHub IDs that need to be added to a new team.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 10:58:02 GMT):<br/>
@mboyd we have RTD accounts. Please, once the repo is created, send a new request to helpdesk@hyperledger.org with as much specificity as you can provide. Due to name space issues, we may not be able to get the exact names you want. Setting up RTD is a well trod path. If you want or expect a google analytics code added, please also send a request to this channel to get a code and you can provide that code to helpdesk to add it to the RTD repo. we will also invite accounts to google analytics, so please provide at least one email address to invite.

@rjones thank you for the help! Im acrually waiting on my PRs to be merged into the actual repos before I begin the readthedocs side. 

Additionally, should I email the helpdesk if I want to add an additional repository to indy? As described in our docs HIPE, we'd like a place to store general documentation somewhere, and there unfortunately isn't a good main repository to do that yet. We'd like to create an indy-docs repo.

Hi experts, I have a question regarding the common use cases for hyperledger fabric. i have a customer that wants to investigate blockchain by implementing a blockchain based solution. the application at the current time consists only of one organization, and planning to involve other organizations (banks for example) at a later stage. i understand that the use of hyperledger fabric is commonly when there is multiple organizations that need to share through applications and to trust each other. However, does it make sense to implement a hyperledger fabric solution consisting of only one organization? wouldn't be more feasible to create a regular centralized data driven solutions? please let me know the benefits (supporting credibility of using blockchain in case of a single organization). Thank you for your feedback.

@rjones after I initialize the repos (later today), can we run your DCO check tool against them before we start merging in new things? (so maybe run the tool tomorrow morning?)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 15:17:42 GMT):<br/>
Just do a pr. The repos have a license and DCO check enabled.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 15:18:49 GMT):<br/>
You can graft the changes so you don't lose history. Also there is another tool that I found out about that might help you

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 21:55:38 GMT):<br/>
rebase isn't friendly to merges
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 21:56:04 GMT):<br/>
I think I already fixed the particular DCO issue you found before though with a rebase, as gross as it is to do that on master

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 21:56:26 GMT):<br/>
is the DCO thing a free plugin?

yup. that is the exact thing I was looking for the other day to show you
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 18:49:37 GMT):<br/>
Especially: ```If you need to re-sign a bunch of previous commits at once, find the earliest unsigned commit using `git log --show-signature` and use that the HASH of the commit before it in this command: `git rebase --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -n -s' -i HASH`. This will sign every commit from most recent to right before the HASH.```
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 19:57:23 GMT):<br/>
That's cool for an individual contributor but not when you have a single commit from someone in a multi-committer branch

Is it a reasonable responsibility of the Community Architects to manage, standardise and curate things like Docker Compose YAML files?  I'm trying to contribute an important Ethereum feature to Seth and I'm tantalisingly close but I'm hitting a bug in sawtooth-core that requires my to rebuild that from source along with Seth.  The network, volume and exports specifications are so very different that this is much more painful than it should be, and I feel there should be a better management of such things that an architect in a commercial business would be responsible for. 

Especially as we're about to launch officially into supporting pluggable consensus and so on this is going to become very important.  Is anyone thinking of taking control of this?

I see what you're asking but because of our fractured and piecemeal CI pipelines, we don't have central control over anything like that
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 20:20:51 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like @JonGeater should be on the CI/CD committee :-) 
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 21:58:47 GMT):<br/>
@silona we’ve actually already offered resources to that.  But the responses are somewhat inconsistent: I can be on the committee, but be relatively powerless, or I can fix sawtooth but leave the rest of the frameworks in anarchy.  There has to be a better way!
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 22:00:33 GMT):<br/>
By the way Sean @amundson my implementation of eth_call in Seth is complete and almost fully compliant.  The thing that’s hitting me is only a niche feature that requires Seth, Burrow and Sawtooth all to play nice together and agree on data types, protocol specs and so on.  Hence the request to architects.  Otherwise your assistance was very helpful.  Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 22:50:48 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater you've touched on a pain point that I know @bbehlendorf is aware of - and I know @Silona cares a lot about as well. Interop is a huge pain point.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 22:51:54 GMT):<br/>
also - I wouldn't say the committee is powerless. slow, yes. powerless, no. We do have to get consensus around changes that we want projects to make.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 23:23:37 GMT):<br/>
OK well that’s cool: we’ve offered to help in the CICD side already so there’s no harm starting there and seeing how it goes.  But even so, I think the design of docker volume sharing or k8s pods or which ports are exported is outside the remit of that team: there’s nothing wrong with what each project has done, it’s just that they’re different.  So the fix is more about imposing technical or procedural standards on the frameworks.  Classic Enterprise Architecture 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 03:10:46 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater A good start would be just making the folks who do the work on the project(s) appreciate the problem as you see it. If you are just seeing differences in the sawtooth-core vs sawtooth-seth yaml files, thats because they evolve over time and its legit hard to maintain the massive amount of docker stuff we have going on in the overall project.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 09:43:22 GMT):<br/>
Yeah absolutely - this chat probably makes the issue seem worse than it is in some way: both the docker files work great and are good in their own right.  They are just different and therefore hard to integrate.  This is why I asked the architects rather than filing an issue against either project :-)

I just see more active architectural curation of projects becoming more critical with the official drive for pluggable everything and therefore the need for more integration combinations.  Sounds like there's a vehicle to address this (thanks @rjones) so I'll look to help through that rather than put more burden on the framework maintainers right now.  Thanks again for all your help this week.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:23:54 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater The software architects are within the projects. 100% want to see this discussion in the sawtooth forum, even if the discussion is "you guys should do what X project is doing to make this easier". If it turns into a large multi-month type of change, Sawtooth has an RFC process we can use to get agreement on how we move forward on these things.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:24:47 GMT):<br/>
(If it's just updating the seth yaml file, it would just be a PR obviously.)

What's best practice for managing meeting agendas and minutes? (yes I know exciting topic)
Add the minutes to the original agenda doc and then relabel the agenda doc as minutes?
I see some groups that keep separate agenda and minutes docs and others that seem to unify them.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 18:51:17 GMT):<br/>
And I don't see a template for agendas that's quite like the TSC agenda template. And I couldn't in e.g. Grid use the TSC Agenda template.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 18:53:54 GMT):<br/>
I prefer for the agenda doc to morph into the minutes doc as I don't see much use for an agenda doc after the meeting.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:02:16 GMT):<br/>
it would be nice if the TSC agenda/minutes were together and the URL didn't change after the meeting
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:03:06 GMT):<br/>
I have no strong feeling about it.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:03:41 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I think you could make a copy of the TSC templates, though?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:03:43 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:06:00 GMT):<br/>
or are you able to do that?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:06:26 GMT):<br/>
it looks like it inherits from a meetings and agendas space. it would be good if all the projects/wgs were using the same template viz. antitrust etc.

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:11:16 GMT):<br/>
@Dan you should now have a global template, called "Meeting Agenda". It's still very TSC-specific but try it out?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:12:35 GMT):<br/>
you should be able to create an instance in your personal workspace. For workgroups, I think each section (reports to TSC, upcoming reports) are OK but I'm willing to wordsmith
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:25:18 GMT):<br/>
Cool. I think this is great. I deleted the reports fields before clicking publish, but actually it might be good to leave those on. That can serve as a reminder for hitting those deadlines. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:16:15 GMT):<br/>
ok. Do you want a specific minutes one, or no? the TSC minutes has a list of TSC members, which would need to be different for every other meeting, so I didn't see the value.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:17:29 GMT):<br/>
@amundson I rolled out "read" on all repos in github, if you're a member of the org (I think). Have things changed? I didn't know there was a difference between read permission and what the public sees
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:27:46 GMT):<br/>
as in, I didn't realize read was a grant that had to be made to any repo.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:36:53 GMT):<br/>
@rjones basically, "read" controls the list of who you can add as reviewers on the repo. so if you don't have read permissions, then you can't be added as a reviewer at all. ("read" reviewers can add grey checkmarks and don't count toward merging rules.) super annoying obviously. looks like adding the HL contrib group w/read works fine. this will save a lot of work and IMO makes it easier for folks to float between projects/repos. I could now add burrow folks to help review seth stuff for example. Wonderful.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:39:23 GMT):<br/>
the only downside is that it make it harder to add folks when you have to search for them (though this is already hard because people don't have their names entered in their github accounts)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:43:46 GMT):<br/>
ah I did not know that. Thanks. The identity problem is... a problem. If only there were a way to have a unified ID
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:45:57 GMT):<br/>
Stuff like this helps, of course, but it's perishable. https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:46:33 GMT):<br/>
we never search for the maintainers. we have them assigned as reviewers using CODEOWNERS
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:46:45 GMT):<br/>
it's like the best thing we implemented recently
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:47:04 GMT):<br/>
what I meant was, in a more general way, there are little mappings all over the place of who to where.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:47:48 GMT):<br/>
right. this is more annoying on RocketChat
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:48:02 GMT):<br/>
I feel that there should be a rule that you can't be on rocketchat without filling in your name :)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:48:31 GMT):<br/>
(ironically, I don't have mine filled in)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:48:42 GMT):<br/>
Something like this: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/MAINTAINERS.rst (which keeps history)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:49:14 GMT):<br/>
we will do exactly that when we retire maintainers. we haven't yet.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 20:29:58 GMT):<br/>
"retire" sounds like a mob euphemism. 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 20:31:01 GMT):<br/>
@rjones thanks I'm good without a minutes template. I'd rather just enter minutes into an agenda. I suppose renaming the file from agenda to minutes might cause the link problem that @amundson mentioned.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 20:40:53 GMT):<br/>

Once it looks ready I'll send a note requesting input and directing them to that wiki page.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:46:53 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I think at least one of the two contributors we had added to the hyperledger org isn't in the overall HL contrib read group (because I can select him as a reviewer). Is there a way to reconcile those instead of us making separate requests? (I assume you can't add them to the group prior to them accepting?)

thanks. I like this global group idea a lot, but in this instance it slowed stuff down (I've had it on my todo to follow up on it for like a week - it takes a surprising amount of time to double-check things before mentioning them). maybe something the automation will help with.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:56:21 GMT):<br/>
I never directly answered your question about testing: prow will emit a log of what it would have done, and I can also issue a RO token as insurance. I think prow is a longer-term discussion.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:57:03 GMT):<br/>
then in the sort term can it be used ot verify things like DCO being on w/branch permissions?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:57:58 GMT):<br/>
don't know. we have other problems there.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:58:35 GMT):<br/>
the short version - GitHub says they use ruby regex of a certain form, they actually do not.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:58:46 GMT):<br/>
`*` will not match all branches.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:02:09 GMT):<br/>
of course adeebahmed and MattP007 don't have 2FA
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:03:18 GMT):<br/>
I will follow up with them about that
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:04:52 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean * won't match all branches?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:05:42 GMT):<br/>
use "**"
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:05:47 GMT):<br/>
exactly what I said. Try it on a personal repo. create a branch called `feature/foo` or `feature_bar`
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:06:13 GMT):<br/>
look here - https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/settings/branch_protection_rules/2791460
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:07:32 GMT):<br/>
create a branch `feature/foo`
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:07:50 GMT):<br/>
this is a problem in Iroha. `**` is not greedy enough
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:07:59 GMT):<br/>
we don't use "/", that breaks other things
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:08:37 GMT):<br/>
that isn't a requirement we're enforcing. What I'm saying is, the documented GitHub regex matching is broken.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:08:59 GMT):<br/>
can you do feature/** though?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:09:05 GMT):<br/>
I pointed this out to a guy that runs a service I want to use, he tested it, and it was kind of an oh shit moment
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:09:33 GMT):<br/>
for Iroha, I have `*` and `*/*` to match the branches they use.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:10:21 GMT):<br/>
good enough in practice then right?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:10:22 GMT):<br/>
I'm willing to be proven wrong. The least interesting part of my day is when I need to think about `DCO` anything
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:10:57 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure why we have ** and not just *
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:11:00 GMT):<br/>
grr
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:11:06 GMT):<br/>
"**" and not "*"
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:11:08 GMT):<br/>
grr
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:11:44 GMT):<br/>
`*` and not `**`
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:11:50 GMT):<br/>
well, the other way around
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:11:53 GMT):<br/>
I just looked at one project, I see they have protection on 2 branches and not on... 13 others.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:12:51 GMT):<br/>
when folks accidentially create a branch (because they push to the wrong remote), then we have to disable this temporarily to delete that branch. it's great fun.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:16:29 GMT):<br/>
so while everyone is doing the right thing and keeping that window to like 10s, it would be nice to have something run that double-checks that it got put back correctly like once a night. (and ideally, just apply it if it's not).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:17:10 GMT):<br/>
actually, I think we might just click the allow-admin button so it's not wide open, for the things that works for, so maybe that's really the thing that needs checking. or both.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:18:28 GMT):<br/>
it's hard to manually review all the repos we have. it's easy to do the most important ones, but it would take a whole day to work through all of them.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:24:09 GMT):<br/>
Right. I wish I could export/copy an org
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:24:30 GMT):<br/>
how many orgs are you managing?

Github Teams question: I'm curious why some folks can't see the team members lists.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:09:47 GMT):<br/>
they need to be logged in to github and they need to be a member of the org.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:10:08 GMT):<br/>
who specifically can't see them?

she is just getting started.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:13:52 GMT):<br/>
Not a member of the org.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:13:55 GMT):<br/>
being able to see the list of maintainers is really helpful.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:14:16 GMT):<br/>
Is there a process for adding members?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:14:30 GMT):<br/>
sure, do you want them invited?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:14:48 GMT):<br/>
Is that something I can do?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:15:13 GMT):<br/>
no, sadly, it is not. I extended an invite.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:15:48 GMT):<br/>

@TelegramSam the requirement that everyone in the org has two factor auth enabled will be enforced in a little over a week, probably, and people without it enabled will be removed from the org

Confluence will experience a short outage on Friday at 9am eastern NYC time zone as we do a hard rebuild of Confluence's indexes to fix a bug.

We apologize for the outage.   We understand that the timing is not ideal but we prefer to do this when full staff is available.  We expect the outage to only be about 15 minutes total.  We will keep everyone posted on chat.hyperledger.org #wiki and #infra-support

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 07:51:58 GMT):<br/>
done!
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 18:27:48 GMT):<br/>
@rjones any particular reason to do the repo transfer and not just push the master branch out there?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 18:38:53 GMT):<br/>
your call. Repo transfer keeps stars, followers, and the like, as well as provides the magic redirect github does
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 18:46:08 GMT):<br/>
@amundson if you wanted to do a git filter branch or whatever into a new repo and use that as well.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 18:47:14 GMT):<br/>
can you run your dco tool against the master branch as it is currently as a double-check?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 18:48:04 GMT):<br/>
we enabled dcobot recently but still worth the check IMO
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 18:49:02 GMT):<br/>
not today. I only have my chromebook. You can run it yourself using the directions from the gist I made. https://gist.github.com/ryjones/07ac650dcc5e83c91e8308ec98bacda4
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 14:15:46 GMT):<br/>
@rjones my preference is just to push the master branch. I don't see the hyperledger/transact repo though.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 14:46:11 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 18:15:41 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 18:52:58 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 18:54:01 GMT):<br/>
the repo transfer idea was new to me, and I'm not sure if there are side-effects since we've never done it before
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 18:54:06 GMT):<br/>
If you would like it immediately, please do the repo transfer.  
</p>

@silona We are trying to hit a press intercept tomorrow that then unlocks another press event the next day. I know its bad timing with the bootcamp, but if there's a way to take time out to create the repos that would be super cool.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 13:34:16 GMT):<br/>
@Dan they are created. @amundson 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 13:44:13 GMT):<br/>
Unconferences are fun but it also means that everyone wants to talk to the team pretty much all of the time.  Super educational but also a lot of work.  We are also trying to make sure to capture everything that is brought to us.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:35:44 GMT):<br/>
@amundson I forgot to add you as a maintainer to the parent group. You are now and should be able to create teams on your own
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:37:11 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I created an "Transact Admins" group to match the naming we have in the other repos. I'm going to rename the -commiters groups to "Transact X Maintainers" to also match the other repos if that's ok. I'm going through the options and making everything match the sawtooth-core repo.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:37:30 GMT):<br/>
up to you
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:37:56 GMT):<br/>
as long as team names are transparent, I don't care

I might need help in a bit to get the DCO setup unless I'm able to enable it myself. I think I need to push the branches first. though as the 'Branches' tab doesn't show up yet in the admin UI.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:40:07 GMT):<br/>
I think the Federal Bureau of Alcohol and Cookies was having some repo problems.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:40:08 GMT):<br/>
you have a blank repo.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:40:42 GMT):<br/>
so there is no master, no nothing. Just add it as a remote and do a git push ... master and you'll create the master branch
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:41:47 GMT):<br/>
yep, I'll do that in a little bit - no worries
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:54:42 GMT):<br/>
Just a quick double-check before I move anything - I assume no output here means nothing was found: ```amundson@geon % lftools dco check transact/
Checking commits in branch origin/amundson-readme for commits missing DCO...
Checking commits in branch origin/dco-fixes for commits missing DCO...
Checking commits in branch origin/master for commits missing DCO...```
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:54:58 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 16:11:25 GMT):<br/>
@rjones can you enable DCO here please - https://github.com/hyperledger/transact/settings/branch_protection_rules/5692012
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 16:14:39 GMT):<br/>
done
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 16:15:19 GMT):<br/>
you can do it by forking the repo, directly adding a file, creating a pull request, and closing that PR and enabling DCO
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 16:59:11 GMT):<br/>
@rjones dco is enabled on the transact-rfcs repo - https://github.com/hyperledger/transact-rfcs/settings/branch_protection_rules/5692222
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 17:05:11 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 26 Jun 2019 15:28:22 GMT):<br/>
yup .. it is when you paste that URL into a thing like imessages .. that grabs the image form some configured resource

Hello, Trusted Compute Framework (TCF) was recently approved as HL labs at https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/trusted-compute-framework.
I can see "Settings" in the GITHUB UI, but when I go there I cannot manage contributors (the UI just have three check boxes). 
Also it seems that anybody in HL Labs currently can approve PRs for TCF. Can you check that maintainer's list is set up correctly or let me know how I should proceed WRT the project contributors management?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 06:59:19 GMT):<br/>

@shemnon please send email to community-architects@ and let us know what you want. Over time, most projects have been migrating away from the Hyperledger Zoom accounts but if you want to use one we'll make it happen

@esplinr @donqui I don't know if there is a discount - please send email to community-architects@hyperledger.org and ask? I've never heard of a discount on EdX

Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 21:46:55 GMT):<br/>
The classes themselves are free.  it is only the certs that cost money and that is controlled pricing wise by EdX.  SO no we don't have discounts because you can take the class for free
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 21:48:47 GMT):<br/>
the cert includes these two classes https://www.edx.org/course/understanding-blockchain-and-its-implications

around the onramp, or funnel, or whatever you want to call it - we have a lot of projects, and they update frequently, so stuff like our EdX courses become outdated quickly. For instance
</p>
<p><strong>benstew</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:20:06 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the intro @rjones. @dhuseby - great to virtually meet you! I was in DC speaking at a conference and popped into a local hyperledger meeting where I met Brian and he mentioned you. Glad to connect.

I’m a security researcher that has been in the blockchain space for a few years. I’ve recently spoke at Defcon, Trufflecon, and contributed to some of the leading static/dynamic analysis tools primarily in the Ethereum space. I've recently seen an uptick with organizations reaching out for security audits that have some blockchain connected infrastructure.
</p>
<p><strong>benstew</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:20:59 GMT):<br/>
I've found it difficult to ramp up on hyperledger and I'm curious what security focused initiatives/objectives exist to better assess what I can do to help! More background about me: https://www.securityinnovation.com/about/centers-of-excellence/blockchain-center-of-excellence/

Hi @rjones it's more a housekeeping questions than a technical one - is there a description or page where it explains the responsibilities that a company acquires by becoming a sponsor for a new Hyperledger project?

Hi, I got a couple notices this morning that the Fabric Chaincode EVM meeting was canceled, but looking at the calendar, there seem to now be 4 instances of the meeting when I look at the next session and they aren't all exactly the same
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 19:10:57 GMT):<br/>
Not sure how to link it, but the next session should be November 20th
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 19:13:14 GMT):<br/>
@swetha someone, we don't know who, deleted a little over 130 meetings on Saturday. I un-deleted everything. This means there are now dupes, since some of them apparently should have been deleted or were expired
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 19:14:13 GMT):<br/>
@rjones oh no, that sounds horrible
</p>

Oh that would be nice
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 21 Oct 2019 19:23:09 GMT):<br/>
if you know a way to make it happen please let me know. I was looking this weekend and I found a lot of git->ical or yaml->ical type things, but I wasn't sure any of them really worked
</p>

@Silona does that mean that that interested parties need to wait for the project to be finished, or is there a way to apply while the project is being worked on?
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 20:40:28 GMT):<br/>
we are dramatically changing it to be metrics based.  So it won't really be applied for anymore.

This is the best way - let me go look for it. 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 18:57:06 GMT):<br/>
oh yea - we are chatting about if we can support this kind of usage budget wise.  
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 18:57:38 GMT):<br/>
We only have 3 Zoom channels and if others begin using it for daily sprints that would hit us rather hard.
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 18:58:03 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks, understood
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 18:58:44 GMT):<br/>
i should have clarified intent is to only use for Sprint Planning & demos (basically 1 session per week)
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 18:58:50 GMT):<br/>
We lean on LF for all legal definitions.  So yes the LF one is the best.  The DCO policy is use the tool and don't turn it off or... we will eventually figure it out and ask for a squash merge or having everyone sign off on it.
</p>
<p><strong>JHamilton</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 18:59:29 GMT):<br/>
and we can use an Accenture bridge; just checking in on norms
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 18:59:31 GMT):<br/>
We pondered taking away admin access for a time because too many were turning off the DCObot...

</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 19:00:44 GMT):<br/>
See I know we would like to support it and we often support projects doing two kinds of calls.  This sounds like a "contributor" call vs a general meeting one
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 19:00:47 GMT):<br/>

@Silona : how do we determine the Zoom channel that is open given the "new calendar" system that Dave is proposing without signing up for all the mailing lists.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:13:47 GMT):<br/>
Checking the global calendar that @dhuseby has created
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:14:04 GMT):<br/>
Really wish there was a way for all meetings across all lists to wrap up in the main mailing list since everyone has to subscribe to that.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:14:17 GMT):<br/>

@rjones We are ready to transfer two repos to HL: https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/aries-toolbox and https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/aries-acapy-plugin-toolbox

How do we get the process started?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 14:17:06 GMT):<br/>
@rjones a few other requests:

1. Rename aries-framework-javascript to aries-sdk-javascript (was renamed by mistake)
2. Add the following maintainers to the newly named aries-sdk-javascript repo:
https://github.com/jadhavajay
https://github.com/matt-raffel-kiva
https://github.com/jakubkoci
https://github.com/smithbk
3. create aries-framework-javascript with the same maintainers?

Thanks!

The new Hyperledger Labs “Blockchain Integration Framework” will be featured in Weds Dec 4th Architecture Working Group.  It’s a great opportunity for us to start to engage this lab with a broader community and we would like to highlight contributor working sessions during the meeting.  Can you help us in setting these contributor working sessions up?

We have started collaborating between Fujitsu & Accenture, which means we already cross 3 geo “swathes” (Americas, Europe, Asia).  So the recurrence is tricky.  I’m imagining something like the below, but will acquiesce to your judgement call.  I listed times Central US to try and simplify but please let me know if a different format more helpful (e.g. GMT crosses into Tuesdays on Series 1)
•	Subject: [Hyperledger Labs] Blockchain Integration Framework Series 1 (Americas + Asia)
o	Recurs once every 3 weeks e.g. Mon Dec 9th , Mon Dec 30th
o	10 PM CT 
•	Subject: [Hyperledger Labs] Blockchain Integration Framework Series 2 (Asia + Europe)
o	Recurs once every 3 weeks @ Series 1+ 1 wk e.g. Mon Dec 16thth , Mon Jan 6th 
o	2 AM CT 
•	Subject: [Hyperledger Labs] Blockchain Integration Framework Series 3 (Europe + Americas)
o	Recurs once every 3 weeks @ Series 1 + 2 wk e.g. Mon Dec 23rd, Mon Jan 13th 
o	10:30 AM CT 
•	Same description and bridge (if possible? Looks like Zoom 3 is open) for all 3
o	Bridge: https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community.3
o	Description: Review & organization of roadmap and project issues https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/blockchain-integration-framework https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/issues

What would DCI-WG members need to do to make use of the LF's survey Monkey account (for the DCI survey)?
We'll need to load in questions and figure out the right format to match what survey monkey provides. That will no doubt involve some copy editing at the very least. Then we'll need to actually operate the survey. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 21:14:54 GMT):<br/>
Create it first as a google document.  I do not have a good way to share survey monkey to non employees.  You could also use google forms. 
</p>

Hello and merry Christmas 🎄. I need `hyperledger-labs` enable "performance" tier on circle-ci. I noted that `hyperledger` already has it enabled (https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L15). Is it possible to turn this plan for labs too? 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 10:20:12 GMT):<br/>
@glotov I will need to check - I don't know if spending money on CI is something we can support. Would it be possible for you to use Azure? Fabric is using it quite a bit, and it's free.
</p>
<p><strong>glotov</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 10:27:35 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean it is free? That would be interesting. I just looked at Fabric, they used some private instance of jenkins.hyperledger.org.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:04:35 GMT):<br/>
I think you're thinking of Sawtooth or Iroha. All of the Fabric CI right now is on AZP: https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:05:30 GMT):<br/>
what is your GitHub userid?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:10:13 GMT):<br/>
Looks like denis-yu-glotov
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:12:33 GMT):<br/>
take a look here for a non-fabric example: https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/tree/master/ci
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:12:59 GMT):<br/>
it's fairly straightforward and free to play with. You can develop the AZP yaml in your own account and let me know when you want to move ov er
</p>
<p><strong>glotov</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:13:19 GMT):<br/>
yes, thank you, will look
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:14:02 GMT):<br/>
sure thing.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:15:57 GMT):<br/>
Looking at https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml , a lot of the setup can come from builtin reps.
</p>

Looking at https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml , a lot of the setup can come from builtin deps.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:16:31 GMT):<br/>
like this for instance: https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/6b2393dec9e2aeca671cc6c42685961a94647615/ci/install_deps.yml#L4
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:16:42 GMT):<br/>
AZP has a lot of stuff that you get "for free"

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:17:49 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:17:53 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>glotov</strong> (Mon, 30 Dec 2019 11:06:59 GMT):<br/>
Hi! Do you know how to specify vm resources (CPU cores, memory) in AZM? I spent more then an hour googling and reading docs but could not find this yet
</p>
<p><strong>glotov</strong> (Mon, 30 Dec 2019 11:08:52 GMT):<br/>
our code needs 4+ cpu cores to run tests, but Azure pipelines does not seep to have a way to specify this. By default, `vmImage: ubuntu-latest` is a 2 core machine which is not enough for us :(
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 30 Dec 2019 14:52:07 GMT):<br/>
I filed a help desk ticket, we'll see if it's possible.
</p>
<p><strong>glotov</strong> (Mon, 30 Dec 2019 17:59:12 GMT):<br/>
I filed a question a had a reply: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59530127/how-can-i-specify-vm-properties-cpu-memory-for-azure-pipelines. Looks that they have no option to provide a stronger vm.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 21:10:41 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 21:11:16 GMT):<br/>
Sure thing. I still need to go and add... 12*8 calendar events.

</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 15:51:30 GMT):<br/>
One thing that might make this easier is picking the same week of every quarter to have the update due so that you can create a "repeating event". Add once. Don't worry about it ever again until you need to remove it.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 15:51:53 GMT):<br/>
Or maybe add twice since it should be on both TSC calendar and project- or WG-specific calendar
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 17:34:28 GMT):<br/>
This time, I did. However, the repeats you can do in groups.io are daily, weekly, monthly, yearly. It isn't as rich as gcal for that. So I still had to create four events per WG/Project.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 17:38:22 GMT):<br/>
I opted not to add them to the TSC calendar, since the TSC members now get notifications for free from Confluence

anyone have ballpark numbers on contributors and member companies? I just want to give someone unfamiliar with HL the feel of the size of the community & membership.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 17:08:52 GMT):<br/>
lfanalytics.io has some but not member companies - yet.  I am having that discussion w LFIT again today...

I don't think you're gated on LF staff in this request at all. You can update the readme for BESU, and you can update besu.hyperledger.org without our intervention, so I think you can go ahead

Hi @rjones - The issue I'm seeing is that the maintainers are not able to assign reviews to non-maintainers in https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/. 
They were able to assign the reviewers a month ago. Any changes in the repo permission or my access recently ? 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 17:59:47 GMT):<br/>
My guess is membership in the org no longer grants read access to everything. I added read access to all Aries repos to the Aries contributors group, see if that helps?
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 21:03:05 GMT):<br/>
It worked. that could be the issue. Thanks @rjones .
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 21:10:53 GMT):<br/>
sure thing. I think this is a change in how GitHub views permissions

hello @rjones, got your contact from Tracy.. do you manage the hyperledgerlabs org on dockerhub? I am the maintainer of labs/blockchain-automation-framework and wanted to check if I can add the relevant repos there.

</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 16:53:17 GMT):<br/>
Hi @rjones - Looks like now non-maintainers are not able to add reviewers at all (not even add maintainers for the reviewers). Seeing this issue from past couple of days.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 17:02:21 GMT):<br/>
OK. I know GitHub in general is having problems
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 19:07:51 GMT):<br/>
yeah, Github been flaky for a week now. But this looks to be more of a permission issue than github issue (works fine in other orgs/repos). 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:16:55 GMT):<br/>
I just added the overall group to read access - does that work now?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:17:06 GMT):<br/>
the default access is supposed to allow that
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:24:08 GMT):<br/>
no, same issue as before. (or may be github takes a while to refresh the permission)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:24:47 GMT):<br/>
who is the person you can't add
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:25:05 GMT):<br/>
i cant add anyone. it's disabled.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:26:03 GMT):<br/>
try now
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:27:00 GMT):<br/>
its enabled now.
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:27:12 GMT):<br/>
i can search and add reviewers.
</p>
<p><strong>rolsonquadras</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:28:41 GMT):<br/>

Hi, this is one of 3 PRs by a new contributor struggling with DCO. Looks like the individual has added a sign-off but possibly manually through the git UI? Not sure just a guess.. possibly not using the github correlated email. Any ideas how to ease this? we've already had 3 or 4 of us from the sawtooth community trying to coach the new contributor:
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/2298
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 15:16:07 GMT):<br/>
Dan, I think you have permission to force push to the source repo, if I’m reading right.

I can't tell if he's stuck because of a formatting issue or what. we have previously shared that DCO error link in his first attempt at the PR. Hmmm.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 15:32:31 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 15:33:53 GMT):<br/>
you also had that power to fix them, but I wanted to try it out.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 15:34:34 GMT):<br/>
that is available if the person submitting the PR has the "let maintainers edit the PR" option checked, which I think is a default
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 15:34:57 GMT):<br/>

yes

I'm seeing a weird issue with the Community Calendar. I updated the Zoom link used by the Indy Contributors meeting. The event appears correct in Groups.io, but the event disappeared completely from the Hyperledger Community Calendar.

Hey there #community-architects. I'm a new user and am encountering a bug using hyperledger chat's `My Account` > `Profile`. The error I'm getting is: `TypeError: cannot read property 'verified' of undefined`. I get this just by clicking on profile, and nothing is displayed. Looks like it could possibly be a bug in hyperledger chat itself, or my authentication state, but I'm not sure. Thanks if you can tell me who I might be able to follow up with about diagnosing this more.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 01:06:50 GMT):<br/>
@adamsc64 thanks for the heads up. This looks like an issue in our chat system - I can't even edit your profile (as an admin)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 01:11:02 GMT):<br/>
when I click "edit" on your account, the error I get is "duplicate user"
</p>
<p><strong>adamsc64</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 19:44:02 GMT):<br/>
Huh strange. Thanks @rjones. Let me know if you need me to follow up about this or send you more information.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 20:30:43 GMT):<br/>
@adamsc64 it's a well known issue in rocket.chat. I filed a ticket with IT to manually fix your account
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:22:35 GMT):<br/>
@rjones how can I do things such as - setting channel updates on RocketChat channel, notifying the members of #community-india channel? We want to accelerate that space by having more engagement. But not having an option to notify all is hindering.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:23:15 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai can you use @here?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:23:22 GMT):<br/>
maybe we disabled it
</p>
<p><strong>adamsc64</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:23:51 GMT):<br/>
I just got notified when you tagged that @arsulegai
</p>
<p><strong>adamsc64</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:24:12 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:24:56 GMT):<br/>
No @dhuseby , that action is disabled.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:25:23 GMT):<br/>
can you pin messages?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:25:28 GMT):<br/>
that's another way
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:25:50 GMT):<br/>
pin announcement messages so they are always at the top
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:27:05 GMT):<br/>
I think I am not in the list of people who can pin new messages. I do see an option to see pinned messages though (there's none apparently).
</p>
<p><strong>adamsc64</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:27:44 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @rjones. I'll follow up about it myself if you send me the ticket link.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 17:33:34 GMT):<br/>
which channel
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 17:34:26 GMT):<br/>
#community-india channel
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 17:35:04 GMT):<br/>
OK, I set you as leader and moderator, does it help?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 17:35:54 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I see pin option now
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 17:45:35 GMT):<br/>
There is another issue around notifications that won't get fixed any time soon - we only get 10k notifications for free, and we use like a quarter million a month.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 17:47:27 GMT):<br/>
Is that for channel level notification?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 17:47:41 GMT):<br/>
on device notifications and the like.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 17:47:48 GMT):<br/>
so if you're running the app on your phone.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 17:49:42 GMT):<br/>
Ah! That's a tricky situation 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Dec 2020 21:02:43 GMT):<br/>
@adamsc64 Your account has been fixed as a part of last night's upgrade - you should be able to edit yourself now.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 01:40:22 GMT):<br/>
Any interest in customizing this RepoLinter github action and adding it to the HL projects?  https://github.com/philips-labs/github-action-repolinter
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 01:40:39 GMT):<br/>
It will need some updates to support the network url flag for the repo file.

<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 01:43:02 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 02:26:15 GMT):<br/>
seems reasonable

> adamsc64 Your account has been fixed as a part of last night's upgrade - you should be able to edit yourself now.
@rjones: thanks for this. But unfortunately I still have the same stacktrace as before. I just did this just now. This is reproducible simply by clicking "My Account." Here's a screenshot below:

Could we also provide similar introduction on `https://github.com/topics/hyperledger`??
</p>

@davidkhala I'm OK with it.

Besu has a Jira board that we think exists to cater for security issues - is this a Hyperledger requirement or is there a way to do this with other tools (eg we now use ZenDesk for everything else). @rjones are you able to shed any light on this?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 22:06:55 GMT):<br/>
@macfarla it is dormant, and GitHub is how we're supporting security issues now (when the JIRA requirement existed, GitHub didn't support private disclosure)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 22:07:22 GMT):<br/>
There was supposed to be a migration from an internal JIRA to the Hyperledger JIRA, but that never happened.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 22:19:28 GMT):<br/>
@macfarla when I [look here](https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/BESU/issues/BESU-203?filter=allissues) I see everything was closed and migrated to GitHub issues in March 2020
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 22:26:30 GMT):<br/>
I just made it read-only.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Tue, 12 Jan 2021 06:51:45 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Great Ry, do you have some material to upload for it? Or we call for contribution?
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:10:30 GMT):<br/>
thanks @rjones - can you advise the equivalent in GitHub to creating a "security issue" in Jira? Are we using GitHub's Security Advisories for this? Wanting to update our wiki https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Security
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:14:48 GMT):<br/>
[Looking here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory), the reporter would need to ask an admin of the repo to create the issue
</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:15:03 GMT):<br/>
Also the main Defect Response page still mentions Jira - is that up to date? https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/SEC/Defect+Response
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:15:43 GMT):<br/>
for the most part, yes. @dhuseby would need to discuss any changes
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:16:34 GMT):<br/>
It was written before GitHub issues were a thing, so it needs some word smithing around when to use JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:17:06 GMT):<br/>
what'
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:17:06 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>macfarla</strong> (Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:19:52 GMT):<br/>

@shemnon I have the bot connecting now - a new environment variable was added as a requirement. However, it is crashing on input. I suspect the API has changed and the rocket chat node module isn't up-to-speed
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 13:02:32 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon looks like the bot started working, so I'll stop digging. The fix was twofold: you have to explicitly connect over SSL now, and there is a fix in a forked repo for the channel returning an array instead of a single object.

Dear Sir,

I am from MeitY NIC we are trying to learn Hyperledger Fabic and  start using it for supply chain management and other activities.

PL guide us how to proceed. We have installed the Hyper ledeger Fabric and getting errors like

cannot run peer because error when setting up MSP of type bccsp from directory /home/fabric-samples/test-network/organizations/peerOrganizations/Org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp:keyMaterial not found in SigningIdentityInfo


during

source ./lifecycle_setup_org1.sh

This setup all required environment variables.

Step 3: Now run below command to install your chaincode.

peer lifecycle chaincode install hometransfer.tar.gz --peerAddresses peer0.org1.example.com:7051


Can you suggest some solutions.

Ganesh

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:10:12 GMT):<br/>
I developed it to get all the PRs from last 7 days, get noteworthy from them and add to the newsletter
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:10:24 GMT):<br/>
There is no condition to filter just open PRs
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:11:06 GMT):<br/>
ah, sorry, I was thinking it would only show the "good first issue" types, because I was confused.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:11:13 GMT):<br/>
I understand now, sorry for the confusion.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:11:21 GMT):<br/>
However for the issues section, it will list open issues only
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:11:49 GMT):<br/>
It has 3 sections - PRs, issues, releases
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:12:05 GMT):<br/>
yes, I was confused, sorry
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:12:20 GMT):<br/>
No problems, thanks :)
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:12:36 GMT):<br/>
We should talk about this and tell everyone to start using it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:12:56 GMT):<br/>
feel free to put it on the TSC agenda
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:14:30 GMT):<br/>
I guess the next step is to ask maintainers to put tags on noteworthy PRs
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:26:50 GMT):<br/>
Done
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:28:36 GMT):<br/>
For tagging the PRs, I would defer not to do it at project level. It may see unforseen consequences. Contributors should not be discouraged by the word noteworthy.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:29:52 GMT):<br/>
Compiling a list in the news letter is still a better option. We could however ask projects to highlight if a PR makes bigger impact to project. Like a reward for impactful contribution
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:08:59 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai not that I can see. It's public, it has issues. It is still using `master` which shouldn't matter
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:09:31 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai what is the text of the error and maybe 4 lines before?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:12:32 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:12:34 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:13:21 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:16:31 GMT):<br/>
ah - not all repos will have releases!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:17:00 GMT):<br/>
there is a draft release, but it has never been published
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:17:36 GMT):<br/>
so that is correct. There _is_ a release (version 1.0.0) that is in **DRAFT** state.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:18:18 GMT):<br/>
I deleted the draft release, because it had no information, and was over two years old

Repeating this from #tsc as this is a better channel for this. 

Would it be possible have github changes (PR opened, PR merged, issue created etc) to become notifications in rocketchat channels? It's great to have activity on github more publicised. I imagine there should be a bot which gets notifications from github and then posts them on particular channels. (e.g. changes to https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang goes to #solang ).
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 06 Jul 2021 14:51:38 GMT):<br/>
(also from #tsc): @seanyoung I would love to do that - rocket.chat is going away next quarter, so I would caution against building on it

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 06 Jul 2021 22:50:59 GMT):<br/>
This seems like a good idea, but I'd be hesitant about using it on our main rocketchat (or whatever chat we have in the future) channels.  Some projects have a lot of traffic, and it might make it more difficult and confusing for new people (for whom we recommend rocketchat as a place to start looking and asking questions).
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 07 Jul 2021 01:32:25 GMT):<br/>
This might be a per-project decision. This might work for some project/channels but not for others.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 07 Jul 2021 02:57:29 GMT):<br/>

Hi all. Not sure if this is the right channel for this, so feel free to redirect my question if it's not.

When maintainers merge PRs into `main` on Hyperledger repos does anyone ever squash merge? If so, how does that work with DCO requirements, because the individual commits in the PR are no longer in the git history?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 14:30:34 GMT):<br/>
Right now the DCO checker requires all commits in the PR chain to have DCO, so squash merging a chain with full DCO markings can also be marked as DCO per clause (c) of the DCO.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 14:31:21 GMT):<br/>
so if you have the DCO checker enabled in your Repo (I believe that is the default for Hyperledger provided repos) you will be blocked from merging non-compliant chains./
</p>

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 14:32:15 GMT):<br/>
Besu does squash merges.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 14:32:30 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense. Thanks. Related to this, I've also seen questions come up about whether merge commits need sign-off on the merge itself if every commit in the branch (PR) being merged has proper sign-off?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 14:33:13 GMT):<br/>
If it's a non-interactive merge the auto-merge provided and attested to by github looks to be sufficient.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 14:33:29 GMT):<br/>
Perfect. Thanks for clarifying!
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 14:34:11 GMT):<br/>
(Not a Laywer, I only can speak to what we've seen and practice in the Besu repos).
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 15:03:21 GMT):<br/>
FF merge commits don't need a DCO. If you have to de-conflict a merge, you need to sign it. I usually do something like `--no-ff -s` or the like

One simple solution might be creating a new github account with organizational email id. But is there any other option that avoids creation of a new github account?

</p>
<p><strong>avradip</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 17:07:06 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I guess then the easiest option might be to go with multiple github id solution. Do you suggest creating the new github id with organizational email id, or can we use any other email id?
</p>

@rjones we don't have a commit yet. We are trying to figure how we should make the commit, so that the commit gets attributed to our organization in the LFX dashboard. The committer is an individual who is already active in the community but working as an independent contractor for our organization at present.

</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 12 Aug 2021 12:26:45 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Aug 2021 13:50:17 GMT):<br/>
@sownak right - it is better to build using GHA and publish to the github docker repo than dockerhub
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 12 Aug 2021 13:55:23 GMT):<br/>
If it's helpful, here's a GitHub Action used by FireFly that pushes to GitHub Container Repository on merges to `main`: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker.yml
There are a couple of one-time manual setup steps that you have to go through initially, but these builds have been very reliable (and much faster than Docker Hub!)
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 15:23:00 GMT):<br/>
@nguyer thanks, github container repository looks very nice. I think I'll start using it too
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 15:47:08 GMT):<br/>
anything that makes it easier for people to publish containers - not asking me for permissions in DockerHub counts as easier :)
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 15:47:34 GMT):<br/>
As a followup on that topic, I've been updating FireFly's GitHub actions in the past few days and we now have separate jobs for "release" (or pre-release) builds, vs just building the latest commit in `main`.

Release build job: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker_release.yml
Main build job: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker_main.yml

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 17:06:58 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 17:28:58 GMT):<br/>
I also moved the runners from allocated per project to just widely available to all labs projects, hoping to get more use
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 17:31:11 GMT):<br/>
The other thing the arm mac could be good for is creating arm64 docker images.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 17:31:43 GMT):<br/>
That way if anyone is running docker image on arm mac they don't have to go through rosetta
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 17:35:57 GMT):<br/>
It exists to serve :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 17:36:18 GMT):<br/>
I mean, I _am_ running the GitHub runner via `arch`, so you know
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:21:40 GMT):<br/>
Solang now uses ghcr.io and I've deleted solang from hyperledgerlabs on docker hub

@rjones is there an issue with the arm mac runner? It does not seem to be picking any jobs up. I hope US weather is not being the stuff of nightmares again.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 18:31:05 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung I did turn them off earlier in the week. I turned them on and logged in, but apparently I needed to answer a prompt about iCloud before it was _actually_ logged in.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 18:31:09 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for the turbulence
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 18:36:02 GMT):<br/>
Great, no problem. I had not noticed earlier as I was at the solana conference in Lisbon. Got some folks interested in solang.

@rjones there is no docker daemon running on the intel mac:
```
hyp@hyp-ci-intel ~ % docker image ls
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```
Also builds are failing on the intel mac:

It doesn't matter if you don't have time now, nothing important being merged.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 14 Dec 2021 19:18:29 GMT):<br/>
OK I'm working on it :)

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 14 Dec 2021 19:20:28 GMT):<br/>

@arsulegai not directly; however, GitHub is, and Hyperledger has used GitHub as a CNA previously.

@rjones As you have experience with setting up github runners, I thought you might know this.

I'm setting up a linux-arm64 github runner. After each job it leaves all the files in place, and I'm having to manually delete them, else the files may cause the next job to fail. Did you have this problem?

I've got a shell script with this for now:

```
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/runner/actions-runner
while true; do
	sudo rm -rf _work/solang
	./run.sh --once
done
```

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:36:17 GMT):<br/>
Ideally I'd like to tear-down the VM for each job, but that's a bit more work
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:36:28 GMT):<br/>
tear-down and snap-shot restore
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:36:40 GMT):<br/>
I wonder if there is a cleanup action you could add
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:37:20 GMT):<br/>
in the workflow yaml? I guess that can be done too. Seems like a strange workaround though
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:38:08 GMT):<br/>
I'm looking at Iroha to see how they handle it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:40:02 GMT):<br/>
I can't figure it out - they create and destroy an EC2 instance dynamically. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/main/.github
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 15:09:58 GMT):<br/>
ok, I
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 15:13:23 GMT):<br/>
I've now have VM which shuts down after each github actions job, and it respawned from a vm snapshot. The libvirt python api is very nice.

So solang has a linux arm64 runner as well now, and now we can build solang binaries for linux arm64
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 16:55:31 GMT):<br/>
nice

@rjones @SeanBohan @davidwboswell could you please create a Hyperledger Challenge chat group?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 15:20:58 GMT):<br/>
Here is how I did it: https://www.mess.org/2022/01/17/Creating-a-linux-arm64-github-actions-runner/
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 16:26:09 GMT):<br/>
Nice
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:10:45 GMT):<br/>
I wonder if that could work on macos
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:13:31 GMT):<br/>
couldn't run `docker` within `qemu`, probably
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:14:06 GMT):<br/>
That would be nice. macos is being used for creating arm64 docker images.

It also creates macos binaries and tests on macos. I don't know how that can be done.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:14:36 GMT):<br/>
So my VM has docker running in it. This does mean it has to pull images  every time.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:14:57 GMT):<br/>
It would be nice if macos could run in qemu but I don't think that can be done.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:15:31 GMT):<br/>
sure. I was thinking of adding `~/cache` to the mac runner to save grabbing the `llvm` binary
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:15:46 GMT):<br/>
`llvm` tar.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:16:03 GMT):<br/>
Could probably do the same with docker images
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:17:12 GMT):<br/>
My thought was basically, if we had a ci vm per project, it's much more tenable to have multiple projects building on one machine since there wouldn't be any conflicts.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:18:48 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/community-architects?msg=kE8BybGuqozLSwtDN) Good idea.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:02:19 GMT):<br/>
if you have multiple VMs running, would you run out of physical memory though?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:03:06 GMT):<br/>
what I meant was having one mac that can run solang, fabric, firefly serially in distinct VMs, not all at once
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:03:30 GMT):<br/>
since they all have disparate requirements
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:06:55 GMT):<br/>
Right, good idea. I guess you could listen for jobs for one minute, and if there was nothing to do, then switch vms and listen to another project.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:07:22 GMT):<br/>
might need some minor changes in github actions runner code.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:07:32 GMT):<br/>
it isn't that hard - you can attach a runner to an org
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:07:53 GMT):<br/>
then, when a CI job comes in, it starts whatever VM
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:08:53 GMT):<br/>
or, when a job comes in, a pre-step is to start the correct vm
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:55:20 GMT):<br/>
right, I didn't know you could configure github actions runner runner like that. Is that a org-specific way of running it?

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:58:53 GMT):<br/>
The runners I have attached that you're using are attached to the org. if anyone else in labs added an appropriate job, they could run there without conflicting, since the org only runs one build at a time per runner
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 19 Jan 2022 11:38:37 GMT):<br/>
Interesting.

If you could create linux arm64 VMs with the m1 macs, then that would be great. I guess the performance will be much better than my arm64 linux server, since m1 is super-fast.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 19 Jan 2022 11:39:28 GMT):<br/>
These mac m1s are very versatile!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:38:54 GMT):<br/>
ah interesting idea. I was thinking of multiplexing the mac arm builds, not the linux arm builds as well
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:40:17 GMT):<br/>
ok.

Is it possible to run macos in a vm?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:53:16 GMT):<br/>
I know for x86 macOS, yes. I don't know if the arm version allows it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:53:39 GMT):<br/>
I think your idea of linux arm builds on mac arm is probably the easier path to explore
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:54:06 GMT):<br/>
of course, I just wiped and packed up the original one I bought, which would have been perfect to experiment on
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:54:47 GMT):<br/>
murphy's law
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:55:10 GMT):<br/>
I had not seen macos in a VM before. Is this using qemu or something else?

Hi, do you know where I can find guidelines on how to deploy the open source distribution of Hyperledger Fabric 2.2 on OpenShift 4? OpenShift 4 uses podman/cri-o as a container engine instead of Docker so the deployment is a bit tricky to me. Is there any more relevant channel to ask this question ? Thanks ahead!
