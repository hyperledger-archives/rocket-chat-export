@jadhavajay -- good question.  we need to sort out the timing and get the first meeting scheduled.  i think that could be a good discussion for the india chapter list.  could you please ask that question there and i'll follow up with amol, the chapter lead, to respond to that?
</p>

Good Morning everybody! We will start the process of getting some structure around the India Chapter this week. 

I would like to have a meeting in the next day or two. Perhaps we can have a Doodle pill to figure out a time best suited to most people. 

Secondly, would folks please spread the word about the India Chapters to the different meetups around the country and encourage them to join the mailing list and chat channel?

Folks is there someone who can mentor a student for brainstorming and submitting a proposal for an internship? Need someone pretty well versed in Fabric architecture. The deadline is in a couple of days so need to move fast on this. Would be nice to get some representation from India in the internship program.

<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 06:31:37 GMT):<br/>
This is Lokesh from Chennai (India).. About myself, I have been into this Hyperledger for the past 1 year 8 months & so excited. Have developed one real-time product in health-care industry using hyperledger and working on one for real-estate.   I am organizing "Blockchain Developers Community-Chennai" Meetup Group & we have 900+ blockchain enthusiast. We run weekly connect and share the happenings about blockchain and trainings so on.. 
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 06:32:52 GMT):<br/>
In addition to that, we have few other IOT Groups, who have partnered with us and we formed a community to help each others by leveraging technologies such as Blockchain / ML / IOT. So pretty excited & I feel joining this group, can help us further spread the Hyperledger Awesomeness to the world, especially in INDIA

How is the ledger synced with a new org/peer in the fabric network? like i know that: 'peer channel join' helps in achieving that but what's the process that goes behind it to make it happen ? what is the concept involved??

I have had requests to change the timing of the second Identity WG call to 9 pm EDT (01:00 UTC+1) on Wednesdays/Thursdays. This way there will be two options for IST based folks to be on the call 9:30 pm Wednesdays or 6:30 am Thursdays. Any feedback? Please respond. We need more APAC participation. Want to get someone in to talk about the consent layer in the India stack...Anyone interested?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 16:30:48 GMT):<br/>
The next call(s) of Identity WG is on April 17th.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/community-india?msg=cpTiMhX7G7Re66niF) @VipinB its better if the call the is on wednesday @9:30 PM rather than mornings 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 07 Apr 2019 12:52:18 GMT):<br/>
That option is already available at 9:30 pm IST @mallikarjunasai995 ! The second call is more convenient for  APAC, but being at 6:30 am IST on Thursdays some people from India can join the call.

Hi @VipinB, sincere apologies. We missed scheduling this today's meeting well in advance. I just spoke to Kamlesh, and we are good to schedule next meeting either on Thursday (regular India chapter meeting day) or next Monday, which is 15th.
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 12:42:36 GMT):<br/>
Please suggest a day and time, so that we can circulate the agenda...
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 14:19:40 GMT):<br/>
Next Monday the 15th would be the best for me as I will be at the zkproof standards meeting in San Francisco this week. I want to do a brief presentation on the Identity Working Group (maybe 10 minutes) and its activities. The next meeting of ID WG will be on 17th April. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 14:26:19 GMT):<br/>
Hello guys, as we made the second call of the ID WG at 00:00 UTC for the benefit of APAC members, we will now move it to 01:00 UTC  (as it will be convenient for everyone, including those in IST). We have two times suitable for India; 4 pm UTC and 01:00 UTC. We have participation from Japan and Australia in the second call. Please let us know what else the Indian community would like to discuss and contribute in Identity Working Group. What would be fantastic would be any work that you could share on Identity in India, especially the consent layer in the India Stack and how this can be integrated into Blockkchain/DLTs based in Hyperledger. This will have a direct influence on the solutions that we develop in Hyperledger DLT for Identity and Access Management. Any open documentation or data or code on these regulations also could help.  Hope to make a short pitch on this on our next community call(hopefully on the 15th). Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 14:27:50 GMT):<br/>
The ID WG calls are every two weeks on Wednesdays/Thursdays there are two calls with almost the same agenda on the same day (for myself in EDT-US East Coast).

</p>
<p><strong>AnilSingh</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 06:43:53 GMT):<br/>
multiVM/VPC environment where each organization has set of different VMs on different VPCs.

Hi Amol,
</p>
<p><strong>AnilSingh</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 20:16:22 GMT):<br/>
Nationwide meet up is great, haven't been for a while I believe.
Also, can we please add something on awareness for the Hyperledger Certifications which are already out for Fabric and Sawtooth from LF. 
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Sat, 01 Jun 2019 01:49:48 GMT):<br/>
Hi Anil, great point. Let's discuss the HL Certifications as well.
</p>
<p><strong>Pradeep_Pentakota</strong> (Mon, 03 Jun 2019 10:06:23 GMT):<br/>
Hi all
Is today’s session cancelled?
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 05:39:17 GMT):<br/>
Notes from the Jun 3 meeting. Apologies for the delay in sending this out. Please feel free to add anything I may have missed.

Attendees:
Anil
Kumaravel
Pradeep
Ravikant

1.	HL National meetup
a.	Coordinate with city meetups to spread the word
b.	Focus on spreading the word about HL projects & working groups, how to contribute etc.
c.	Amol to initiate the conversation on email & Rocketchat
d.	Early agenda proposal:
i.	Project updates & roadmaps – 15 mins each
ii.	Intro to the working groups
iii.	How to contribute to HL projects
iv.	Other topics – technical topics, case studies, demos etc. Suggestions required.
2.	Starting Application Developer Forums like we have for Sawtooth
We need a group of volunteer who will host the calls. Frequency to be decided by the community. Need to get area experts on each projects signed up to help & mentor during these sessions.
3.	HL Certification
There’s a need felt to provide some help to obtain HL certification. The process isn’t known by many and some struggle to go about it. Having a community of HL certified members available to guide exam takers will help. Suggestions are to set up a RocketChat channel focused on certification, have dedicated meetups & form study groups. Perhaps arrange for training if required.

Action Items:
1.	Amol to initiate a conversation about the national meetup.
2.	Decide on which forums will be started and who’ll sign up to run them.
3.	As a first step for certification, set up a RocketChat channel, spread the word and get the community organized.

Looks like we need to create an event page on wiki about the National e-Meetup... 
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:11:57 GMT):<br/>
When I contacted the meetups, many organizers are asking for more details..
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:12:21 GMT):<br/>
we can summarize the event details in one wiki page and share the page link with everyone..

Hi Ajay, looking at the flyer, we have instructions to join via the local city meetup and then at the bottom also about zoom. 
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:58:23 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:58:30 GMT):<br/>
So I think it may be best to let the city meetups coordinate this on the local level and we can give them the zoom link
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:58:41 GMT):<br/>
absolutely
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:58:43 GMT):<br/>
I agree
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:59:01 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps publish the link to the community on the last day. This is to prevent against the 100 connection limit being hit
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:59:05 GMT):<br/>
can you please share the Zoom link which we can use in the Flyer ?
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:59:19 GMT):<br/>
Same link as the weekly call :)
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:59:30 GMT):<br/>
okay :) great
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 10:00:07 GMT):<br/>
BTW, I have created an event page is here - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CP/India+Chapter+National+e-Meetup

which can be shared with all for promotion purpose.
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 10:00:19 GMT):<br/>

The recording stopped a couple of times thanks to the Webex feature of switching the host whenever the original host joins. Recording stops when that happens. So we had to switch back to Harsha was recording the session and restart. So now we have a few videos which we're stitching together right now. There are a couple of spots where we lost some video due to this switch. But almost all of the sessions are recorded.

@amolk I missed the follow up on HLF Certifications in yesterday's meeting. As we discussed last we were planning to get a separate rocket chat channel for this to start with, there has been lot of queries around this. I am working closely with certification community globally and following the upcoming certification in sometime Q1 2020. We should spread the same in India community and help experts recognized and a way to demonstrate their expertise.

Hello Folks, we had few questions from last "Hyperledger Fabric Developer Forum - Asia". I remember just 1) related to adding a new channel for new organization along with some existing organization ON a running network, please post other questions if you have any ...
</p>
<p><strong>javapriyan</strong> (Sat, 24 Aug 2019 16:23:03 GMT):<br/>
2) was about a aggregation query from @Ayyalusamy

@Ayyalusamy Could you please post your question here in bit more detail (probably with an example what are you looking for) 
</p>
<p><strong>Ayyalusamy</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 07:46:36 GMT):<br/>
@AnilSingh Sure. 
</p>
<p><strong>Ayyalusamy</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 07:46:39 GMT):<br/>
I wanted to join two docTypes using Fabric getQueryResult API. But as of now, I don't think couchdb view is supported in Fabric getQueryResult API. In that case can I directly create view in peer's couchdb and query the couchdb?
</p>
<p><strong>Ayyalusamy</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 07:48:00 GMT):<br/>

Hi ...i forget to mention fabric... its hyperledger  fabric i am trying to do multihsoting  in hyperledger fabric & I am deploying one org1 on local machine & another org2 on Cloud machine ...i am able to do up to instantiate successfully...but not able to do invoke getting this error(invoke-chaincode - invoke chaincode proposal resulted in an error :: Error: make sure the chaincode mycc has been successfully instantiated and try again: chaincode mycc not found) 
</p>
<p><strong>AnilSingh</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 14:11:30 GMT):<br/>
I am sure must have read this in error "that chaincode is not instantiated" .... could you please try to first see you have chaincode installed on both peers by running "peer chaincode list --installed" and then "peer chaincode list --instantiated -o <your orderer>" 
</p>
<p><strong>Heena078</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 05:20:13 GMT):<br/>
yes i saw it is installed on both the peer ...
</p>
<p><strong>AnilSingh</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 05:22:51 GMT):<br/>

yes
</p>
<p><strong>AnilSingh</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 05:56:34 GMT):<br/>

How about using these weekly meetings to update the larger greenhouse project statuses. Many of us attend the individual project contributor meetings and sharing the updates from those to the other members in India would help them be aware of happenings.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Mon, 07 Oct 2019 09:48:03 GMT):<br/>
For example updates on interoperability, Indy/Aries/Ursa, Transact, Sawtooth, Fabric etc. We can fix 10 min for such an update and then proceed with other tasks.

you need to give ip address & port number too in configtx file so that could be written in system configuration file

Hi all, today we do not presentations in the Indy/Aries forum. We will be meeting in the next week.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 01:44:56 GMT):<br/>
Did we have a meeting yesterday?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 01:45:16 GMT):<br/>
I was in another event the whole day
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 05:20:37 GMT):<br/>
meeting was cancelled
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 06:07:21 GMT):<br/>
@amolk Shall we start a excel sheet for list of topics, for those interested?
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 06:20:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes please
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 06:21:47 GMT):<br/>
So folks, next national meet-up is on Nov 16. Brian Behlendorf will be calling in live for a keynote speech. Please spread the word and let's make this event a great success! 
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:16:36 GMT):<br/>
great 
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:18:17 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai  it will be same excel sheet or we creating new one ?
</p>
<p><strong>vijay5378</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:23:01 GMT):<br/>
lets discuss in todays call
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:37:45 GMT):<br/>
Which call do we have today?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:45:05 GMT):<br/>
Hello all, let us use the same spreadsheet and update the proposals under the tab - "Nov 16"
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:47:42 GMT):<br/>
Also as Amol suggested, we shall notify meetup groups to send the teaser.. Detailed instructions can be sent later. Is it good to create a email alias of the meetup groups or do we already have one?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 13:27:01 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai is anyone working on creating the teaser? Or you want @kulkarnikk to look at it, like he did last time ?
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 13:27:56 GMT):<br/>
We had a meeting with Julien on Monday, only three of us were there.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 13:28:14 GMT):<br/>
That would be helpful, I guess nobody else is preparing that
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 13:28:51 GMT):<br/>
We can also add the tasks and task-owner in the spreadsheet
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 13:32:15 GMT):<br/>
Yes, another thing to confirm is the meeting ID. The free version of zoom cannot accommodate 100+ participants. This is where we struggled last time.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 13:33:03 GMT):<br/>
@amolk Did you talk about this with Julian in previous call? Or shall I ask community architects to create one for us?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 05:06:48 GMT):<br/>
@kulkarnikk I have volunteered you based on @ajayjadhav for digital posters/teasers
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 05:07:46 GMT):<br/>
There's a "Nov 16 - Volunteers" tab for the task-ownership information
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 05:44:55 GMT):<br/>
that's great
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 05:46:29 GMT):<br/>
sorry!, late to the discussion, but suggestion is to spread the words at the earliest to all the meetup groups!, so that we can achieve good numbers this time.
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:01:41 GMT):<br/>
@Logi can you help coordinate the meet-up groups?
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:01:44 GMT):<br/>
Just a thought - Can we create one survey link? and put that in respective meetup-group .. In this survey, we can ask for what do they want to see out of this national meetup?.  I think, we will get different opinions or options, from which we shall pick the line items which are posted by majority of members?.... 
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:01:49 GMT):<br/>
yes I can Amol
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:03:07 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai  - please let us know when we have first cut/draft of Posters/teasers
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:03:09 GMT):<br/>
This time we're grouping presentations into tech and business so there's something for everyone. Plus folks can choose not to attend parts they're not interested in.
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:03:27 GMT):<br/>
oh that's wonderful
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:04:13 GMT):<br/>
Before that, a heads up needs to be given to the meet-up organizers. I'm writing a message on the meetups channel.woukd you be able to send an email as well? Many folks don't check the channel regularly.
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:04:46 GMT):<br/>
He meet-up organizers emails are in the spreadhseet. That can be the starting point and you can add any mails that may be missing.
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:05:06 GMT):<br/>
sure Amol,
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:05:21 GMT):<br/>
i will do that.., pls share the write-up's
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:10:21 GMT):<br/>
@Logi please check the heads-up message I posted on the meetups channel. You can start with that and get the initial mail going. We can send follow-ups as and when we get details.
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:11:13 GMT):<br/>
Also, please go ahead with the survey. But let's put a time limit on the responses so we get sufficient time to plan the event.
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:11:14 GMT):<br/>
sure thanks Amol, got it
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:11:28 GMT):<br/>
will do that ..
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:11:38 GMT):<br/>
Awesome!
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:26:23 GMT):<br/>
done, sent a heads-up message and also shared the survey link

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 14:00:13 GMT):<br/>
We can also ask for paper proposals if anybody is interested to present, that would trigger greater interest in participation
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 16:29:03 GMT):<br/>
yes, email should be fine, and they can post it in respective meetup group/whatsapp group .. Any other sugestions?
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 16:38:54 GMT):<br/>
I too have same opinion to send it over mail.

</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 16:43:59 GMT):<br/>
Looks good. Shall we say how/where to come to get more info? What about volunteering or submitting topics for the meetup? 
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 19:16:39 GMT):<br/>
thats a good idea, we can share rocket chat details for joining India Chapter
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 20:27:29 GMT):<br/>

Hello All,
Here are the two flyers for the upcoming national meetup.

<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 13:31:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi @davidwboswell , Need your kind help to propagate these flyers to all meetup organisers across India, like last time we sent to all of them
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 13:33:57 GMT):<br/>
Please use correted flyer #3 again
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 20:54:39 GMT):<br/>
@kulkarnikk -- i'll be happy to help.  i recommend we do that when we have the webinar dial-in information to go along with it so organizers have all of the info they need to get plugged in.
</p>
<p><strong>vijay5378</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 08:49:46 GMT):<br/>
app deev
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:59:25 GMT):<br/>
Sure @davidwboswell, we will wait for the webinar and YouTube live details from Julien. On a second thought, given that we are already on Tuesday, can we send the agenda slide.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:23:32 GMT):<br/>
@kulkarnikk I forwarded an email with the Zoom webinar link for Saturday
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:30:07 GMT):<br/>
okay, thanks for the update Arun. I will check my mails and then add the webinar link
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:30:41 GMT):<br/>
But we are not to share the Webinar link with attendees, webinar is going to be joined only by presenters, while attendees will hook into YouTube live, isnt it?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:31:44 GMT):<br/>
The webinar allows 500 participants, in today's experiment it was not possible to get a fixed URL for YouTube live. It changes everytime we stream.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:32:19 GMT):<br/>
The other cool feature was that only presenters can be granted option to talk.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:32:53 GMT):<br/>
The email has more details and we're planning on a second test tomorrow 2:30 PM IST
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:33:15 GMT):<br/>
Oh thats great. So it sounds that Webinar will be a good option to go ahead with
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:33:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:48:50 GMT):<br/>
Perfect, thanks Arun for confirming. I shall update both the flyers with Webinar details and share with the group here shortly.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:11:42 GMT):<br/>
Great, glad to hear the test was helpful.  I'll start sharing the info out when the flyers are updated.
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 18:26:32 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 19:05:08 GMT):<br/>
@kulkarnikk yes, will share this information out with organizers and on Hyperledger Twitter account.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 19:06:01 GMT):<br/>
In flyer 2, how about removing the YouTube Live with underline?
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 21:55:38 GMT):<br/>
To make it simple for organizers I'm going to tell them to go to the wiki for all resources for the meetup.  I see you have one of the flyers there already.  Could you please add the other too?
</p>
<p><strong>kulkarnikk</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 05:25:08 GMT):<br/>
I have added second flyer as well on the Meetup Wiki Page

Hi Kamalesh,
I think this is for all the SIGs (Special Interest Groups) such as Fintech, SupplyChain, etc. to have desk to present updates on what is happening in the groups respectively. Not sure whether this is available for other than SIGs. Can Hyperledger India Chapter have an opportunity, is something we should explore.
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 09:07:13 GMT):<br/>
yes,,they also mentioned about Working group too...May be Amol can check & explore
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 09:34:11 GMT):<br/>
Awesome! We should represent and spread the awareness on working group

hello guys, i am lavish, and i am new in block chain and in hyperledger as well.
i have read  basics of hyper ledger and studied the working of hyperledger fabric samples.
Can any one guide me what to do after this, how can i start making my own project ?
i have cloned the fabric sdk node but don't know what to do next, so can anyone please help.

Hi - Welcome to Hyperledger Fabric World, to get the taste of fabric. Would recommend you to start with first network setup available in fabric samples. You can find plenty of tutorials for the same,. Make sure your environment is ready before your start creating the network.

Ok. I don't see a 1530 (UTC+0530) call for yesterday on this calendar though. There's one I see on 10Feb titled Hyperledger India Chapter.

Hi, with regard to chapter india hackathon, is there any template for a proposal for first round? 
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 18:40:42 GMT):<br/>
@Tomomi.Yamano There's no template mandated. It's open for the participant's creativity. The more structured the materials are the better chances to catch jury's attention. You may want to add in design diagrams, explain in brief how the solution works etc through a PPT. If it's possible then add a sample code that's working with screenshots.
</p>
<p><strong>Tomomi.Yamano</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 01:53:21 GMT):<br/>
ok

Folks,

We've made some important changes to the HyperHack 2020 guidelines after hearing from interested participants and consulting with the Jury members. The updated guidelines can be found here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CP/Rules%2C+Regulations+and+Guidelines

Here's a summary of the main changes:
1. Teams affiliated to members of the Jury are now allowed to participate as long as they disclose their affiliation with the jury members. The said jury member shall recuse himself/herself from judging these teams.

2. Detailed timelines have been added

3. Judging criteria have been added

We'd like all of you to participate and show off your technical prowess! Let's make this inaugural Hackathon a huge success!
</p>
<p><strong>mrudav.shukla</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 08:57:09 GMT):<br/>
Sure.

Hello all,

Today (27th Feb 2020) we have Sawtooth developer's forum. You may join on the Zoom call https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community
Please find more information in the Hyperledger Calendar, it lists the dial in options as well
Time: 2:00 IST (GMT +5:30)
</p>
<p><strong>nikola_tesla</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 09:31:45 GMT):<br/>
are the final round demos open to all? 
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 09:38:38 GMT):<br/>
No, unfortunately! Jury panel suggested that it would be unfair for the teams presenting first as their comments will be heard and incorporated by the later teams. The last team presenting would be doing so at 135th minute. That's sufficient time to alter the presentation based on reviews for initial teams.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 09:39:11 GMT):<br/>
However, we are making efforts to either record the session and post or write a blog with all the submissions.
</p>
<p><strong>harika.n</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 12:12:28 GMT):<br/>
Hi, are we expected to show demo as well as present in the given five minutes? Just wondering as transaction submission itself would take some time. Also, if the screen sharing doesn't work , is there any alternative? 
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 12:21:54 GMT):<br/>
You could try a video recording option, with edits for 2-3 min. Then show that the video recorded is indeed from the deployed code. Do not worry about the glitches, we will consider those issues and give sufficient buffer time in 15 min window.
</p>
<p><strong>harika.n</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 12:29:34 GMT):<br/>
Ok thanks. 
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 12:43:46 GMT):<br/>
However, note that we've tested the calling option. It works well and we won't be able to grant you extra time if it's because of your demo setup.

hello guys,
can you help me with query a ledger ?
i know how to query world state in fabric usering couchdb,
but what if i want the history of an item from the ledger, then how can i achieve that, i know some functions for query a ledger with transaction id or blocknumber , but how can i complex query in ledger , like we do in couchdb ?
</p>
<p><strong>pritam_01</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 07:14:12 GMT):<br/>
you can do rich query but have to use couch db, for rich query you have to implement function inside chaincode  . shim package provide function like
1. GetStateByPartialCompositeKey 
2. GetStateByPartialCompositeKeyWithPagination
3. GetStateByRange
4.  GetStateByRangeWithPagination
refer this https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim#ChaincodeStub.GetStateByPartialCompositeKey
</p>
<p><strong>lavish 1</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:22:37 GMT):<br/>
will it also work on ledger, because it seems that these function are for query in worldstate only. @Pritam 12 
</p>
<p><strong>pritam_01</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:23:59 GMT):<br/>
No, it will not work on ledger, 
</p>
<p><strong>lavish 1</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:24:13 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>lavish 1</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:24:42 GMT):<br/>
but is there way to query ledger @Pritam 12 
</p>
<p><strong>lavish 1</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:24:42 GMT):<br/>
but is there a way to query ledger @Pritam 12 
</p>
<p><strong>lavish 1</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:25:10 GMT):<br/>
complex queries
</p>
<p><strong>pritam_01</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:27:02 GMT):<br/>
complex queries? example 
</p>
<p><strong>lavish 1</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:30:25 GMT):<br/>
like i have a project car auction,
and in world state , the product is car and whenever someone buy a car , i change the owner of the product,
but if i want to get all the owners related to this car, for that i want to query ledger , so that i can get all the transactions in which that car is included
</p>
<p><strong>lavish 1</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:30:54 GMT):<br/>
@Pritam 12 
</p>
<p><strong>pritam_01</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:32:18 GMT):<br/>
you can use GetHistoryForKey
func in shim package 
https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim#ChaincodeStub.GetHistoryForKey
</p>
<p><strong>lavish 1</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:35:11 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks, i will try that @Pritam 12

Hello,
I have one use case for implementing private blockchain . I am supposed to use Hyperledger fabric. Can anyone help me out what should be the architecture for do that?
One company deals with different vendors (unknown). Now, we want to make smart contract between the company and vendor to do further transactions.
I will make one organization for the company. But what to with vendors? As vendors are not separate organization, they are individual entities.

Hey !! could anyone here help me with Kubernetes Volumes. I am stuck since last 1 week. I have been trying to deploy test Fabric network on Kubernetes minikube cluster but I am not able to. I am unable to get crypto-config and channel tx files in the Pod containers. Any help will be much appreciated.

Also you can explore blockchain automation framework
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetBhowmik</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:37:58 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @knagware9 I will definitely look into this. Although I don't wanna use helm and do everything from scratch by myself. I will see what I can do to make that happen. Right now k8s Volume is something which elude me.

Hi all
in HLF All signing keys and certs getting store in wallet and it is hosted on back-end. I mean project Owner have access of the wallet and he can easily get all signing key and make the transaction on user behalf. My main concern is wallet security. how we can make it more secure and decentralise so that even Owner of the project can not have access of the wallet.
All suggestion are welcome

<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Sun, 27 Sep 2020 12:17:48 GMT):<br/>
There are 2 parts to this.
(1) Asking for BFT behavior in HLF which is not yet implemented / available.
(2) Storing the keys at the client, I guess you're talking about Fabric client here. Could you explain your current architecture? Are you building a server which has wallet stored and then a client that talks via the server?

One approach would be for you to store list of trusted certs in a world state. Install a administrator chaincode and let it verify end user's cert. All the client transactions are to be signed by an entity that is rooted to the certificate that your chaincode trusts. Hope this was helpful.
</p>

Hi Everyone,

So excited to join the group.

As Julian Gordon, VP APAC, Hyperledger at the Linux Foundation suggested, I thought of dropping you a note and letting you know about the Hyperledger Fabric Bootcamp which is on 19th November 2PM HKT for the Hong Kong Blockchain Week 2020. 

To open the event, Julian will be sharing with us the latest news and development for Hyperledger Fabric and beyond.

It is going to be a fun event with amazing learning. It will be great if you could share it with other groups too as we are trying to have a greater number of people coming in. 

We would love to see you there and work together to attempt to deploy the largest Hyperledger network to date.

Register now

I hope to see you at the event.

Best Wishes,

Hi - Can someone tell me, can we use couchbase as state database in hyperledger fabric instead of couchdb?.. we want to use enterprise support db, any other enterprise db you recommend?.
</p>
<p><strong>ravinayag</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 08:21:23 GMT):<br/>
@Logi ,  FYI : couchdb is widely tested in developer community.  State database is optional to user's choice to exchange whichever is convenient to your enterprise.
</p>
<p><strong>Logi</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 12:51:59 GMT):<br/>
thanks ravinayag: I understand, but the requirement is to use enterprise licensing db version, so was exploring some options. Thanks for your reply
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 14:16:03 GMT):<br/>
@Logi you can implement any DB with Hyperledger Fabric but you need to implement ledger APIs , you can refer this https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Enabling+CockroachDB+as+a+State+Database+for+Hyperledger+Fabric - Enabling CockroachDB as a State Database for Hyperledger Fabric

<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 19:18:04 GMT):<br/>
Looking at the logs, the first screenshot seems to be normal, I don't see any issues there. It is just adding new batches to the block that is being created.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 19:18:47 GMT):<br/>
Since you're saying it is a production network, I believe you have tuned your network to maximum transactions in a block.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 19:23:13 GMT):<br/>
Second screenshot says that you have a static peering network. You will have to give out more information. This gossip layer exception does not necessarily end up in bad behavior. Until the networking layer is moved to rust, you will see these dumps. These are not well handled.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 19:23:36 GMT):<br/>
Can you share more information: what are you experiencing, what makes you think there is a problem etc?

<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 20 Jan 2021 04:58:56 GMT):<br/>
If this is not happening, please raise a ticket to the Fabric team. Give me more logs, I can help to debug it further.
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetBH 2</strong> (Wed, 20 Jan 2021 12:10:16 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai 
This is the scenario. Client is firing a transaction which is invalid as per our transaction processor validations that we have put. But as opposed to the expected behaviour of replying with INVALID status, blockchain seems to add it to candidate block queue and instead sends back UNKNOWN status which implies to clients that something is wrong with the blockchain. We are confused whe n all the nodes' transaction processor is logging it as an invalid transaction, why is blockchain not as a whole rejecting the block as invalid and instead keeping it as candidate block
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 20 Jan 2021 13:17:46 GMT):<br/>
Batch and block are different things. Transaction execution happens only at the time of block creation. When you say blockchain, I assume it to be the validator node. Validator waits for the transaction result and then adds to the candidate block. If the TP is written to send invalid transaction, it won't be added to the block. Candidate block is a term that is used to represent block under construction.
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetBH 2</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 02:38:49 GMT):<br/>
Transaction Processor is throwing exception saying it's an invalid block. But still the batch is added as candidate block. I wonder what could be the possible issue.
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetBH 2</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 02:38:49 GMT):<br/>
Transaction Processor is throwing exception saying it's an invalid transaction payload. But still the batch is added as candidate block. I wonder what could be the possible issue.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 09:34:03 GMT):<br/>
Is it the only pending transaction that node has?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 09:34:03 GMT):<br/>
There is a known issue around that
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetBH 2</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 10:14:07 GMT):<br/>
Yes. Let me give a brief of the scenario

I submit a faulty transaction: Transaction error throws error, but still validator keeps it and I see log CandidateBlock: add_batch
Now if we keep submitting faulty transactions, the above scenario keeps happening. 
Submission of a correct transaction results in a block getting comitted.

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 18:21:16 GMT):<br/>
When you submit the good transaction, block gets created. This does not include invalid transaction in it. It removes the invalid transaction from the pending batches (that is how transactions are sent to the validator) pool.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 18:22:26 GMT):<br/>
The known issue around invalid transaction is -- validator should ignore if a transaction is invalid, but it won't if it's the only transaction in the validator. This was unintentional in the code. Also, there is a pending PR on that and is not merged from a long time.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 18:22:46 GMT):<br/>
Sawtooth 2.0 release wouldn't have this issue because it will follow different design around this part of the code.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 18:22:56 GMT):<br/>
Hope this clarifies all your questions
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetBH 2</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 13:41:45 GMT):<br/>
Thanks a lot @arsulegai Sir. When is the estimated release of 2.0 scheduled ? I guess we need to upgrade to that
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 13:42:39 GMT):<br/>
It is not released yet. Please join the community meeting today, there will be updates. Find the meeting information in #sawtooth-core-dev
</p>
<p><strong>AbhijeetBH 2</strong> (Mon, 25 Jan 2021 13:27:29 GMT):<br/>
What's the better way to have a health check on sawtooth nodes ? To address the issue of stuck validator nodes which gets fixed on node restart, we are thinking of having kubernetes readiness probe in place which would perform health check on sawtooth validator pod. But I am unable to find any relevant documentation on it. My basic approach that I thought on the top of my head was to execute `sawtooth batch status --url http://rest-api:8008 $(sawtooth batch list --url http://rest-api:8008 | awk 'FNR == 2 { print $1 }') | awk 'FNR == 3 {print}'` and check the commit status but it turned out sawtooth batch status only returns commited batches.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Mon, 25 Jan 2021 17:05:56 GMT):<br/>
It depends on how you define the health, if the health check is whether service is up or not then it is easier. If you're defining health check as whether block is being produced or not, it is user triggered random event. Alerting based on logs is the best way.

For us ( basically what clients expect) blocks are being committed is the metric to judge if things are good. Do you have reference to any procedure to accomplish this. We are a bit reluctant to submitting batch every time liveness probe runs as that would result in a tremendous amount of chain size.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 27 Jan 2021 14:55:04 GMT):<br/>
Attach an event listener to know if a transaction has been successfully put into the block. If you don't see the event in sometime, let's say 10min, then query for the status, if it's unknown then send it again.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 27 Jan 2021 14:55:30 GMT):<br/>
This just is one way of doing it, you're best person to understand your system requirements and design accodingly.

Hello everyone.   Great to be in here, I wanted to update the community on our updated capabilities with XBOM on Hyperledger Fabric we presented in late 2020.  

We presented to Hyperledger NYC and Denver Meetups. Please watch the recording of the premier of ClassFungibleAsset and subclass ClassSmartAsset for enablement of Fungible and Non-Fungible Assets in our GlobalOS, XBOM a First Class Object mode on Hyperledger.

This is a command line demo which clearly shows how blockchain advances without any smart contracts using DataGrid Token ($DGT) and wrapped ETH ($WETH) as examples.

Again, everything works as advertised, this release is for our XBOM dev environment and enterprise TestNet for PoC. The use cases for enterprise, the assets would be pharmaceuticals, spark pugs, bolts, coal, etc in a supply chain.

Pay Attention to the enablement of a Globally UniqueID for every account and every object.

Hi all, i am using 1.4.6 version of fabric in production in swarm mode facing issue as follows
panic: Error opening leveldb: leveldb: manifest corrupted (field 'comparer'): missing [file=MANIFEST-000008]
when researched the issue seemed to be because of Full disks not sure if this is the reason. Can anyone confirm this or tell what the issue is and a way to resolve this issue without data loss.
thanks and regards

Hi all, I am trying to create a channel and encountering the following error.
 ``` [grpc] Infof -> DEBU 040 Channel Connectivity change to READY   
Error: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST -- consensus metadata update for channel creation 
is invalid: invalid new config metadata: verifying tls client cert with serial number 280322
988955805056619412110165950090557792693897: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority 
```

I have checked the tls certificates of orderer and peer and they don't seem to have any problem. The error says the tls client cert of orderer is signed by unknown authority. Can anyone shed some light how to troubleshoot this problem?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 04:45:36 GMT):<br/>
@indirajith re-check your `configtx.yaml` configuration file, the part where you are specifying channel creation. Paste the configuration and the commands you are using for more debugging.
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 08:08:15 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai I have pasted the entire config here: https://pastebin.com/VrsuusQr , I use the following command to create the channel. Thank you!

``` peer channel create -c orgschannel -f /etc/hyperledger/org1/peer1/files/orgschannel.tx -o ord1-org1-map.example.com:7050 --outputBlock /etc/hyperledger/org1/peer1/files/orgschannel.block --tls --cafile /etc/hyperledger/org1/peer1/tls-msp/tlscacerts/tls-ca-tls-map-example-come-7054.pem  ```

@arsulegai  , should "whitepaper on use of blockchain in election" contain implementation approach also. For past 2 month I have been working on problem similar  to e-voting. In short e-voting require 3 problem to solved 
1. Prove membership : voters proving that they belong to a Electoral list without revealing his/her identity 
2. Vote only once : voter should be allowed to only once 
3. accountability of casted votes : voter should be able to verify whether their voter got included in final counting .
Till now I was able to solve first 2 problem (POC) and would like to work on this project.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Fri, 23 Jul 2021 19:11:47 GMT):<br/>
@pritam_01 that would be an excellent addition the document. Can you share more about the project?
</p>
<p><strong>pritam_01</strong> (Sat, 24 Jul 2021 17:49:07 GMT):<br/>
Due to private nature of the project, I won't be able to share more about it.

If you could give edit access I will be happy to contribute to the docs and also to the project.

Any one know how to make a peer read only?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 14:03:42 GMT):<br/>
@RahulEth I assume you are asking about Hyperledger Fabric? When you create the channel, you can configure the permissions to not let the peer have ability to write to the channel.
</p>
<p><strong>RahulEth</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 09:47:41 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai how to configure the persmission ? any idea ?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:00:14 GMT):<br/>
@RahulEth I missed this message completely
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:00:43 GMT):<br/>
You can do it by modifying the policies, fetch the config block, decode it to json, update it and submit back.
