{"msg":"Hi Everyone,\n\nSo excited to join the group.\n\nAs Julian Gordon, VP APAC, Hyperledger at the Linux Foundation suggested, I thought of dropping you a note and letting you know about the Hyperledger Fabric Bootcamp which is on 19th November 2PM HKT for the Hong Kong Blockchain Week 2020. \n\nTo open the event, Julian will be sharing with us the latest news and development for Hyperledger Fabric and beyond.\n\nIt is going to be a fun event with amazing learning. It will be great if you could share it with other groups too as we are trying to have a greater number of people coming in. \n\nWe would love to see you there and work together to attempt to deploy the largest Hyperledger network to date.\n\nRegister now\n👉https://blockchain-bootcamp-hyperledger-fabric-v2.eventbrite.sg\n\nI hope to see you at the event.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nNeha Jajodia\nDigital Marketing Associate | Chainstack","username":"neha.jajodia","ts":"2020-11-09T08:25:12.491Z"}
