The Linux Foundation’s CommunityBridge engineers are working on a tool to measure the health of critical open source projects and one of the key areas identified is QA Testing.  They request that our communities provide  honest and detailed information on testing tools and methodologies you use in your projects for us to come up with a detailed analysis, which they will share with all respondents and projects. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9H5G2GV. It’s only 5 questions long.

Hello @davidwboswell Thank you for your feedback. I have many questions since this area is very interesting for me and my company. When do you expect to "restart" the activity?

Hi, 
I am Darshana Jain, CEO, Snapper Future Tech.
Our company is creating hyperledger based products in the Education domain.
I am keen to restart activity on this group and brainstorm, collaborate and engage with like minded companies, people.
 
Learning Credential platforms are trending, there are several companies building these solutions.
There are standards being proposed for Blockchain in Education in Europe. I Would love to have views  on this.

The other business domains with the hyper ledger SIG which have created / working on setting standards.

Lets work together towards creating Global standards for Blockchain in Education.
I am happy to volunteer time to lead the effort in this domain.

Hello everyone, just joining in this chat to learn more about the work of this SIG and see if there is any way I can add value and contribute.
</p>
<p><strong>alexchainstack</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 07:17:07 GMT):<br/>
Prior to joining the blockchain industry 5 years ago, I worked in the education sector / lifelong learning in the UK, managing high value contracts from a number of UK agencies and the EU to up skill the workforce and increase social mobility through education. The area of education and blockchain are very dear to me, and I would welcome any information you may have of existing applications being built on Hyperledger (or even any other protocol) that will apply to this industry. Thanks a lot, looking forward to a conversation with you all.

As a quick introduction, I work as Director of Sales and Marketing at Chainstack (https://chainstack.com/) - managed blockchain services.
