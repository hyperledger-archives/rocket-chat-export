 Hi, I was wondering if chaincode has an API functions for user/application to explicitly sign and verify the content and send it as part of the transaction. Example - If a legal contract is deployed using a chaincode, we need participant to sign on the legal contract content. Can anyone pls advise.

<p><strong>nickmelis</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:38:21 GMT):<br/>
how would you implement a unique id generator (possibly for an incrementing sequence number) within the chaincode? I was thinking about using a variable in the state to keep track of the latest sequence number but how would you ensure it is read/written in an atomic way across nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 18:47:28 GMT):<br/>
It is probably better to generate it on client side
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 18:47:39 GMT):<br/>
like it is done in car-lease-demo project
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 18:48:46 GMT):<br/>
but if you don't use random numbers and just increment a value, then you can save the last used ID and get the new one based on it.

Hello.. In Fabric v0.6.1-preview, is there any way to execute some function inside the chaincode, at a specific date/time automatically? eg., in a share market usecase, can we do calculation and transfer of dividend at a specific day, time of every month/quarter etc? or is it better to have an external application that invokes a transaction on the chaincode to do the necessary calculation and transfer?

<p><strong>karan-bharadwaj</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 08:35:48 GMT):<br/>
hey guys, i have a few basic questions about deploying chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>karan-bharadwaj</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 08:35:54 GMT):<br/>
so how exactly are the init invoke and query functions called? where are they called? I'm assuming init and invoke are called automatically right?
also how can i pass args []string to the chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 12:25:46 GMT):<br/>
@karan-bharadwaj yes, they are called when you deploy or invoke your chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 12:27:11 GMT):<br/>
and when you do this, for example, with Node SDK, you make a request which is sending to a peer. This request contains some parameters like chaincode ID, function to call and *arguments*
</p>
<p><strong>karan-bharadwaj</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 14:13:57 GMT):<br/>
@zemtsov right, thanks.

I've a question to submit 
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 09:51:12 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible in fabric to clone chaincodes?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 09:53:22 GMT):<br/>
To have two same ones?
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 09:54:40 GMT):<br/>
My idea is having a set of chaincodes 
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 09:54:45 GMT):<br/>
like templates 
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 09:54:58 GMT):<br/>
and using these to clone other ones 
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 09:55:26 GMT):<br/>
the clone could be changed 
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 09:55:26 GMT):<br/>
the clones could be changed

<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 09:56:10 GMT):<br/>
leaving in the initial state the "templates"
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 09:57:09 GMT):<br/>
I guess the best way is to modify the code outside blockchain and deploy different versions

How do I create a business contract using the fabric?
the second way, and probably the more efficient way, is to use chaincode to create decentralized applications that manage the life cycle of one or multiple types of business contracts, and let end users instantiate instances of contracts within these applications.

Dear Gents, does anyone know how to browse the Blocks in the Ledger of Hyperledger (including the data) and not the Worldstate? I guess this requires "admin" rights. But I do want to have a historical view on transactions and also access to the data somehow. Any suggestions? Many thanks
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 13:12:46 GMT):<br/>
@bercinho to browse the blockchain there is a blockchain-explorer tool in the incubation
https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer
To see transactions data, I guess, you need to be an auditor. Take a look at car-lease-demo example. There is a Regulator view which shows history of all transactions with details.

Hi @zemtsov thanks for your feedback! The explorer is quite useless in a sense, you don´t have access to the data, so apart from seeing transactions and blocks completing, there ain´t much more. Will look into the demo to see the Regulator view, thanks for advice! :)

Hi all, we're facing an interesting challenge. We need to import a large amount of (json encoded) items, process them and store them in the worldstate. There are so many items that we run into an execution timeout on the peer and the transaction fails. We’d prefer to not split the items up and have limited options in reducing processing time per item. Can we increase the timeout or is there another smart way of solving this? (We’re on 0.6 currently but answers for V1 are also welcome). Thanks!

Hi @zemtsov, I don´t really get from the car-lease-demo what APIs are available to investigate the ledger itself, browse through the blocks and transactions within.

Hi @bercinho. Take a look at this file:
https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/car-lease-demo/blob/master/Server_Side/blockchain/transactions/CRUD/read.js
REST API is used to get transactions info from blocks
</p>
<p><strong>bercinho</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 09:38:24 GMT):<br/>
Hi @zemtsov, the REST APIs you refer to is exactly what the Blockchain Explorer utilizes, and I guess what we see in the Blockchain Explorer is as far as we can go looking at the Hyperledger  blockchain. My problem is this doesn´t provide for a particular user identity a historical human- readable semantic audit log into his interaction with the Blockchain ... The Blockchian Explorer is not restricted to a particular identity, but it would be quite valuable for a particular identity to allow a richer view from his perspective on the Blockchain in respectvie to transactions he has submitted and have been added to the Blockchain in terms of data (maybe even change in the World State). ... now either this audit log for certain users may be built up off-chain, but then we introduce some security & reliability concerns OR we can have specific structures & chaincode to implement such a view and align it with all business transactions. How would you provide such a "historical audit log" to a particular user on the blockchain & transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 09:51:35 GMT):<br/>
So, did I get it right? You want to see not only a list of transactions in block but what is in transaction's payload, right?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 09:54:39 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>bercinho</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:20:27 GMT):<br/>
Hi @zemtsov this looks exactly what I am looking for as it cotnains the details of the transactions. Nevertheless when I look at the REST API reference (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/protocol-spec.md#3121-transaction-data-structure) it says "TransactionPayload.payload - Bytes defining the payload of the transaction. As the payload can be large, only the payload hash is included directly in the transaction message." so you might have lack of data; The Regulator must have special rights in membersrvc.yaml auditor or admin to have such insight? 
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:02:02 GMT):<br/>
@bercinho I'm not sure what to say :)
that code woks. It just converts transaction's payload to ascii and then parses it in
https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/car-lease-demo/blob/master/Client_Side/JavaScript/ledger/ledger.js

I guess there should be more details about it

https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/car-lease-demo/blob/master/Client_Side/JavaScript/ledger/ledger.js

I guess there should be more details about it
</p>
<p><strong>bercinho</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 15:00:00 GMT):<br/>
Hi @zemtsov what I meant is that the documentation of the API states that you don´t have payload data of the transaction, just a hash of it ... it´s not accurate in this sense as according to your example the payload is actually given back.

<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:46:50 GMT):<br/>
@zemtsov I figured out. Ethereum Solidity has a limit on local variable (inside method), depending on variable type size... typical max. no is 16 in solidity.

In Solidity, the state of instance variables defined will be stored as well. In HL, the instance variable we defined are still stateless. If we need to persist anything (being stateful), we need to store with shim.putState(key, value).
</p>

Wow ... just getting into the port of our IoT contract platform to v1 and it is a total bummer that we already had our own composite keys and history and queries with iterators. Because the stub has changed completely with incompatible implementations of all of that ... the term "bleeding edge" could not be more apropos :-)
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 16:45:34 GMT):<br/>
@DannyWong Yes, it is an absolute that contract state shall never be maintained in memory. Every transaction or query is completely new and all state must be persisted in world state.
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 16:49:05 GMT):<br/>
Yeah right. Actually, i am doing some kind of comparison for my project on Ethereum Solidity and HL
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 16:50:54 GMT):<br/>
i think one of the key benefit of Solidity is the OO concept and contract native language design
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 16:51:46 GMT):<br/>
but we knew that chaincode-to-chaincode invocation (write) is coming now,.... read is already available
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 16:52:16 GMT):<br/>
if we can have something like "msg.sender" in Ethereum in HL, then we can do some kind of "trust" chain code chain call easily

@DannyWong Chaincode must be installed on peers that can receive the contract invokes. The chaincode must be associated with a channel explicitly (as in deployed to it). And every user access requires a tcert be obtained ahead of time. Channels can be private between tow or more parties. With all of that, what more "trust" were you looking for?

Can anyone tell me how to override the logging level of a 0.6 chaincode with an environment variable?

@channel I got no answer to the following questions on the fabric channel, so perhaps this is a better channel for these. I watched the video "Hyperledger install & instantiate code" today, and was left with some questions. 

1) If I understand the video, endorsers require install of chaincode in order to execute invokes. But what about queries? Do observers require install of chaincode so that applications can be targeted to the observer? In a globally distributed network, we will want observer peers all over the place so that we don't put pressure on the endorsers with queries. It looks like an install command for every global observer would be required in the new model (i.e. versus the v0.6 model where the chaincode is installed on every peer automatically no longer holds for this scenario). Would this be an accurate interpretation?"

2) I also note that the Query stub API is gone and queries are run through the Invoke entry point now. This makes me wonder if the queries now have write access? And can queries now see *uncommitted* state? Thanks.

3) Also, how do I differentiate insode Invoke between invokes and queries? I don't see a separate parameter that tells me whether I am receiving an invoke or query? Or does it even matter any more? Is it really just down to the specific API function name?

More questions: I see Jira changes such as 1751 and 1752 that seem to dramatically change the stub interface without any explanation. Meaning that there are cryptic (or no) reasons to do each of these changes, but I cannot find explanation on how they are to be used in the stub's comments or in the two FABs. The chainge itself is not all that helpful since all of these properties are simply byte arrays with no implied structure. 

		 +	creator   []byte
 +	transient map[string][]byte
 +	binding   []byte

So I am wondering what I am missing. Does anyone know where the new stub interface is documented? That might help me find the answers to my questions above since none of the channels are at all responsive right now.

@kletkeman `creator []byte` and `transient map[string][]byte` are defined in the protos for proposals. `binding []byte` is computed from (creator, nonce and epoch) as seen in protos/utils/proputils.go -> ComputeProposalBinding()

</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 20:56:04 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix Thanks. I'm also wondering about the questions above that one re the query context. read/write protection, committed versus uncommitted state purview, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:11:24 GMT):<br/>
@kletkeman for queries if it involves chaincode then you'll need to install it on the peer and instantiate it in the channel you'll make queries to. there are other queries that don't require customer chaincode, like the general purposes ones getChainInfo, getBlock by number, get transaction by ID, etc. so an observer peer can serve those query requests without the chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:13:20 GMT):<br/>
yes the queries are sent as regular endorsement proposals, but they won't be able to see uncommitted state because the ledger won't get updated until the transaction is committed, and since chaincodes are stateless a query request won't get to see internal states of a transaction processing
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:14:34 GMT):<br/>
finally yes it's down to the specific function name in the args that get sent in the proposal for the chaincode to tell what's what
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:14:35 GMT):<br/>
so the query has some sort of marker in the stub that says it is read protected? and that it cannot see uncommitted state? Because the transaction can see the uncommitted state of any previous but not yet committed transactions
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:15:19 GMT):<br/>
hmmm ... I don't see how a transaction can see uncomitted state while a query cannot ... they both use ReadState
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:15:31 GMT):<br/>
and both in the context of Invoke
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:16:06 GMT):<br/>
'the transaction can see the uncommitted state of any previous but not yet committed transactions' - not sure how that's the case
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:16:18 GMT):<br/>
that's always been the case ...
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:16:24 GMT):<br/>
read state is built from accessing the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:16:57 GMT):<br/>
in v0.6, the JSON RPC read method cannot do putstate ... and getstate sees only committed data
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:17:15 GMT):<br/>
the JSON RPC invoke method can do putstate and ses uncommited transactionse
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:17:34 GMT):<br/>
I know this because I can send many transactions for the same asset and all can end up in the same block with the correct state changes
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:17:40 GMT):<br/>
right, but in the context of that particular transaction request
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:17:49 GMT):<br/>
it sounds like the new method might have a problem in that this discipline has been lost
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:18:00 GMT):<br/>
when you send a separate request, the read set if built from ledger
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:18:00 GMT):<br/>
no ... multiple transactions in a row
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:18:04 GMT):<br/>
they can layer in v0.6
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:18:24 GMT):<br/>
ok ... so this is also true for invokes?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:18:40 GMT):<br/>
i don't know how the internals of v0.6 works
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:18:41 GMT):<br/>
i.e. parallel requests on the same assets will have race conditions then
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:18:48 GMT):<br/>
but i'm pretty sure what i said is true for v1.0
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:19:39 GMT):<br/>
ok ... this is something to think about ... thanks
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:19:58 GMT):<br/>
yes if more than one outstanding tx are modifying the same key, then only the first one is considered valid
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:20:45 GMT):<br/>
wow ... that's going to be difficult to enforce ... presumably the fabric will take care of returning a failure for all outstanding requests to the same key ...
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:21:04 GMT):<br/>
I cannot imagine how it can do that ... interesting
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:21:09 GMT):<br/>
they get included in the block as invalid transactions
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:21:40 GMT):<br/>
but the first one will be successful
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:21:41 GMT):<br/>
wow ... rejection events are sent automatically ... 
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:21:46 GMT):<br/>
pseudo flow control
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:21:57 GMT):<br/>
but not as effective ... 
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:22:34 GMT):<br/>
apps will start serializing by asset ID ... something I have already asked for 6 months ago from IoT platform ... looks like we have to do it now for sure

@jimthematrix One last question ... sorry ... for this to work, the entire write set would have to be checked to make sure that no keys appear in a previous transaction in the block ... this would have to be done using a hash table as the block was built for performance reasons. Does this sound about right?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:49:14 GMT):<br/>
are you referring to how the peer/validator enforce this or how you need to "line them up" in the application before submission?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:51:03 GMT):<br/>
you can use the key version to see if the intended write is valid or not
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:51:17 GMT):<br/>
but i'm not entirely sure i understand your question...
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:51:17 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:55:42 GMT):<br/>
sorry, I was talking about how the enforcement works ... 
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:56:03 GMT):<br/>
in real time, every txn going into the block would have to be checked for a clash with all the previous txns
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:56:32 GMT):<br/>
we can queue our simple crud txns by assetID ... but complex txns that can write several keys we cannot do anything about
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:56:47 GMT):<br/>
they are slower, though, and not likely to fail
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:57:17 GMT):<br/>
queue and serialize I meant
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:59:15 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix what this also implies is that endorsers cannot overlap processing with the committers ... the endorsers must have the latest block with no further blocks outstanding ...
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 22:01:47 GMT):<br/>
ok i see, yes when the committer validates the tx in the block it'll need to take into account previous tx in the same block to decided if a key version has advanced
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 22:01:49 GMT):<br/>
I suppose we could have lazy failure ... at the very end based on key versions
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 22:02:30 GMT):<br/>
as for how the endorser and committer/ledger coordinates block commits (or not), you'd have to ask @dave.enyeart 
</p>

<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 22:02:35 GMT):<br/>
as in we can run everything in parallel and the key versions get checked at the end, signalling a race condition and failing the txn at the last moment
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 22:03:50 GMT):<br/>
thanks ... I'll run that by him sometime ... for now, I can think of ways to do it so I will assume we can get lazy failure ... which is not really different from immediate failure in effect ... we need to wait to submit txns on an asset until we see the previous commit, and then it is safe
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 22:03:56 GMT):<br/>
thanks again ... making sense
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 22:04:26 GMT):<br/>
you bet
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 22:06:12 GMT):<br/>
@kletkeman @jimthematrix The committer 'state validator' ensures that state hasn't changed for all entries in ReadSet. It checks against both state db and prior trans in the block (yes, using a hash map)
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 22:07:29 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart Thanks ... basically, the read set must be the same as that used by the endorser, else transaction fails at commit time ...
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 22:07:39 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 22:07:41 GMT):<br/>

Hi! I'm newer to the world of Hyperledger. I am making a Java project to be simply like giving out pieces of gum. I wrote a file that handles the initialization and the transferring and the deleting and the different actions that can happen to the gum, but I'm confused with where to go from here. Can someone help me?

Adding another thread here from the fabric sdk channel: 

weeds 3:29 PM
Got this quick question today highlighted here---> https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2625
Is there a way to include a request that is sent in state in the emitted event, because this team who opened request is using uses a router for chaincode API and rules and so access to intermediate data is difficult at best. Ideally, they want to be able to use SetEvent as done today, but to add more information by calling a new GetEvent function on the shim and then putting it back. Any recommendations on approach here? @kletkeman added her given this is where question originated from

kletkeman 3:50 PM   
Thanks @weeds, we can set only one payload for the emitted event -- in our case a marshalled JSON object -- and so we need to be able to incrementally add to this event. I would much prefer to not have to built it up as a separate passed context, since the shim is already a useful context object for working with the ledger. Instead, the addition of a getter for the intermediate event payload would allow us to put the latest payload and then get it and update it along the way. Note that this would suffer a bit from poor performance, since it has to be serialised and thus marshalled each time we exit from a function.

Perhaps we could instead get an actual context object that could be used by complex chaincode to build context up for other purposes and to build up the payload, which can then be set in the shim at the end. This would actually be even more useful. Something like *map[string]interface{} would be incredibly high performing and yet flexible. With or without getter and setter. Anyway, I wonder how others feel about this? (Note also that the shim might even be able to pass this context to all participating chaincodes in a deeply complex chain.)

There was a ".yml" file under there I used to successfully start up a small fabric .... and it is still there under .../docs/source ... so maybe it will still work ...

@SubhodI the software is not released yet, and thus nothing is on dockerhub.  You need to build from source.  "make docker" will generate the images you are looking for

Earlier we have been using hyperledger fabric v0.5 and v0.6 with vagrant and successfully developed various sample applications. Now we want to switch to v1.0. Though we are following the steps given on "http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-setup/devenv.html", but somehow we are facing issues while setting up development environment. Is membersrvc.yaml file replaced with fabric-cop? Thanks in advance.

<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 16:44:06 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins I created an issue a while ago that it the cli container has no visibility of /local-dev, which makes working on real chaincode impossible with the cli. You mentioned something to me about using the cli like we used to, natively on the mac. The problem I am having is that it is built only inside the peer. So what would be more likely to succeed -- hacking the build to make /local-dev visible inside the cli container; or trying to build the peer outside the container to use its cli features old school?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 16:51:12 GMT):<br/>
@kletkeman by "inside the peer" I assume you are referring to the fact that the "peer" binary is a multi-mode tool (e.g. "peer node" is a oeer daemon vs "peer chaincode" is a CLI)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 16:52:34 GMT):<br/>
i still do not think it makes sense to advocate that CLI tools should run inside docker...so I wouldnt be a fan of modifying the containers further.....in addition, as far as I know, you can already build the "peer" binary natively which means "peer chaincode" and other CLI usage of it should already be supported
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 16:53:30 GMT):<br/>
in addition, I am not sure there is really anything the build could do about it: sharing a volume inside a container, as far as I know, is only available as a function of runtime switches like -v
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 16:53:51 GMT):<br/>
by that, i mean: its already available to you today, and I am not sure I could improve upon the usage further
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 16:55:11 GMT):<br/>
we could conceivably offer a wrapper tool (e.g. a script "peer-chaincode.sh" that wraps something like "docker run -it --rm hyperledger/fabric-peer peer chaincode $@"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 16:55:32 GMT):<br/>
but again, I am not a fan of this approach...i think our CLIs should be native tools ideally
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 17:05:04 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins Thanks ... I agree with you. Turns out that the SDK end to end just started working again, so now I have to decide how best to recreate our simple debug environment from v0.6 ... command line (which is always painful as transactions get big), or a translator got our POSTMAN collections from v0.6 to run on top of the SDK ... I know that there is a production level initiative to add REST, but I think a quick hack debug facility is needed asap ... might not actually be all that much work ... have to see ...

<p><strong>suvpatil</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 10:10:53 GMT):<br/>
can we call third party API from chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:12:26 GMT):<br/>
@suvpatil Here is the problem with calling out from chaincode -- chaincode must be 100% deterministic, and any call to an external system is not guaranteed to work. Moreover, any call that results in information being recorded externally is going to be missing from the read/write set and thus not rolled back if the transaction does not end up committed. Thus, you are immediately out of sync between world state and the external system. Note also that any call made out to the real world is made from every copy of the chaincode on every peer involved in the transaction.

So you can call out for read-only, but your peers must all be able to reach the same URL and thus you introduce a major impediment to determinism. Carefully handled, it could be reasonably reliable. But expect transactions to fail more often unless your implementation is bullet proof.

And writing externally is unlikely to stay perfectly synced up to world state, so designing that in is simply asking for earth shattering issues.

There is an exception that I was shown and agree with. If you want the chaincode to certify an external file's authenticity (for example you want the master copy of the latest Star Wars film to be certified as the original on some IP protection ledger), then you could have the chaincode create the hash of the film (which is much better than passing it in with the "trust me" property set) and store the signature of the film and the exact location. For performance reasons, I suspect that you would need a separate channel per film and you would need the film to be accessible locally on a fast network shared with the peer. Further, each peer would need the same access using the same URL, which implies a distributed file system with appropriate routing. Yet this is all still fine if the endorsers all agree, because the URL and the signatures match and that is all you need.

I have not heard of any other scenario where external access is safe and effective, but I really like this one.

@here Any thoughts on the above? ^^^^^
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:39:45 GMT):<br/>
i am thinking about one functional requirements that i am doing....
1) We created a "resolution smart contract" that requires multi-sig from defined set of key members in order to get it "resolved"
</p>
<p><strong>Suma</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:40:35 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:40:49 GMT):<br/>
so... its like

if (obtainedNoOfSig >= requiredNoOfSig) {
   resolutionStatus = "resolved";
   resolutionTime = block.timestamp; // achievable in Etherum Solidity
}
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:41:30 GMT):<br/>
in HL, due to different architecture, we cannot really put a non-determinisitc operations like "now()"
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:41:52 GMT):<br/>
as it will produce different results in different endorser
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:42:24 GMT):<br/>
so... even the block creation time is marked in the Orders, it cannot really put this value back to the "writeSet"...
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:42:40 GMT):<br/>
Of course, we can pass a timestamp from SDK
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:43:13 GMT):<br/>
but it is not a trusted source (outside chaincode)
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:44:15 GMT):<br/>
and the timestamp we can pass from SDK is at most "the timestamp of the signing action", which IF this sign action is the one that change the if-statement above to true, then use this timestamp as the resolution time
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:44:36 GMT):<br/>
so.... i am thinking how we can design this in HL.
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:52:36 GMT):<br/>
@kletkeman I agreed above. Should avoid external call as much as possible. And implement a trusted idempotent/deterministic Oracle service for all endorsers... but IMO, it makes more sense to do query from Oracle service BUT NOT updating. Since the transaction atomicity cannot guaranteed. 

If we really need to update external system, we should "event" instead.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:01:01 GMT):<br/>
@DannyWong I had the stub API changed about 8 months ago to allow us to get the TX time stamp and I use that as the official time. Note that there can only be one TX time, so all committers will see the same time in your data. Now() is absolutely forbidden, as you mentioned.

This is a function from inside the IoT Contract Platform on IBM-Watson-IoT/Blockchain-Samples -- note, v0.6 code

// Adds the current transaction timestamp into world state, replacing it if it was already there.
func (a *Asset) addTXNTimestampToState(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) error {
	// add transaction uuid and timestamp
	a.TXNID = stub.GetTxID()
	txnunixtime, err := stub.GetTxTimestamp()
	if err != nil {
		err = fmt.Errorf("error getting transaction timestamp, err is %s", err)
		log.Errorf(err.Error())
		return err
	}
	txntimestamp := time.Unix(txnunixtime.Seconds, int64(txnunixtime.Nanos))
	a.TXNTS = &txntimestamp
	return nil
}
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:01:30 GMT):<br/>
and yes, events are the other half of 2-way communication
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:05:47 GMT):<br/>
kinda agree on the time...
// GetTxTimestamp returns transaction created timestamp, which is currently
// taken from the peer receiving the transaction. Note that this timestamp
// may not be the same with the other peers' time.
func (stub *ChaincodeStub) GetTxTimestamp() (*timestamp.Timestamp, error) {
	return nil, nil
}
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:05:57 GMT):<br/>
but current implementation is returning nil hahaha
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:06:40 GMT):<br/>
in v1.0, client (sdk) submits the tx proposal to multiple endorsers
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:07:03 GMT):<br/>
endorsers should receive the tx in different timestamp
</p>
<p><strong>dknochen</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:12:10 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:21:40 GMT):<br/>
in fact, potentially in future, if we as client do not need to send proposal to all endorsers ourselves...
we just submit to one endorser, then it will internally forward to necessary endorsers via gossip (after checking the endorsement policy for example)...
then at that point, i think the receiving peer can mark a tx timestamp and forward it to other endorsers as well
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:21:47 GMT):<br/>
just some *wild* thought
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 17:10:57 GMT):<br/>
If we are not getting TX timestamp in v1, then we have a serious problem ...
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 17:11:44 GMT):<br/>
I saw yesterday that there is a move to send to all endorsers in parallel to save time ... but the client will have to do that I suspect ...
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 17:12:38 GMT):<br/>
either way, we need a way to get the official transaction time ... and since the SDK gets the nonce before submitting it, we can perhaps have the SDK perform "now()" to assign a TX timestamp. That way, all endorsers get the same timestamp.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 17:13:10 GMT):<br/>
in fact ... if there is a timestamp field on the transaction request, perhaps we just have to set the time there and it will work
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 17:14:14 GMT):<br/>
@DannyWong @jimthematrix I am not all that comfortable with so much responsibility in the clients, but we can set the timestamp if need be. ^^^^^

</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 22:40:10 GMT):<br/>
Yes, in fact, i have been discussing why the sdk client has entire respsonsibility to orchestrate everything. Like collecting responses n compare the signatures n determines whether it passes the endorsement policy n submits to orderer services...
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 22:41:38 GMT):<br/>
Why the heck a client needs to have all the addresses of endorsers in the first place...

@raj The latest docs are only days old and are here: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
If you want to browse the source, then simply drill down into the docs folder to find the *.rst files.
Some examples of interesting docs:
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/install_instantiate.rst
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/dev-setup/build.rst
But the real action for v1 comes from the hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node project. Take a look in there and spend some time on the channel of the same name. Browse the posts form this week and you will be able to deploy and talk to a test chaincode from that project.

@raj An asset is just something stored against a key in the world state database. It is usually the focus of the contract, but can be one of many such contract foci. There is a project called the fabric-composer that you might want to look at: https://github.com/fabric-composer
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 16:04:38 GMT):<br/>
@raj I have an article I put down about 6 months ago. It needs updating for our contract platform, but the info might be useful for you.

<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 16:53:42 GMT):<br/>
@DannyWong I don't understand the scenario under which you would need that? If need be, you can always pass the chaincode its own ID in a separate function, which it can store in world state under "MYID" or some such. But ... v1 is also introducing a monikor mechanism to my knowledge where the name will be settable ahead of time, allowing smart contracts / chaincodes to have well known addresses like web services etc. I don't quite know how this would help you, but it might?

@greg.haskins @kletkeman thanks. let me write a test chaincode to verify...
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 16:54:54 GMT):<br/>
let me illustrate why i need it
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 16:55:29 GMT):<br/>
as we now in v1.0 we can specify the chaincode id in sdk
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 16:55:50 GMT):<br/>
i can probably set it to the state db in the init method 
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 16:56:02 GMT):<br/>
with something suggested "my_cc_id" something like this

<p><strong>rrader</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 15:51:35 GMT):<br/>
I run marbles app with v0.6, I saw `cc_id` is this the signature of transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>StevenLanders</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:33:43 GMT):<br/>
@rrader this is the chaincode ID that you'll need to reference when you invoke/query your chaincode.  In a non-dev mode of v0.6, it's a hash of the deployed chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>rrader</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 19:09:56 GMT):<br/>
@StevenLanders ok, thanks, but how to sign a transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>StevenLanders</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 19:14:18 GMT):<br/>
I might need more context.  The SDK takes care of certain parts of this, and will request the ECerts/TCerts as needed.  One assumption is that the client is running in a secure location.
</p>
<p><strong>rrader</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 19:15:13 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible to sign a transaction by custom data from application, for example ID + PIN?
</p>
<p><strong>StevenLanders</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 19:16:33 GMT):<br/>
it is possible:  one could sign the transaction as you're doing, and pass the signature in as an argument, and have chaincode logic verify that signature.
</p>
<p><strong>StevenLanders</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 19:17:03 GMT):<br/>
another approach is to verify cert attributes of the enrolled user, but it's mainly useful for things that do not change
</p>
<p><strong>StevenLanders</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 19:18:05 GMT):<br/>
(i have a 2FA use case that used this sort of approach)

<p><strong>rrader</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 19:35:16 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>StevenLanders</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 19:43:26 GMT):<br/>
(for me, in chaincode, but it's something weird i'm doing)

hi there
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:43:34 GMT):<br/>
does anybody know of a reason for not being able to run two networks within the same environment?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:43:53 GMT):<br/>
I've managed to get two sets of 4 nodes running, sharing one CA
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:44:20 GMT):<br/>
but the chaincode deployment on the second network seems to fail for some reason
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:44:32 GMT):<br/>
I should say that this is using v0.6
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:45:11 GMT):<br/>
the weird thing is that the peer seem to believe the chaincode did deploy successfully
</p>

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:45:25 GMT):<br/>
but I can see there are no chaincode containers running
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:45:41 GMT):<br/>
and any subsequent attempt to query or invoke fails
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:46:34 GMT):<br/>
this is the error I get: Error: Error querying chaincode: rpc error: code = 2 desc = Error:Failed to launch chaincode spec(Could not get deployment transaction for 4fd71582cea191fb9e890

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=pwoBu6FMRx4Yb9ZmC) @lehors  Hi! Try to attach to docker container and check logs
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:33:12 GMT):<br/>
I understand but what I'm asking for now is whether there is any known limitation

<p><strong>normand</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:36:33 GMT):<br/>
Not sure about that. Had same problem when deploy request returned me chaincodeID, but containers weren't created. It couldn't find the baseimage for docker. But u are trying to run on same environment, so docker host is the same and think it's not the problem I encountered.
</p>
<p><strong>normand</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:37:51 GMT):<br/>
There are channels in hyperledger for working within a channel with different chaincodes or different channels for different chaincodes, but as far as I know, this mechanism was implemented in v1.0
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:38:22 GMT):<br/>
that's right
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:38:41 GMT):<br/>
in my case, the chaincode works just fine on the first set of nodes
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:38:57 GMT):<br/>
it's only on the second one that it fails
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:39:34 GMT):<br/>
given that it's on the same host it should have the images all right
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:40:05 GMT):<br/>
I guess I will need to dig into the logs and code ... or give up
</p>
<p><strong>normand</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:42:42 GMT):<br/>
Are nodes running in PBFT?
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:49:41 GMT):<br/>
@lehors Have you tried with different parameters for the second set of nodes? The reason I ask is that changing even one thing about the deploy (in this case parameters) will change the ID of the chaincode and thus the name of the container. This might help.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:50:40 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I tried that and did get a different name but that didn't seem to help unfortunately
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:51:57 GMT):<br/>
I also thought there might be a conflict with the names
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:52:06 GMT):<br/>
now I wonder whether the conflict isn't with the ports
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:52:46 GMT):<br/>
that would seem to me to be the most likely cause but what do I know? :)
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:53:14 GMT):<br/>
Sorry to hear that ... it's the most obvious possibility. Have you set the logs on the peer to DEBUG? That might provide some info. Also, does your second set of nodes have the same level of network access? And are the ports changed correctly? Meaning -- each peer must have unique port assignments, which is done inside the docker-compose file (as I am sure that you know). Did you remember to continue incrementing the port numbers?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:53:16 GMT):<br/>
(answer: just enough to get in trouble ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:53:48 GMT):<br/>
i.e. no ports can overlap
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:53:52 GMT):<br/>
I think
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:54:03 GMT):<br/>
so I think we agree on the next possible issue
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:54:09 GMT):<br/>
yes, I've changed the ports and I'm confident the nodes are well connected each in their own network
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:54:25 GMT):<br/>
hmmm ... wow ... stump city
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:54:27 GMT):<br/>
it's really a problem with the cc deployment
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:54:50 GMT):<br/>
so, I will try to dig into those logs (which are way too verbose!)
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:54:51 GMT):<br/>
which is the first real transaction on that sub network
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:55:10 GMT):<br/>
I agree on the verbose ... you get slammed with pbft logs that overwhelm the rest
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:55:22 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:55:36 GMT):<br/>
but somewhere in there will be the deploy and there are followon logs that might be illustrative ...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:57:24 GMT):<br/>
thanks

<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 15:13:28 GMT):<br/>
@StevenLanders good if you can share a bit more on your 2FA chaincode use case... i m designing something similar... 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>StevenLanders</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 15:27:17 GMT):<br/>
@DannyWong we were trying to keep as much of sensitive logic as possible in the chaincode to get the security advantages of decentralized validation.  Technically it's pretty straightforward: it involves chaincode checking the value of the 2FA code from the payload against some datasource (e.g., world state).   
</p>
<p><strong>StevenLanders</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 15:28:22 GMT):<br/>
(I'll say that ideally it belongs upstream from chaincode (authentication in general is upstream))
</p>
<p><strong>StevenLanders</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 15:29:06 GMT):<br/>
(it may have been going overboard to put it in the chaincode)
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 15:32:49 GMT):<br/>
in fact it makes sense to put sensitive logic in chaincode as long as it produces deterministic result...
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 15:33:25 GMT):<br/>
e.g. if we can get a "trusted" timestamp in chaincode, then it will be great
</p>

<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 16:28:19 GMT):<br/>
@StevenLanders @DannyWong I'm curious as to the use case that requires that 2FA be done in chaincode? Basically, you want the COP to do its magic, and if that include 2FA then so be it. By the time you get the transaction (invoke or query), you have a known user and thus it is effectively signed, is it not? Also, there is the transient area in which to pass keys should you be doing obfuscation / anonymization and so on. The chaincode will want to enforce ACLs based on ID or ORG, but otherwise I don't se why the chaincode would be involved in the mechanics of auth in any way.
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 16:35:14 GMT):<br/>
Yes for the jira, i am tracking it
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 16:36:02 GMT):<br/>
For thr 2fa, i received a requirement now n thinking how to implement it
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 16:36:39 GMT):<br/>
The ca can be a good and natural place to integrate with biometric auth like FIDO
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 16:38:57 GMT):<br/>
@DannyWong Yeah, I prefer a string separation of duties. Chaincode's purview is the object model and API (transactions and queries) while the ca's purview is authentication for all clients. I would hate to see the line blurred as it is non-intuitive and ultimately not maintainable ...

<p><strong>StevenLanders</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 18:01:37 GMT):<br/>
@kletkeman I think I agree with that.  The thought was to use the decentralized peers to limit the attack surface for hacking, and it more-or-less got out of hand.  We ended up pushing more authentication into the chaincode in that effort.

Hi there, new to hyperledger development, I'm digging around examples and finding that the common setup for every example I've come across follows this pattern of having an `Invoke` function, which takes in the name and args for a function, RPC-style, and the function name is mapped to a custom application function in Go to interact with the ledger. Is this RPC-style function calling the only way to interact with the ledger?

I dun think there will be a direct RESTful API like v0.6
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 03:06:21 GMT):<br/>
they move from RESTful (sync req/response style) to GRPC one as Fabric is a more event based / bidirectional / async nature
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 03:06:43 GMT):<br/>
you can wrap the logic with NodeJS SDK to expose REST if needed
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 03:07:11 GMT):<br/>
Fabric CA has RESTful API... as it is "sync" based, there is a Swagger file for you to see the API
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 03:08:16 GMT):<br/>
@here, in the past (v0.6), when we deploy a chaincode, there is something "ACL" to specify who can actually call the chaincode

<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 03:09:27 GMT):<br/>
is it gone now?

(my initial thought: now we have multi-channel architecture that only relevant parties are in that channel, then we instantiate that piece of chaincode on that channel, instead of just deploy it like in the past)

Hi, can somebody please send me a link for fabric node js sdk specs?
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 04:15:24 GMT):<br/>
i am struggling to find it. I just get a link to http://fabric-sdk-node.readthedocs.io/
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 04:15:32 GMT):<br/>
which does not provide the specs details
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 04:15:49 GMT):<br/>
i am looking for fabric v1.0 specs
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:29:49 GMT):<br/>
@praveennagpal  you mean docs
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:30:27 GMT):<br/>
honestly don't know what is the right one
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:30:29 GMT):<br/>
lol
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:30:36 GMT):<br/>
yes i meant the docs needed for integration with the fabric client
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:30:59 GMT):<br/>
but that's one of the links
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:31:04 GMT):<br/>
i have a decentralised app which I need to integrate with fabric
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:31:22 GMT):<br/>
so i was thinking of using the fabric node js sdk 
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:31:45 GMT):<br/>
how do I use it unless I have the published specifications?
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:31:54 GMT):<br/>
the best getting to started one so far is
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:31:55 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:33:35 GMT):<br/>
fabric v1.0
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:34:03 GMT):<br/>
the nodejs sdk is 0.1.0
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:34:03 GMT):<br/>
the nodejs sdk is 0.1.0 though in this tutorial
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:34:35 GMT):<br/>
latest is 0.2.1, but stuff are breaking
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:35:01 GMT):<br/>
@antoniovassell : have seen this set up step..
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:35:34 GMT):<br/>
but if I have to send transactions, deploy chain code, query chain code..there should be some apis available to do it..
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:35:48 GMT):<br/>
there is, look at the code
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:35:50 GMT):<br/>
also
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:35:55 GMT):<br/>
i know they are retiring the REST api
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:35:56 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:36:04 GMT):<br/>
look at the test specs in the repository 
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:36:22 GMT):<br/>
..until there is better documentation
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:36:45 GMT):<br/>
yea i saw that somewhere
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:37:02 GMT):<br/>
#confused 
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:37:28 GMT):<br/>
think #fabric-sdk-node  would be a better channel regarding node sdk
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:38:27 GMT):<br/>
let me try that
</p>
<p><strong>antoniovassell</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:40:34 GMT):<br/>
@praveennagpal repo is here by the way https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/tree/master/test/integration

<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:29:19 GMT):<br/>
hey guys im using hyperledger v0.6 
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:29:36 GMT):<br/>
is it somehow possible to loop through all rows of a table?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:33:25 GMT):<br/>
stub.GetRows should return all rows to you
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:44:16 GMT):<br/>
@zemtsov thx, but for GetRows you have to provide a key dont you ?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:48:54 GMT):<br/>
yes. I think you should have the key since there is a key value storage
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:49:35 GMT):<br/>
If you have a list of all keys, you can iterate all rows
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:50:56 GMT):<br/>
so my problem is, I have table where there are users and their holdings users is a key and holdings is not
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:51:26 GMT):<br/>
what I want is to simply get the whole table 
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:51:59 GMT):<br/>
so like for the first entry: get the user and his holding
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:52:04 GMT):<br/>
than for the second and so on
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:52:09 GMT):<br/>
*then
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:52:19 GMT):<br/>
if users are keys you probably can store the list of them as a separate value
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:53:00 GMT):<br/>
do you have the list of all users?
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:53:09 GMT):<br/>
no :D that is exactly the point
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:53:40 GMT):<br/>
and im unable to find a simple "loop through the table" function
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:57:16 GMT):<br/>
GetState and PutState are native functions for KVS there. There in no tables. Such functions as GetTable, GetRow just use Get/PutState to operate data
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:57:16 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:57:31 GMT):<br/>
so I think you need the key anyway to read anything 
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:58:08 GMT):<br/>
hmm... ok thx anyway :D 
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:58:32 GMT):<br/>
what i could do is add a key column which gives an integer to every user
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:59:03 GMT):<br/>
Yes, use UserID as the key
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 14:37:43 GMT):<br/>
@thojest The table APIs are gone from v1, so I recommend that you don't play with those. They were just a wrapper on the K:V database anyway. Since GetState and PutState still work fine in v1, it behoves you to work with those.
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 14:38:17 GMT):<br/>
@kletkeman thank you. i will try it
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 14:39:12 GMT):<br/>
As for looping, you can get an iterator to loop through a range of keys, so careful naming of keys (and remember that composite keys are your friend) will allow you to do a lot of things that tables promise. Consider using JSON objects as your data and you have much of what you need, and it is portable forward into v1.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 14:42:38 GMT):<br/>
If you want to take the short path, examine the ctasset.go file in my contract platform. It contains "readAllAssets" as an implementation of class-based CRUD style manipulation. There are three sample contracts associated as well. The v0.6 platform is here: https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/blockchain-samples/tree/master/contracts/platform
It's a bit fresh, and the documentation is lagging, but there is a docs folder at the top level that has a few articles to get you started, notably this one: https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/blockchain-samples/blob/master/docs/HyperledgerContractsIntroBestPracticesPatterns.md

What is the pattern used for notifying a new chaincode id from the originator/creator to other selected members of the network in Fabric v1.0? Do we need some messaging here outside chain or is there some capability within client sdk to watch on the world state for new chaincode instances?

Could someone point me to a link or any documentation, mentioning how to write and execute unit tests for chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 14:32:02 GMT):<br/>
@praveennagpal An application listening for a "block" event could parse the block and look for deploy transactions. The "init()" method for a chaincode could emit an event called "new chaincode version", which would rely on world state storing its name and version (which you could pass into the chaincode during deploy) and thus your own chaincodes could uniquely identify themselves as having been deployed or upgraded.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 14:46:37 GMT):<br/>
@chaitanya There is some mention of unit testing here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/CONTRIBUTING.rst, but the references in there are the standard sort of unit tests that execute when you run "go test". I have examples of that in our iot contract platform and it works very well for utility modules etc.

But if you are asking about the "mock" interface for testing a chaincode as if it were deployed, then I must say that scanning the code and the docs (*.rst) has yielded nothing. I know that there was a breaking change to the stuib API in v0.6 for mocking, and I think I';ve seen some tests based on that somewhere, but I can find no mention in the v1 code or doc bases. Sorry.

is there any replacement for the table functions in v1?  some helper functions?  I realize everything was built on top of GetState/PutState, but does anybody have table-like functions?

</p>

@chaitanya @bmos299  I would go to the fabric-quality channel to ask about testing.  They have an automated CI they have built and the experts are on that channel

i have a network of several peer nodes in pbft but running locally so no docker

then i deploy the chaincode to one of the nodes

<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Wed, 22 Mar 2017 15:05:28 GMT):<br/>
and then whenver i query or invoke the chaincode i get transport: http2Server.HandleStreams failed to receive the preface from client: EOF

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=Dn4RCQwsu3JTuzimS) @RishabhSoni By server do you mean any generic server? If so, I've used `github.com/go-resty/resty` in the past to make REST calls from chaincode.

I want to store in hyperledger data about exchange usd to eur, something like(date -> rate) 
"21 Mar 2017" -> 0.92940
"22 Mar 2017" -> 0.92583
"23 Mar 2017" -> 0.92699
so, as I understand, first I should deploy a chaincode with empty map,
and everyday I should call invoke to update the map
is this how it should be?

I have this scenario. B got in agreement in A to solve a mathematical puzzle for him. This matematical puzzle include a encrypted string. A knows the decrypted text beforehand, he just want see B working(for fun). A stores the decrypted text and encrypted string in a database. Duration of this work is several days. After completion/decrypting B submits the decrypted text on the fabric network. Chaincode may have some access to the database from where he matches the answer.

How can i convert all this in smart contract to overcome problems like A must pay to B if he successfully decrypt the text.

I just need a high level smart contract, not the code. I am new to this i just want to know if contract can be implemented in hyperledger fabric smart contract.

Hi All, is there any signin/signout kind of functionality available with membersrvc with Fabric-V0.6 ?
For me it seems once the user is enrolled he get the capability to fire invokes and queries and cannot be logged out.
is there any example of such login/logout feature in repository ?
using HFC node-sdk

<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 13:00:48 GMT):<br/>
@RishabhSoni It helps to think of the smart contract as more or less equivalent to a web application with an API. Meaning that you design a datamodel to reflect what you want to be able to do, then a sensible API to reflect how you would like the data to flow in and out, and finally you codify it in whatever language you are working with (JavaScript in web apps, Go in smart contracts, or a sort of hybrid of custom datamodel plus Javascript event model for transactions in composer). There are many details to deal with, especially in v1, but the basics are always the same. Note: if you want privacy etc, things get a lot more complicated, but to simply reflect your scenario into chaincode is quite straightforward. Note that I have always stored everything as JSON objects, which is where fabric has evolved with v1 as well. This makes it pretty easy to understand how your asset states will have to change as events are received. You just do a lot of GetState and PutState to the asset identifiers.
</p>
<p><strong>RishabhSoni</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 13:22:00 GMT):<br/>
@kletkeman i definitely need some security over that as i understand that the chaincode deploys on both peer A and B. So basically B should not be able to see the decrypted text. What should i do in this scenario. Whare the database should be located show that only A can access it and both peer can endorese it.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 14:11:58 GMT):<br/>
@RishabhSoni Ah yes, I see the issue. Well, there are a few different ways to approach it in a simple demo app. The simplest might be to have the test be one asset and the solution be a second asset (different but related composite keys in the ledger. You could then have a test admin have access to every key while those being tested have access to the test and their own solution key, but not the master solution key and nit any other person's solution key. That way, you can run many in parallel and "tested" people cannot see others' work.

Example of asset keys:

Key=TEST1
Key=TEST1Solution
Key=Test1SolutionStudent1
Key=Test1SolutionStudent2

Student1 can see TEST1 and Test1SolutionStudent1 ... this is easily enforced since the student's ID is part of the key so you don't need any heavy admin solution.

Use JSON objects to model the test and the solution and you can see how simple this is to implement.

Anyway, just a thought ...

can i block some onse money on a blockchain. Suppose A and B are in agreement, where B do a work for A. Work duration is in days and B want ensure that A must have the payable ammount after the completion of work. it may happen that B agrees to work because A have ammount, but A can spend the ammount during the work duration.

I am new to the hyperledger. Although have some experience with bitcoin blockchain. In bitcoin blockchain I only executed money transaction on blockchain, but hyperledger provide facility to execute smart contract. I saw an example in hyperledger where confirmation messages are being stored on blockchain, like "asset delevered" and "time exceeded". I need help in understanding how thiese message block are different from transaction block.??? and how current ammount is calculated with these message blocks.

Hi There, for V1.0 how should I set up development environment if I'm not using vagrant?. Previously for V0.6, we just run the memberservice and peer separately like below:

1. github.com/hyperledger/fabric/membersrvc > ./membersrvc (This will start the memberservice which is called CA server I believe now)

2. github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer > ./peer node start --peer-chaincodedev (this will start the peer in dev mode)

3. github.com/chainwalk/go/pmechainwalk> CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=chain01 CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7051 ./<chaincode_tobe_run> 

in 3 different terminals I will run this and after wards if I run any deploy, invoke services, the logs will appear in the 3rd/last window.

As of now for V1.0 I had followed this url and ran the test as given there. http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asset_setup.html.

please let me know after this in V1.0 what are the next steps to get there. Is there any documentation available some where?
</p>

it uses vagrant. without vagrant here are the steps 
</p>
<p><strong>raj</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 00:05:36 GMT):<br/>
1) after getting fabric, 2) do a `make docker` 3) go to `fabric/examples/e2e_cli` 4) run `docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)` 5) do a `./network.sh up
</p>
<p><strong>raj</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 00:05:57 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 01:17:11 GMT):<br/>
Hi, Can someone pls explain what is the difference between deploy vs install & Instantiate chainccode now. 
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 03:34:27 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi Deploy on v0.6 would send a chaincode path to a peer, it would load the chaincode and build it, performing consensus with the rest of the validating peers, and if all was well they would all have it installed and running and ready to service invokes and queries.

V1, on the o ther hand, introduces private channels. So you must create a channel, then install the chaincode on every peer that will use that channel, and then instantiate the chaincode on that channel (also called join I believe). End result is the same, but for only one of many channels.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 03:35:29 GMT):<br/>
Look at the e2e.js test suite under the integration folder here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/tree/master/test
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 06:21:23 GMT):<br/>
@kletkeman  Thanks for detailed explanation. I understand now. just curious so deploy command is no longer valid in V1. We should install and then instantiate Correct?

@nhrishi yes, you need to have a channel created, then install the smart contract chaincode on the peers that you want on that channel, and finally instantiate the chaincode. Having peers join the channel might actually be a separate function ... you can check that by looking over how the e2e tests work ...

</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 16:28:52 GMT):<br/>
no. of chaincode can be installed on peer should be mainy affected by max no. of file in single directory i think
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 16:30:02 GMT):<br/>
For how many chaincode can be instantiated on one channel? I think no answer until we have someone really test it...

But in what use case will we instantiate so many chaincode on same channel
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 16:38:17 GMT):<br/>
@DannyWong There are use cases being discussed where a new channel will be made for every shipment in a large system. Right now, channels look like the best way to protect anonymity of a shipment from spying eyes. However, using a single channel with ACLs may also work well. Each incurs management overhead, but channels mean no extra code in chaincode. Might be a big difference and thus might make many channels the preference in some scenarios.

hi everybody, i'm working on developing a java application that gives its users the ability to do financial transactions. i'm wondering if there will be communication between the different peers of my network. i mean, for example, in case of sending an amount from an account to another, and each account belongs to one user which itself belongs to a peer. so want to know how this communication behind this transaction is going to be established .

<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 13:25:46 GMT):<br/>
@DannyWong @Ying Channels are how data can be separated in such a way that only specific participants ever have access. However, channels are replicated in full across all participating peers, both the blockchain portion and the world state portion. There are no shards (and should not be by definition, unless a peer itself is split to enable higher speed r/w someday), so these copies are always complete. I hope that helps.
</p>
<p><strong>Ying</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 13:30:01 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=EY4DzbQHKfcfhYXbX) @kletkeman  thanks for the info. My concern is data sacalability rather than complete, thus using chaincodes as partition like sql
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 13:35:22 GMT):<br/>
@ying Since you have only one peer and one database, the best you can probably do is to make the database itself scale up. I'm not sure if a remote database is supported, but it can probably be incorporated, in which case you do not need to artificially scale your chaincodes for data scaling alone. On the other hand, the concept of channels offers the opportunity to scale, since they can be processed in parallel. I.e. you must flow control any conflicting writes on the same channel, as you cannot have transactions touch the same keys inside one block. But if you manage to separate the data by channels, you can process the writes in parallel with impunity. And of course you have instantiated the chaincode on each channel separately, so you are in effect using chaincodes to partition data (although the channel is what effects the partitioning). I hope that helps.
</p>
<p><strong>Ying</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 13:48:07 GMT):<br/>
[ ] (https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=zv2Df8py6MAxm7Htb) @kletkeman your suggestion of scaling db is a good way, I think. Considering my needs of querying the chains history, I still have to use multiple chaincodes (in one channel), each for a piece of states. Currently multiple channels are not suitable for my case. Anyway, appreciation for your discussion.😀
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 13:49:47 GMT):<br/>
@ying Multiple contracts on a single channel can also be used. The r/w sets cannot conflict across chaincodes, but you may have quite a lot of chaincode to chaincode traffic and do remember that each runs in a separate container and communicates with gRPC. Good luck.

<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 18:34:37 GMT):<br/>
@MrMoneyChanger Are you using the table API? I eschewed that from the getgo as I was told that it was implemented on top of the existing K:V API, and I prefer the flexibility of JSON objects anyway. Fabric v1 has gotten rid of tables and gone with JSON objects as well for state and a database option that supports SQL like querying. I would recommend you not fool around with tables as your code has no future.
</p>
<p><strong>MrMoneyChanger</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 18:35:29 GMT):<br/>

@MrMoneyChanger These lines seem to imply that the fix was never applied:

And they are fixes in the shim that you cannot get around in chaincode.

This might be a stupid question, but is the key/value store local to each chaincode or is it universal for all chaincodes deployed on the channel?
</p>
<p><strong>ecn</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 07:07:06 GMT):<br/>
@akashmar I think you can read the key/value from another chaincode but not update it (yet) : "State partitioning. Keys in the KVS can be recognized from their name to belong to a particular chaincode, in the sense that only transaction of a certain chaincode may modify the keys belonging to this chaincode. In principle, any chaincode can read the keys belonging to other chaincodes.

@ecn I'm not sure I understand. Does that mean I can use key1 with chaincode1 and chaincode2?
</p>
<p><strong>ecn</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 13:49:51 GMT):<br/>
The chaincodes should be in the same channel you will probably have to provide the chaincode ID with the key to get the data

<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 14:06:42 GMT):<br/>
@ecn the chaincodes will be in the same channel. I'm just trying to avoid creating composite keys, for example, assetType1.id1 vs assetType2.id1
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 14:06:59 GMT):<br/>
or is that the normal procedure when managing multiple assets?
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 14:14:10 GMT):<br/>
multiple types of assets that is
</p>
<p><strong>ecn</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 14:20:43 GMT):<br/>
@akashmar I wouldn't be able to answer of how to do it the right way, I don't have enough expertise sorry.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 14:48:50 GMT):<br/>
@akashmar I am not using the new composite key APIs, but my platform has used composite keys very effectively for months. I consider composite keys to be the secret behind "smart" smart contracts. For example, I use a designated 3 letter code to define the asset class in world state, and this prefaces the asset's key. So I have implemented "read all assets by class" as one example of why this is so interesting. It obviously uses iterators, but I also allow a simple filter to be passed in so that you can further restrict results (I store JSON objects as state so you can send qualified paths and values to restrict the result set). I assume that this pattern has been common since the stub has now codified it in the composite key APIs.
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 14:51:19 GMT):<br/>
@kletkeman I wasn't aware of a composite key API. Do you have a link? I was just trying to understand how to manage keys across chaincodes on the same channel. I assumed that the keys are unique across the channel
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 14:54:11 GMT):<br/>
@akashmar in v0.6, keys were unique by chaincode. I am not certain that this has changed, but perhaps someone can point out where the partitioning of world state ends (channel? contract instance?). Regarding the APIs, these are what I am talking about ...

	// Given a list of attributes, CreateCompositeKey function combines these attributes
	// to form a composite key. The objectType and attributes are expected to have only
	// valid utf8 strings and should not contain U+0000 (nil byte) and U+10FFFF (biggest and unallocated code point)
	CreateCompositeKey(objectType string, attributes []string) (string, error)

	// Given a composite key, SplitCompositeKey function splits the key into attributes
	// on which the composite key was formed.
	SplitCompositeKey(compositeKey string) (string, []string, error)

And they can be found

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 18:11:15 GMT):<br/>
it turns out that I can no longer install chaincode on vagrant
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 18:12:32 GMT):<br/>
the latest code (not sure when that actually came in) check on the file mode and will reject anything that "looks suspect"
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 18:13:07 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately vagrant has this unfortunate habit of exposing all windows files as 777
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 18:13:21 GMT):<br/>
so the chaincode fails the filemode test and gets rejected

@rahulhegde you configure the CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL when you create the peer. It's an environment variable you can provide in the docker-compose script. Valid values are CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO, DEBUG

@rahulhegde  i don't think that's possible for any application. You can change the value of the environment variable and then restarted the peer

I'm having troubles understanding how chaincodes are envisioned to be made available to all peers in a production scenario. As I see it, chaincodes are essentially separate processes that communicate with peers via a messaging protocol built around GRPC. When a chaincode is invoked, each peer sends a message to the correct chaincode process with the executed transaction, which responds, if successful, with a state delta that is later applied to the key/value store (or other data structure) maintained by the peer. If I host a HF cluster, am I expected to run one chaincode process for each combination of chaincode/peer to ensure redundancy? Do I have to manually set up all chaincode processes, in the same way I do it when I develop my chaincode?

@mastersingh24 Thank you for your reply. I've been away for Easter celebrations anyway. I came back to the office today. So, if I understood it correctly, peers are able to themselves create and start containers containing chaincode processes. Part of creating the containers, I assume, is compiling the chaincode Go/Java program into something that can be executed. Then, how is the chaincode program code, the actual source files, expected to be made available to each peer? Is distribution of source files at all part of the HF application, or are source files assumed to be distributed some other way? The example you refer to uses a chaincode that is available locally on in peer containers.

You can send when invoking chaincode transient data in the proposal.  Does anyone know if the chaincode can access this and if so have an example GO chaincode that shows how to do this ?

i have gone through examples on asset management. is it possible to model the same using UTXO i.e i wish to know the current state of asset along with its previous state. The current state should be the result of all the transfers that happen across various users rather than storing the same in a table or a state variable(the same that happens with bitcoin). 
is it possible write such a chaincode

@akshay111meher I'm not a developer on the project. That being said, Hyperledger Fabric is not a UTXO blockchain. Rather, each state-changing transaction is (usually) an invocation of a so-called chaincode method. Such methods are defined as part of a chaincode application (or smart contract). Accepted chaincode invocations are accepted into the blockchain, and change the global "state" data structure associated with the blockchain. The "state" is configurable, but would typically be a key/value store. If you want transactions to both contain consumed previous state and a declaration of intent, such as in the case of Bitcoin, you just have to write your chaincode program in a way that forces that behaviour.
</p>
<p><strong>epal</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 12:49:42 GMT):<br/>
You could regard Bitcoin as an instance of Hyperledger Fabric (or actually, more accurately, Ethereum, as it shares more uncertainty properties due to its more similar consensus algorithm) with only a single chaincode, which deals with only transfer of money.
</p>
<p><strong>epal</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 12:56:18 GMT):<br/>
There might be one issue with the current chaincode API, however. Chaincodes cannot access the actual blockchain, only the "state" data structure. You can see the API available to chaincodes here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go In particular, an instance of the ChaincodeStubInterface interface is provided whenever a chaincode is invoked, and is what allows the chaincode to query or modify the current "state".
</p>
<p><strong>epal</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 12:57:10 GMT):<br/>
You could still, however, simulate it by writing all blockchain transactions to the "state". I'm not sure about how efficient that would be, however.

steps followed:
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sat, 22 Apr 2017 14:46:36 GMT):<br/>
``````Step 1: Create new channel with TX and BLOCK files (as per the getting started on fabric site)
Step 2: Create a new channel at the start up by pasing the channel name
	CHANNEL_NAME=aj005 docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yaml up -d
Step 3: Create a new network of peers using docker-compose.yaml
	this creates 4 Peers Peer 0, Peer 1 for (ORG0) and Peer 2 and Peer 3 (for ORG1)
	1 Orderer
	4 Couch DB State DBs
	1 Fabric CA
	1 Cli
Step 4: All start up fine and I login to CLI (as per the fabric site)
Step 5: Create channels again within CLI (by passing peer0 to peer3) - All looks fine.
Step 6: Join the channels - all is fine here too (no errors)
Step 7: Deploy the chaincode - all fine here too (no errors)
Step 8: Initialize the chain code - here is where the things breaks and cannot get hte container up and running.

Hi a question if anybody is aware
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 12:22:36 GMT):<br/>
How to limit a particular PEER to execute a particular method on the SMART contract?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 12:23:16 GMT):<br/>
I mean I have a security setup being done in chaincode that does all the CRUD to the Role Document. I do not want anyone other than peer0 to call this method?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 12:23:32 GMT):<br/>
the method of lets take "Create role"
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 12:27:09 GMT):<br/>
All can execute "queries" no issues there but creating and updated I have to restrict
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 12:27:11 GMT):<br/>
Any ideas?

ok cool.  it'd be great if you can recreate and give steps to solve in JIRA.  At a quick glance, it seemed like you were missing some environment variables that need to accompany your calls; and possibly the chaincode source wasn't mounted in the CLI container (although I expect you didn't overlook that).

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 02 May 2017 11:14:19 GMT):<br/>
@zhangchao while others have tried various debuggers for go, I haven't done that yet myself. A simple way would be to put the peer in `--peer-chaincodedev` mode as described in docs/source/peer-chaincode-devmode.rst... you'll have to do one thing extra ... in the section `Use the chaincode` before you instantiate, also do `peer chaincode instantiate -n mycc -v 0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02`

@muralisr , this doc uses devmode during peer node start, it helps. But I am wondering whether there is a way to debug go cc inside an IDE without any peer, even if a workaround. I like use breakpoint to suspend the code and inpspect the variables

hi, from the docu, chaper 25, I have found the following paragraph "There are generally two ways to develop business contracts: the first way is to code individual contracts into standalone
instances of chaincode; the second way, and probably the more efficient way, is to use chaincode to create decentralized
applications that manage the life cycle of one or multiple types of business contracts, and let end users instantiate
instances of contracts within these applications."

@akshay.lawange V1 has changed the stub interface to chaincode. You will need to clone v1 and build your chaincode against that before deploying into a v1 fabric. Make sure you get your clone aligned with the fabric into which you deploy.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Thu, 04 May 2017 14:23:17 GMT):<br/>
If you are deploying a sample, then make sure that you take the same from a clone of the same version of fabric as that into which you deploy.

I am trying to run/debug a go contract in 1.0-alpha, i used the docker yml from https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/test/docker-compose.yml.
When I run the contract it gives me the message REGISTERED, but i never saw the message READY (however I can see when i dont use docker and run it locally as described in docs/source/peer-chaincode-devmode.rst.)
when i run the instantiate command  peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer:7050 -n mycc1 -v 0 -C ch1
then i my contract chashes and i got the same message as @jaswanth. Should I map some volume? how the contract gets into READY state ?

@muralisr - a question if you might be able to help me with.
A chain-code (chain-code A version 1.0) is installed, instantiated and transactions happened. It has a state DB (couch db where lets take an account "a" has "10" assets)
There is an upgrade that is needed to chain-code (chain-code V2.0) - I call the upgrade command from CLI and it gets upgraded.
question #1 : Would chain-code v2 still have the same State and transaction DB (i.e account "a" still has "10" assets)
question #2: A new docker container is created? if so how this is going to effect the ledger sharing.
Or any one who can answer this - just to clear up some design elements before hand.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:56:05 GMT):<br/>
It seems the older data is stored as part of upgrade as-it-is. So no data loss.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:56:07 GMT):<br/>
It seems the chaincode upgrade keeps the ledger state as-it is and you can keep using older data as-it-is.

@akshay.lawange Ok, I too have found it difficult to work with new chaincode and v1 Fabric. Debug mode worked well for me (but that was a long time ago), but deploying to a channel did not. I apologize, but I don't have any ideas to get you over than hump at this time.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 15:44:40 GMT):<br/>
@albert.lacambra Both communities seem to be making good progress, so you should theoretically be able to make progress in either language. However, our experience was that node was generally the first to update to newer version of Fabric. Not sure that this is true any more, and of course Fabric is maturing all the time, so difference should diminish over the coming months.

If I return in my function and then call my chaincode again (via peer chaincode), then I have the new value... How can I (within the same function) know when the new value is written?

"Then, the peer forwards internally tran-proposal (and possibly tx ) to the part of its (peer’s) logic that endorses
a transaction, referred to as endorsing logic. By default, endorsing logic at a peer accepts the tran-proposal and
simply signs the tran-proposal . However, endorsing logic may interpret arbitrary functionality, to, e.g., interact
with legacy systems with tran-proposal and tx as inputs to reach the decision whether to endorse a transaction
or not."

This is in the documentation latest.
</p>
<p><strong>bercinho</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 11:29:41 GMT):<br/>

@here Do we have a function in the shim to get the user attributes like similar to getUserAffiliates() in 0.6. The key reason for this is to restrict the user to perform only reads or writes based on the Role. Is see that we have them hfc sdk (getAffiliates, getSigningEntity, etc) and i think HFC fabric communicates with the Fabric CA to get the details. Is there any way to restrict the user in the chaincode to perforn only certian operations

@shanthi0547  - not sure how far you got here?  Looks like the containers are up and running?
The cli container just executes a script and then shuts down - so that's probably why you are seeing that error.

You say _The cli container just executes a script and then shuts down_, but the manual/tutorial says that you should be able (and have to!) enter the cli container to execute the commands after that. But this is not possible, given the fact that the cli container exits immediately after it has executed the scripts -- other containers are up and running indeed. Is this an error in the docs? Do we really need the cli container up? If not, what would you suggest to be the following step?

@here  I am using fabric master. I think it's a bug. 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 03:33:44 GMT):<br/>
@zerppen  it seems the orderer can't find the channel 00001, one possible cause is the orderer is set to use `ram` as ledger type, crashed and lost the system ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 03:34:36 GMT):<br/>
try `ORDERER_LEDGER_TYPE=file` (you'll have to recreate the channel)
</p>
<p><strong>zerppen</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 03:36:12 GMT):<br/>
if it is true.why it can query the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>zerppen</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 03:40:15 GMT):<br/>
And I excuted `install`   `instantiate`,logs showed the chaincode existed.So I don't think it's chaincode's fault
</p>
<p><strong>zerppen</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 03:43:58 GMT):<br/>
Maybe endorsers lost the chaincode file but wrote down the chaincode name and path?
</p>
<p><strong>zerppen</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 03:45:45 GMT):<br/>
Because `query`  does not need endorsing. @jimthematrix 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 03:48:52 GMT):<br/>
query only contacts the peers. apparently the channel exists in peers. invoke contacts the peers for endorsement and then sends to the orderer. did the orderer crash after the instantiate and before the invoke?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 03:49:57 GMT):<br/>
(endorsers have the chaincode since your query uses the chaincode which succeeded)

@leonli0811  what error you got?
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:23:50 GMT):<br/>

@leonli0811 what you should do is comment the line in the files `docker-compose.yaml`, `docker-compose-template.yaml` and `docker-compose-no-tls.yaml` out that fires up the `script.sh` script. The line is `command: /bin/bash -c './scripts/script.sh ${CHANNEL_NAME}; ‘` which you will find near the end of the above mentioned files in the `cli` container. 

Then follow the instructions from the _Getting Started_ part line by line. To avoid mistakes copy the whole lot where the doc says “So our command in its entirety would be:” and paste it into the cli container.

@here can we call one chaincode from another..Lets say there is a billing department and accounting department, accounting department can have reference to billing department. Can we have two CC's separate where one cc can query another an get the values. In this case billing and accounting.

@mastersingh24 hi, is there an error in the source code of `marbles_chaincode.go`? After installing it on peer0 I get a couple of error messages when I try to instantiate the chaincode beginning with 

```2017-05-16 13:13:29.885 UTC [chaincode-platform] func1 -> ERRO 001 Failed to generate platform-specific docker build: Error returned from build: 2 "# github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/marbles02
peer0.org1.example.com    | chaincode/input/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/marbles02/marbles_chaincode.go:370: assignment count mismatch: 2 = 3```

But looking at the `marbles_chaincode.go` file I see the same error message in the Visual Studio Code IDE, e.g. lines 370 `queryResponse, err := resultsIterator.Next()`, 428 `responseRange, err := coloredMarbleResultsIterator.Next()`, 538 and 586 show an error `assignment count mismatch: 2 = 3` `

Any idea what could be wrong or am I goofing up again?

@habpygo Majority the errors come because of incorrect environment setup. Once you have that, just follow the marbles structure and you should be okay. Carefully have a look at script.sh in e2e_cli/scripts/ carefully for correct commands and environment variable. Let me know if you rub into any problems.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 10:55:02 GMT):<br/>
@bercinho :

`does the Peer eventually communicate with the CA?` :  No - the peer does not communicate with the fabric-ca (or any CA) at all

`The Peer no longer enrols itself (like it did in 0.6) and currently does not talk to the Fabric CA at all.`: This is correct.  The peer and orderer both support crypto material obtained from the fabric-ca but don't require the use of the fabric-ca (i.e. you can use your own CA, bring your own certs, etc)
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 11:04:45 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 @bercinho its is possible to use the nodesk without to enroll user? or how can I create an enroll certificate and secret for a user without the use of the CA?
</p>
<p><strong>bercinho</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 11:51:39 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is: we need to attach Transaction Certificates to every Transaction Proposal submitted to a Peer by Node.SDK, so I guess you need the mechanism of ECAs & TCAs, which might be provided by the Fabric CA or anyone else implementing the MSP of Fabric. @mastersingh24 is this your understanding as well?

The Java chaincode found in alpha2, although disabled, has feature parity with the golang chaincode, except for the following issues:
• https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3648
• https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3649
• https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3650
• https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3651
• https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3652
• https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3653
• https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3470
• https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3716
• https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1794
• https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3618 (applies to both Java and Go)

These can basically be summarized as:
• Some missing APIs that were added to golang chaincode as part of https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1751 and https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1752.
• A bug regarding composite keys.
• Ability to set logging levels in Java chaincode.

hello, I wanted to study how a new chaincode gets inserted into the syste, basically the init() command, can u share or point the link to the piece of code that executes that?

On V0.6 we could view block info through the *GET* /chain & *GET* /chain/blocks/{Block} rest endpoints, How would we go about this in v1.0

Hi All...when we run "peer chaincode instantiate", does it create a docker container for the chaincode? It does appear to be trying to that...Just trying to confirm....
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 00:31:30 GMT):<br/>
@samarcho if the chaincode is not running, yes, it will create the container.

@kartikeya95  i need to model a pdf as an asset in hyperledger and track the ownership of asset...can i model it as json and give attributes like file path owner etc ?
</p>
<p><strong>kartikeya95</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 12:55:58 GMT):<br/>
@Maha1992 We can store any kind of JSON data on to CouchDB. If you look at the Marbles examples. Assuming you pdf is analogous to a marble. we can give it an owner, have other identifiers including size etc. One draw back i can think of is the 32 character limit to a string.

<p><strong>raghu_vamz</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 14:04:21 GMT):<br/>
@Maha1992 - you need to convert the pdf as bytes from your front end and pass it as string into arguments

@anik, I use Atom but IDE should not matter. You can do a go build on the cli and see if the error still comes.

Hi, 
 
I  am working  a pilot  on  a bank     and  we have  developed a sample  java  chain code.
if  I deploy  on  docker environment  described  on  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html      

the java  chaincode   deployment  gives error:

My  question:  is  the  java   for  chaincodes working  properly  fabric v1?  I  have  seen  in  the slack  that there  are  some  issues  with  java chaincodes and  we  should  wait  till  HLF1 GA  
 
((perhaps  is  possible  to  get  some  working  java  sdk environmnet  before  GA?)))

When I run ./network_setup.sh up <channel> <timeout> couchdb I get the same error messages (Failed connecting to orderer:7050).

Unless you want this peer to be accessible from other orgs, you shouldn't resolve it.

For deploy chaincode I have to exec cli.

Hi All, 

I have a question. In real scenario we expect the smart contract update. So, when we update the smart contract , 

1. Do we have any option to continue with the same previous ledger? Instead of creating a new genesis block, can we continue appending new blocks from where we left with the previous chain code?

2. Or is there any way to copy all the data from previous ledger to this chain code's ledger?

3. Or do we need to store the chain code id's of the previous smart contract to access the previous data stored?

4. Or Do we need to have two smart contract, one for the storage and retrieval of data to and from the ledger ( which is more stable ) 
     And other smart contract which will have the business logic, which can get changed.


Which is the best option. Any help / suggestion really appreciated. Thank you

@PushpalathaHiremath 
1. The chaincode is installed onto a peer and instantiated on each channel on which you want to run the chaincode. And that is theoretically all you have to do to upgrade, although I would imagine that you would primarily need to upversion the chaincode under the same moniker. If my understanding of the solution to the "take over the database" problem that I reported several times on v0.6 is correct, the world state partition is organized by channel/chaincode moniker, and the chaincode respects the versioning.

2. Should not be needed, and would not work on any but the most trivial databases -- I have a v0.6 Bluemix fabric that has 4.8M blocks and an estimated 20M+ transactions, and there is no way that all peers could be paused while they deal with the upgrade time under such a scenario. Under v0.6, we pondered such things, but v1 has obsoleted the need.

3. No. V1 versions chaincode and the ID is set when it is installed / instantiated (one of those two), so the ID does not change.

4. This is something I have pondered, but it really is not necessary any more. Chaincode to chaincode calls are also container to container gRPC calls in user space, and so the performance hit would not be pleasant.

The best option is to read the v1 docs on chaincode and note the ID and version that you assign. Then make a backwards compatible change and redeploy. You should be able to carry on.

hi everyone. i am thinking about how to implements a random method in chaincode. do you have any idea for it? i am worried different peer will generate a different number, how can they perform the same random number together.

I have to include external libraries in my chaincode. Can someone explain how?  I get the following error `cannot find package "gopkg.in/oleiade/reflections.v1" in any of:
/opt/go/src/gopkg.in/oleiade/reflections.v1 (from $GOROOT)
/chaincode/input/src/gopkg.in/oleiade/reflections.v1 (from $GOPATH)

</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:21:41 GMT):<br/>
@nickmelis You are right that, for testing of the chaincode and single peer in debug mode, the REST API is no longer an option. The doc also mentions the CLI if I recall correctly, and that is the way testing is done in v1. The CLI is now in a container, and there is a complex relationship between the container and your own chaincode, which causes difficulties for deployment. There are many examples of how this can be done our there, but none are all that satisfying. The one that looks really promising is the CLI example for the Go SDK. I will be testing it fairly soon and will try to add something to that doc or create an adjunct doc. Time permitting of course ...

Hi,

I am using fabric(1.0.0-alpha) in "dev" mode on a classic TwoOrg topology with 4 peers, 2 CAs, 1 SDK(fabric-sdk-go). When i initiate a transaction(chaincode_example02) to peer1(in Org1), peer1 is able to execute the chaincode but peer2(also in Org1) sees a "No such channel" error -

two questions: (1) can you install chaincode directly from a git repo, or do you have to download the go file locally and point to it? If yes; how do you point to git repo? (2) I know this is a silly question, but does the term 'artifact/artifacts' have any contextual meaning behind it that might help me understand what they are?

I have found that the CLI does not have visibility of chaincode outside of the fabric name space, but I think it should be fairly easy to hack in that visibility (as in expose your own chaincode working directory)

</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Sun, 11 Jun 2017 17:59:24 GMT):<br/>
@kletkeman When I query about any marble stored in a blockchain by calling this function `getHistoryForMarble` the result returned contain transaction id , timestamp and other data. I also want to see merkel hash, previous block number alongside with transaction id and other data. Is there anyway I can get these two extra values?
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Sun, 11 Jun 2017 18:02:20 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid You can get those value in an application using the SDK, not in the chaincode. Applications can look at the chain itself, which is all of the blocks, or at the world state. The chaincode sees only the transaction that it is processing and any world state that it chooses to read and/or write. The chain itself is not in scope as it is a permanent record of the transactions and their results, stored as full read / write sets. A new peer can be brought up by replaying the chain (which in fabric v1 might actually be many channels).
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Sun, 11 Jun 2017 18:04:05 GMT):<br/>
There are articles around I believe that go into some depth around how Hyperledger Fabric might be used to implement a crypto-currency. You may be able to find some of that using Google.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Sun, 11 Jun 2017 18:10:22 GMT):<br/>
@kletkeman Thanks . I will take a look at node sdk. Just one more question. I have done everything using fabric cli like adding peers, deploying custom chaincode etc. Can I connect sdk with cli? or do I need to do everything from scratch using sdk?
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Sun, 11 Jun 2017 18:12:22 GMT):<br/>
The cli has a lot of power, but it is not built on the SDK. The node SDK models the fabric with js objects and gives you access to pretty much everything the fabric can do. The very latest fabric builds also have a working balance-transfer application I am told, and it shows how most of the key operations can be done in js.

<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Sun, 11 Jun 2017 18:15:17 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=ZWqqMTpB4dCRP9GDK) @nickmelis I used to get this error if I create a channel and do not join / send the genesis block to all the peers in the channel.  So the MSP map in fabric would be empty and when you run any other chaincode commands like instantiate a chaincode, i would get this error.

Hi, Let's say there are 2 peers each belongs to 2 different organizations.  I see we need to install the chaincode on all the 4 peers. DO we also need to instantiate explicitly on 4 peers? or we should just instantiate on Anchor peers? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 11:36:38 GMT):<br/>
only on some peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 11:36:43 GMT):<br/>
not necessarily on anchor
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 11:37:55 GMT):<br/>
so do we have to instantiate on one peer of Org1 and one peer of Org2 in order to satisfy endorsement policy?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 11:39:10 GMT):<br/>
And what are factors to be considered ..just for example.

First character of the key [account00000000] contains a null character which is not allowed
Got the error because I PutState use the stub.CreateCompositeKey("ACCOUNT~", []string{"00001302"}) and GetStateByRange  use stub.CreateCompositeKey(indexName, []string{"00000000"})   stub.CreateCompositeKey(indexName, []string{"99999999"})

@here - can somebody provide me more info on the below item?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:24:56 GMT):<br/>
The way we do installation in the production systems for peers is we share the source code with the partners and ask them to deploy it on their nodes.
Once installed and instantiated - then all is fine.
However if some crook client - changes the source could does the install and instantiate - he can put wrong transactions too - right?
Does the chaincode deployment check for the "hash" of the code base too?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:25:23 GMT):<br/>
good question
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:25:32 GMT):<br/>
the hash of the chaincode is saved on the channel
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:26:22 GMT):<br/>
Aha - so if somebody tries to change the code then this would mismatch and would reject at the "install" stage itself. Right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:27:14 GMT):<br/>
no. the install would work. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:27:22 GMT):<br/>
but when the container would launch
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:27:27 GMT):<br/>
it will check the hash of the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:27:30 GMT):<br/>
and the hash of the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:27:34 GMT):<br/>
and then would fail to launch
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:28:22 GMT):<br/>
Ok - makes perfect sense. thanks @yacovm

Is it possible to achieve property level privacy in Fabric 1.0. For example: If I have a chaincode representing a tenancy contract. I want only tenant & lessor to see all the details, banks to see only payment terms and actual owner to see everything except payment terms. How can I achieve this in Fabric 1.0. If I use channels then I will need to deploy two different contracts and the total number of channels I can create is limited to the network performance. Channels are not meant to be used to achieve property level privacy. I don't want to do it off-chain and also don't want to do on-chain encryption as I cannot apply smart operations on it. What is the best solution for achieve this?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 11:39:58 GMT):<br/>
@luckydogchina  - Do you just want to use Fabric or do you want to actually contribute to the core Fabric itself?   It looks like you are trying to build Fabric from source and then run it?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 11:40:43 GMT):<br/>
It also looks like you likely tried to run `go build` for the peer package which is likely causing the problem
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 11:41:04 GMT):<br/>
If you want to build the peer binary, you should run `make peer`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 17 Jun 2017 00:19:16 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 @luckydogchina running `go build` instead of `make peer` or `make native` would cause the crash
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 17 Jun 2017 00:23:25 GMT):<br/>
`chaincode=cscc,version=` - the system chaincode code cscc needs fabric version that's built by make peer

@gauravgiri  - unless you plan on trying to implement some very custom record-level encryption (which would basically be done at the application / chaincode layer), the easiest thing is to simply encrypt the file system

@msoumeit: I think there is no constraint to access external resources from chaincode as its not inside any sandboxed secure VMs unlike EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machines) but the onus of keeping it deterministic then is on yourself.
</p>
<p><strong>msoumeit</strong> (Mon, 19 Jun 2017 17:21:09 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, @praveennagpal .I am working on a situation where I need to capture a trade in the blockchain, but the price would depend on market price which changes within milliseconds. That could result in a different hash for the same trade across peers. How can I handle that?
</p>
<p><strong>praveennagpal</strong> (Mon, 19 Jun 2017 17:23:53 GMT):<br/>
I guess, you would need to built your own set of oracle service which all peers can trust. This service can keep a record of all the market prices based on the agreed frequency of polling from the external source. Asking all peers to fetch data individually will lead to mismatch.

It would be great if someone could give an answer to this question: What do I have to do to be able to use external libraries in chaincode? Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>gauravgiri</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 11:25:21 GMT):<br/>
@mariogemoll @praveennagpal @msoumeit : Another option is that the market price is computed/inferred by the client web application by invoking the external service, then later this client web application can supply the market price as one of the chaincode function arguments.

yep

<p><strong>mariogemoll</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 17:15:13 GMT):<br/>
OK I'll try that. Thanks! BTW it seemed strange to me that this functionality (finding out the identity of the sender of an invoke message) is not "baked in". Coming from Ethereum that's a fundamental piece of functionality (for all sorts of permissioning). Or maybe I'm missing something and I should not do that in general because of conceptual reasons?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 18:03:46 GMT):<br/>
So I agree that we should actually add some better utilities to extract the "creator / sender" of the message
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 18:04:12 GMT):<br/>
The tricky part is that the system is built to support other types of identity beyond X509 certificates
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 18:04:31 GMT):<br/>
BUT - we should add some helper functions to parse things out for the common cases

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=QcA6wRYtSBXzTabAd) @durantto you need to install libtool-ltdl-devel for centos

<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 19:18:05 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 does chaincode support authorization on transactions? for example, if the chaincode receives a transaction changing a property of Org1's in the ledger, is there a way to verify within chaincode if the issuer of the transaction actually belongs to Org1?
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 01:01:04 GMT):<br/>
@akashmar The following stub function gets you the identity of the transaction creator:

 	// GetCreator returns `SignatureHeader.Creator` (e.g. an identity)
	// of the `SignedProposal`. This is the identity of the agent (or user)
	// submitting the transaction.
	GetCreator() ([]byte, error)

The creator is defined thus:

// Creator of the message, specified as a certificate chain

Which I believe means that you would look inside the certificate (always an ecert on fabric v1) to find the ORG and use for your RBAC implementation. You would return false + "unauthorized" if the ORGs don't match.

Hi,can I use already buildable go file for installing on peer? 
now it looks like I must write path to folder with go files. Thanks

@kletkeman @mastersingh24 I'm currently using Java chaincode (I know it's not supported fully yet) and the GetCreator method is not implemented there yet. I'll just have to make the changes myself but good to know there's way to implement that functionality within the chaincode. Thanks!

@akashmar Go is the native language used in the fabric and I consider it a good personal investment to learn that language and use it for development. The Go SDK will likely be very good as well once it catches up to the node SDK (if it hasn't already). I have executed tens of millions of Go based transactions on v0.6 in a 5 million block chain and the performance and stability are superb. The other viable alternative is is to use Hyperledger Composer and take advantage of their native ACL language.

@kletkeman I started working on the chaincode before Java was disabled in beta. I'd have to go back and rewrite what I have in Go. I don't really have the time. Besides, that feature I was asking about would just be "nice-to-have" for the prototype I'm building.
</p>
<p><strong>kletkeman</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:28:39 GMT):<br/>
@akashmar Fair enough. My guess is that you will have enough trouble and limitations with Java based chaincode that the time saved by staying with Java chaincode will be lost elsewhere. Anyway, best of luck.

hi all, i wrote my chaincode to store a struct, but when i get the struct, i got nothing. any one has idea for it?
1. type SimpleChaincode struct
2. var center SimpleChaincode
3. binary.Write(&buf, binary.LittleEndian, center)
stub.PutState("center", buf.Bytes())
4. result, _ := stub.GetState("center")
return shim.Success(result)
5. the payload is empty

Could you help me for for this

"I am building sample applications, where user must have to register for login. So for this registration form contain username & password as well, so I have to store this basic details in chain code OR into database ( mongodb, mysql etc). "? which is best ways.?

<p><strong>JonathanTan</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 08:15:47 GMT):<br/>
Hi @alfa , there's actually two concepts for user management, 1) To use the fabric enrollment ids and secrets to identity users or 2) abstract the user model to to chaincode by creating a user datastore in the blockchain datastore
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanTan</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 08:17:24 GMT):<br/>
1) has limitations that the users can only access the network via that client/peer ; could be a more secure model/design
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanTan</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 08:17:38 GMT):<br/>
2) is how Fabric composer is handling users
</p>
<p><strong>alfa</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 08:30:26 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=2iHfEdLhu4XZ2LNby) @JonathanTan : so here enrollmentids and secrets works as username and password.?

Could you share any ref. links or example to understand this better

Hey folks, When writing chaincode apps, where do we place our dependencies so the chaincode can properly be installed and instantiated on a peer node? For example, I have a library that I'd like my chaincode to use and I'm getting the following error when installing the chaincode:
```
Error: Error getting chaincode code chaincode: Error getting chaincode package bytes: Error obtaining dependencies for ***.com/rp/cclib: go list: failed with error: &quot;exit status 1&quot;

@jtsiros (1) what level of fabric are you using and (2) are you doing install & instantiate from a docker container or from your fabric/ download env
</p>
<p><strong>jtsiros</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 20:11:28 GMT):<br/>

there was a bug that was fixed recently in this area - I'm trying if it was fixed in beta... almost sure it wasn't. Would you mind trying the latest rc1 builds ?

<p><strong>jtsiros</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 20:26:07 GMT):<br/>
sure I'll try that

<p><strong>jtsiros</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 20:27:09 GMT):<br/>
ok, i've pulled commit id `d58af569b76df644bd931c846d946435eaafa784` on fabric-examples. That OK?
</p>
<p><strong>jtsiros</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 20:27:35 GMT):<br/>
that's the latest on the master branch
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 20:27:50 GMT):<br/>
you need the right fabric/ repo too
</p>
<p><strong>jtsiros</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 20:28:42 GMT):<br/>
right now the fabric repo only has 1.0.0-beta tagged under the releases section
</p>
<p><strong>jtsiros</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 20:29:18 GMT):<br/>
ok, i'll check out RC1
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 20:29:35 GMT):<br/>
yes please
</p>
<p><strong>jtsiros</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 21:04:47 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr upgrading to fabric 1.0.0-rc1 and commit id `d58af569b76df644bd931c846d946435eaafa784` for fabric-examples seemed to fix the instantiation errors I was getting

very good.. thanks for checking it out !

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 14:48:00 GMT):<br/>
hey all, i know we can use `stub.GetCreator()` to get the identity of the user interacting with the chaincode, but how would we go about accessing the attributes they were registered with?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 14:58:15 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean attributes?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 15:01:13 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm so when we register users via the ca we have the option to pass attrs, so the registered user looks something like:

```
{
      enrollmentID: 'User1',
      role: 'client',
      attrs: [
        { name:'region', value:'US'},
        { name:'email', value:'user1@email.com'}
      ]
    }
```

if I understand `stub.GetCreator()` properly it means we can identify that the user is `User1`, but can we access those attrs?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 15:02:09 GMT):<br/>
do you have a certificate you got from fabric-CA?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 15:02:17 GMT):<br/>
if you do then open it with `openssl`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 15:02:29 GMT):<br/>
and all you can get from `stub.GetCreator()` is what is in there
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 15:04:09 GMT):<br/>
awesome, thank you

How do you install Go chaincode that requires packages not included in the build container?  Do all the packages needed to be included in the source directory?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 29 Jun 2017 17:58:28 GMT):<br/>
For example, let's say my chaincode needs to use mgo
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 29 Jun 2017 18:53:25 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal Just make sure you can build the chaincode locally and you should be good to go. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 29 Jun 2017 18:57:56 GMT):<br/>
At least that's true for installing via CLI. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 29 Jun 2017 18:57:56 GMT):<br/>
At least that's true for installing via CLI. Auto-vendoring of external packages hasn't been implemented yet in the SDKs.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 29 Jun 2017 21:29:16 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti auto-vendoring?  Not sure how building locally helps since installing the chaincode causes it to be built in the ccenv container, at least as far as I know
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 29 Jun 2017 22:03:43 GMT):<br/>
The fabric platform logic (at least for Go) will automatically vendor any external packages it needs, as long as they are available on the system that is performing the install. Have you tried it out locally and seen a problem or are you just wondering if this scenario has been considered?
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 29 Jun 2017 22:03:43 GMT):<br/>
The fabric platform logic (at least for Go) will automatically vendor any external packages it needs, as long as they are available on the system that is performing the install.

Hi. How do I import another deployed chaincode? just import "chaincodename" or I requires a path?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:39:14 GMT):<br/>
@SethiSaab the ledger in fabric cannot be connected to active directory or database (also you may find more help on the  "fabric-ledger" channel for ledger specific questions)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:41:56 GMT):<br/>
@rfrabasile not sure what you mean by "deployed chaincode" ...there is "install" and "instantiate" in fabric 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:42:15 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr  i meant install
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:43:14 GMT):<br/>
o
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:43:14 GMT):<br/>
ok... where you want to import that installed chaincode ?
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:44:09 GMT):<br/>
in another installed chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:47:00 GMT):<br/>
in order not to repeat code
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:48:04 GMT):<br/>
ok. So for code reuse.... there's no way to refer to an installed chaincode from another 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:49:10 GMT):<br/>
you can 'call" a chaincode from another chaincode after instantiation but doing that just for code reuse would not be recommended
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:50:41 GMT):<br/>
i'd think of the code as a more development artefact  where you can have two chaincodes using common packages
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:51:51 GMT):<br/>
install will package them separately for two chaincodes but there will be shared code in the development space
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:59:30 GMT):<br/>
will do, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 20:04:25 GMT):<br/>
i have another question regarding how to create indexes and use them for rich queries
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 20:05:21 GMT):<br/>
#Insert the object in the DB
stub.PutState("name", ObjectInBytes)

#etc

#for the index
indexName := "field1~field2"
dataNameIndexKey, err := stub.CreateCompositeKey(indexName, []string{dataFromField1, dataFromField2})
value := []byte{0x00}
stub.PutState(dataNameIndexKey, value)

I took this from the marbles example, what it does is create another entry in the couchDB that has the name of the fields but does it help in the rich queries or I'm just duplicating data.

</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 20:05:57 GMT):<br/>
not duplicating but creating another useless entry

the log comes from the peer, not the chaincode, it never makes it to the chaincode

Hi I have been trying unit test particular chaincode functions which require me to create a new instance of a struct that belongs to another chaincode using something like 
ccEx2 := new(ex02.SimpleChaincode)
and importing
ex02 "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02"
as shown in the example of chaincode_example05_test.go

But when I try to execute the test the error becomes
chaincode_example05_test.go:23:2: import "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02" is a program, not an importable package

Can anyone share some pointers as to where the problem may be?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 01 Jul 2017 12:02:40 GMT):<br/>
@ShermanHLee  - you can't import a package with a main function into a program.  You can only import it into a test program

Hi All, 

Can anyone suggest me when do we need more than one smart contract? What is the recommended way to architect the smart contracts?

We can include all the business logic under only one smart contract. When and why we want to split the logic into more than one smart contract? Can anyone help me understand?

So, if I'd like to limit the use of a chaincode function only for certain MSP's - how can I achieve that? Should I split the chaincode into multiple parts, even though they are working on the same asset? Or should I use identity data available in stub and validate the user before I let it perform that operation? (NOTE: I cannot use fabric-composer now)

Hi, Quick question. If I install and instantiate a chaincode on 4 peers (2 for Org A and 2 for Org B), do I have to explicitly invoke a transaction on all the 4 peers always? or If as a user of OrgA, I only invoke on the 2 peers of OrgA, Will a smart contract state on the OrgB get updated post endorsements and commitment of the transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 19:56:30 GMT):<br/>
[You can't split the chaincode into multiple chaincodes since as each chaincode has its own namespace so the best option would be to extract identity info within your chaincode function(s).  You can get the identity of the client who submitted the transaction using the GetCreator() method on the stub](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=4EutJppLGyTTTTJ68) @rmohta

@nhrishi given  OrgA and OrgB are in the channel (a hidden assumption in the question) all peers in the channel will get updated on successful proposal followed by a successful commit on the peers. Which orgs you send the proposal too depends on the endorsement policy applied at commit time

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 10:46:21 GMT):<br/>
@snorlaxative  -

https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#HistoryQueryIteratorInterface
https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult#KeyModification

So you can do something like this:

```
queryResults, err := stub.GetHistoryForKey("mykey")
for queryResults.HasNext() {
    queryResult, err := queryResults.Next()
    value := queryResult.GetValue()
}
```
(of course you'd add code to handle err)

Please correct me if I am wrong. If PutState writes a key with its value (in JSON format, made from a structure), then when using GetState, the output would also be in json format and we would need to unmarshal it and to access the attributes saved in the structure, we would use Struct_name.Attribute_name.

Can someone explain what this `(t *SimpleAsset)` is? I am new to Go, and what is more, is the concept of pointers is new to me. I think that `(t *SimpleAsset)` is a pointer receiver to this:
```
// SimpleAsset implements a simple chaincode to manage an asset

@swangbj  - Are you having an issue?  It has been used by many folks - although more often people use `peer chaincode install -p ...` which does the packaging under the covers as well

You can of course replace mycc and 1.0 with your own name and version

You may also need to set the following environment variables as well:

CORE_PEER_ADDRESS
CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID
CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH

similar to https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/first-network/scripts/script.sh#L34
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 08:55:39 GMT):<br/>
The other option is to just do everything via the install command and skip the package command

+1 for @ssaddem again. In 0.6.5 we could do `stub.ReadCertAttribute("role")` and get the roles the registered was registered with. In 1.0.0 we can do `stub.GetCreator()` but that cert only includes the name of the person, not the roles. 

Do we have a way of achieving the same functionality of `stub.ReadCertAttribute` in 1.0.0?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=d7SrPT9vtLPJ6t4tS) @JarvisJang the `init` function is used during instantiating chaincode, so I think  that it can not be called one more times.

This may slightly depend on the Fabric version, but in general you should either make sure that all the dependencies are present on GOPATH of the machine calling install (if using CLI) or properly vendor all the depednecies (may be excluding shim), e.g. using govendor.

working with RC1 in an environment similar to what is described here. 

https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4ade.html

Question: If I make a change to the code, what is the fastest way to re-deploy the chaincode to re-test? Do I have to bring down the network, start up the chaincode again, install, instantiate, and invoke? or is there a better way?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:56:16 GMT):<br/>
So you have the transient field in the proposal which isn't sent into the orderer 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:56:26 GMT):<br/>
you can send in that transient field an encryption key
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:56:32 GMT):<br/>
(for example)

@mariogemoll My IoT Contract Platform uses a JSON Schema 4.0 schema for the payloads and includes it in the contract by processing it into a string in a golang file. You can do this by calling a processor from a "go generate" comment. See the main file in my container sample (note -- not yet formally ported to v1 fabrics) : https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/blockchain-samples/tree/master/contracts/platform/iotcontractcontainersample

<p><strong>akshay.lawange</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 12:53:31 GMT):<br/>
@ssaddem does it cover rich queries? because if u see one of the rich query functions in marbles02 example, they are not using this function instead they are using GetQueryResult().

</p>
<p><strong>ssaddem</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:14:40 GMT):<br/>
@akshay.lawange you have to work with couchdb to query with GetQueryResult()
with GetQueryResult() you can invoke a mongodb query (nosql) but i don't think that support map reduce 
</p>
<p><strong>ssaddem</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:16:14 GMT):<br/>
add to your env var :

Hi everyone, i'm trying to figure out how to receive response from GetTxTimestamp(), but can't handle this after hours trying so.... This method returns a Timestamp, but i really do not understand what type should i use for it. 
Here is my struct definition: 
```
type DemandeHistory struct {
	Transaction_id  string                 `json:"transaction_id"`
	Timestamp       timestamp.Timestamp    `json:"timestamp"`
	User_id         string                 `json:"user_id"`
	Days_sent       int                    `json:"days_sent"`
	Validated       bool                   `json:"validated"`
}

```

I try to send it to this variable : timestamp, _ := APIstub.GetTxTimestamp(), but i always receive an error saying: "undefined: timestamp in timestamp.Timestamp" any ideas ?
</p>
<p><strong>koloisator</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:02:18 GMT):<br/>
Or, maybe someone could just simply explain clearly how to ose this function, as it is supposed to send 2 variables, a timestamp, and error .... I really do not understand how to store the rendered timestamp ....
</p>
<p><strong>koloisator</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:02:57 GMT):<br/>
the interface of the GetTxTimestamp is like so: GetTxTimestamp() (*timestamp.Timestamp, error)

 Hi, I'm using Fabric rc1. Have3 chaincodes (A, B & C) instantiated on one channel. First, client invokes chaincode A. The Invoke function in Chaincode A queries some data from chaincode B & then C. And then Chaincode A invokes the chaincode B. But while chaincode B is processing the invoke function, the docker container of chaincode B is crashing with error --  ERROR : "panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x20 pc=0x4095b9]". Did anyone experience this issue before and any idea/help?

@nhrishi if you add env var CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true and CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug to `peer` containers, you might get more information on the crash (hoping for a stack trace from the chaincode)

@cristianvanderweij the actual instantiation is probably taking longer than 45 seconds. Mine takes about a minute to complete. You can try increasing the timeout and see if that helps
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 20:38:50 GMT):<br/>
@JarvisJang the examples on github are very simple currency chaincodes. You're basically assigning a number value to a key (the person's name or id) and storing it in the ledger.

@cristianvanderweij  can you try the question in fabric-sdk-node please ?
</p>
<p><strong>cristianvanderweij</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 09:52:09 GMT):<br/>
@akashmar thx for you reply! Yes I have put the timeout to 60000 still sometimes I get a timeout error. Maybe it has to do with the size of the smart contract and computer performance
</p>
<p><strong>cristianvanderweij</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 09:55:16 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr thx I put it at fabric-sdk-node

<p><strong>FollowingGhosts</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 10:29:04 GMT):<br/>
is there any documentation re: unit testing chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>ssaddem</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 11:06:05 GMT):<br/>
@cristianvanderweij it's a time after a while you can verify your chaincode is up with docker ps
so if you re-execute instantiate after it will works fine
</p>
<p><strong>ssaddem</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 11:10:48 GMT):<br/>
@FollowingGhosts i don't know but there is an example
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02/chaincode_example02_test.go
if you are not familiar with golang you can search for golang unit test
</p>
<p><strong>ssaddem</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 11:10:48 GMT):<br/>
@FollowingGhosts i don't know but there is a severals examples in fabric e.g

I noticed that this command you mention is part of documentation for 1.0-beta but has since been removed: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.0-beta/cc-packaging-and-signing.html
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:37:27 GMT):<br/>
@gbolo the "Usage" and "Flags" is misleading ... but the main error is `Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = proto: bad wiretype for field peer.ChaincodeSpec.Type: got wiretype 2, want 0`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:37:54 GMT):<br/>
which makes me think /data/channel-artifacts/ex02_v1.0.out somehow not right
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:38:01 GMT):<br/>
is there anything from the peer log ?

@gbolo I'm not sure.. the signed package is not currently in general (for instance SDKs use the standard mechanism).

@muralisr is this enough information for a ticket? or is it possible I am doing something wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 16:29:23 GMT):<br/>
@gbolo I don't see any error on the peer logs ... so not sure where the problem is. Do open a JIRA and we'll go from there. But again, the signed package is not yet by the system (it was meant to be used in future)
</p>
<p><strong>gbolo</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 16:36:18 GMT):<br/>
oh ok then in that case perhaps i should wait for v1.01
</p>
<p><strong>gbolo</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 16:36:24 GMT):<br/>
because non-signed works
</p>
<p><strong>gbolo</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 16:37:43 GMT):<br/>
I guess it's just odd that there is no error in the logs. But to be fair the docs dont describe how to deploy a signed package, only how to make one
</p>
<p><strong>gbolo</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 16:37:49 GMT):<br/>
so perhaps this is a known issue

Hello, I'm trying to create and listen to events from chaincode in the node sdk. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to accomplish this? I was looking at the EventHub class in the documentation, but there aren't specifics on how to implement in node. Has anyone done something like this before?

@ashahn in the balance transfer example there is example code that contains a helper function called `newRemotes`, this helps you set up eventhubs. once you connect your peers to them, you need to register a functions (for events and errors) for the block

@akdj you'll need to use the `encoding/json` package and use `json.Unmarshal`

jsonVal, err = json.Unmarshal(payload)

The Hyperledger Fabric Model (http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fabric_model.html#privacy-through-channels) describes privacy via channels and goes on to suggest that values can be encrypted by the chaincode.  How is this done in practice?  Where would the encryption key come from?

Hi, is it possible to create a queue structure on the chain code which persists even after the invoke function is done, so that the next invoke can make use of the queue
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 02:21:34 GMT):<br/>
@here 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 02:55:12 GMT):<br/>
@wy: each chaincode instance has its own isolated persistence layer...you can put whatever you want inside, including a queue structure
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 02:56:20 GMT):<br/>
the one thing to keep in mind is that chaincode acts like an implicit transaction...any mutations you make within an invoke will be either all committed or all rolled back...the one main rub is that the transaction _may_ abort out from under you if consensus is not reached
</p>

<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 02:59:59 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=ke6Wyu593aWj82BLg) @greg.haskins In that case, where should the queue be defined? within the invoke function itself? Will other peers with access to the channel be able to see the same queue?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:00:43 GMT):<br/>
so, say you have a chaincode X, and you create an instance Y on channel Z
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:00:54 GMT):<br/>
each peer that is part of channel Z will be running a copy of Y
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:01:03 GMT):<br/>
(generally speaking)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:01:51 GMT):<br/>
each copy of Y presumably has the same local state, and an invoke targetting instance Y is executed by each of the replicas
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:02:19 GMT):<br/>
so, depending on how you define "peers with access to the channel", yes or no
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:02:37 GMT):<br/>
the right way to frame it is: all instances of Y have access to the queue, yes
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:03:18 GMT):<br/>
but other chaincode instances, even those in the same channel Z, do not have access to it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:03:21 GMT):<br/>
it is private to Y
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:03:44 GMT):<br/>
and Y has N replicas that operate concurrently
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:03:48 GMT):<br/>
does this make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:04:29 GMT):<br/>
im confused on what you mean by a 'chaincode instance'
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:04:43 GMT):<br/>
ok, step back from chaincode for a second
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:05:01 GMT):<br/>
I write hello-world in C, and compile it to a.out
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:05:07 GMT):<br/>
how do i define which instance i am on or currently running? is it by the version number?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:05:10 GMT):<br/>
I then run a.out 1000 times
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:05:18 GMT):<br/>
I have one code, and 1000 instances
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:06:09 GMT):<br/>
likewise, I can have one chaincode deployment that is instantiated 1000 times
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:06:29 GMT):<br/>
well, each instance has a unique address
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:07:25 GMT):<br/>
versioning is about upgrading in lifecycle management
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:07:39 GMT):<br/>
dont confuse versioning with instancing
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:08:08 GMT):<br/>
I can take foo:v1 and deploy it as instance bar and baz
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:08:24 GMT):<br/>
I can then write foo:v2 and upgrade instance baz
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:08:38 GMT):<br/>
but I still only have two instances: bar and baz
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:08:52 GMT):<br/>
make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:08:56 GMT):<br/>
this is an example of how i invoke a chaincode (as per the first-network example)
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:09:00 GMT):<br/>
```peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050  --tls $CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem  -C $CHANNEL_NAME -n mycc -c '{"Args":["transFund","a","b","10"]}'```
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:09:14 GMT):<br/>
how can i specify which instance i am running it on?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:09:19 GMT):<br/>
right...so "mycc" is your context
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:09:37 GMT):<br/>
that is essentially identifying the instance you are targeting your invoke at
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:09:55 GMT):<br/>
ohh i see
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:10:13 GMT):<br/>
v1.0 has a bit of a limiting namespace: its all flat
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:10:21 GMT):<br/>
so you are saying that i can have multiple installations of the same chaincode with a different name, which creates different instances?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:10:23 GMT):<br/>
but its a namespace nonetheless
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:10:28 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:10:37 GMT):<br/>
that makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:10:39 GMT):<br/>
the name is your instance identifier
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:10:55 GMT):<br/>
cool
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:11:23 GMT):<br/>
so a newbie question, where should i define the queue in terms of the code?
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:12:16 GMT):<br/>
should it be within the invoke function?
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:16:03 GMT):<br/>
another thing is, where is this instance the chaincode running? will it be affected if a peer drops? will a new peer who just joined the channel be able to see the queue? @greg.haskins 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:17:04 GMT):<br/>
think of a chaincode instance as a long running process...it can respond to invoke() requests, and it can store state in its database
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:17:38 GMT):<br/>
so, how you structure your state will be up to you, but normally its a combination of init() and invokes() that shape it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:18:17 GMT):<br/>
the instance is supposed to be running on any peer that is a designated endorser for your instance
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:19:37 GMT):<br/>
as far as peer drops, etc, the entire point of blockchain is to present a byzantine resistant network, and handling drops/rejoins is part of the fundamental operation
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:19:51 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=G87JCurtuq8zvaLtZ) @greg.haskins so do you mean that the queue should stored in the state? from what i understand the state is only made up of key value pairs
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:20:10 GMT):<br/>
define "queue"
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:21:48 GMT):<br/>
what i need is a priority queue which stores failed transactions ordered by different priorities
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:22:16 GMT):<br/>
what I am getting at is: a queue is just a data structure
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:22:40 GMT):<br/>
you can model a queue on a kv-store (as well as many other data structures)
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:23:08 GMT):<br/>
alright so maybe i should clarify
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:23:19 GMT):<br/>
is there a way to use built in data structures?
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:23:21 GMT):<br/>
such as https://golang.org/pkg/container/heap/
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:23:30 GMT):<br/>
you would have to serialize it
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:24:15 GMT):<br/>
and having the contents of the data structure not destroyed between invoke calls
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:24:20 GMT):<br/>
generally, it would probably be better to use something specifically created to work with fabric's kv-store than try to use an existing library though
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:24:40 GMT):<br/>
the only legal persistence layer you can use is the kv-store
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:25:04 GMT):<br/>
if you try to persist state in other ways, your code likely wont be deterministic
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:25:10 GMT):<br/>
so do you have any suggestions as to how a priority queue can be implemented using the kv store?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:26:20 GMT):<br/>
typically its done by synthesizing a few different indices into the kv-namespace and using range queuries
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:26:49 GMT):<br/>
with the introduction of couchdb in the latest release, there may be built-in ways to do this, but I havent written an app on top of couchdb yet to say for sure
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:27:26 GMT):<br/>
are there any examples of this i can possibly take a look at?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:27:28 GMT):<br/>
but what I can say is: you def want to be thinking about your persistence layer solely in terms of the provided kv layer
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:27:59 GMT):<br/>
otherwise your app may hold state that was aborted and that would be bad
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:28:18 GMT):<br/>
not sure, quite possibly
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:28:37 GMT):<br/>
i see
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:29:00 GMT):<br/>

Hi All, 

I observed that the usage of random number and current time in milliseconds in the chain code will result into mismatch of read write sets. 

Do we have any alternative to make use of same random number/ time on all the peers?

Any clue / advice is appreciated.
Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 09:20:32 GMT):<br/>
@PushpalathaHiremath  - What exactly are you trying to use the random number for?

It would be possible to have your client generate the random number and include it in the transient field in your  invoke proposal and then extract it in chaincode using https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#ChaincodeStub.GetTransient
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 09:20:53 GMT):<br/>
This way all peers would get the same random value

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 11:27:14 GMT):<br/>
@chaitanya you may want to vendor "documenteventmanager", "documentmanager" and any other packages with the chaincodebefore you install

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=M2PkaQHKeWjRagbw6) @akashmar In the v0.6 time frame, the GOPATH was used by the vagrant environment and related scripts as part of a path. This was a mistake I think because the GOPATH should be able to contain multiple entries, which is mandatory if you choose to create platform for common code and then import it to your chaincode. I did that and found that things worked best if I brought up a new environment from scratch and then manually exported the updated GOPATH in my shells. Worked pretty well, but was a bit of a hassle.

I have not done golang development on chaincode for v1 in months, and so I don't know if there are other bad assumptions for the GOPATH, but since it lasted for a year in that state my guess is that it is still like that in some way or other. If you need entries on GOPATH, you might try setting it inside the shells you are using. Just a thought ...

@muralisr Hi, i notice that after upgrading my code, the container for the previous version is still there, is this normal?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 11:49:56 GMT):<br/>
@chaitanya the paths refer to paths in chaincode container (which get created  as part of the build) and not CLI or peer containers. With regards to the error, I wonder if its trying to build of the previous install... can you clean up your env (remove old installed files, remove previous chaincode images etc) and try ?
</p>
<p><strong>chaitanya</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 11:50:54 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr I had tried pulling the network down and up again. Could you suggest me what more I need to do, in order to cleanup files?

@wy yes, thats normal... the upgraded chaincode could be selectively applied on a subset of channels so the older CC could be serving others

@wy yes, thats normal... the upgraded chaincode could be selectively applied on a subset of channels so the older CC could be serving others. There's a JIRA for inactive chaincodes to be brought down after user specified "inactive" time period which will ensure unused chaincodes will go away. For now, you can just kill the older chaincode if its unused
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 11:56:46 GMT):<br/>
@chaitanya that should do it. I'm not sure what you are running into. So you have completely vendored everything in the chaincode to be totally self contained and installed that CC ?
</p>
<p><strong>chaitanya</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 11:57:29 GMT):<br/>
Yes, following the video link you mentioned. I see all of my dependencies mentioned in the vendor.json file too.
</p>
<p><strong>chaitanya</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 11:58:56 GMT):<br/>
However, if you look at the output of $GOPATH in the container, it says `/opt/gopath/`. Is that expected, or should it be something like `/chaincode/input....`
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:03:05 GMT):<br/>
@wy more of a resource concern
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:03:54 GMT):<br/>
@chaitanya which container are you refering to ... the CLI ?
</p>
<p><strong>chaitanya</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:04:11 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr Yes, the cli container
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:05:30 GMT):<br/>
that should be /opt/gopath... note that the CLI container is not used to build the chaincode (ie, "go build" does not happen on the CLI container)
</p>
<p><strong>chaitanya</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:07:30 GMT):<br/>
So is there something wrong with my vendoring then? The external packages I'm using are simply in the following directory structure, `vendor/documentmanager/documentmanager.go`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:14:27 GMT):<br/>
what is the "import" for "documentmanager" in the CC ?
</p>
<p><strong>chaitanya</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:15:10 GMT):<br/>
`dm "documentmanager"`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:15:16 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:16:44 GMT):<br/>
that looks right. are you sure the "path install -p <path to chaincode>///
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:16:44 GMT):<br/>
that looks right. are you sure the -p in  "path install -p <path to chaincode>..." is resolving to the right chaincode ?
</p>
<p><strong>chaitanya</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:18:23 GMT):<br/>
yes, I just checked that too.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:21:54 GMT):<br/>
 if you copy the chaincode to a new folder outside of the current gopath (say /home/me/testcc/src/mycc)  set GOPATH=/home/me/testcc , cd /home/me/testcc/src/mycc and do a `go build` there
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:22:05 GMT):<br/>
does it build ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:23:04 GMT):<br/>
if it does, it should just work when you install too
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:23:04 GMT):<br/>
if it does, it should just work when you do it from CLI too assuming the correct chaincode is picked up from gopath
</p>
<p><strong>chaitanya</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:24:16 GMT):<br/>
It builds when it's pasted within my Fabric clone for sure. I'll need to try copying it outside of that clone and check.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:25:04 GMT):<br/>
right, isolating the CC and trying would be key
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:25:50 GMT):<br/>
need to step away ... can check back later
</p>
<p><strong>chaitanya</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:28:52 GMT):<br/>
Sure, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>chaitanya</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:51:14 GMT):<br/>

In the interface I do not see this function...If it is not possible, should I do a get state again to get a new iterator or should I save all results in an array so I can loop over them again as many times I want?

one liner
</p>
<p><strong>gbolo</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:07:26 GMT):<br/>
excellent
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:07:35 GMT):<br/>
do you mean you wish to fork v1.0, patch, and build locally?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:07:48 GMT):<br/>
or did you mean you would like it in the next v1.0.x release?
</p>
<p><strong>gbolo</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:08:11 GMT):<br/>
I will create my own patch for local use, our devs are on 1.0 GA
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:08:21 GMT):<br/>
ok, follow up
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:08:39 GMT):<br/>
what do you use to create your deployment payload? (e.g. CLI, node-sdk, etc)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:08:55 GMT):<br/>
(it might need to be patched in both the client and server
</p>
<p><strong>gbolo</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:09:21 GMT):<br/>
for packaging and deploying cc i use the peer binary. so i guess your change will fix it for both server and client
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:09:42 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>gbolo</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:09:57 GMT):<br/>
much appreciate btw. ill create the ticket shortly
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:10:19 GMT):<br/>
if you want to patch locally, I _think_ you just need to modify this: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/core/chaincode/platforms/golang/package.go#L32
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:11:12 GMT):<br/>
I just looked at the server side, I think its more permissive
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:11:23 GMT):<br/>
(so you only need the client side patched, which for you is the peer CLI)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:12:25 GMT):<br/>
i also think I misunderstood you when you said that you'll patch....i thought you meant you would write the patch, but I think now that you meant you will apply the patch I write
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:12:27 GMT):<br/>
which is totally fine
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:12:59 GMT):<br/>
actually it will help get the patch submitted if your team confirms it actually works
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:13:12 GMT):<br/>
so, ill push the CR and you can test?
</p>
<p><strong>gbolo</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:13:54 GMT):<br/>
yes I will test it immediatly
</p>
<p><strong>gbolo</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 16:14:25 GMT):<br/>
creating ticket now...

The Hyperledger Fabric Model (http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fabric_model.html#privacy-through-channels) describes privacy via channels and goes on to suggest that values can be encrypted by the chaincode. How is this done in practice? Where would the encryption key come from? 
</p>

@greg.haskins after patching on client side I get this:
```

When i issue `docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple.yaml up` i get the error below..

```
ERROR: An HTTP request took too long to complete. Retry with --verbose to obtain debug information.
If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: 60).
```
I have increased COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT value upto 500, but the error occurs continuously. Internet connection is fine...

I have found a way around above problem by disabling/commenting `tty : true` in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric-samples/chaincode-docker-devmode/docker-compose-simple.yaml` 
But now when i run `docker exec -it chaincode bash`  it gives error, `Error response from daemon: Container 20c5bba37c50d378ebf5b130471ea202dcaf2114fe580573bfd0f44e000f8a3d is not running`

To retrieve all the values a key has had, do I have to retrieve all the txid I got from getHistoryForKey and then go to the payload of each and read the value of it? or is there any shorter way?

Hi .. can someone please tell me,, if an external  json config file, be accessed from chaincode program. If yes, how? I have already tried using os.Open() and io/ioutil.ReadFile(). But, both are getting error that,,no such file exists.

seems the shim.MockStub interface has changed completely

you need to use GetCreator()

but I am struggling to decode the raw bytes sent
</p>
<p><strong>crazyquark</strong> (Fri, 11 Aug 2017 13:37:35 GMT):<br/>
seems to be a certificate
</p>
<p><strong>crazyquark</strong> (Fri, 11 Aug 2017 13:37:39 GMT):<br/>
but no idea how to decode it
</p>
<p><strong>crazyquark</strong> (Fri, 11 Aug 2017 14:20:12 GMT):<br/>
I managed to do it, here is the code:
</p>
<p><strong>crazyquark</strong> (Fri, 11 Aug 2017 14:20:15 GMT):<br/>
`func getCallerCertificate(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) (*x509.Certificate, error) {

	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.New("Failed to get creator")
	}

	var creator mspproto.SerializedIdentity
	err = proto.Unmarshal(creatorBytes, &creator)
	if err != nil {
		logger.Info("Failed to deserialize creator identity:", err.Error())
		return nil, errors.New("Failed to deserialize identity")
	}

	bl, _ := pem.Decode(creator.IdBytes)
	if bl == nil {
		logger.Info("Failed to parse PEM:", err.Error())
		return nil, errors.New("Failed to parse PEM")
	}

	cert, err := x509.ParseCertificate(bl.Bytes)

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 12 Aug 2017 17:49:53 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi  - A couple of things:

1) If you don't want the chaincode to run on certain peers within a channel, don't install it on those peers
2) You only need to instantiate chaincode once per channel (i.e. instantiate is not run on a per peer basis)

The default instantiation policy is that the admin of any org in a channel can instantiate chaincode.  So you need only run one instantiate transaction.  Once you get the response back from a peer for instantiate and then send that to the orderer, all of of the other peers in the channel will get the instantiate transaction.  If they have the chaincode installed, then they will spin it up.  If a peer on the channel does not have the chaincode installed, then it simply saves the lifecycle information but will not spin up the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Sat, 12 Aug 2017 17:52:33 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Thanks a lot for clarification. Yes somehow I completely missed this point.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 12 Aug 2017 18:20:52 GMT):<br/>
Sure thing

> Once you get the response back from a peer for instantiate and then send that to the orderer, all of of the other peers in the channel will get the instantiate transaction. If they have the chaincode installed, then they will spin it up.

Hi Gari, unless something has changed post v1.0.0, my experience has been that the chaincode images and container are spun up only on the peer that is the target of the chaincode instantiate request.  Other peers that had the chaincode installed do not get the image or container built at that time.    I am only referring to using the *peer chaincode instantiate* cli command, so maybe you're referring to what happens when using one of the SDKs?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Sat, 12 Aug 2017 19:02:24 GMT):<br/>
@silliman Thats correct. Initially, it'll only spun up only on the peer that is instantiated on (so only one chaincode container). But When you invoke or query the chaincode on the other peers,  it'll spin it up for given peer, so you'll see new container for that peer.  
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Sat, 12 Aug 2017 19:02:41 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 correct me if missed anything
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Sat, 12 Aug 2017 19:07:10 GMT):<br/>
@silliman @mastersingh24 Also with my example above, I see 2 chaincode containers for the same chaincode although second instantiate transaction is failed in the peer log but not on the cli output. I should ideally see only one chaincode container. 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 12 Aug 2017 19:11:29 GMT):<br/>
@silliman  - What @nhrishi  wrote above is correct - the other peers will not spin it up until needed (i.e. first invoke).  I left out that detail as the point I was making is that you need only run a single instantiate transaction per chaincode per channel
</p>
<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Sat, 12 Aug 2017 19:12:37 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 understood...just making sure I'm not missing out on some new functionality :-)

At the moment, the script is hardcoded to accept only `mychannel` and `mycc` channel and chaincode names respectively. When I have the time, I'll try to make it more generic

I am developing a chaincode and testing it by modifying script.sh in e2e_cli example with the default network setup (Org1,Org2, 2 members each). If I instantiate chaincode using peer0.Org1, I am able to invoke transactions on it. But when I invoke transactions on peer0.Org2 after instantiating CC on peer0.Org1, I get the following error on peer0.org2. The same behavior other way round as well.

On the orderer, I see the following message corresponding to same timestamp

```

My e2e_cli works fine with the default chaincode examples. What could be going wrong with my chaincode? how do I debug? Thanks

@here - Hi people. I have been trying hard to put data in couch db and viewing them in Fauxton GUI. I managed to put them using my go CC but I am unable to see any data inside "data" field inside my document. I have tried the marbles_02 example and running that shows data using the Fauxton GUI. Any ideas where I might be going wrong. (I have tried with raw as well as Json documents, but no success till now) 😞

Everything goes great.. but when i try

i get an error responsing saying

I have a very strange behavior when updating an asset in the fabric using PutState. The asset structs are something like that Asset1 {id, desc, []asset2} Asset2 {id, name}. Now storing asset1 without any asset2 works without any issue, but once I create an asset2 and add it to the list in asset1 the asset1 object seems to be completely empty stored. I've checked several times, until the point of PutState the byte array isn't empty and no errors a thrown. Any idea what could be the problem here?

Hi Team, I am running the marbles demo inside of "IBM Container service". The hyperledger version that I have is v1.0. I want to access the chaincode methods "query" and "invoke" from external applications. What peer URL/address and port number should I use to access the endpoints "/registrar" and "/chaincode"?

I'm playing around with InvokeChaincode and thought I would try a simple test of having my chaincode implementation call itself. I can see the peer receive the INVOKE_CHAINCODE request but I don't see it trying to invoke the chaincode. The likeyhood is that there is something wrong with the way I have constructed the INVOKE_CHAINCODE message but just want to check there isn't any logic in fabric that basically doesn't allow a chaincode to call itself ?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 16:55:12 GMT):<br/>
And as a follow-on are there any examples of calling InvokeChaincode ? specifically the arguments expected ? such as should it have the string "invoke" as the first argument for example ?

Hey there, I was wondering if there is any way to make a time trigger in chaincode?? I tried to make goroutines, dont seem to work for more thana 30 seconds. How can I make a functionality execute on its own after a period of time on its own??

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 10:34:17 GMT):<br/>
No, you would have to have a client application trigger the chaincode.  The client is responsible for initiating an invoke, getting it endorsed on X peers, and then packaging up the responses in a transaction that is submitted to orderering.

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 10:53:08 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart Thanks for the reply. I've actually found that chaincode cannot invoke itself, it can only invoke another chaincode and I have that working now but it means my e2e testing will require me to setup 2 running chaincodes and I was hoping to get away with 1 :-)

Hi Team, How to interact with the chaincode contract that I have deployed. I want to communicate with "init", "invoke" and "query" methods of the chaincode. I have used chaincode earlier with hyperledger v0.6 and there the primary mode of communication was REST APIs. It seems v1.0 does not have REST APIs. How to access the chaincode from client applications like HTML/javascript/nodejS. Any links to examples\tutorials in this regard will be a great help. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Fri, 25 Aug 2017 11:20:23 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for clarification @dave.enyeart . Sorry to get on your nerves but, I was just wondering what would happen I change the KeepAlive .
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Fri, 25 Aug 2017 11:20:23 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for clarification @dave.enyeart . Sorry to get on your nerves but, I was just wondering what would happen if I change the KeepItAlive in core.yaml. I would predict that the goroutines would work for as much time as I want but then what could be the bad outcome of it. I can only imagine problems such as infinite loops or big loads on the system. Again apologies for these queries.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 25 Aug 2017 17:07:33 GMT):<br/>
@Stas Sorokin  - You use that function if you want your client or an external application to receive some type of notification once your transaction has been committed.  There is an eventhub service/endpoint which your client can connect to in order to subscribe to and receive event(s) of this type

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 17:51:37 GMT):<br/>
@CodeReaper the keepalive in core.yaml is meant for chaincode to send keepalive message on the grpc channel to keep the connection alive in situations where the chaincode, peer endpoints have to go through hops which could terminate inactive connections ... this param is an internal heartbeat and is not part of the request/response which you can somehow harness to implement things like timers

Hi
</p>
<p><strong>BinduPriya</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 18:23:23 GMT):<br/>
I have a question in chaincode, is it possible to query using non primary key
</p>
<p><strong>BinduPriya</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 18:23:54 GMT):<br/>
like i have main key ApplicationId, but i want to query the block using status key
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 19:09:26 GMT):<br/>
@BinduPriya What do you mean by non-primary key?  world state and all the indexes (key history, block index, etc.) are maintained in a key-value store.
</p>
<p><strong>BinduPriya</strong> (Sun, 27 Aug 2017 17:50:24 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal if my structure is {applicationId:String,Status:String,Name:String}, can i query using Status?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Sun, 27 Aug 2017 19:01:05 GMT):<br/>
If you are using couchdb, you should be able to do that...  Otherwise you'd need to create a separate key-value pair such as Status as the key or more likely Status concatenated with applicationid to do a range query

Hello Team,
Hyperledger used to provide Rest API endpoints listed on:
"https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v0.6/core/rest/rest_api.json".

My current use case has a frontend screen that displays blockchain information like chain of blocks, hash contents inside a block etc. This screen needs to show block level system information. I want access to the following information:
1) /chain
2) /chain/blocks/{Block}
3) /transactions/{ID}

Question A) How do I get this information in the blockchain network built using Composer? 
Note: I know that Composer server does exposes a REST API. However, that  API only provides application level information like asset information, participants etc. and does not provide block level information as I want.

</p>

found an annoying in the ChaincodeStubInterface: This interface uses the timestamp package, but as a VENDORED package.
This results in being unable to implement the ChaincodeStubInterface with my own struct
More info here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38091816/packages-type-cannot-be-used-as-the-vendored-packages-type

From forum/blog-posts, it seems the only valid solution is that a library should NOT use vendoring when exposing these kind of things to the outside.
So please don't put the "github.com/golang/protobuf/ptypes/timestamp" package in a vendor folder...

My new question is
Is it ok to call `InvokeChaincode` twice?
For example:

func Function(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response {
    // first invoke
    ccArgs := util.ToChaincodeArgs("f1", "1")
    resp := stub.InvokeChaincode("mycc1", ccArgs, "")

   return shim.OK
}
```

</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 06 Sep 2017 13:06:43 GMT):<br/>
the comment to `InvokeChaincode` function says that you can even call chaincode from another channel (in read-only mode)
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Wed, 06 Sep 2017 13:35:29 GMT):<br/>
Where does validation system chaincode resides can we edit it?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 06 Sep 2017 13:36:26 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean? when it is read only?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Wed, 06 Sep 2017 13:39:35 GMT):<br/>
when you call chaincode B from chaincode A in the same channel B's read and write sets just add to A's RW sets.

How would I define different user-types/access control within the chain code? Each would have the same read-level, but TypeA could only create TransactionA and TransB, while TypeB can create TransB and TransC. I can't find anything detailed in the docs on how to create this sort of functionality

I need a system like this i have a chaincodeA on peers of org1 and chaincodeB on peers of org2 if I invoke a transaction on chaincodeA it has to be completed and committed only if already there exists a transaction calling chaincodeB how do I go about it

</p>
<p><strong>Luxii</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 09:40:43 GMT):<br/>
@zemtsov and where is the certificate stored which we are getting here ?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 09:44:59 GMT):<br/>
certificates and keys are stored locally on your machine
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 09:45:50 GMT):<br/>
if you tried some examples, you saw something like `keyValueStore` parameter
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 09:46:10 GMT):<br/>
this is the path on the machine where your application runs to store keys and certs
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 09:48:51 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure if it is possible to get keys in chaincode.

</p>
<p><strong>Luxii</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:01:03 GMT):<br/>
I am using docker-devmode
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:01:53 GMT):<br/>
which sdk does your application use?
</p>
<p><strong>Luxii</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:04:02 GMT):<br/>
not using any sdk just docker-devmode network example with my own chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:05:46 GMT):<br/>
`GetCreator()` returns cert of a user, if this user was enrolled with SDK all certs and keys are stored on your local machine where you run your application
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:06:27 GMT):<br/>
Where cert is located in your case, I don't know. Sorry
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:08:19 GMT):<br/>
if you didn't enroll any users the cert is probably included in the channel's genesis block.
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:08:28 GMT):<br/>
But I'm not sure

@zemtsov  if I want to get the MSPid of the peers on which I am executing the chaincode how do I get it
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:33:26 GMT):<br/>
if peers executing your chaincode are from different orgs, you'll get different mspids
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:33:49 GMT):<br/>
and this can fail your transaction

<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:35:15 GMT):<br/>
I don't know how to get it. 
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:35:31 GMT):<br/>
@Luxii I was wrong about `GetCreator`'s result
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:35:39 GMT):<br/>
it is not the cert itself
</p>
<p><strong>Luxii</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:35:56 GMT):<br/>
Then?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:36:21 GMT):<br/>
it is a structure 
```
type SignatureHeader struct {
	// Creator of the message, specified as a certificate chain
	Creator []byte `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=creator,proto3" json:"creator,omitempty"`
	// Arbitrary number that may only be used once. Can be used to detect replay attacks.

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 12:17:22 GMT):<br/>
```import(
"crypto/x509"

"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim"
mspprotos "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/msp"
)

func getSigner(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) {
creator,err := stub.GetCreator()
id := &mspprotos.SerializedIdentity{}
err = proto.Unmarshal(creator, id)
block, _ = pem.Decode(id.GetIdBytes())
cert,err := x509.ParseCertificate(block.Bytes)
enrollID := cert.Subject.CommonName
mspID := id.GetMspid()

Above explanation says that we can query a chaincode deployed on a different channel from a chaincode deployed in another channel. 
Isn't the concept for multi channel is so that data shared in one is not accessible to peers on the other channel .?
</p>
<p><strong>htyagi90</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 15:49:23 GMT):<br/>
and here ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eRNxxQ0P8yp4Wh__Vi6ddaN_vhN2RQHP-IruHNUwyhc/edit ) it says that 
"Only members of a channel may transact on that channel, and *transactions on a channel is not visible on other channels.*"

I have an infrequent and seemingly non-reproducible error in the Go shim's GetState and PutState, which is "[txid]Channel exists". (To me it smells like a concurrency issue but I don't use go-routines in my chaincode.) Anyone experienced something like that before?
</p>
<p><strong>bta</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 19:58:48 GMT):<br/>
@htyagi90 you can query chaincode on a different channel, but the functions you invoke cannot write state. Also, this only works if endorsers that execute the chaincode have access to both channels, which should also make clear that confidentiality is not an issue (or if it is, then the invocation will fail for lack of endorsement).

@VoR0220 there's nothing _bad_ about filling in field of chaincode structs. Just best practice of chaincode to not have global vars or store data from proposals in chaincode memory - basically make the code itself stateless.

@bmalavan  - I'd seriously advise against trying to use stuff from the fabric repo as packages - most of them are not really designed as such (and yes - I know one of the examples uses this package - I keep meaning to change that)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 13:20:30 GMT):<br/>
That being said, the solution is that you actually need to vendor the shim package with your chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 13:20:55 GMT):<br/>
As well as vendoring the common/util package
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 13:21:30 GMT):<br/>
Are you using the peer CLI to package and install your chaincode?   It should have including the common/util package - but you can just vendor it yourself
</p>
<p><strong>bmalavan</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 13:25:39 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=dM6RuxWc4n3CpPmii) @mastersingh24 Yep. I try to instantiate via  cli. For the moment, I have come up with my own method to get chain code arguments.

@mastersingh24  bydaway, is there a way to mock couchdb to do go Test? or simply mocking stub will be enough to test `Rich Query`?

Hello everyone! I tried to invoke chaicodes in sequence: Chaincode1:Method1 -> Chaincode2:Method1 -> Chaincode1:Method2 and got an error "Error: chaincode error (status: 500, message: )"
Is this an issue or a protection against cycling? 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 13:40:01 GMT):<br/>
@bmalavan  - the rich query functions have not been implemented in the mock stub

@mastersingh24 could you tell me how to vendor the "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/events/consumer" package?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:34:47 GMT):<br/>
@Amit04Patel  - Before I tell you (  ;) ), why exactly are you going to use the event consumer package in chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:35:38 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 to capture new records in the ledger 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:36:27 GMT):<br/>
I don't think you should / would want to have chaincode attempt to subscribe to events
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:36:46 GMT):<br/>
You'd really want to write an app that consumes events and then invokes chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:40:54 GMT):<br/>
i am getting the error for util package also could you tell me how to vendor that?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:58:43 GMT):<br/>
```
go get govendor
cd to the root of your chaincode project

@mastersingh24 when i am running govendor in my system (ubuntu16.04) it says already in vendor

Hi guys, I am not very good at Golang, so I have the following question:
Because I do not want to implement all my chaincode functions in a single file. I want to separate them into different files with the structure:
```
$GOPATH/src/my-project/cc/main.go
$GOPATH/src/my-project/cc/functions/chaincode_function_A.go
```

In my main.go, I can do :
```
import (
  functionA "my-project/cc/functions/chaincode_function_A"
)
```
And I define the chaincode struct in main.go:
```
type Chaincode struct {
}
```
However, when I want to implement my chaincode function A in chaincode_function_A.go
:
```
func (t *Chaincode) functionA() string {
  return "Function A"
}
```

I failed/don't know how to import the `Chaincode` struct from my main package.

Any Golang expert can help???
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:19:14 GMT):<br/>
@levinkwong what if you define `Chaincode` in `chaincode_function_A`?
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:19:51 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=rLACLk3dxpuuG46q9) @Amit04Patel Anyone could you help me with this?
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:20:55 GMT):<br/>
@zemtsov 
then in my Invoke function, how should I call it with chaincode.functionA() ?
Also, I want to put function per file, would it duplicate the struct in `chaincode_function_B`?
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:22:46 GMT):<br/>
I mean I want to do something like this in `main.go`:
```
func (t *Chaincode) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) pb.Response {
	function, args := stub.GetFunctionAndParameters()

	if function != "invoke" {
		shim.Error("Invalid function name received " + function + " for invoke transcation")
	}

	fmt.Println("function : ", function, " args : ", args)

	action := args[0]
	args = args[1:]

	switch action {
	case functionA:
          t.functionA(stub, args)
	}
	errMsg := fmt.Sprintln("Received unknown function invocation: [function:", function, ", args:", args, "]")
	return shim.Error(errMsg)
}

```
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:23:41 GMT):<br/>
In the old days, I put functionA in same file so no problems. But now I have many many functions, so I want to separate them into different files.
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:23:58 GMT):<br/>
```
func (t *functionA.Chaincode) Invoke(...) pb.Response {
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:25:26 GMT):<br/>
I think cannot do this because I init the shim by 
```

func main() {
	err := shim.Start(new(Chaincode))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error starting chaincode: %s", err)
	}
}

```
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:26:03 GMT):<br/>
Can't you put `functionA.Chaincode` to `Start`?
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:26:23 GMT):<br/>
But there will be funcitonB.Chaincode, functionC .. etc
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:27:07 GMT):<br/>
Is it not logical to do `t.functionA(stub, args)` while functionA is in another package? should I just do `functionA(stub, args)`??
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:27:25 GMT):<br/>
so, you want to init all chaincodes in a single `main`?
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:27:46 GMT):<br/>
I only have 1 chaincode, but that chaincode provide many business functions.
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:28:30 GMT):<br/>
Please point out anything I doing is not logical
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:29:08 GMT):<br/>
I just reference https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/examples/chaincode/chaintool/example02/src/chaincode/chaincode_example02.go
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:29:39 GMT):<br/>
But instead of putting every functions in the file, I want (maybe this wish is not logical) to put the functions into different files
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:30:27 GMT):<br/>
Define one `Chaincode` type in `main` package, define `Invoke` and `Init` there. And call any your functions defined in `functionA(B,C...)` from `Invoke`
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:31:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes, exactly what I am trying to do.
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:31:55 GMT):<br/>
I guess this is wrong:
```
case functionA:
          t.functionA(stub, args)
	}
```
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:32:01 GMT):<br/>
So back to my question , the following codes failed because Chaincode is defined in main.go
```
func (t *Chaincode) functionA() string {
  return "Function A"
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:32:33 GMT):<br/>
define it out of `Chaincode` type.
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:32:56 GMT):<br/>
```
func functionA() string {
...
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:33:26 GMT):<br/>
and call
```
functionA.functionA()
```
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:34:45 GMT):<br/>
OK, could you give me some idea what indeed is `(t *Chaincode)`? I would like to know the right use of that
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:35:02 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your help! Very new to Golang :(
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:35:56 GMT):<br/>
when you define a function this way
```
func (t *Chaincode) functionA() string {
  return "Function A"
}
```
you make something like a class member
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:36:25 GMT):<br/>
of a class `Chaincode`
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:36:40 GMT):<br/>
and `t` is like `this` here
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:38:29 GMT):<br/>
Same as what I understand, so I think I should not remove it. Because that function belongs to the class `chaincode`
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:38:39 GMT):<br/>
why?
</p>
<p><strong>zemtsov</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:39:07 GMT):<br/>
then define it in `main` package
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:39:11 GMT):<br/>
I want to restrict the access of that function to only that class
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:40:03 GMT):<br/>
oh! I will try define the chaincode_function_A.go in `main` package
</p>
<p><strong>levinkwong</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:41:20 GMT):<br/>
Thanks very much, it works, and I can sense what I misunderstood
</p>

@mavericklam still not entirely clear which case youre talking about. 

if it is chaincode A installed on peer A and chaincode A installed on peer B then yes, the state db is a reflection of the same ledger.

if it is an instance of chaincode A and and an instance of chaincode B they do not share the same state, but they can get information about each other's state by querying and sending invokes between them if and only if they are instantiated on the same channel

I need some help.  I've been working on add chaincode logging and can't get it to work.   So I created a sample_logging program from fabric-samples sacc.go and added the info from here: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging-control.html.  I've tried various ways and still can't get it to work.  My code is located here:  https://github.ibm.com/debrajo/logging_sample/blob/master/logging_sample.go   Anyone have any idea on why it doesn't work or can point me to a working sample?  
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 19:44:37 GMT):<br/>
Hey @debrajo, let me take a look.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 20:03:56 GMT):<br/>
One quick question: how are you running your chaincode? one of the samples that creates the network for you using containers, running locally using devmode?
</p>
<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 20:32:16 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti I've got kubenetes container using  ibm-container-service  
</p>
<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 20:32:46 GMT):<br/>
we've deployed our chaincode to it .. and I've deployed sample_logging .. and see nothing in the log 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 20:59:50 GMT):<br/>
I proactively opened a JIRA to update the documentation for logging: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6170. I've been meaning to get around to that for a while.
</p>
<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:14:28 GMT):<br/>
so documentation is incorrect ? 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:15:41 GMT):<br/>
it's at least slightly outdated and not straightforward.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:16:07 GMT):<br/>
by the way, I'm refreshing my mind on chaincode logging at the moment and should have an answer for you shortly. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:46:27 GMT):<br/>
hmmm there's definitely something acting weird here. I'm able to get the chaincode loggers working for levels up to INFO but not currently for DEBUG. need to dig deeper.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:48:49 GMT):<br/>
the chaincode log level should really be controlled by the environment variable CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:48:49 GMT):<br/>
the log level for chaincode containers should really be controlled by the environment variable CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL
</p>
<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:59:16 GMT):<br/>
I'm actually thinking of a setChaincodeLevel  invoke command .. so we can set prod at say info .. and if something significant happens, we can turn to debug .. capture error, then back to INFO 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:59:17 GMT):<br/>
my container wasn't picking up the change immediately from sampleconfig/core.yaml. it's working now. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:01:08 GMT):<br/>
interesting. well definitely use CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL to set the overall default level for the container initially. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:02:35 GMT):<br/>
and it's a to-do for the future to add the ability to dynamically update the chaincode container logging level. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:04:45 GMT):<br/>
it could definitely be worth a try to figure out another way to use the system (like you setChaincodeLevel invoke command) to update the level dynamically but that's not something I've looked into
</p>

<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:05:37 GMT):<br/>
I don't think the ibm-container-service  blockchain.yaml  sets a  CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL  environment variable ..  I may have to pick one of those .. or explicitly set for our dev environment  
</p>
<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:05:54 GMT):<br/>
don't know what variables will be there for the IBM Blockchain service in bluemix
</p>
<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:06:25 GMT):<br/>
no worries ..  that's what I'm trying for with this sample_logging 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:07:14 GMT):<br/>
in theory, it looks like it should work. 
</p>
<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:07:34 GMT):<br/>
In theory :)
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:07:34 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:08:41 GMT):<br/>
from my sample-logger.go chaincode ?   .. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:09:11 GMT):<br/>
well, I started with the same logging calls from your sample and then modified
</p>
<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:10:59 GMT):<br/>
I've seen a few samples with fmt.Printf()  .. does that even work for logging ?
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:11:27 GMT):<br/>
the logger from shim logger does seem like it needs improvement... I don't like that it just shows the logging call as the function name instead of the actual function (I added those calls to the invoke function of my chaincode)
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:11:56 GMT):<br/>
yes, fmt.Print statements work inside chaincode and the containers
</p>
<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:12:59 GMT):<br/>
so maybe it's the container setup .. because the main() fmt.Printf("logging_sample.go.main started")  didn't make the log 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:15:08 GMT):<br/>
yes, it could be. I haven't worked with kubernetes yet; only docker
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:17:00 GMT):<br/>
I'd recommend making sure you see fmt.Print statements in your container first, then try with the loggers and make sure CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL is set to DEBUG initially
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:18:55 GMT):<br/>
feel free to reach out to me with any further logging questions that come up
</p>
<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:23:34 GMT):<br/>
Thanks.. appreciate it .. I'm out tomorrow .. so will try all this on Monday 
</p>
<p><strong>debrajo</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:24:39 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti Sorry.. so code wise, my logger-sample.go looks good ? 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 23:14:11 GMT):<br/>
@debrajo yes, the code itself works. I'd recommend removing the SetLevel statements for now until you get around to implementing/testing that part.

Where should the conditions for asset transfer be stored ? and also the records of asset transfer? , should this be stored in hyperledger fabric or a  database???
</p>
<p><strong>ShashikumarVishweshwara</strong> (Tue, 19 Sep 2017 11:58:35 GMT):<br/>
 while writing chaincode with Go program we have the PutState() and GetState() methods ,if my understanding is right should i be using the PutState method to store the contract or transaction rules example PutState('rules_for_successful',rule1_in_bytes)
something like b := []byte("transaction_can_take_place_if_color_green")
using putstate method should we be using this method to fill the agreement points between two transacting parties for the transaction to be successful and then using the getstate method to pull the points and verify it, can someone clarify this?

Hi, I want to iterate over all the transaction id’s (TxID) on the blockchain and extract the Key/Value pairs belonging to the different TxID’s. I can iterate over all the Keys and get the Value and TxID for each Key, but that’s not what I want.

Looking at the marbles example, we can query  “a” and extract the Value; so if “a” starts out at 100, buys 100 and then sells 50, we only see the Value for “a” (150) and the TxID for the last transaction, while I would like to see this:
```
TxID		Key 		Value
1607f… 		a		100
967f2…		a		200
e03bc…		a		150
```

Any idea which function/method to use? Looking at the shim interface, `GetTxID() string` is probably not what I want.

@habpygo I would suggest that you crawl the blocks for the channel in which you are interested. Start from the top and you will be able to list them in order starting with most recent first.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=tkMNQgXiosFzLCY9c) @kletkeman  , thanks for the suggestion, but I think that I’m missing something fundamental here. 
The question is how do I “crawl the blocks for the channel?” Or put it differently, how do I scrutinize the ledger?
Looking at `interfaces.go` in the `shim` package, I can find two iterators, i.e. `StateQueryIteratorInterface` and `HistoryQueryIteratorInterface`, all stating: “…allows a chaincode to iterate over a set of key/value pairs…” As I said before, by using the same Key for a nth transaction, this will overwrite the Value of the (n-1)th transaction for that Key, so this is useless; I want to see all n transactions for the same key. If you have any suggestions please let me know.
Thanks.

@habpygo Oh, sorry, you seem to be wanting to do this from inside a smart contract. I can't quite see any reason for doing that, so it never occurred to me that someone would want to. I don't think that there is an interface for it in user chaincode, so you are relegated to doing whatever you can through the shim. What you want is easily done using the SDKs. For any given channel: (1) Get chainheight, (2) read blocks starting at chainheight, decrementing by 1, (3) parse block for transactions in array -- ID, original payload, r/w set, and events

Hi, I am trying to get one state back from current world state of an asset from the ledger. (i.e., If current state of an asset is S, i would like to get S-1 or S-2 data) Is there any efficient way of doing it without using `stub.GetHistoryForKey()`. The problem I foresee is, if a certain asset has 10K state change, This would result me that many value objects and I need to iterate every time to get the correct previous state of an asset. any idea is appreciated?

hi previously have written chaincode and deployed it over free blokchain service on bluemix which was coming with 4 node setup.
</p>
<p><strong>kartikeyagupta</strong> (Mon, 25 Sep 2017 04:25:46 GMT):<br/>
have also integrated UI using rest API with bluemix blockchain service. however since my trial bluemix expired, registered with new account however not able to locate free blockchain n/w/service with 4 nodes . 
</p>
<p><strong>kartikeyagupta</strong> (Mon, 25 Sep 2017 04:26:36 GMT):<br/>
any idea if IBM has stopped that service with trail account ?

Hi all,
I am trying to implement block-listener using the code given here 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/v1.0.0/examples/events/block-listener

I have set CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=false in docker-compose-cli.yaml  and base/peer-base.yaml and 
ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ENABLED=false in base/docker-compose-base.yaml

but i am getting the following erros
when I try to run it from my local machine (Ubuntu 16.04)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=Ayp9ggcbkhGN497CL) @DarshanBc Where did you run the govendor command? I think I need to do the same for proto to resolve my issue
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:27:47 GMT):<br/>
@yoyokeen that seems to be the expected behavior if querying by a full composite key. if you want to get a range you should use a partial composite key: https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#ChaincodeStub.GetStateByPartialCompositeKey

partial composite keys are implemented in the marbles chaincode example: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release/chaincode/marbles02/marbles_chaincode.go
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:29:14 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc glad to hear the vendoring solved the problem! for the second issue you posted, is that short code block what exists in example_cc.go on line 191?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:32:26 GMT):<br/>
@wy meaning `mockstub.GetCreator()`? if so, it is not implemented.

https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/core/chaincode/shim/mockstub.go#L280
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:33:05 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith i have a getcreator in my actual chaincode function which i want to test
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:33:34 GMT):<br/>
so i want to be able to set the "creator" to see if the function logic passed as expected
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:34:53 GMT):<br/>
@wy hmm good question. i'm guessing you'd have to sign off on the transaction in the mock.Invoke? @mastersingh24 would probably more help here
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:35:36 GMT):<br/>
Either that or just implement a mock version of GetCreator
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:35:41 GMT):<br/>
probably the best option
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:36:08 GMT):<br/>
Because the mock stub runs chaincode standalone rather than through the peer
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:36:59 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 what do you mean by a mock version of GetCreator?
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:41:13 GMT):<br/>
@sampath06  for protobuf you need not run govendor command there is a directory inside /hyperledger/core/vendor you need to paste vendor directory inside your chaincode directory along with .go file 
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:42:27 GMT):<br/>
Anyway for other dependency you need to run govendor where your vendor directory is present
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:43:09 GMT):<br/>
You'll see that mockstub returns nil,nil for GetCreator
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:43:25 GMT):<br/>
You could modify that to return something for testing purposes
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:43:47 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 i cant do that right? i am trying to test my actual chaincode function which makes use of GetCreator
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:44:04 GMT):<br/>
Are you doing mock testing or real testing?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:44:21 GMT):<br/>
Meaning using a peer or not
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:44:32 GMT):<br/>
trying to use the mock to do some basic unit tests
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:44:38 GMT):<br/>
If you use a peer, then no issue - just submit a trans against the peer to invoke chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:44:47 GMT):<br/>
unless you have another way which i can perform unit tests on my chaincodes?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:45:32 GMT):<br/>
But if you are doing mock, then you'd need to modify the mockstub.GetCreator to return a real value - even if just a test value
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:48:29 GMT):<br/>
yes, but i dont need the mock to GetCreator
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:51:54 GMT):<br/>
the getcreator is in my actual chaincode function, problem is.. if i were to do a mockinvoke to test that, the function will fail due to the creator not being the value as expected
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:53:27 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:12:22 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc in your `Init()` for the chaincode are you logging what happens when it does not start up succesfully? I suspect that on line 191 `plp` may not be defined, i'd recommend logging `plp` and `plp.List()` on a new line between 190 and 191 to be sure

<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 19:14:11 GMT):<br/>
In chaincode, how do I get the latest Version of a key (i.e. blockNum and TxNum) without calling GetHistoryForKey() because core.ledger.history.enableHistoryDatabase may be false in general. This info is available to the shim because it will appear in the ReadSet if I call GetState()
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:12:52 GMT):<br/>
@mna2017 ibm wrote a guide here: https://developer.ibm.com/blockchain/2017/03/17/migrate-fabric-v0-6-based-chaincode-run-latest-fabric-v1-0/
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:13:43 GMT):<br/>
@clempo assuming you've been using the same key when updating state with `stub.PutState()` you can grab the latest value the key points to just by using `stub.GetState()`
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:15:09 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith, I asked for the key Version as seen in the ReadSet deep within a BlockInfo. Getting the latest key value is trivial as you point out.
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:17:06 GMT):<br/>
oh so you're looking for the value of a key at a certain point in the keys history? 
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:17:07 GMT):<br/>
What I'm hinting at is GetHistoryForKey() should work for at least one item in the iteration regardless of the db settings. It could possibly work if I tried, but then the function comment needs updating.
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:17:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's what GetHistoryForKey() does but it requires a setting on the engine
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:18:18 GMT):<br/>
I want the latest version even if that setting is off
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:20:02 GMT):<br/>
ok so just to make sure i'm understanding correctly...with enableHistoryDatabase off you want to be able to get an iterator of historic values or one specific value from that iterator
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:20:14 GMT):<br/>
as in a specific block
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:20:14 GMT):<br/>
That should be easy to do for the engine since it puts it in the ReadSet of the transaction
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:20:49 GMT):<br/>
I want to be able to get the first item, the one for the current version, it's already available to the engine to store in the ReadSet
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:21:10 GMT):<br/>
Another function in the shim to do the same is also acceptable
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:27:50 GMT):<br/>
hmm thats a good question. not sure how to access that via the chaincode, @mastersingh24 would be more knowledgeable about this
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:28:29 GMT):<br/>
Did that ring @mastersingh24 automatically, or I need to write the question elsewhere?
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:29:02 GMT):<br/>
another more drastic solution is if the settings is always on
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:29:20 GMT):<br/>
or I can ask my users to always set it
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:29:52 GMT):<br/>
I noticed the iterator returns the value differently than a ReadSet, that's strange
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:30:26 GMT):<br/>
Iterator tells you txid, but ReadSet Version is BlockNum and TxNum
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:35:12 GMT):<br/>
it will ping him. next time he is online, he will come for you. i think whether or not it is enabled really depends on your use case and is decision you can make during network setup
</p>
<p><strong>clempo</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:35:54 GMT):<br/>
I still think the Key Value Storage should give us that info since it maintains it without the help of the db
</p>

Is there a discussion somewhere of the implications/impacts of turning on that setting?

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 20:56:01 GMT):<br/>
they will most likely have more informed opinions about the implication/impact questions you have, as well as accessing the engine readset

@ascatox, @sampath06 is correct, you'll need to use couchdb and perform rich queries using selectors: http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/api/database/find.html#find-selectors
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:49:48 GMT):<br/>
@sampath06 maybe its an issue with checking id's greater than null? if you query for a specific id does it return the proper value?

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 17:34:21 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox you might find it easier to unit test the chaincode with MockStub and only install and instantiate when you have a version you're sure you want to spend the time deploying. Alternatively, you could just use `sendUpgradeProposal`: https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/Channel.html#sendUpgradeProposal__anchor

Someone has a good tutorial different from the official documentation, to start to develop a chaincode. I'm not asking for Go Tutorial, but how to setup a developer environment to test your chaincode in developer mode.

@ArnabChatterjee @mariogemoll you need to make sure that you have the`github.com/golang/protobuf/proto` in your `$GOPATH`. this will let you develop with it locally. to ensure that its available when you install/instantiate, you must vendor your dependencies. i believe fabric recommends govendor for this step

Hi. How do I invoke another chaincode from a chaincode? I found this: func (stub *MockStub) InvokeChaincode(chaincodeName string, args [][]byte, channel string) pb.Response, what is that args is an [][]byte 
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 17:46:00 GMT):<br/>
it was a args []string before
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 18:38:59 GMT):<br/>
@rfrabasile `[][]byte` is an array of byte arrays
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 18:39:29 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith i know, but what does it contain
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 18:40:08 GMT):<br/>
why change array of strings for a matrix of bytes?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 19:15:00 GMT):<br/>
@rfrabasile i believe its because thats what Invoke expects the args to be https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L43
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 19:16:44 GMT):<br/>

Hi. Looking at the insert example for the "map.go", for each insert wouldn't it generate another entry in the db that only has the index name and the content of the field (and a null value). 
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:57:24 GMT):<br/>
indexName := "compositeKeyTest"
compositeKeyTestIndex, err := stub.CreateCompositeKey(indexName, []string{key})
valueByte := []byte{0x00}
if err := stub.PutState(compositeKeyTestIndex, valueByte); err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("Error putting state with compositeKey %s", err)
	return shim.Error(fmt.Sprintf("put operation failed. Error updating state with compositeKey: %s", err))
}
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:58:21 GMT):<br/>
this would create two entries for each insert? the doc with the data and another entry that has the name of the index and the composite key content (and a null value)
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:39:56 GMT):<br/>
@rfrabasile the code snippet you have posted just does one insert of the composite key. you would have to call `PutState` with an key pointing to the data as well
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:41:58 GMT):<br/>
if i where to insert another value in the blockchain, should i repeat the index key? or would i have two more entries(data+new composite index)?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:47:30 GMT):<br/>
the index keys should be unique, otherwise you'll be update the value associated with the original index
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:59:12 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:59:28 GMT):<br/>
so i do end up having two entries in the db for each element i insert
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:59:46 GMT):<br/>
one for the document with the data and one that has a compositekeyindex name
</p>
<p><strong>rfrabasile</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 17:00:00 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 17:26:16 GMT):<br/>
yes, one with the index pointing to the data, and another with the composite key pointing to null

if I install chaincode on 3 peers of a channel that has total number of 5 so when I instantiate chaincode does the endorsement policy exclude those 2 peers by itself even if they are involved in the organisation that endorsed the chaincode

@bmalavan @sampath06 I'm having a similar issue. I can see through the Fauxton UI `mychannel` but when I query through chaincode I get empty results. Investigating a bit further I see that one couch container(the one linked to the peer i've installed my cc) returns all the databases while the others don't

```
$ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/_all_dbs
["_global_changes","_replicator","_users","mychannel"]

$ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:7984/_all_dbs
["_global_changes","_replicator","_users"]

$ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:6984/_all_dbs
["_global_changes","_replicator","_users"]
```
Shouldn't this be distributed to all couch instances? Is there something I'm not getting?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 14:20:03 GMT):<br/>
@rock_martin the endorsement policy should be set before a transaction is run against the chaincode. the chaincode should be installed on all endorsing peers as they submit arguments to the chaincode as part of the transaction flow and return those to the sdk in the proposal response. the endorsement policy has no knowledge of whether or not the chaincode is installed on an endorsing peer, it just expects it to be.
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 21:03:40 GMT):<br/>
@KGiou chaincode is instantiated on a channel basis, but it is installed on a peer basis. if the peer does not have the chaincode installed, why would it have a couchdb instance representing the ledger state?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=BXAubyrKjQudE5ukT) @ArnabChatterjee If you look at the docker compose file you can specify the volumes.

@SudhiBhat - Thanks. I already tried that but that mounts the volume in the peer container and not in the chaincode container. And this results in a file not found exception. :)

There are 3 orgs org1,org2,org3 there are 2 chaincodes with different endorsement policies such as A->AND(org1.member,org2.member), B->AND(org2.member,org3.member). If chaincode A invokes B only on peers of org2 doesn't  the endorsement policy fail?

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 11:30:18 GMT):<br/>
@KGiou yes, the peers all have access to the same ledger data. as of right now, no global installs. and organization is responsible for installing the chaincode on each of its own peers associated with the channel. i don't believe there will ever be a global install in the interest of separating concerns.

Some of the functions are available to all participants, some are designed specifically to be launched only by a restricted group of users. I am curious at what layer (application / fabric client / chaincode) should I focus in order to make sure that given functions of the abovementioned chaincode are executed by eligible participants. Any help with the above will be appreciated.

Thanks @Vadim. Sorry for the basic question, but how to commit a transaction?
</p>

you don't need to to that yourself, peers do that when they receive a block from the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 13:58:58 GMT):<br/>
Does it means, when I getState again, the final value will be change after txn committed?

	// GetState returns the value of the specified `key` from the
	// ledger. Note that GetState doesn't read data from the writeset, which
	// has not been committed to the ledger. In other words, GetState doesn't
	// consider data modified by PutState that has not been committed.
	// If the key does not exist in the state database, (nil, nil) is returned.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 14:14:49 GMT):<br/>
@Jonny that text basically means, that if you do stub.PutState('a', 1) and then immediately stub.GetState('a'), you will not get '1', but some previous value.
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 14:18:32 GMT):<br/>
if I simply stub.PutState('a', 1) and the stub.PutState('a', 2). I will get 2 for stub.GetState('a') after committed. right?

when I run the cli code `peer  chaincode instantiate -o 127.0.0.1:7050 -C mychannel -n mycc -v 1.0 -p  github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02 -c '{"Args":["init","a", "100", "b","200"]}'`,the error is thrown that `Error: unknown shorthand flag: 'p' in -p` , the version is `fabric-v1.0.1`.
How to solve it?

We are trying to build a loan application for user using Hyperledger Fabric and we have just started.
Can some please answer some very basic questions:
1.	Can we build the entire application using the CouchDB, the application would require to upload documents and trasanctions as well.
2.	Can the Couchdb used to store transactional data if yes are the ways we can database modelling to maintain the integrity of the data.
3.  How can i connect from golang to couchdb to maintain user data  details and restrict from other user

I try to debug chaincode (with `--peer-chaincodedev=true` peer start param and standalone started chaincode) and first debug attempt is successful, but when I restart debug session, I get this message: `Duplicate chaincodeID error: name:"hello:0"`. Is it by design? I have only one attempt to debug and then I should change my chaincode Id to continue? :)

@DarshanBc binding is used when we have a chaincode invocation that requires application-layer authentication, independent / agnostic to the fabric. 

So say a chaincode part of application APP with its own PKI. Each user, e.g., Alice, Bob have their own certs under APP's PKI. Now these users have also fabric identities, EnrollmentCerts that would allow them to submit transactions to the Fabric. For APP to authenticate messages invocations need to be signed by their APP certificates' keys. For Fabric to grant them access to a channel they would need to use their Fabric identity keys in transactions. 

Binding ensures that application layer authentication messages (e.g., a signature on the chaincode input) cannot be detached by a potential attacker who would replay this signature on another Fabric transaction of its.

Hi everyone. I want to upgrade Chaincode without deleting the historical data, without re-deployment blockchain network. As I read from the docs it is possible by changing Chaincode version number and keep chaincodeName the same. So I installed my new Chaincode on the same peer and changed the version. Installation is successful, but I can't see the changes. Still accessing old version. What I am missing, any suggestions?

@daanporon assuming the preview comes out as scheduled you should be able to try it by the end of the month. i'm not sure forking fabric would be the best idea if you guys are starting a project now, trying to implement that on your own might be a major time sink.

<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 14:58:36 GMT):<br/>
@daanporon you could also build it from master, which should give you something closer to what will end up in 1.1 https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master

Hi everyone. I have a question regarding Chaincode development. From the examples I can see the difference of the chaincode logic between fabric 0.6 and 1.0. I mean the way how transactions are stored in the ledger. For instance, marbels example in v0.6: transactions were recorded under the particular index, that way by querying that index name we could get all transactions saved on it. Right now, in ver1.0 we don't have index, but there is a CompositeKey, which is a good way to retrieve data, but still without rich queries I think there is not much flexibility to read information. Are those indexes used in earlier versions of fabric chaincode discarded and not recommended? 
</p>
<p><strong>lmars</strong> (Mon, 23 Oct 2017 07:24:14 GMT):<br/>
@BhaskarGandavabi, I suppose, info from https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3218 can help you. But I hope, you know that Java Chaincode support is disabled now... and you should build fabric from source to enable it.
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 23 Oct 2017 12:29:24 GMT):<br/>
@GiorgiBlockchain not entirely sure what you're asking...information about a transaction still associated with a specific index in the state db. are you asking for best practices for querying for multiple transactions?

Hi, I am trying to develop blockchain application related to educational usecase. I want to model student academic lifecycle in chaincode like getting id card from university, getting other sensitive documents etc and these document should be on a blockchain network so that any student can view its entire academic documents... I am completely lost in how to achieve this. Do I need to make separate chaincodes for each document or one chaincode for all documents?  What you guys suggest?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 23 Oct 2017 19:03:11 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid you do not need to write a separate chaincode for each document. if you really want to store the bytes of the documents on the ledger you could, but i am not convinced that would be best implementation

</p>
<p><strong>GiorgiBlockchain</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 05:10:11 GMT):<br/>
 @jrosmith Yes, my question was a bit confusing. Here what I meant: Marbles demo ver1: https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles/blob/v1.0/chaincode/part1/part1_chaincode.go here key/values are stored under particular index `_marbleindex`. On the other hand in new versions, they are stored under specific index passed as an argument. But now from your answer I'm guessing that it just depends our choice and needs. So basically, my question is regarding best practices for querying. Thanks!

@asifrajwani @lmars composer allows you to use javascript to define business logic that gets executed on a generic chaincode written in golang. Fabric v1.1 (due out by end of year, the preview comes out end of month) will have support for chaincode written in node.js. chaincode can also be written in java but it requires building fabric from its source

@GiorgiBlockchain the best way to query for a list of transactions depends on your use case. 

if you're using couchDB you can use rich queries (`shim.GetQueryResult`) to explicitly select a set from the state db, i've found composite keys (`shim.GetStateByPartialCompositeKey) to be useful for getting a particular set. you can also define a range (`shim.GetStateByRange`) and iterate over multiple transactions that way.

i've found going through to `interfaces.go` to be really helpful with understanding my options: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces_stable.go#L104

Hi guys, I have deployed the example "first network" from the blockchain demo. When I run this "./byfn.sh -m up" script, it performs without errors. While the docker is still up and running, I try to run "peer query -C mychannel -n mycc -c {"Args":["query","a"]} and I receive an error "failed to deserialize identity, err MSP DEFAULT is unknown".

Thanks @jrosmith 

I tried `composite keys` and `GetStateByRange` as well. They are really useful. I don't want to use couchDB yet, for now testing all possibilities what we can do using state DB.
So I have this case: Having a struct consisting with the following fields: "ID", "PayID", "UserID", etc. Transactions are saved under "ID", which means I can query each of them by getting state using that "ID". I can query by range as well. 

But what if I want query by UserID, how I can get all transactions related to particular user with all fields? By composite key I can get particular sets as you said, but not everything.
One way I am thinking is to get IDs by composite key related to that User and then query that IDs. Is there any other way I can consider? Thank you!

@GiorgiBlockchain if you don't want to use rich queries then that would be the way to do it. the only downside to this method is that you will have to iterate over each one of those partial composite keys and then dispatch another query for each ledger id

I am trying to do some access control in chaincode .. i cloned the fabric from github and ran ` git checkout master` ( as only this branch has the `cid`) . then i ran `make clean ` and `make docker ` .. i cloned fabric-samples examples from github.. and changed the `balance-tranfer` examples chaincode and ran `./runAPIs.sh` ..on instantiation i got ```
error: [client-utils.js]: sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: error starting container: Failed to generate platform-specific docker build: Error returned from build: 1 "chaincode/input/src/github.com/example_cc/example_cc.go:25:2: cannot find package "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid" in any of:

Hi All! I'm struggling with an issue (and I was discussing #fabric), probably the wrong channel. 
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 08:00:32 GMT):<br/>
I've a network of 4 machines, one orderer and 3 peers. They all joined the same channel
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 08:00:56 GMT):<br/>
In the cli of the peer, I did the peer install, peer instantiate of my chaincode, which is in /opt/gopath/src/
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 08:01:33 GMT):<br/>
I see the newly created docker image of my chaincode (I'm not running in dev mode)
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 08:01:46 GMT):<br/>
and from its logs I see my logs that I've in the Init() method. 
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 08:02:24 GMT):<br/>
The chaincode is installed in all the peers, and the policy is "OR ('GPMSP.member', 'LAB1MSP.member', 'LAB2MSP.member')"
</p>

<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 05:09:51 GMT):<br/>
I am sending an error message from chaincode if there is any error. I am using node sdk how can bring that error msg to the front as a response Error msg ends at logging
</p>
<p><strong>gut</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 07:34:48 GMT):<br/>
Hi @nate94305. I think the infinite loop is not intended, so yes. As far as I know it is the scenario where you want to update your version. Maybe next time you could test your code prior to deploy it :)
</p>
<p><strong>gut</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 07:49:38 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc as you are using the chaincode shim to throw errors, the SDK can get them from the response, which components are status, payload, message and endorser. Then, you can use that message as you want (propagate or log).
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 12:44:23 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc after using `channel.sendTransactionProposal` you will get back a result set, let call it `results`. in the event of the chaincode returning `shim.Error()` the error message will exists in that results set in `results[0][0].message`
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 12:45:18 GMT):<br/>
what is returned in a success is located in `results[0][0].response.payload` 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 12:45:18 GMT):<br/>
the return from `shim.Success()` is located in `results[0][0].response.payload`

Hey guys, I'm getting error: ` too many arguments in call to shim.Error`. Inside the function, I'm calling `shim.Error` three times. Error comes when I keep this line: `return shim.Error("Error: Check the third argument. DateType must be one of 'DateType1', 'DateType2' or 'DateType'.  But got: %v", args[2])`

Full piece of code: ```        if (args[2] != 'DateType1' || args[2] != 'DateType2' || args[2] != 'DateType3') {
        	return shim.Error("Error: Check the third argument. DateType must be one of 'DateType1', 'DateType2' or 'DateType'.  But got: %v", args[2])
        }```
What I'm doing wrong? Is there any restriction using `shim.Error`?
</p>

Can I use chaincode in hyperledger fabric v1 with other blockchain network (eg stellar, ...)?

@GiorgiBlockchain how do you call shim.Error?
</p>
<p><strong>GiorgiBlockchain</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 08:09:34 GMT):<br/>
Just like this I wrote above. 
```func (t *SimpleChaincode) queryByDate(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) pb.Response {
........................... some code

        if (args[2] != 'DateType1' || args[2] != 'DateType2' || args[2] != 'DateType3') {
        	return shim.Error("Error: Check the third argument. DateType must be one of 'DateType1', 'DateType2' or 'DateType'.  But got: %v", args[2])
        }
........................... some code
}```
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 08:11:25 GMT):<br/>
@GiorgiBlockchain shim.Error can take only one arg, you pass two, hence  the error
</p>
<p><strong>gut</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 09:06:47 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim is right. Maybe fmt.Sprintf can help you

<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 11:26:53 GMT):<br/>
Hi All, I am still facing problems. 
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 11:27:02 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand where the chaincode is executed, while NOT in dev mode
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 11:28:40 GMT):<br/>
After the chaincode instantiate command, an additional docker instance starts
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 11:29:18 GMT):<br/>
and there I see just a command "chaincode -peer.address=" the address on port 7051
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 11:29:52 GMT):<br/>
And in the logs I see the output of the Invoke()
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 11:29:52 GMT):<br/>
And in the logs I see the output of the Init()
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 11:30:47 GMT):<br/>
but then, when I invoke it, I always see could not find chaincode with name 'masabd1' - make sure the chaincode masabd1 has been successfully instantiated and try again - <nil>
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 11:31:02 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 11:31:24 GMT):<br/>
Where the chaincode is physically run?
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 11:31:32 GMT):<br/>
what does the "chaincode" command does?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 12:42:59 GMT):<br/>
@mascanc what was the command you used to install/instantiate the chaincode? it's possible the chaincode was installed with a different identifier than you one youre passing. if you're using one of the sdk's there are functions that allow you to query for installed and instantiated chaincodes
</p>
<p><strong>mascanc</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 13:00:24 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith : I instantiated it using the peer chaincode install, and peer chaincode instantiate, the version is still the same (1)

Hi all, 
How am I supposed to instantiate my chaincode when my Init function is not expecting any arguments? I've tried the following but it didn't work.
peer chaincode instantiate -n mycc -v 0 -c '{}' -C myc

</p>
<p><strong>E.Gutarra.Tibco</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 17:58:04 GMT):<br/>
My Init function looks like this:
</p>
<p><strong>E.Gutarra.Tibco</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 17:58:14 GMT):<br/>
func (s *SmartContract) Init(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) sc.Response {

Hi all, I'm trying to create the package for some chaincode I've installed and tested in dev-mode.
</p>
<p><strong>E.Gutarra.Tibco</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 20:31:52 GMT):<br/>
Now I'm reading through the tutorial Chaincode for Operators
</p>
<p><strong>E.Gutarra.Tibco</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 20:32:16 GMT):<br/>
For creating the package it's stating that I need to issue this command: 
</p>
<p><strong>E.Gutarra.Tibco</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 20:32:19 GMT):<br/>
peer chaincode package -n mycc -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02 -v 0 -s -S -i "AND('OrgA.admin')" ccpack.out

</p>
<p><strong>E.Gutarra.Tibco</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 20:32:43 GMT):<br/>
but where am I supposed to run this command from. Which network do I need to have running to do this?
</p>
<p><strong>E.Gutarra.Tibco</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 20:59:42 GMT):<br/>
Or well how do I get the path ... github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02 into the peer container.. I can't find that path in the peer I'm running it from: docker exec -it cli bash

@novira You can easily run fabric 1.0 on Windows, but there is no REST support in 1.0

Hi guys,


I have the following struct for both Wallet & Owner. I need to create both of owner and wallet at the same time and link up together with ownerId in wallet information.

```
// Wallet represents a data of user's wallet
type Wallet struct {
	ObjectType string        `json:"docType"` //field for couchdb
	WalletID   uuid.UUID     `json:"walletId"`
	Balance    int           `json:"balance"`
	WalletType string        `json:"walletType"`
	Enabled    bool          `json:"enabled"`
	Owner      OwnerRelation `json:"owner"`
}

// Owner represents a data of user
type Owner struct {
	ObjectType string    `json:"docType"` //field for couchdb
	UserID     uuid.UUID `json:"userId"`
	Enabled    bool      `json:"enabled"`
}

// OwnerRelation represents a link between Owner and Wallet
type OwnerRelation struct {
	UserID uuid.UUID `json:"userId"`
}
```

Question : Is that possible for me to save both entity during one putState or I need to run twice of putState to achieve this?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 13:27:52 GMT):<br/>
@Jonny  - you would need to do 2 PutState operations (but they will be atomic since they are part of the same transaction)
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 13:28:20 GMT):<br/>
thank you @mastersingh24 
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 13:31:50 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24, before creating a new owner, no need for me to check whether the wallet already existing or not, right? I could simply try to add again and if there is already one, it would throw an error for me?

I'd do the check in chaincode actually in order to avoid rejected transactions during validation
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 13:46:00 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, confuse with the term validation. Is this rejection happen in proposal or endorsement?

Does anyone know how it is possible to globally set the logging level of the flogging logger outside the code? Just pretend like I'm a real noob
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 15:02:48 GMT):<br/>
@Jonny  - I would do the check in chaincode and return an error if the wallet already exists.  You would not want to rely on the validation/commit process (which happens once peers get blocks from the orderer)

Is anyone has idea of designing data struct for bank clearing and settlement?  The 
 balance of bank account  will be updated by multi users in their payment transaction,  only the 1st transaction will update bank account(asset) successfully if these transactions are in the same block .    is fabric suitable for bank clearing and settlement?

</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:13:07 GMT):<br/>
why not? Just make a rich query over transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:13:37 GMT):<br/>
it's a matter of data representation / model
</p>
<p><strong>tim_zeng</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:16:31 GMT):<br/>
first , rich query is querying against value not  key, you have to convert coposite key in the high throught solution to value
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:26:39 GMT):<br/>
@tim_zeng I then suggest you that for a key you use some unique key (e.g. tx id), and use the actual key which you are going to use for searching as a model property, then you can run queries on it.

Hello All, 

I am new to Hyperledger Fabric. 
Is it possible with the chaincode (Smart contract) to use a hash map and store a set of key value pairs (Where key is the user address/public-key/any unique ID which links back to user and the value is a number).
In my app, when the user wants something the user will start a transaction and this transaction will intern trigger the chaincode which has the hashmap stored and based on the user unique ID the hash lookup in the chaincode will return the value. I want to store this value back on the ledger with the user key. 
Can this be done on Fabric? 
If someone knows anything about this, please help me out. 

-Thanks
</p>

@isahilsharma If you want to run your own chaincode you'll need to do some changes inside the startFabric.sh script

<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Sat, 11 Nov 2017 15:51:58 GMT):<br/>
you'll need to change the path from 'github.com/fabcar' to '../../../my-chain-code/go'
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Sat, 11 Nov 2017 15:54:07 GMT):<br/>
I've did some experimenting to use chaincode instead of go inside the samples repo. I had to rewire also the scripts to use a different path + use node.js language  (which is set using the -l option)

@janb87 how do you reproduce this?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:45:35 GMT):<br/>
is this the master branch or release?
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:45:39 GMT):<br/>
I have it all the time now, yesterday no problem
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:46:43 GMT):<br/>
release branch, 1.1.0-preview docker images
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:47:26 GMT):<br/>
FAB-6969 is logged today, so thought it maybe relates to this issue which I only started having from today
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:49:37 GMT):<br/>
@janb87  - yes - this is the issue
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:50:28 GMT):<br/>
ok I got this
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:50:33 GMT):<br/>
It will happen on all branches and for all released Docker images which attempt to use the sampleconfig
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:50:45 GMT):<br/>
the identity mapper is initialized with an outdated cert
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:50:54 GMT):<br/>
and then the callback:
```
func(pkiID common.PKIidType, identity api.PeerIdentityType) {
		g.comm.CloseConn(&comm.RemotePeer{PKIID: pkiID})
		g.certPuller.Remove(string(pkiID))
	})
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:50:55 GMT):<br/>
is run
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:51:01 GMT):<br/>
which, calls `g.comm.CloseConn(&comm.RemotePeer{PKIID: pkiID})`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:51:09 GMT):<br/>
but the comm is only initialized after the identity mapper is initialized
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:51:14 GMT):<br/>
(a few lines below)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:51:35 GMT):<br/>
ah - yeah - makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:51:41 GMT):<br/>
But, we should never reach this state, as the MSP should check if the signing identity is expired, and panic! 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:51:47 GMT):<br/>
and the MSP is initialized before gossip is....

I'm not able though to update the "orderer.block" file and the "myc.tx" file using "script.sh" (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release/chaincode-docker-devmode/script.sh). Looks like this script.sh needs an update. Anybody know s how to fix this?

@Jonny chaincode instantiation is on a per channel basis, chaincode installation is on a per peer basis. you only need to call instantiate once

Hello, could some one explain how can I upgrade the chaincode on a fabric-sample blockchain? I run the install command and everything is ok, then I run the upgrade and also it is ok. But I discovered that it continue to load standard chaincode and not my modified chaincode. I'using the command `docker exec -e "CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP" -e "CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp" cli peer chaincode install -n fabcar -v 1.4 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/cc` but I get `path to chaincode does not exist`
</p>
<p><strong>swettdj</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:29:55 GMT):<br/>
could someone help me?
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 19:01:34 GMT):<br/>
@swettdj I am not as far along as you with getting my hands dirty, but looking at the `-p` flag, which presumably is short for "path", the URI "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/cc" doesn't exist. Perhaps the "cc" (short for "Chain Code"?) is now replaced with "chaincode"? 
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 19:01:59 GMT):<br/>
Looking on github.com via a browser I see: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release/peer/chaincode, and not https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release/peer/cc
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 19:02:52 GMT):<br/>
So modify your command's `-p` flag to this and see what happens. If it doesn't work, then I'm out of ideas already!

```
-p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/chaincode
```
</p>

<p><strong>swettdj</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 07:56:48 GMT):<br/>
@theruss `-p` flag should specify the path, but I'm trying  to understand which kind of path because if I set my local machine path I get `path to chaincode does not exist` If I put my chain code on my github repository and set its path, the problem is the same.

hi, we are trying to setup the 1.1 preview with node.js chaincode ... but when we instantiate the chaincode it times out ... 
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:29:36 GMT):<br/>
we saw in the code that when you enable TLS, mutual TLS is enabled by default? but we didn't configure anything for mutual tls ... could this be our issue?
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:30:13 GMT):<br/>
it suspects a CORE_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH and CORE_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:30:39 GMT):<br/>
and they are there but we don't know if they are the correct ones
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:48:06 GMT):<br/>
we see that it sends a chat message i think the register one ... but we don't get a response or anything :/

I need help on the implementation of a query service so I can mock this feature for testing
```
func (stub *MockStub) GetQueryResult(query string) (StateQueryIteratorInterface, error) {
	// Not implemented since the mock engine does not have a query engine.
	// However, a very simple query engine that supports string matching
	// could be implemented to test that the framework supports queries
	return nil, errors.New("not implemented")
}
```

<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 19:44:55 GMT):<br/>
@here could we add an option to specifiy the 'ssl-target-name-override' for fabric-shim?
Currently it's not possible to specify this option. Probably an environment variable would be best. As it's done for the pem option.
See https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/blob/master/src/lib/chaincode.js#L100
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 20:39:01 GMT):<br/>
@janb87  why do you need this?
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:55:53 GMT):<br/>
We are trying to run node.js chaincode but we get a timeout from the peer. Inside the logging of the chaincode container we can see it send a chat to the peer but it looks like the peer never received it.
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:56:47 GMT):<br/>
I looked into the code and saw some notes that you need to have mutual tls enabled. We currently don't have this. 
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:57:13 GMT):<br/>
I thought that maybe using the ssl-target-name-override would be an option to get around this but it didn't work. 
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:57:27 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Is there some documentation on how to setup mutual TLS?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:59:12 GMT):<br/>
@janb87 with mutual tls, peer would still receive the request, so I guess that's not the reason
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:03:01 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim i'm working with jan on the project ... do you have any idea how we best proceed into debugging this because right now we have no clue where to look :( we see the chaincode sending a chat message but it doesn't receive anything
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:05:36 GMT):<br/>
@janb87  I don't understand
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:05:42 GMT):<br/>
you're saying you're using node.js chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:05:46 GMT):<br/>
are you using dev mode or not?
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:06:11 GMT):<br/>
we are not using dev mode
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:06:50 GMT):<br/>
we also have go code which is working, only facing issue with node.js
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:07:48 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/blob/master/src/lib/chaincode.js#L103-L104
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:07:53 GMT):<br/>
so you need to set these env vars
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:09:38 GMT):<br/>
that was our question we need this for mutual TLS ... but based on which certificate are these generated?
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:10:11 GMT):<br/>
does the peer generate them automatically? Because for some reason they are set and they are available inside the chaincode container ... but we don't know where they come from
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:10:19 GMT):<br/>
right exactly
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:10:25 GMT):<br/>
so, the peer generates a certificate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:10:31 GMT):<br/>
injects it into the container ;)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:10:42 GMT):<br/>
and the certificate is signed by the peer
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:10:57 GMT):<br/>
does the peer tls certificate needs to be a CA:TRUE then?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:11:18 GMT):<br/>
so, I don't think it should, however I don't think the `crypto/tls` library enforces it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:11:28 GMT):<br/>
do you mean the root CA cert?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:11:39 GMT):<br/>
it's not a certificate of the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:11:45 GMT):<br/>
it's a certificate that the peer generates itself
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:11:54 GMT):<br/>
it generates the entire validation chain itself
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:11:56 GMT):<br/>
at startup
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:12:18 GMT):<br/>
but as @Vadim explained if it's an issue with mutual TLS then the peer should receive a packet from the chaincode container ... but we don't see any packet comming in
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:13:12 GMT):<br/>
the root certificate we are providing is the combined certificate of the peer and all his intermediate certificates all the way to the root one ...
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:14:08 GMT):<br/>
the first one inside that certificate is the root one so ... root > intermediate > intermediate > leaf certificate
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:14:39 GMT):<br/>
btw, probably forgot to mention this but the GO code is working without any issues ... does this also enforces mutual TLS? because we didn't do anything different for that one
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:22:29 GMT):<br/>
@daanporon have you tried to run first-network from master? It has an option to deploy a nodejs chaincode. Just to see if that works.
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:25:51 GMT):<br/>
no, we've setup a dev environment where the nodejs is working
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:26:07 GMT):<br/>
i've tried it using the basic-network
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:26:58 GMT):<br/>
@janb87 you tried to deploy nodejs chaincode on basic-network, did it work?
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:27:24 GMT):<br/>
yes it worked fine
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:27:30 GMT):<br/>
but it's not using tls
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:27:44 GMT):<br/>
and if you deploy your nodejs chaincode, does it work?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:27:44 GMT):<br/>
and if you deploy your nodejs chaincode on basic-network, does it work?
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:28:10 GMT):<br/>
yes in the basic-network the nodejs is working just fine
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:28:21 GMT):<br/>
so it's a problem with your setup then
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:28:28 GMT):<br/>
but now we try to get it running on our multiple machine setup inside aws ... where we generated all the certificates ourself
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:28:50 GMT):<br/>
and we don't know what we are doing wrong ... go code is running fine ... 
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:29:25 GMT):<br/>
so there needs to be a difference between GO and NodeJS chaincode that we are missing
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:29:39 GMT):<br/>
and that's why we thought it had something to do with the mutual TLS
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:29:58 GMT):<br/>
are you sure the peer is reachable at all from the chaincode container?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:30:04 GMT):<br/>
maybe it's some network issue?
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:30:43 GMT):<br/>
yes the peer is reachable, we tried pinging it
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:31:21 GMT):<br/>
is GO also using port 7052? and does it also enforce mutual TLS?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:31:40 GMT):<br/>
I think on 7052 there is no tls and it's for dev mode only
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:32:27 GMT):<br/>
however the fact that golang works is confusing 
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:33:26 GMT):<br/>
we see that when the nodejs is executed it is using 7052 outside of the dev env
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:33:55 GMT):<br/>
it does this: > mychaincode@1.0.2 start /usr/local/src
> CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_SHIM=DEBUG node chaincode.js "--peer.address" "peer1.hostname.be:7052"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:34:06 GMT):<br/>
on 7052 there is ONLY CHAINCODE
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:34:09 GMT):<br/>
regardless of TLS or not
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:35:09 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm so golang is also connecting to 7052?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:35:13 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:35:15 GMT):<br/>
yup
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:35:16 GMT):<br/>
any chaincode type
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:35:19 GMT):<br/>
we checked that as well
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:35:19 GMT):<br/>
it has to
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:35:41 GMT):<br/>
look, @daanporon  - have you configured the 2 env vars?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:35:44 GMT):<br/>
that I pasted above
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:35:58 GMT):<br/>
ok, the video on youtube about nodejs chaincode got me confused about 7052
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:36:18 GMT):<br/>
oh wait a second
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:36:23 GMT):<br/>
we don't pass them anymore as env vars...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:36:47 GMT):<br/>
look please open a JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:36:56 GMT):<br/>
and tag me and @jimthematrix 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:37:03 GMT):<br/>

What in the video made you confused?
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:37:30 GMT):<br/>
but we don't know how those are generated ... because we never did this
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:37:38 GMT):<br/>
because he uses chaincode in dev mode and opens ports 7052 at the same time
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:37:49 GMT):<br/>
lets make an experiment ok? 
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:37:53 GMT):<br/>
the CORE_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH and the CORE_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:37:58 GMT):<br/>
oh wait you can't do that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:38:05 GMT):<br/>
someone needs to set the env vars in the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:38:43 GMT):<br/>
the problem is our environment at the moment is quiet complex ... and we don't really know where the issue is 
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:39:02 GMT):<br/>
but the go code is running and the nodejs code isn't
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:39:07 GMT):<br/>
>  because he uses chaincode in dev mode and opens ports 7052 at the same time 
 @Vadim  - chaincode uses 7052
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:39:09 GMT):<br/>
inside the same network
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:39:14 GMT):<br/>
regardless of devmode, TLS, or not :)
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:39:27 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm ok, no problem. I told you why I was confused.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:39:37 GMT):<br/>
right, I'm reiterating for the viewers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:39:53 GMT):<br/>
so can you please open a JIRA and tag me and @jimthematrix  ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:44:28 GMT):<br/>
>  they are set, I checked the chaincode container
oh really?
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:44:29 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm is it possible to provide you the private key to our network? so that you can see what's happening there?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:45:23 GMT):<br/>
wait that's not necessary
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:45:33 GMT):<br/>
we can solve it without you compromising your environment
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:45:59 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm while the container is busy with timing out we have time to see which environment variables are set
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:45:59 GMT):<br/>
are you available in an hour from now? maybe we can do a google hangout and I'll take a look
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:46:16 GMT):<br/>
> while the container is busy with timing out we have time to see which environment variables are set 
oh I see
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:46:21 GMT):<br/>
so the environment variables are set...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:46:40 GMT):<br/>
is there a way you can perhaps do `cat /etc/hyperledger/fabric/client.crt`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:46:43 GMT):<br/>
while the container is running
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:46:45 GMT):<br/>
yups, we only don't know how those are generated
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:46:51 GMT):<br/>
yups we did that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:46:55 GMT):<br/>
show me the output
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:47:00 GMT):<br/>
it's a PEM and it's not classified
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:47:05 GMT):<br/>
since it's generated by the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:47:26 GMT):<br/>
send it to me in a private message though just in case
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:50:16 GMT):<br/>
i've send them to you through private message
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:50:33 GMT):<br/>
we are available within an hour to do a hangout call if needed

@yacovm @Vadim We figured out the issue with the peer timing out when instantiating node.js chaincode. 
The url was somehow converted into lowercase "epeer1.vlaanderen.be" where the DNS in our docker network was case sensitive "EPeer1.vlaanderen.be".
Probably in Go the casing was kept that is why it was working there and not in node.js.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:21:30 GMT):<br/>
is docker DNS case sensitive?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:23:40 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I just tried, it does make a difference, i.e. `ping peer0` works, but `ping Peer0`does not

I know this is probably not enough info to diagnose the issue, but basically I think the chaincode container is not properly created when I call instantiate 
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:01:08 GMT):<br/>
are you able to see the docker container for the chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>ashablyg</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:02:26 GMT):<br/>
While i try to instantiate or just in general?
</p>
<p><strong>ashablyg</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:02:55 GMT):<br/>
Currently I have 3 peer containers, 1 orderer and 1 cli 
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:03:29 GMT):<br/>
when you instantiate it
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:03:41 GMT):<br/>
you should install it and then instantiate
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:03:55 GMT):<br/>
on instantiation you should see new docker containers apearing
</p>
<p><strong>ashablyg</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:03:56 GMT):<br/>
So I got it to install 
</p>
<p><strong>ashablyg</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:04:04 GMT):<br/>

watch -n 1 --differences docker ps

<p><strong>ashablyg</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:06:29 GMT):<br/>

 @jimthematrix I have reported an issue related to node.js chaincode (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7001). I've updated the ticket information as we figured out the actual cause of the issue. We worked around the issue for now by lowercasing all our urls. I've also added some info on which code is causing the issue.

@albert.lacambra Everything seems to be in order. Maybe it's a miss match with CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_blockchaindme? Under Networks i have it as 'blockchaindme' but ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME} env is set to 'net'

<p><strong>ashablyg</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:22:50 GMT):<br/>
However, looking through the logs on one of the peers i did find this:

@ashablyg do you happen to have capital case letters in your peer address?
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:25:44 GMT):<br/>

Here's how I try to instantiate the chaincode after I get OK on install: 
</p>
<p><strong>ashablyg</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:31:27 GMT):<br/>
peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.*****.com:7050 --tls --cafile $CA_CERT_FILE -C $CHANNEL_NAME -n marbles -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":["initMarble", "marble1", "13", "doe"]}' -P "OR ('P*****MSP.member', 'P****MSP.member')"

</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:43:18 GMT):<br/>
@ashablyg you should check the logs of the chaincode container, maybe it crashed for some reason. The peer just times out because it never got a response back. 
</p>
<p><strong>janb87</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:43:30 GMT):<br/>

This code does not, what you would expect
```
	APIstub.PutState("key", []byte("initial Value"))
	val, _ := APIstub.GetState("key")
	fmt.Println("value from ledger", string(val))

The putState is not applied immediately, but only after the transaction!

<p><strong>tbltzk</strong> (Sat, 18 Nov 2017 13:41:32 GMT):<br/>
So if I have multiple modifications on a ledger value, it is the responsibility of the chaincode, to keep track of this? This is a huge pitfall IMO!

@tbltzk endorse-order-commit ... that is the flow. state changes are committed only after required participants have endorsed the changes, transactions have been ordererd into a block and the committer makes sure required endorsements are in each Transaction. 
</p>

ok, but *within a transaction* I want multiple modifications to the same value batched, right?

I'm encountering errors while building my chaincode docker image -- am I required to vendor github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/peer and github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim ?  It seems like this stuff should be in the fabric-ccenv docker image, but I searched the image and didn't find it.
</p>
<p><strong>tbltzk</strong> (Sun, 19 Nov 2017 17:09:45 GMT):<br/>
did you check the $GOPATH in ccenv container. The chaincode on the host machine has to be mounted into the right location on the go path. This is also where the dependencies should be located. something like `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/...`
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 01:36:06 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, in the ccenv container, GOPATH is set to /opt/gopath.  I'm not sure how to check if the source is correctly mounted in a running ccenv container though.

@daanporon don't use @ here, just ask your question and be patient
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 15:03:49 GMT):<br/>
you are allowed to invoke functions in other cc, so if you want to get a data, write a chaincode function which will return that data
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 15:04:14 GMT):<br/>
other than that, the chaincodes' data are isolated from each other

@Amjadnz that;'s likely a red herring ... assuming you are instantiating a CC, I suspect the chaincode never came up

your ip seems to have a typo. Should be 127.0.0.1 not 127.0.0.11. The port also looks weird. should be :7051 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 12:22:45 GMT):<br/>
@stepf do you really have a peer named "peer" running in your network?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 12:23:36 GMT):<br/>
@tbltzk 127.0.0.11 is an address of the docker dns server, port 53 is a standard dns service port

<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 22:23:18 GMT):<br/>
Removed all the lingering CC images. Still the same issue - would try disabling TLS on all the nodes and check again

</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 22:33:00 GMT):<br/>
Now disabling TLS tried again - the above message. Looks like  I already have the name registered as chaincode ID.

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 22:33:26 GMT):<br/>
right... not sure what's in your env, but at least you can fix everything else and get back to TLS

Hi guys! 

I'm running the docker containers on (Ubuntu) VM. After shutting down the server containers were exited. I started all peers, orderer and both fabric-ca. But can't start containers with installed chaincodes, they are exited instantly after I run the docker start command. Error message:

Do I need to remove those containers and install chaincode again? That case data will be lost I suppouse. What is the solution here? 
Thank you, cheers !

@GiorgiBlockchain the cc containers will be launched automatically if you try to query/invoke something
</p>
<p><strong>GiorgiBlockchain</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 09:12:56 GMT):<br/>
Indeed. They started automatically. Thanks @Vadim

hey there! I have a fundamental question. suppose there are two organisations and four peers(2 each) for both the organisations!
Now I create 2 users for both the organisations, say user 1 and 2 belong to org1 and user 3 and 4 belong to org 2. Can i create a channel between users(1,3) and (2,4) and deploy specific chain codes or each of them?
All i want to know is if a channel is at a peer level or user level. Thanks in Advance!
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 13:35:54 GMT):<br/>
@Raghuvamz channel is at the peer level

Hello shall i user fabric or composer for development of block chain applications?
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:03:45 GMT):<br/>
omposer creates a default channel and we can write smart contract between participants so whats the use of chaincode provided by fabric??? is it provides the same thing we can achieve by composer??
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:12:16 GMT):<br/>
@yogesh.fulsunge yes, but composer models the financial world, while using fabric directly is more generic and universal
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:22:26 GMT):<br/>
which ones to be used?? can composer create a private channel ??
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:22:49 GMT):<br/>
the application which is developed in composer can also be done in fabric then which one to be used?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:23:19 GMT):<br/>
which best suits your needs
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:23:40 GMT):<br/>
in composer, most likely, you will write less code
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:23:58 GMT):<br/>
i am looking for some use cases which we can have permissioned relationships
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:24:03 GMT):<br/>
also, on #composer channel you will most likely get more detailed answers
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:24:53 GMT):<br/>
but whether composer provides all features which fabric provides like consessus, smart contract, permissioned relationships
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:25:32 GMT):<br/>
composer is in a nutschell a specialized chaincode which runs on top of standard fabric
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:25:54 GMT):<br/>
so yes, it implicitly provides all features
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:27:11 GMT):<br/>
so it will be good if i use composer and implement the business use cases to be shown to customer and don't write chaincode in fabric
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:27:12 GMT):<br/>
???
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:28:24 GMT):<br/>
the concept of chaincode is there in fabric i guess it won't be required then ?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:32:42 GMT):<br/>
@yogesh.fulsunge if you use composer, you dont directly write chaincode. But the business logic you implement in composer will end up in some fabric chaincode which composer manages for you,
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:32:42 GMT):<br/>
@yogesh.fulsunge if you use composer, you dont directly write chaincode. But the business logic you implement in composer will end up in some fabric chaincode which composer manages for you
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:33:09 GMT):<br/>
so you still need to write some code, if that is what you were asking
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:33:28 GMT):<br/>
yes i have written some sample application on composer
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:33:47 GMT):<br/>
then i have gone through the fabric samples and tried to run some of fabric applications
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:34:27 GMT):<br/>
i am confused which one to be used shall i write my use case in fabric or shall i use composer? 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:35:04 GMT):<br/>
depends on your use case
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:35:19 GMT):<br/>
there is no clear answer
</p>
<p><strong>yogesh.fulsunge</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:38:05 GMT):<br/>
the Real World use case can be written in composer ? which creates private channel between nodes and joins them to the channel then execute chaincode to acomplish business transactions ????
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:39:50 GMT):<br/>
I think the network config you should do yourself, but you'd better verify that on #composer

Hi guys , 
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:09:18 GMT):<br/>
Hi guys,

    For hyperledger images version "x86_64-1.1.0-preview" while running nodejs code for "fabcar" its working fine but when I run the same code for my custom network with changed values I am getting
the following error:
Store path:/scratch/Hyperledger1.0/fabric-test-multihost/fabric-ccenv-1.2/nodejs/hfc-key-store
Successfully loaded user1 from persistence
error: [client-utils.js]: sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: Failed to deserialize creator identity, err the supplied identity is not valid: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority

I have a doubt in what should be the value of affliation while registering the user using "registerUser.js" 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:11:32 GMT):<br/>
@Amit04Patel how did you obtain the identity you use to query the network?
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:14:41 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim before running query.js i ran enrollAdmin.js and registerUser.js 
gave admin name as admin and pass as adminpw which is mentioned in docker-compose file 
and for registerUser,js i gave a random name of the user .

</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:15:17 GMT):<br/>
so you have a CA? And the network is provisioned with cryptogen?
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:15:30 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:15:53 GMT):<br/>
did you provide correct root CA cert & key to the CA?
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:17:18 GMT):<br/>
if you meant in docker-compose file I am using the same logic to provide key location and values as done in basic-network
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:18:07 GMT):<br/>
but the key values in hfc-key-store are generated by running the js codes
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:18:53 GMT):<br/>
the error message you have implies that the identity you obtain from the CA is not trusted by the network, which means that the CA uses the wrong certs to sign. Make sure these are the certs you obtain from cryptogen.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:19:58 GMT):<br/>
you have to compare the cert and key the CA uses with the cert from peerOrganizations/orgXXX/ca folder
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:19:58 GMT):<br/>
you have to compare the cert and key the CA uses with the cert from peerOrganizations/orgXXX/ca folder
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:23:30 GMT):<br/>
what should be the value of affiliation in "registerUser.js" if I use any other value than "org1.department1" its not able to register
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:24:31 GMT):<br/>
it's configured in fabric-ca-server.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:25:56 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=LpNQtnyHz5riJ7zME) @Vadim 
the certs location in docker-compose file are correct only 
did you mean i have to compare the values between hfc-key-store folder and peerOrganizations/orgXXX/ca folde
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:26:25 GMT):<br/>
no, I meant to compare what CA is uses as its root cert/key
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:27:51 GMT):<br/>
where i can find this file "fabric-ca-server.yaml " is it in fabric samples folder
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:32:43 GMT):<br/>
no, it's in the CA container, I'm not sure if that one is mounted to the host or not
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:32:58 GMT):<br/>
you have to provide that yourself
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:36:31 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim thanks it worked there was some error in my compose file only one dot(.) was missing 
</p>
<p><strong>Amit04Patel</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:41:05 GMT):<br/>

is there any way i can provide a custom value for affiliation in "registerUser.js"

<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:33:21 GMT):<br/>
hi guys. can someone confirm that if I'm generating random id at chaincode level, the value return will be difference for both proposal and endorsement. I assume that, allow chaincode to generate id is not a good practice if the design is to use the id as a part of response to client. 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:33:56 GMT):<br/>
@Jonny if you generate something random in the cc, then all endorsements will differ
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:34:44 GMT):<br/>
it will be difference for all node? 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:35:23 GMT):<br/>
each node will generate its own random, so you will get different results accross node
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:35:23 GMT):<br/>
each node will generate its own random, so you will get different results accross nodes
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:36:20 GMT):<br/>
Oh, can I say that, allowing chaincode to generate a random id is a really bad design? am I correct?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:36:48 GMT):<br/>
aha
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:37:24 GMT):<br/>
Ah, seems like I need to change to whole program then. Thank you for the confirmation @Vadim 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:37:41 GMT):<br/>
you can use txid if you want something unique
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:39:10 GMT):<br/>
I'm using uuid currently.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:41:27 GMT):<br/>
it it unique?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:41:27 GMT):<br/>
is it unique?
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:41:55 GMT):<br/>
yes, but generated at chaincode level. as you said, it will be differ for each endorsements 
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:43:24 GMT):<br/>
Other than txid, is that any way I can use something that I can customize to ensure the value will be same across the network?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:44:02 GMT):<br/>
pass it from the application when you invoke
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:44:32 GMT):<br/>
means, the value will be from client sdk for example
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:44:34 GMT):<br/>
right?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:45:23 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:48:41 GMT):<br/>
Any possibility to ask chaincode to generate the value during proposal and use the same for each endorsement?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:51:19 GMT):<br/>
each chaincode instance running on a peer is executed independently from other chaincodes, so you have to make sure they run deterministically. YOu can only achieve that by not generating anything random within a chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:56:13 GMT):<br/>
I think that's really a clear explanation. Appreciate it. 
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 12:04:18 GMT):<br/>
Sorry @Vadim, may I know when I query the record from each peer (including peer from other organization) how can the value of the generated id is same for the all peer (the only difference is value from the proposal
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 12:08:37 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 12:08:52 GMT):<br/>
why do you need to generate id to query?
</p>
<p><strong>Jonny</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 12:09:59 GMT):<br/>
Sorry. the id was generated during invoke already. I just requery for confirmation how it looks like at the ledger

Hi. When i generate a query like this: {"selector":{"ID":{"$in":["111"] } } } I get it transformed to this: {"selector":{"data.ID":{"$in":["data.111"] } } } , is there anyway to avoid the data on the $in??

@rfrabasile Please open a bug in Fabric Jira.  The data wrapper should get injected before the top level field name, but not within the $in.  @chris.elder FYI.

Hey team, question, did the Fabric ramp up script remove the -l option to choose node instead of golang? (./byfn.sh -m up -l node no longer works)

Need urgent help please....how to get the history of all the transactions like create asset, update asset, delete asset, transactions related to update etc from different registries sequentially.  Want to simulate same as we see "All transactions" in PlayGround.  In historian APIs it is just giving the transactionid but not the attributes.  All other explorer APIs provides the information respective to specific repositories..But I need all transactions (different APIs) in one call....

using REST APIs how to execute transactions using user roles so that i can identify which user has performed what transaction?
the REST APIS i have generated can execute the transaction but there is not user which is registered and enrolled i think by default it is using admin but i need to know which customers have performed what transactions

@gut they are the part of a certificate, so if you manage to pass a proper creator cert to mockstub, it will be correctly parsed

something that can't be faked

or maybe get access to the original request ... if chaincode1 invokes chaincode2 ... check in chaincode2 which was the request invoked on chaincode1

@daanporon the original Proposal is always passed to the chaincodes
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 14:57:30 GMT):<br/>
so in the special case of 1 chaincode calling aniother, you can get the calling chaincode ID from the Proposal's header with a bit protobuf unmarshalling

we are using the following node.js chaincode and the argument printed contains the chaincodename and chaincodefunction from the initial proposal ... i don't know why because i just did the same as is done in de stub and i get a different result (i thought this would have given me the chaincodename and function of the current proposal) ... but anyhow i get the response i want ... the only thing is that there are special characters in front of it and after it and i don't know why :( any idea? and is this the way to do this? also is it safe to do this, can't this be faked somehow?

@Chalex to call cc from another cc, you can use stub.InvokeChaincode(), but note, that it only works for read queries if the chaincodes are on different channels, see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L66-L80

I think I have something misconfigured while compiling with Golang: `main` is the package name for the chaincode start point code in  my application. Then, I have other packages inside that app (controller, model, etc.). 
That code is already running on the servers. But when I try to run my tests locally, the `go install` command run automatically by Goland after `go build` is leading me into `permission denied`. The trace is `go install tecnalia/lab: open bin/lab: permission denied` because go build has no output.
If I run tests with `package lab` it works. If I run them with `package main` it fails.
</p>

I think it has to do with this fact, because when compiling a simple-one-file chaincode, it works like a charm. 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 09:28:32 GMT):<br/>
@gut I have many files in my chaincode, all of them with subpackages are located in the folder called "chaincode", the main file is called "project_name.go" and it's in "package main". All files are in $GOPATH. Works for me without problems.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 09:29:24 GMT):<br/>
perhaps for you the problem is that it tries to put the compiled file into $GOPATH/bin, but it's not writable by the user which executes "go build"

hi, we are invoking chaincode from another chaincode and sometimes we get an error: "error executing chaincode: failed to execute transaction: error sending: txid: 8D443...c085 exists" so it tries to invoke other chaincode and we direcly get an error back telling us the txid already exists, but we don't know where and why it's throwing this error
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 10:59:09 GMT):<br/>
@daanporon chaincodes on different channels?
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 10:59:16 GMT):<br/>
same channel
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 10:59:45 GMT):<br/>
it should work
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:00:30 GMT):<br/>
yes, most of the time it works ... but for some reason we sometimes get this
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:00:42 GMT):<br/>
seems like something wrong in your client app
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:01:12 GMT):<br/>
don't think it has anything to do with cc calling another cc
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:01:24 GMT):<br/>
ok, i'll have a look at the client then
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:01:39 GMT):<br/>
but then it's weird that it only happens when invoking the second cc 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:02:01 GMT):<br/>
what you invoke the second cc from the app?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:02:01 GMT):<br/>
you invoke the second cc from the app?
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:02:44 GMT):<br/>
i invoke cc1 and that one invokes cc2
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:02:51 GMT):<br/>
cc1 is invoked from the app
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:03:01 GMT):<br/>
and then with the second invoke we sometimes get the error
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:03:51 GMT):<br/>
where does the second invoke come from?
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:04:04 GMT):<br/>
from the first chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:04:07 GMT):<br/>
cc1
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:04:23 GMT):<br/>
why do you think it's caused by that?
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:05:59 GMT):<br/>
because i can see that the error is thrown then

```
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:07:14 GMT):<br/>
so app invokes cc1, cc1 invokes cc2 ... retrieves an answer, cc1 invokes cc3 and then this error occurs
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:07:31 GMT):<br/>
@daanporon but txid is generated by the client app
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:08:04 GMT):<br/>
afaik when cc executes cc, the resulting rwset is just added to the current tx
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:08:05 GMT):<br/>
and sometimes it just works ... so it seems like a timing issue
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:08:38 GMT):<br/>
yes, perhaps in you client app? It somehow not synchonized and reuses the same txid for another transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:09:39 GMT):<br/>
no because then when the app invokes cc1 it should throw the error already? or when cc1 invokes cc2? because all of these transactions are using the same txId (which was generated from the app) ... but it throws the error when cc1 invokes cc3
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:10:08 GMT):<br/>
it's not different transactions, it's all the same
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:10:44 GMT):<br/>
yep, but for some reason the error is thrown when cc1 invokes cc3 ... while preparing the message

<p><strong>mna2016</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:12:17 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim Although composer framework now makes development much easier, can there be a need to still code chaincode/smart contracts using golang? Are there any things that can only be done using golang chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:12:41 GMT):<br/>
@mna2016 ask on #composer, I'm not using it
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:13:57 GMT):<br/>
@daanporon you tried this on master? Maybe it's some bug.
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:14:28 GMT):<br/>
i think deleteTxContext (inside Handler) isn't called yet from the previous chaincode that was invoked
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:14:32 GMT):<br/>
so it is still locked

@daanporon are you sure you are on preview? because the link you gave is for release branch
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:17:45 GMT):<br/>
which is 1.0.5
</p>
<p><strong>daanporon</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:18:27 GMT):<br/>
we are running preview in our network ... but right now i'm trying to understand what is happening behind the scenes ... and this code is still more or less the same
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:18:47 GMT):<br/>

however when calling the method on the same channel i have no problem at all

any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 13:00:40 GMT):<br/>
@samdeir has the peer joined both channels?
</p>
<p><strong>samdeir</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 13:01:21 GMT):<br/>
so i got channel foo and bar
</p>
<p><strong>samdeir</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 13:01:31 GMT):<br/>
both installed the same chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>samdeir</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 13:01:45 GMT):<br/>
each channel has 2 peers
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 13:02:20 GMT):<br/>
the peer needs to be a part of both channels if you do cross-channel invoke
</p>
<p><strong>samdeir</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 13:03:17 GMT):<br/>
even query?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 13:04:47 GMT):<br/>
yes, and only query is possible btw

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 15:02:39 GMT):<br/>
not really sure how to go about further debugging, is it referencing a grpc channel here?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 19:15:02 GMT):<br/>
i've looked into this further, and the only place i'm seeing `channel exists` is in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/shim/handler.go

the workflow for this transaction involves 6 calls to `GetState()`, up to 6 calls to `GetQueryResult`, and then 7 calls to `PutState()` all in the same invoke. is it possible that these are stepping on each other and thats why I'm getting `channel exists`? 
</p>

<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 19:15:21 GMT):<br/>
so we need to use the sampleconfig/configtx.yaml and create a new orderer block and a new channel transaction artifact
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 19:15:57 GMT):<br/>
and then just park the msp folder in master into the chaincode-docker-devmode folder in fabric samples.  Those certs seem to be good until 2027

How do I create individual identity for each end user on hyperledger without an admin interference, should i create individual peer for each of them?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 12:46:28 GMT):<br/>
@Raghuvamz fabric is not a public network, so adding users must be somehow controlled. It's implemented by requiring admin to register users. In case you still want that the users register themselves, you can develop a backend API which will use admin user to register any request which comes in automatically without human interference.

</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:00:31 GMT):<br/>
@Chalex what's the point to use sdk in chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:01:02 GMT):<br/>
@Jonny it's possible, but I'd set the config over init function, since it's more flexible
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:01:24 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=rqoyaRHzBhRcSgsjR) @Vadim  I want to invoke a chaincode installed on another peer. 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:01:54 GMT):<br/>
you have `stub.InvokeChaincode()`
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:02:35 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=y3mKwTwdZThNeXLtc) @Vadim I know this function. But with this function, you have to install the chaincode onto the same peer
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:03:26 GMT):<br/>
@Chalex which identity are you going to use when calling another chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:03:40 GMT):<br/>
So i want to connect to another peer via the sdk and call the chaincode installed on another peer
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:03:56 GMT):<br/>
for querying?
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:04:07 GMT):<br/>
query and invoke
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:04:37 GMT):<br/>
how is it going to work with multiple endorsers? I expect that the rwsets are not going to be the same
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:05:03 GMT):<br/>
I also see problems with crypto material which is needed if you use sdk
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:05:13 GMT):<br/>
how are you going to bring it onto chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:05:41 GMT):<br/>
I thought about multiple endorsers, but actually it's not very proper for my scenario
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:06:01 GMT):<br/>
what if the peer gets compromised and starts to deliver wrong results?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:07:17 GMT):<br/>
anyway, you seem to be misusing the standard fabric flow which raises a lot of questions about security and feasibility of such solution
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:07:45 GMT):<br/>
Ah, multiple endorsers can be applied. But currently, I want to invoke a chaincode installed on another peer 
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:07:59 GMT):<br/>
Yeah. I agree. 
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:08:27 GMT):<br/>
But i didn't come up with other solutions. 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:09:39 GMT):<br/>
well think about that: the sdk sends a proposal to the chaincode, that one is using built-in sdk to call another chaincode, which means it gets a proposal from that chaincode. What are you going to do with proposal in the chaincode? Send it to the orderer? Send it back to the app? But maybe app should just call the other chaincode first?
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:12:28 GMT):<br/>
Is it okay to make the proposal in the chaincode wait for the results from the chaincode calls via built-in sdk?
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:13:54 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, I am not quite familiar with fabric-sdk. I don't know whether i express properly.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:15:05 GMT):<br/>
why not doing in in client sdk which is not in chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:18:28 GMT):<br/>
I will think about that solution. But currently I hope to implement the logic in a chaincode, just like the stub.InvokeChaincode(), but the callee chaincode is not installed on the same peer.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:19:15 GMT):<br/>
@Chalex which identity are you going to use to call another chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:20:08 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=iN2bsutmhc8QW9Yxr) @Vadim I will use a normal member of the Org that holds the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:20:30 GMT):<br/>
chaincode does not have access to it
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:21:16 GMT):<br/>
I see the motivation behind that the logic in the chaincode, but I think it creates more problems that it solves
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:21:44 GMT):<br/>
I agree. It makes things more complicated. 
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:22:03 GMT):<br/>

Hi Team, Can you please provide me the maximum possible payload size for chaincode in hyperledger fabric 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 22:09:40 GMT):<br/>
Are there guidelines on how to name the namespace given while installing chaincode?  It seems as though while chaincode is specified by name and version, the namespace it's installed into is not subject to the version number you specify, and therefore it's necessary to put the name and version into the namespace.  E.g. if my company name is `acme` and my chaincode is called `anvil` and my chaincode version is `1.1`, then the namespace should be something like `acme/anvil-1.1`
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 00:35:35 GMT):<br/>
Also, how is the namespace for a chaincode used?  E.g. are all installed chaincodes mounted within the chaincode env docker container, or some such?

Does anybody know how one could properly isolate the Chaincode Containers from the outside world? I ran a little test and I was able to resolve URLs and to call external HTTP endpoints from inside the Chaincode. As far as I understand this is a problem because it's no more deterministic if I can call external HTTP endpoints. Shouldn't the Chaincode just be able to communicate with it's Peer node and nothing else?

@Vadim I see that for using GetQueryResult method in comments it is told to not use or take precautions while updating so that will apply in the case when I am updating through query string or through stub.putState. If you can explain some cases?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 19 Dec 2017 09:37:24 GMT):<br/>
well you should use it only for querying, don't use it when you invoke

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 19 Dec 2017 09:44:36 GMT):<br/>
the comment says that it does not detect phantom reads, so in case the query result gets affected when you invoke, it won't be detected. Whether this is ok for you or not is up to you

Can someone give explanation of usage of below query. 
</p>
<p><strong>ynkumar143</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 07:43:27 GMT):<br/>

 GetQueryResult performs a "rich" query against a state database. It is
 only supported for state databases that support rich query,
 e.g.CouchDB. The query string is in the native syntax
 of the underlying state database. An iterator is returned
 which can be used to iterate (next) over the query result set.
 The query is NOT re-executed during validation phase, phantom reads are
 not detected. That is, other committed transactions may have added,
 updated, or removed keys that impact the result set, and this would not
 be detected at validation/commit time.  Applications susceptible to this
 should therefore not use GetQueryResult as part of transactions that update
 ledger, and should limit use to read-only chaincode operations.

GetQueryResult(query string) (StateQueryIteratorInterface, error)

<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:28:14 GMT):<br/>
I tried installing chaincode_example02 and it is working fine but there is some problem with util package or something else
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:31:26 GMT):<br/>
@kapilAtrey which fabric version is this? which golang version do you have?
</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:33:48 GMT):<br/>
fabric image version : x86_64-1.0.5     golang version : go version go1.6.2 linux/amd64

</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:35:07 GMT):<br/>
which util package have you fetched?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:35:17 GMT):<br/>
is it from master?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:35:46 GMT):<br/>
and I'm not sure why invokechaincode requires some additional package
</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:35:58 GMT):<br/>
git fetch github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/util       i fetched it from here
</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:36:15 GMT):<br/>
invoke chaincode expect 1 2d array of byts
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:36:18 GMT):<br/>
ok, you took the package from master branch and that needs golang 1.9
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:36:26 GMT):<br/>
I suggest you take it from the release branch
</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:36:36 GMT):<br/>
and how to get it ?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:36:55 GMT):<br/>
manually copy it, go fetch afaik only fetches from master
</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:37:17 GMT):<br/>
ok thank you sir i'll try it 
</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:37:19 GMT):<br/>
:-)
</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:58:29 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim  it didnt worked  and i do have a doubt when i fetch util ,the folder containing util have 2 files utils.go  and net.go and now in release branch it also have  2 files utils.go and utils_test.go  and i've pasted both of files....... but it is not working and do i need to put net.go in this or not   
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:59:05 GMT):<br/>
you need the same util package as in 1.0.5 codebase
</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:59:53 GMT):<br/>
I have the same but it is not working 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:03:03 GMT):<br/>
@kapilAtrey so you vendored the whole fabric? "chaincode/input/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/marbles02/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp/factory/pluginfactory.go:12:2: cannot find package "plugin" in any of:
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:03:25 GMT):<br/>
you should remove chaincode/input/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric from vendor
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:04:02 GMT):<br/>
sorry, from marbles02/vendor/githup/hyperledger/fabric
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:04:37 GMT):<br/>
and actually, I still don't understand why you need utils, the ccenv supposed to have hyperledger/fabric dependency
</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:05:24 GMT):<br/>
i need utils  for this *f := "transferMarblesBasedOnColor"*
	*queryArgs := util.ToChaincodeArgs(f, arg)*
</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:06:01 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:06:08 GMT):<br/>
cause it need a 2d array of args
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:06:17 GMT):<br/>
you have a mess in your vendor folder, I think
</p>

may be 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:07:18 GMT):<br/>
if you remove everything hyperledger/fabric-related, what error do you get?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:07:26 GMT):<br/>

@Vadim  I didnt get it , let me explain you the question one more maybe i was a little confused ------------ So i am able to make a build of the chaincode with go build on my machine it gives me no error i do have a chaincode executables  all good till now............... next when i try to instantiate then it gives me that error that i mentioned ........... now you ask me to deploy the build i made from the go build on my local machine now i didnt get it how to deploy or use the build i made from go build on my machine in docke cli container ..............  
</p>
<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:23:00 GMT):<br/>
@garima can you please type in the command you entered where you get this error
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:23:06 GMT):<br/>
I asked you to remove marbles/vendor/fabric and instantiate it
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:23:16 GMT):<br/>

ok, now just copy $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/util to marbles/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/util manually, I also suppose you should have fabric 1.0.5 source code in your $GOPATH since you can build it

</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:47:10 GMT):<br/>
you are still mixing 1.0.5 and master packages, because pluginfactory.go is only on master

<p><strong>kapilAtrey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 09:33:39 GMT):<br/>
yeah i got it but why it is complaining then

can you remove this image and see if it complains about the missing image when you try to build?

Hello, I am facing an issue with chaincode instantiation.

Environment :
Org1 
- peer0
- peer1

Org 2 
- peer0
- peer1

Fabric v1.0 & Node SDK v1.0

Scenario:
1. Install CC on Org1 -> peer0 & peer1
2. Install CC on Org2 -> peer0 & peer1
3. Instantiate CC on Org2
4. docker kill Org1.peer0 container
5. docker start Org1.peer0 container --> peer container started but CC container did not start
6. docker kill Org2.peer0 container
7. docker start Org2.peer0 container --> peer & CC container started successfully 

I checked the logs and found the following error:

```

https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=jkNnwWrxPcESMsg2B       in this it is stated not to use rich queries when sending update transaction what if I am sending a fresh transaction which is inserting new keys but before inserting it is validating old values for which I am using rich query will that effect my transaction too?

hey all, i was under the impression `Init()` gets called whenever the chaincode container comes up. is this true, or is it only called for the chaincode instance on the peer that made the initialize call for the channel?

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 14:02:35 GMT):<br/>
https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#Chaincode

according to the docs my impression was correct, but i recently had an instance where multiple containers were coming up but `Init()` was not being called, has anyone run into this issue before?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 15:04:57 GMT):<br/>
woops makes sense, i was populating package level variables in `Init()`, was not using it properly.

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 15:10:01 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith right, the "Init" is really "InitAtInstantiate" ... wish it had been named to reflect that.

Can i store large files within the couchDb implementation within fabric? I believe it would make the block fat and eventually bloat the network!
However if i want to process the files offchain and reference a hash within the block, how do i do it? How is the data of the user secure in this case? If i were to encrypt the file and take a hash such that the file is not visible to anyone in the network.. How do i share the key in this scenario with some other participant within the network who wants to access this file. TIA

I have created a chaicode and have tested it using chaincode-dev mode. How do I run the chaincode in production mode? I have started the peer as usual peer node start. The chaincode seems to have been installed and instantiated. Is there any other step that needs to be followed? If I need the chaincode to be installed on all the peers, how should I go about doing it?

Thanks yacovm. I have a setup with two peer nodes on two different machines (I am not using docker/). I installed the chaincode on one node (peer.a.com) and also instantiated it in the same node. However the chaincode is not getting copied into the second node.Will the chaincode automatically be sync'ed to the second node? Or will the chaincode need to be installed and instantiated in the other node separately? Both the nodes belong to the same channel.

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 02 Jan 2018 14:43:15 GMT):<br/>
@Chalex if both chaincodes are running on the same channel then they can communicate: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces_stable.go#L64

</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 03 Jan 2018 17:42:02 GMT):<br/>
@Chalex thats how i understand it, because the other chaincode is the one that has access to those key/val pairs.

Hi @muralisr, finally a good opportunity. I'm better at this than that go stuff ;). What would be the procedure, create a JIRA ticket like here: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/CONTRIBUTING.html#making-feature-enhancement-proposals? Or should I discuss the basic design first with you or Jim? It's not in the main repo and I never contributed so I'm not really sure where to start.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 03 Jan 2018 21:35:23 GMT):<br/>
@arner sure, I'd say open a proposal ... then we can all talk about the design in the JIRA and capture everything ... on the other hand you could just shortcircuit with a JIRA and a gerritt CR if we are going to use the golang implementation as a reference.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 03 Jan 2018 21:35:37 GMT):<br/>
perhaps you have some idea of the approach already ?
</p>
<p><strong>arner</strong> (Wed, 03 Jan 2018 21:43:41 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking of porting the golang version indeed, I guess most parts can be the same. It would implement the interface of the real stub, plus a few extra functions like mockInvoke.

For the node we may also need to mock the shim (at least the success and error functions), because the real one requires a very specific environment (peer address in the process arguments, some grpc settings) that makes it hard to set up in a test.

Because in another case, when I use `GetState("abc")`, the log will be ` getting state for chaincode hospital1, key abc , channel chainplaza`. Why I passed the key `org1`, and the log showed the key as empty. And in another case, it worked well. What kind of setting errors could cause this problem.

Hi all, I have an important and urgent question about Chaincode. I wrote a little example chaincode that was able to make outgoing http calls to external services. In the example below I was able to get a response from an external API. Now that I'm able to call external APIs my chaincode is no more deterministic, isn't that a huge problem?
Is there anything I could do to stop Chaincode from calling external services?
Are there plans to fix that in the Fabric codebase?

Here is the example:
```
package main

import (
	"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim"
	"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/peer"
	"net/http"
	"io/ioutil"
	"fmt"
)

type MyCC struct {
}

func main() {
	shim.Start(new(MyCC))
}

func (cc *MyCC) Init(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response {
	return shim.Success(nil)
}

func (cc *MyCC) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response {
	function, args := stub.GetFunctionAndParameters()
	switch function {
	case "outgoingConnection":

 need help on chaincode instantiation which is dependent on other go packages like golang/protobuf and pkg/errors. Below is the error i am getting in the peer logs,

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 20:27:47 GMT):<br/>
@LeoKotschenreuther if making external calls is a concern, then do not make external calls within the chaincode. if you want to prevent this behavior i'd recommend an out of band solution and locking it down from the network level.

@vinay_g you need to vendor your dependencies 
</p>
<p><strong>vinay_g</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 20:31:20 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith Thanks! I am new to golang can you let me know how to vendor these packages? Currently I just git cloned into the VM and mounted it to the peer's docker process

I think there will be situations where one doesn't have control over what other people do with their chaincode that runs in your network.
Do you know of any Peer settings that might make it harder for Chaincode to make outgoing calls?

As far as I know it not a problem on Fabric, the chaincodes don't have to be deterministic in opposition to Solidity ones. Here  the transaction is not ran on all endorsers, only the RW replica set is check, so as long as they have the same RW there's no problem

@dsanchezseco `Now that I'm able to call external APIs my chaincode is no more deterministic, isn't that a huge problem?`  -  short answer, not a problem from "determinism" point of view. We are storing only the transaction with a unique result from the executing endorsers. That result should be signed according to endorsement policy by set of peers and amounts to looking at _what_ they compute to and now _how_ they compute it.

having said that, you can get into a situation where different endorsers will keep computing different things and the TX won't make progress

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=HZqcXJuuCTr4Q7rzu) @muralisr nope. the endorsers don't replay the transaction, they only check that the READ replica set versions of the proposal and the stored is the same. So is not a problem being non-deterministic. The function is only called once.

@bingimanasa if you want to store it from chaincode use node/java sdk for storing and retrive data into ledger(statedb). See the fabric-sample examples

Hi there. I am running docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple.yaml up -d in the fabric-samples/chaincode-docker-devmode folder which consists of a cli containers. I then want to enter the peers file system with command docker exec -it cli bash and it tells me the containers doesn't exist? It seems the cli container is exiting when I run docker-compose. Anyone have any idea why this would happen?

Hi team ....can anyone provide me an example of chaincode where we can get the attributes mentioned during the user registration process
currently i am using the below chaincode to get name and org
var getCreator = func(certificate []byte) (string, string) {
data := certificate[strings.Index(string(certificate), "-----") : strings.LastIndex(string(certificate), "-----")+5]
block, _ := pem.Decode([]byte(data))
cert, _ := x509.ParseCertificate(block.Bytes)
organization := cert.Issuer.Organization[0]
commonName := cert.Subject.CommonName
logger.Debug("commonName: " + commonName + ", organization: " + organization)

organizationShort := strings.Split(organization, ".")[0]

return commonName, organizationShort
}
But I cannot find a way to get the values of attributes i use to register the user
I am using the below Node SDK request

Hey folks, I would like to know if it is possible to store multiple types of information in the same hyperledger network? I have been looking at the chaincode examples and it seems like they all only track one type in each application. Relationships between these types would also be a requirement. Sorry if this isn't the optimal channel for this question, still figuring things out. Thanks!

        if err != nil {

        }
        defer resultsIterator.Close()

        var buffer bytes.Buffer
        buffer.WriteString("[");
        for resultsIterator.HasNext() {
                queryResponse, err := resultsIterator.Next()

                }
                buffer.WriteString("{");
                buffer.WriteString(queryResponse.Key)
                buffer.WriteString(":");
                buffer.WriteString(string(queryResponse.Value))
                buffer.WriteString("}");

Hi All,  fabric-sdk-rest runs a rest server that connects to a blockchain network with the connection parameters defined in "datasources.json" file. I have used connection_profile.json in past to connect to a blockchain network. However, the format of datasources.json is significantly different from other connection_profiles I have seen so far(specially the ceritificate related parameters). My question is "What are minimum mandatory fields we can fill in datasources.json to connect to an IBM cloud blockchain? If an example is shared, that will be a big help. Thanks.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=WxPLYyayR47oKohHR) @markthedark Are you using pure `fabric` or `hyperledger-composer`? If `fabric`, are you using the `development` mode or `normal` mode? If `normal` mode, then check whether you deleted the `old chaincode running environment` which is a docker image created by the peer. You should always confirm that when you deploy new chaincode, there is a  image newly built for this chaincode in `normal mode`.

@pkarolis in the mockstub you can actually just edit the code and return whatever you want: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/shim/mockstub.go#L256

to my knowledge its not implemented because the stateDB is pluggable and not all stateDB implementations support rich querying
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:42:20 GMT):<br/>
@CodeReaper to my knowledge the system chaincodes are literally part of the fabric blockchain logic, they do not participate in consensus. 

i know the escc, lscc, qscc, vscc, and cscc all have logic that is relevant to the life of a network. i think the sample is there in case you would like to implement system logic to extend current fabric capabilities. i have not written or felt the need to write a system chaincode so i am most likely not the best person to ask, perhaps someone with more knowledge of fabric internals could chime in?

@CodeReaper system chaincodes respond to invokes just as any chaincode would. If you want to use an invoke as a trigger and start some asynch timer processing, theres nothing to prevent you from doing that ...really depends upon what you mean by "invoke user chaincode". If thats a chaincode-to-chaincode call using chaincode api, then you would lose the context of the original invoke and it woukd fail. If you are mimicking a proposal and doing an external call, you might as well do that from the SDK. Sounds to me taking a step back and doing any orchestration from the SDK woukd be the right approach

Sounds to me taking a step back and doing any orchestration from the SDK woukd be the right approach

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=NbjqPbus6BMuSNqvX) @muralisr Thanks for the response, It sounds interesting to me. What all extra resources are we talking about when we say that the system chaincodes have extra resources available to them(apart from querying blocks and transactions as shown by qscc)?

A question.

I am using couchdb as my state db, have all the benefits of rich queries. Now need to find out if there is a chance of using aggregate functions of couchdb.

Like I have a transactions in my transactions-chaincode:
Transaction 1 ----   (-25 Units)  ---- FromAccountA ---- ToAccountB
Transaction 2 ---     (-50 Units) ---- FromAccountA ---- ToAccountC

Need to get a SUM of units
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 17:38:44 GMT):<br/>
One way is to iterate through all the units and get the sum - but if that is done via a aggregate function - should be handy.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 17:40:33 GMT):<br/>
Due to the deterministic nature of all the chaincode calls on all peers - I cannot resort to a running total kind of calc as well.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 02:30:37 GMT):<br/>
@CodeReaper as system chaincodes run in the peer process (not in a container) they have access to all peer resources.

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 11:48:15 GMT):<br/>
e.g. use transaction id
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 14:05:21 GMT):<br/>
@Amjadnz it sounds like the issue is the fact that `GetQueryResult` is a read only action and is not included in part of the read/write set. if i remember correctly `GetStateByPartialCompositeKey` does get entered into the r/w set and you'd be able to detect phantom reads/writes, enabling you to write the summation in the chaincode.

as far as for doing it on the couchDB side...perhaps you could create a view that sums everything and then query that? i'm fairly certain this is possible but I don't know the specifics

Hi, i am currently working on a chaincode which stores the data into the ledger using encryption, but whenever i try to instantiate the chaincode  i get timeout error. I know sometimes we have to instantiate more than once so I tried it many times but it still returns timeout error. Then i tried instantiating the same chaincode without encryption and it got instantiated in first try. It is happening only when i try to instantiate my encryption chaincode. any idea?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 07:49:42 GMT):<br/>
@Lucifer have you checked the peer logs? Also, you need to instantiate only once. It's strange when you say "sometimes we have to instantiate more than once"

@Vadim  it happens sometimes only when timeout occur while instantiation, by sending request again it gets properly instantiated

@Amjadnz the chaincode package does not contain the package (the fabric peer does). You'll have to vendor the dependency

How can we deploy vendored chaincode on docker setup?

<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 05:10:34 GMT):<br/>
if i use node sdk - the example chaincode gets deployed fine (non vendored as there are no external deps)

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:49:08 GMT):<br/>
you can see that sdk does filtering and leaves only files of these extensions: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/fabric-client/lib/packager/Golang.js#L31-L34
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:50:02 GMT):<br/>
Shall  put the .s, .pl and .yaml too in there
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:50:18 GMT):<br/>
and try (Golang.js)
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:50:37 GMT):<br/>
I don't think you can
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:50:46 GMT):<br/>
ah, you mean modify the sdk
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:50:48 GMT):<br/>
well try
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:51:11 GMT):<br/>
at least you will know whether this is the reason or not
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:55:19 GMT):<br/>
Issue is still there.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:55:59 GMT):<br/>
So I guess "vendored" go packages are not supported still in current fabric. Or may be something in my config is breaking.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:56:26 GMT):<br/>
in the docker mode I mean
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:58:38 GMT):<br/>
In here http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/Style-guides/go-style.html it is mentioned that it has to be in fabric/vendor folder
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 10:59:02 GMT):<br/>
I shall map the vendor folder in the container and check if that is working fine.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 11:24:49 GMT):<br/>
@Amjadnz I use vendoring, it works for me
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:20:30 GMT):<br/>
What also i noticed is this error is possible if the peer in docker cannot get the chaincode itself 
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:27:16 GMT):<br/>
Would do one round of mapping again with volume and try again
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:27:41 GMT):<br/>
what does it have to do with volumes?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:28:46 GMT):<br/>
In nodesdk im specifying the path to the chain code.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:28:52 GMT):<br/>
what if
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:29:33 GMT):<br/>
the path is not accessible to the peer where im deploying
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:38:28 GMT):<br/>
The chaincode compiles to executable - at the instantiate level right?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:40:22 GMT):<br/>
the sdk should compress everything and install it on the peer, so when you instantiating, peer has all necessary chaincode files
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:42:10 GMT):<br/>
I see - then its my understanding issue.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:42:49 GMT):<br/>
Is this possuble that I'm running the instantiate very fast after it gets installed and delivered to the peer.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:43:47 GMT):<br/>
Its actually a script I can add a await time to check for that
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:43:51 GMT):<br/>
I guess you wait for install to finish?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:46:05 GMT):<br/>
yes and then I instantiate without waiting further. i can add it too. what I feel the diff is example_cc is non-vendored, footprimt is small. Ans mine has a lot of dependencies
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:46:05 GMT):<br/>
yes and then I instantiate without waiting further. i can add it too. what I feel the diff is example_cc is non-vendored, footprimt is small. And mine has a lot of dependencies
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:46:53 GMT):<br/>
well for instantiate you don't need to wait as long as you don't try to invoke it
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:03:40 GMT):<br/>
what I did - that worked before (i was not aware of the vendoring process in go) - I modified the fabric-envcc images to manually have these packages vendored as part of go path. And it worked fine.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 13:04:24 GMT):<br/>
Let me try again - just to make sure vendoring is the key issue.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:14:09 GMT):<br/>
```func userChaincodeStreamGetter(name string) (PeerChaincodeStream, error) {
	flag.StringVar(&peerAddress, "peer.address", "", "peer address")
	if comm.TLSEnabled() {
		keyPath := viper.GetString("tls.client.key.path")
		certPath := viper.GetString("tls.client.cert.path")

		data, err1 := ioutil.ReadFile(keyPath)
		if err1 != nil {
			chaincodeLogger.Errorf("Error trying to read file content %s: %s", keyPath, err1)
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("Error trying to read file content %s: %s", keyPath, err1)
		}
		key = string(data)

		data, err1 = ioutil.ReadFile(certPath)
		if err1 != nil {
			chaincodeLogger.Errorf("Error trying to read file content %s: %s", certPath, err1)
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("Error trying to read file content %s: %s", certPath, err1)
		}
		cert = string(data)
	}```
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:14:51 GMT):<br/>
Regarding my issue of missin files I'm checking the chaincode.go code. Here it is complaining about the error if it is not able to find the tls.client.key.path or tls.client.cert.path
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:15:54 GMT):<br/>
ehm, then what does it have to do with vendor?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:17:41 GMT):<br/>
yes you are right - that is a bit of confusion. If I use the same setup with example_cc (goes fine). If this is a TLS issue then it should complain there too right?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:19:07 GMT):<br/>
Is this possible that this (userChaincodeStreamGetter)  is called only for vendor specific go packages?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:20:32 GMT):<br/>
and for those specific vendor packages my TLS settings are missing.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:20:44 GMT):<br/>
I don't think that peer cares whether it has vendor folder or not
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:21:04 GMT):<br/>
it just puts your chaincode files into a container and runs "go build" on it
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:21:25 GMT):<br/>
yep did that - and all went fine. got the executable.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:21:54 GMT):<br/>
By the way on peer I cannot build it right? I have to instantiate the envcc
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:22:12 GMT):<br/>
I somehow fail to understand how peer-chaincode tls is influenced by the chaincode vendor folder
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:22:24 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=6bYfuKnHqs4feuXom) yes, ccenv
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:22:47 GMT):<br/>
Would do that again - yesterday seems like ages ago :)

yep
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:29:36 GMT):<br/>
they are only images
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:30:23 GMT):<br/>
when starting up containers the issue of "file not found" is shown.
Doing another round with ccenv now. Let me check if that helps
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:31:02 GMT):<br/>

why they are not there I don't know
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:46:23 GMT):<br/>
I see. 
But these are not in the default sdk docker yaml.

I have the below:
```- CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/keystore/35c98094ef1c4d89c9d6854a30ca71eb5a590abd3de6256dc73047d19845d62b_sk

</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:46:42 GMT):<br/>
no, those are defined and set by peer when the image is being built
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:46:43 GMT):<br/>
probably that is missing in my side.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:46:49 GMT):<br/>
Oh Isee
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:46:53 GMT):<br/>
they are generated by the peer
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:47:28 GMT):<br/>
what I can see in the logs is this

<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:48:03 GMT):<br/>
and the one we have is there in the folder (peer.crt)
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:48:03 GMT):<br/>
yes, I cannot comment on that
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:48:27 GMT):<br/>
perhaps I'd start from updating your fabric to the latest stable
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:48:53 GMT):<br/>
so you use 1.0.3?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:49:06 GMT):<br/>
yes - I can upgrade no issues.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:49:23 GMT):<br/>
Let me check  - and thanks @Vadim for having this patience. Really appreciate it.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:49:34 GMT):<br/>
yeah, just try with 1.0.5
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:49:59 GMT):<br/>
Sure thing - should be fine is my feeling. Would update anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:51:59 GMT):<br/>
@Amjadnz it's actually strange, from the code you posted it also defines only CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE. I have a suspicion you have some mix between fabric versions
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:52:16 GMT):<br/>
make sure you remove ALL fabric-related images
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:54:56 GMT):<br/>
Yes I will

<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 16:29:20 GMT):<br/>
Can anyone explain a bit about implementation of chaincode in Fabric network. Should we install chaincode on all the peers? But from the docs it says, chaincode runs separately from the peers. 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 16:35:16 GMT):<br/>
@indirajith chaincode should be installed on all peers that will be endorsing transactions. peers do not require a chaincode in order to run, but all chaincodes run in a docker container alongside a peer

Hi, I have a blockchain network running and I installed two chaincodes from the cli by using 
`peer chaincode install -n cc2 -v 1.0 `
`peer chaincode install -n cc2 -v 1.0 -p cc1`

instantiate command:
`peer chaincode instantiate -o order.domain.com:7050 -C mychannel-n cc1 -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":["init"]}'`
`peer chaincode instantiate -o order.domain.com:7050 -C mychannel-n cc2 -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":["init", "cc1"]}'`

as you can see from the parameters, cc2 is invoking a function from cc1.
After I instantiated both, I am getting following error: Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Transaction returned with failure: could not find chaincode with name ''

And I invoking cc1 in cc2 with following command
`stub.InvokeChaincode("cc1", ToChaincodeArgs(function,util.ToChaincodeArgs(args...), "")`

Hi, I have a blockchain network running and I installed two chaincodes from the cli by using 
`peer chaincode install -n cc2 -v 1.0 `
`peer chaincode install -n cc2 -v 1.0 -p cc1`

instantiate command:
`peer chaincode instantiate -o order.domain.com:7050 -C mychannel -n cc1 -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":["init"]}'`
`peer chaincode instantiate -o order.domain.com:7050 -C mychannel -n cc2 -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":["init", "cc1"]}'`

as you can see from the parameters, cc2 is invoking a function from cc1.

@Vadim will try
</p>
<p><strong>dsanchezseco</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 12:51:47 GMT):<br/>
@novusopt Why the -p points to cc1? Shouldn't it be the path to get the chaincode from instead?

In the invoke you have to provide the channel that is the last "" that you have
</p>
<p><strong>novusopt</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 12:54:29 GMT):<br/>
@dsanchezseco yes actually it is the path, I shortened the code and I did the mistake

@novusopt you can't read your own writes

<p><strong>novusopt</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:39:52 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim I dont get that...
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:41:17 GMT):<br/>
when you do "PutState" it only writes that to the proposal's RWset, but not to the state. GetState() reads the state. The state will be updated when orderer builds the block and sends it to peers and the peers commit transactions with RWsets from that block.
</p>
<p><strong>novusopt</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:52:16 GMT):<br/>
ok that means I call the function ini wait for the state transition then I can query it?

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:53:00 GMT):<br/>
can you explain what you want to do?
</p>
<p><strong>novusopt</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:55:23 GMT):<br/>
sure, my plan is the following. I have 2 chaincodes cc1 & cc2, cc1 is invoking a function of cc2. cc1 gets via the init function the id of cc2. In the cc1 init function I am persisting(PutState) the id of cc2 in order to make it available for the function of cc1 which calls the function off cc2
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:56:22 GMT):<br/>
ok, makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>novusopt</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:58:10 GMT):<br/>
so I can not make a GetState?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:58:25 GMT):<br/>
you can, but not immediately after PutState
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:58:34 GMT):<br/>
it should be in a separate transaction
</p>
<p><strong>novusopt</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:58:52 GMT):<br/>
ok I see now I understand

Hello, I have one question on CreateTable in the Fabric shim.  Has the CreateTable API been removed in the Fabric v1.1 shim? If so, is there any equivalent API in the Fabric v1.1 shim? I am now using the Fabric 1.1 binary, but I got compilation error when doing `go build` on the chaincode which is developed in Fabric v0.6.   I got the following error 
`stub.CreateTable undefined (type shim.ChaincodeStubInterface has no field or method CreateTable)`
 Thank you!

@DongSuIBM CreateTable has been removed for a while. There is no direct equivalent but using range queries and iterator functions you should be able to get the same functionality (but will let @dave.enyeart expand/correct).

Tables were a misnomer in 0.6 since you could only query fields left to right rather than any column as you would expect from a table. The equivalent as of 1.0 is to utilize composite keys, which can be queried left to right in a similar way.  See:

If I accidentally skipped deleting the chaincode containers when following the docs on upgrading the peer binaries (http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade_to_one_point_one.html#upgrade-peer-binaries), what is the proper procedure to do this after the fact? For example:
Do I need to shut down the peer first, delete the chaincode container and then restart the peer OR do I simply delete the chaincode container without shutting down the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:42:08 GMT):<br/>
@sanchezl you could simply delete the container...it should get rebuilt on the next proposal.

Hello,
I am trying to setup a custom network inline as shown in : https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/build_network.html
My Network has a Orderer and 2 Orgs having one peer each.
I have been able to reach till the point of installing the chaincode.
However, I am stuck at the step of Instantiating Chaincode (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/build_network.html#install-instantiate-chaincode)

Command executed from cli:
peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.companyName.com:7050 --tls $CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/companyName.com/orderers/orderer.companyName.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.companyName.com-cert.pem -C vehicletrackerchannel1 -n mycc -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":["init","a", "100", "b","200"]}' -P "OR ('ManufacturerOrg1MSP.member','DealerOrg1MSP.member','ServiceCenterOrg1MSP.member')"

On checking docker ps -a (in another terminal), I can see that a new container is exiting with below logs:
018-02-14 14:28:08.260 UTC [shim] userChaincodeStreamGetter -> ERRO 001 Error trying to connect to local peer: context deadline exceeded
Error starting Simple chaincode - Error trying to connect to local peer: context deadline exceeded.

Stuck on this for this for the past couple days!!!

@yacovm actually chaincode build is about 15Mb and contains some fabric default packages like shim and protobuf. But it also contains lots of, you know, parsing funcs for structs with about ~20 fields. 
I use balance-transfer network (a little bit modified to kafka) and it's nodejs scripts for installing\instantiating. Install goes fine (obviously) and during instantiation it takes up to 10 or more mins actually. Including retries.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 10:50:37 GMT):<br/>
Hmmm we have a timeout parameter in the config of the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 10:50:53 GMT):<br/>
In core.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>eirlis</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 11:00:01 GMT):<br/>
We've tried same and played around with timeout param (increasing\decreasing) but it did nothing. Maybe it's an SDK error, but I don't know if there any timeout params for peer inside the SDK itself

@yacovm thank you, I'll try it if there would be such problems again. I think we handled this situation it by increasing SDK timeout param :)

I am trying to build a simple car tracking blockchain app on hyperledger fabric v1.0, much like IBM Carlease demo built back with v0.6. An overview of my app is

- Manufacturer build the car and sell it to dealer
- dealer sell it to user
- user can use it throughout its life or can sell it to another user
- Manufacturer can track all the cars they manufactured, from start to its current status
- Dealer can only track the cars that he bought from various manufacturers to its current status.
- User can only track car/s he bought, from its manufacturer to the user he sold to, but must not have access to view transactions afterwards.
- And also there is a regulatory authority that can track any car from manufacturer to its current user.

I am having trouble restricting user to view transactions that is performed after he sell the car to another user. How can i achieve this? And where can i implement these restrictions, in chaincode or SDK?

Hi,
what does define:
type SimpleChaincode struct {
}

because I always get an error in my function because of it? 
 'cannot use new(SimpleChaincode) (type *SimpleChaincode) as type shim.Chaincode in argument to shim.Start:
	*Info does not implement shim.Chaincode (wrong type for Init method)
		have Init(*shim.ChaincodeStub, string, []string) ([]byte, error)
		want Init(shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response'
at: '90,2'
source: ''
code: 'undefined'
</p>
<p><strong>KGiou</strong> (Fri, 16 Feb 2018 17:25:31 GMT):<br/>
@MartinKrmer SimpleChaincode collects all the data from your CC, its the main struct. To resolve the error just do what the error says. Instead of `Init(*shim.ChaincodeStub, string, []string) ([]byte, error)` write `Init(shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response`

Hey folks. This page: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/Fabric-FAQ.html says "Chaincode can be written in any programming language and executed in containers." Does this mean that I can right now write chaincode in any language or is it true only after support for that language has been added?

@sanchezl Hello. I've been looking at the Java chaincode implementation and I see that you're one of the authors. I'm trying to educate myself so that I can create an implementation for another language (Haskell).  I'm new to hyperledger and my main question at the moment is: what effects on the outside world is chaincode supposed to have?  What part(s) of the Java implementation do this?  Is it the `ChatStream` stuff?  Also, are there docs that describe things at this level so that a dev could implement a new chaincode language?

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 17 Feb 2018 21:30:23 GMT):<br/>
@tmciver at a high level, you'd create a new "platform" (see `fabric/core/chaincode/platforms`) for haskell. The most recent language implementation was `node` which could also serve as a good guide (see FAB-2331 and FAB-5371) in addition to java... `what effects on the outside world is chaincode supposed to have? ` - the stream support to the fabric's chaincode listener is the only external dependency. every other interaction - for example, with the ledger maintained by the fabric - is via that stream.

I solved that issue. However, althhough my invoke init function worked in the devmode I face now this error: UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 0cd grpc: addrConn.transportMonitor exits due to: context canceled

Could it be that the content is to big or how would you interpret it?

If all you are seeing is DEBUG messages but no errors than this may be noise.  I believe these sorts of messages can occur if grpc connections are not terminated "cleanly", so it may be an indication of less than perfect teardown of a connection, but not necessarily a problem to worry about.

Okay, now that's a problem.  I don't know the cause.  I'd recommend looking at your orderer logs and if you can't figure it out or nobody else jumps in here to help, I suggest searching on StackOverflow with tag hyperledger-fabric or maybe opening up an issue there.  
</p>
<p><strong>MartinKrmer</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 20:25:28 GMT):<br/>
@silliman I wonder could it be caused by the orderering service (solo)?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/chaincode-dev?msg=2Ti5oj8YNehEjMhfA) @MartinKrmer 

i doubt if it is due to solo.  it could be a lot of different things.   `broken pipe` is a pretty generic error that is being returned from the networking stack.   Are you following one of the documented tutorials or are you working in a custom environment.  It could be something specific to your network configuration.  
</p>
<p><strong>MartinKrmer</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 20:35:50 GMT):<br/>
Well I first tried to combine custom network with custom chaincode, but then I decided to maybe use "first-network" as example network
</p>
<p><strong>MartinKrmer</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 20:36:22 GMT):<br/>
So I basically followed steps as I would use marbles02 chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 20:43:01 GMT):<br/>
@MartinKrmer Have you successfully run the _first-network_ tutorial, from start to finish, without modifications, on the same system on which you are now having the issue, in order to know that you have a baseline working environment?  If not, I recommend doing so
</p>
<p><strong>MartinKrmer</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 20:43:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes yes I did so several days ago
</p>
<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 20:51:57 GMT):<br/>
@MartinKrmer Ok, so _first-network_ runs with two organizations in a single Docker network inside a single server, using TLS... is this the same topology that your custom network uses?
</p>

<p><strong>douglasthiel</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 23:34:13 GMT):<br/>
looking at the orderer logs I see:

</p>
<p><strong>douglasthiel</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 23:34:43 GMT):<br/>
which is weird because TLS is enabled on all my peers and orderer, sigh
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 23:36:51 GMT):<br/>
that probably means a client tried to connect without TLS

<p><strong>douglasthiel</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 23:37:43 GMT):<br/>
maybe, trying to inspect to find that one
</p>
<p><strong>douglasthiel</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 23:39:55 GMT):<br/>
would a dev-peer instance not have TLS enabled by default?

a dev-peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 23:40:33 GMT):<br/>
usually that's a prefix of a chaincode container

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 23:40:41 GMT):<br/>
chaincode containers don't talk with orderers...

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 23:41:42 GMT):<br/>
it's pretty simple - either you use TLS everywhere, of you don't
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 23:41:59 GMT):<br/>
if you use TLS in the peer, that means the chaincode also uses TLS

Is that error pointing to an issue with my chaincode? Or is this still an external to chaincode issue?

<p><strong>zajanksk</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 05:05:35 GMT):<br/>
hi guys, i have a question about chaincode
what happens if RANDOM logic (like rand(100)) in the chaincode? As i know, Chaincode is each of peers and excute independently. So i think if the random method is chaincode, each peer has different value.
Then they can't reach consensus. I think
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 11:27:21 GMT):<br/>
@zajanksk  - chaincode is executed during the endorsement phase.  Each endorsing peer runs the chaincode and if there is no error responds with a signed endorsement response.  The endorsement response contains the actual state changes (they have not yet been committed) and the signature is over the entire response.

After the transaction along with collected endorsements is sent to the orderer and then sent to the peers, each peer than validates the transaction.  Part of the validation is to make sure that the transaction meets the endorsement policy.  As part of this check, the peer makes sure that enough signatures were collected over the SAME response.

So let's say the endorsement policy required 2 out of Org1,Org2,Org3.  If peers from Org1,Org2 and Org3 all returned different results, then the transaction would not be committed.  If the Org1 and Org2 return the same results, then the transaction would be committed

Yes, I'm talking about running chaincode from the CLI to start. Then trying to understand how to look at the data.  I'm looking into Fauxton at the moment but was hoping there was a println way of doing this too.  I don't see any of my golang printlns in docker logs —since 5m orderer.domain.com so I'm wondering out loud
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:38:24 GMT):<br/>
@douglasthiel adding `CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true` to peer should get you the printlns into the peer's log

Hi, is there any guideline how to structure the chaincode for high throughput? I used this approach  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release/high-throughput, but I am facing following issue: TxValidationCode_PHANTOM_READ_CONFLICT

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:41:19 GMT):<br/>
@novusopt it sounds like your read/write sets are conflicting:

</p>
<p><strong>novusopt</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:51:07 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith yes, is there any guideline in order to avoid it...? I would like to run some performance tests. 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:53:04 GMT):<br/>
in order to avoid it you should not attempt to update a record before it has successfully been committed to the ledger. as of now commitment seems to be the bottleneck within fabric, with our systems we've noticed we can get ~3 txns/s reliably with the 1.0 build, there are promises of performance upgrades in 1.1
</p>

i saw the document about GetQueryResult(), but i don't know how to write query(parameter). 
</p>
<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 01:50:54 GMT):<br/>
@zajan.ksk You can find an example of GetQueryResult(), among other ledger interaction patterns, in `fabric/examples/chaincode/go/marbles02/marbles_chaincode.go`

Then Is there a way to test chaincode without fabric network? It's to hard to test cause every time when i rewrite to code, i have done all process again like install and instantiate. is there other way to test chaincode more fast?

hi all, I'm unable to install chaincode in node js, the peer install command with -l node flag is giving me Error: Error getting chaincode code chaincode: Failed to determine platform type: Unknown chaincodeType: NODE
Peer version is 1.0.6, has support been disabled or I'm doing something wrong?

hi, guys. I have a question. 
Is it possible to separate permission(authority) for each function of chaincode? 
</p>
<p><strong>zajan.ksk</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 02:07:37 GMT):<br/>
For example, The tutorial Fabcar chaincode has several invoke method, User A has authority of queryCar and queryAllCars but can't generate transaction about changeCarOwner. is it possiple?
</p>
<p><strong>AnandBanik</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 02:17:15 GMT):<br/>
@zajan.ksk if i understand your question, you are asking for attribute-based access control. Its available in fabric 1.1 natively, but if you want to achieve the same in fabric 1.0, you will have to, for example, add an attribute like OU to the certificate and then pull the attribute value in your chaincode and use it for accessing or restricting certain methods.
</p>

<p><strong>zajan.ksk</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 02:19:44 GMT):<br/>
@AnandBanik is it cid(Client Identity Chaincode Libaraty) you say?
</p>
<p><strong>AnandBanik</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 02:20:32 GMT):<br/>
yes....but its available in 1.1 only..for 1...you have to use GoLangs lib to get this value from the certificate
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 16:17:24 GMT):<br/>
@debutinfotech I think the peer defines the number of peers (validators or not) and the users define the number of clients.
At least that is how I used it
</p>
<p><strong>debutinfotech</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 16:55:54 GMT):<br/>
@ArvsIndrarys I think the orderer is the validator?
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 16:58:43 GMT):<br/>
`validate` means several things  :
not all peers validate that transactions are ok. The one doing it are the peer validators.
And orderers participate in the consensus, so they are an other kind of 'validators', the way that I see things

@jrosmith although its complaining of protos/peer ...shouldn't have to vendor that as its in the ccenv ( chaincode_example02 has it and works without need to vendor). something else is happening I think

@ArnabChatterjee , I'm just starting to know fabric and took a look at your guidelines. They look good to me. The only thing I'm not sure is the deterministic thing. You only need to be deterministic between different endorsing peers for the duration of the transaction. This means you can rely on external services as long as they give the same response to all endorsing peers during that limited timeframe. Correct me if I'm completely wrong in my assumptions.
</p>
<p><strong>SashiKanth</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 11:53:45 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 12:07:21 GMT):<br/>
@janbols - Thank you for your time. Yes, you can rely on an (*TRUSTED*) external service as long as it returns same value to all the endorsing peers. The reason why I bolded out the TRUST is that on a contradictory opinion, blockchains are solutions applied, where there is absolute lack of trust. :wink:

Hey All,

Does anyone have any experience in using chaincode with local dependencies, say I have (on my local machine) this:

```
src \
    common
    cc1
    cc2
```

Both `cc1` and `cc2` (both chaincode apps) use libraries in common, however when I go to instantiate them, I get this error:

```
Error: Error getting chaincode code chaincode: Error getting chaincode package bytes: Error obtaining dependencies for common: <go, [list -f {{ join .Deps "\n"}} common]>: failed with error: "exit status 1"
can't load package: package commonLib: cannot find package "common" in any of:
	/opt/go/src/common (from $GOROOT)
	/opt/gopath/src/common (from $GOPATH)
```

How do I ensure that `common` is included?

</p>
<p><strong>tom.appleyard</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 15:25:06 GMT):<br/>
sorry, that's a typo - it is called `common`
</p>
<p><strong>jeffprestes</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 15:27:18 GMT):<br/>
"commonLib" --> "common" ?
</p>
<p><strong>tom.appleyard</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 15:27:29 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jeffprestes</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 15:36:07 GMT):<br/>
And after fix this typo, does it work?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffprestes</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 15:38:40 GMT):<br/>
In general @tom.appleyard in Go Applications your source stay at: $GOPATH/src/<<your repo name>>/<<project>>/ 
and then you have your packages.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffprestes</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 15:39:34 GMT):<br/>
In projects for instance I have: $GOPATH/src/bitbucket.org/novatrix/lawchaincode/
</p>
<p><strong>jeffprestes</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 15:40:18 GMT):<br/>
Then, for instance, my imports are:
```import "bitbucket.org/novatrix/lawchaincode/common"```
</p>
<p><strong>jeffprestes</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 15:40:43 GMT):<br/>
And at my code I use: ```common.MyFunction()``` 
</p>
<p><strong>tom.appleyard</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 15:41:15 GMT):<br/>
@jeffprestes Managed to fix the issue, basically issue was a bit what you are saying - issues with things not being in the gopath

</p>
<p><strong>tom.appleyard</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 08:35:54 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr I've since been told that what's in `/var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/` are chaincode deploy specs, is this not the case?

Who does the building of the code, is it built then sent to the peer or does the peer build it?

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 12:14:06 GMT):<br/>
@tom.appleyard the binary under `/var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/` is the chaincode deployment spec. It  is sent to the peer. The exe is built by the peer using the deployment spec
</p>
<p><strong>jeffprestes</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 12:27:27 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr so, Fabric nodes only executes an exe. Is that correct? 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 12:27:50 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>jeffprestes</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 12:30:24 GMT):<br/>
So, just to confirm the entire process: I can compile the chaincode externally - in test or developer machine - and then deploy it to this folder ```/var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/``` and done, It will work. Is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 12:31:09 GMT):<br/>
correct

When using `dep` as a vendoring tool for my chaincode, do I need to commit my `vendor` folder so that it is copied into the container with my other files? Or is Fabric smart enough to detect the `Gopkg…` files and run dep itself?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffprestes</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 17:04:24 GMT):<br/>
If I understood correctly @pd93 , based on @muralisr explanation, Fabric only see the executable file. So your dependencies are only needed at compile time not at execution time.

In the above say you had a composite key with the structure `type~location~value`, you can use each key to narrow it down
</p>
<p><strong>tom.appleyard</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 17:25:45 GMT):<br/>
e.g. "all records of type x with any location or value" or "all records of type y in location b with any value"

@jeffprestes @tom.appleyard I didn't mean to imply the chaincode under /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes are "exe" binaries. They _are_ deployment spec (per the earlier comment ` the binary under /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/ is the chaincode deployment spec. It is sent to the peer. The exe is built by the peer using the deployment spec`)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 17:45:16 GMT):<br/>
I think the confusion - a bit my fault - was in interpreting your comment `So, just to confirm the entire process: I can compile the chaincode externally - in test or developer machine - and then deploy it to this folder ` @jeffprestes ....from the contexted, I assumed  "compile the chaincode externally" to mean generate the deployment spec

@mohebz chaincode is identified by its name and all peers which needs to endorse requests for a chaincode must have the same chancode. We can have multiple chaincodes in a channel

Hi, I'm trying to use node.js for chaincode and I have the latest images and the network started using the fabric-samples `chaincode-docker-devmode` example, but the example README only says how to start and run the go chaincode. Is there anyplace with the instructions on how to start and run the node.js chaincode? I'm getting an error saying that the `peer.address` program argument must be set to a legitimate value (I had tried setting the environment variables like in the go example, but I got the same error)
</p>
<p><strong>doowb</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 21:35:29 GMT):<br/>

Hey, When using `dep` as a vendoring tool for my chaincode, do I need to commit my `vendor` folder so that it is copied into the container with my other chaincode files? Or is Fabric smart enough to detect the `Gopkg…` files and run dep itself?

@pd93 you have to bundle the vendor with the chaincode.. fabric will not add those dependencies automatically
</p>
<p><strong>pd93</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 13:50:28 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr Great thanks. Is this something that might be considered in the future? After all, you'd just have to run `dep ensure` during the creation of the chaincode image. Some might say that this step should be done anyway to guarantee (ensure) that everything is valid
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 13:57:23 GMT):<br/>
@pd93 only CLI uses the fabric to package the chaincode for install. SDKs use there own mechanisms to create the chaincode package. So there are some difficulties. Also, dependencies are tricky..we have to make sure the dependency computed is the right one you want.... But you raise a good point about finding a way to have it generated so users don't have to worry about it (
</p>
<p><strong>pd93</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 14:24:56 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr I hadn't considered that the SDKs would need to be able to do this too. If you like, I'm happy to open a JIRA for this for further discussion
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 14:27:22 GMT):<br/>
@pd93 certainly, please do. It might be useful information in general regardless of where it leads us

Hi Team, I am part of one finance company and using hyperledger 1.0.3. We deployed all services in Docker UCP (Enterprise Edition). After 15 mins call is timing out from peer to smart contracts.

@zimabry you can get the common name from the cert using the following:

	"encoding/pem"
	"github.com/golang/protobuf/proto"
	mspprotos "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/msp"
)

func getSigner(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) (string, error) {
	creator, err := stub.GetCreator()
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	id := &mspprotos.SerializedIdentity{}
	err = proto.Unmarshal(creator, id)
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	block, _ := pem.Decode(id.GetIdBytes())

	cert, err := x509.ParseCertificate(block.Bytes)

	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	signer := cert.Subject.CommonName
	return signer, nil
}
```

@jrosmith one more question :smile: my chaincode function returns a array String( []array ). But my invoke function is supposed to return a peer.response so my code is throwing an error. Any way around this?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 16:40:58 GMT):<br/>
@zimabry at some point you will have to convert any information you want to return from the chaincode into the form of a `peer.Response`. its easiest to use the shim functions, in your case `shim.Success()` but that only accepts one argument in the form of a byte array, so you will either need to convert.
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 16:41:15 GMT):<br/>
ive found the shim docs to be really helpful: https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim
</p>
<p><strong>zimabry</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:21:12 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith So I will need to convert the string array to byte array and pass it into shim.success()?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:21:34 GMT):<br/>
@zimabry yes that is correct
</p>
<p><strong>zimabry</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:23:20 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith can I use []byte() and pass in to that my array?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:24:16 GMT):<br/>
@zimabry unfortunately it is not that simple. take a look at the answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13573269/convert-string-to-byte
</p>
<p><strong>zimabry</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:26:39 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith yes I was actually reading this one earlier today. Will "encoding/gob" import work with go version go1.7.6 linux/amd64?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:27:07 GMT):<br/>
@zimabry absolutely!

@caseybecking as of the 1.1 release (happening later tonight or tomorrow) chaincode in node.js will be supported. to my knowledge chaincode in java is also supported but requires specific build options

ah, i've found the problem, you have to use name:version as id for the chaincode

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=iw3FDZHuaynX3WyjK) @papegaaij You will need to compile fabric from source, making sure that the `EXPERIMENTAL` variable is set to `true` (this is the default on non-releases). 
</p>
<p><strong>papegaaij</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 13:24:01 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr that part is hard to miss :)

</p>
<p><strong>papegaaij</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 13:25:01 GMT):<br/>
it would be nice though if builds with the experimental flag enabled would also be available as docker containers

<p><strong>papegaaij</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 13:25:12 GMT):<br/>
that would have saved me a day :)

is there a way to increase this timeout for chaincode invoke?
</p>
<p><strong>sanchezl</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 13:35:33 GMT):<br/>
I believe there are some timeout values in `core.yaml`.

`CORE_CHAINCODE_STARTUPTIMEOUT`
`CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMEOUT`

hi, i have a setup of two channels deployed on them same chaincode, channel A deployed on it chaincode (chX) and channel B deployed on it same chaincode (chX)
when i try to invoke a method on chX from channel A its works

when I try to invoke a method on chX from channel B it works
when i try to invoke from one channel a method on the other channel using InvokeChaincode, it fails with error 500
if i deployed different chaincode on each channel, as Channel A deployed on it chaincode (chX) and Channel B deployed on it chaincode (chY) and call InvokeChaincode from channel A to channel B this will work
any explanation why?

Hi All,
I have been doing a Performance Test on the hyperledger-fabric network with Node SDK. When I invoke an API to do a payment from Org1 to Org2 for about 6 min. using Jmeter tool, I get the following error.

`{
"error": "Failed to invoke chaincode. cause:Error: Problem setting up the event hub :Error: EventHub has been shutdown"
}`

When I investigated, I found out the 'chaincode container' crashing once it reaches 2GB limit and re-starting by itself. During this time, if there is any request made, I am getting the above said errors. And googling it out, I found there could be a 'memory leak' issue within the 'chaincode container' https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues/2801. I am using fabric version 1.1.0-alpha. 

I would like to know,
_i. if this issue is resolved or not?
ii. Is there a workaround?_

Please let me know if you need more information.
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 15:06:46 GMT):<br/>
 @zimabry yep, usually means you need vendor your dependencies 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 15:07:06 GMT):<br/>
i believe fabric currently uses govendor to handle, with plans to switch to godep
</p>
<p><strong>zimabry</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 15:12:44 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith I ran the following in the CLI container and still the same error. Should I run this locally or on the CLI container?

go get -u github.com/kardianos/govendor
govendor init
govendor fetch github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/msp
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 15:20:47 GMT):<br/>
@zimabry actually a bit out of my depth on that one, i usually handle all chaincode installation and instantiation via one of the sdks. @muralisr would have a better idea
</p>
<p><strong>zimabry</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 18:41:32 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith I actually figured it out, thank you though!

@crissi i recommend you to get the byfn and with a bit of tweaking make it install your chaincode instead the chaincode_example02 (playing with the docker-compose volumes :wink: ), then just `.byfn.sh -m up -l node`. the -l it's to choose the language, for now it's only node or golang (default).
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:18:29 GMT):<br/>
is that about the node question or the instantiate question ?
</p>
<p><strong>dsanchezseco</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:19:37 GMT):<br/>
both, i'd started with the node chaincodes looking at the node version of chaincode_example02 and https://fabric-shim.github.io/ChaincodeStub.html 
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:20:05 GMT):<br/>
my code is golang and I am unable to get chaincode to instantiate properly when in dev mode
</p>
<p><strong>dsanchezseco</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:20:36 GMT):<br/>
btw, check something about the new async/await in node if you don't already now

<p><strong>dsanchezseco</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:21:13 GMT):<br/>
@freddyisaac ah sorry, i misunderstood you, i didn't play with lscc (yet) sorry
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:21:49 GMT):<br/>
in fact the install doesn't give any errors and the instantiate actually executes the Init() on the chaincode but then it fails on an invoke by saying the "could not find chaincode with name mycc"
</p>
<p><strong>dsanchezseco</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:22:18 GMT):<br/>
wait you're in dev right?
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:22:25 GMT):<br/>
and the errors in the peer log start when looking up the chaincode name on the lscc namespace
</p>
<p><strong>dsanchezseco</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:22:53 GMT):<br/>
cause i can recall some differences in the install/instantiate between dev and prod...
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:22:58 GMT):<br/>
the peer is started with --peer-chaincodedev-true
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:23:47 GMT):<br/>
I don't do a package (I think) I just start the chaincode with the CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME set
</p>
<p><strong>dsanchezseco</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:23:51 GMT):<br/>
it was something about the -n -p in instantiate, to make developing easier, let me check  
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:24:09 GMT):<br/>
my instantiate line is
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:24:44 GMT):<br/>
peer chaincode instantiate -n mycc -v 0 -c '{"Args":["init","name","Frederick Isaac","b","200"]}' -o orderer.hypdex.com:7050 -C primaryab --tls true --cafile $ORDERER_CA --logging-level debug  -P 'OR ("DEAFULT.member")'
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:25:11 GMT):<br/>
and it is installed with mycc and -v 0 also which doesn't give any errors
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:25:51 GMT):<br/>
also I need to upgrade to 1.1 currently on 1.0.3 or something similar
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:27:28 GMT):<br/>
I see lines like

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=CrrXTxkfPjtYLeQoo) nope, this was from 0.6 i think, is no more in the docs, so the next suspect is the `-P`

<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:30:16 GMT):<br/>
in the peer log for byfn.sh I see the vscc mentioned a lot around the instantiate but in my logs I see no mention of the vscc
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:30:26 GMT):<br/>
what is the role of the vscc during instantiate ?
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:30:54 GMT):<br/>
is it even relevant during a dev mode instantiate ?

<p><strong>dsanchezseco</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:31:34 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=nExq78AAXBxy2XmwM) @freddyisaac Hi, I've seen this error while instantiation, not just in dev mode but in other cases. I don't know the cause of this but what I usually do is to instantiate on the other Org peer connected to the network, the instantiation normally goes fine at least in one of the peers. And when we invoke the chaincode, the change is broadcasted (instantiated) on other nodes as well.
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:46:43 GMT):<br/>
well in my small test box I only have one peer and one orderer
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:46:59 GMT):<br/>
is that a problem - must it have more than one peer
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:47:32 GMT):<br/>
I read a paper on hyperledger architecture and although it did not mention this explicitly I was left with a feeling that it might be a problem
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:48:25 GMT):<br/>
I was going step by step - started out with the chaincode in mock and it works ok
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:48:40 GMT):<br/>
then I thought single peer in dev mode would be the next step
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:48:54 GMT):<br/>
and grinding halt ... :)

@freddyisaac `in fact the install doesn't give any errors and the instantiate actually executes the Init() on the chaincode but then it fails on an invoke by saying the "could not find chaincode with name mycc"` - this suggests the the instantiate transaction sent following getting the response for your instantiate proposal (which appears to have been successful for you) never made it to be committed. You should see a Commit message in the peer log some time after the instantiate proposal. If you don't (or see errors during validation - this is where vscc woud come in) then that's the issue. There could also be an issue that the transaction was not even successfully submitted (say because the orderer `orderer.hypdex.com` was not reachable.  I'd look in the orderer log for activity as well.

<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 13:34:46 GMT):<br/>
if I could see an error then it would maybe give me a clue as to what might be wrong but I am just stabbing in the dark and the only clue I have is the lscc message
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 13:37:15 GMT):<br/>
if the orderer is received the transaction and sent it to peers, then the error could be in the peer on validation of the block (before you see the lscc message on the invoke)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 13:37:56 GMT):<br/>
the other thing that could happen is you might be sending the invoke too soon before the instantiate got committed
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 13:39:21 GMT):<br/>
what I'd do is (1) send the instantiate request (2) look at the peer and orderer logs for activity (3) wait for commit message or error on the peer log (4) if the former, send the invoke. if the later, debug
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 13:39:37 GMT):<br/>

is there a way to use peer chaincode invoke to query the lscc to get meta data about the installed chaincodes I think that the peer chaincode list was deprecated
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 13:53:47 GMT):<br/>
it would be nice to see what the lscc thinks that it has available or even if it is emty

@crissi what llevel of code are you using ? MSP role based policies (the ".peer" in your policy) was not introduced till the recent 1.1 .. I'd first try `OR ('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')` works. If it does, that's the issue

</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 21:54:58 GMT):<br/>
so I am guessing that the peer I was deploying the chaincode to was not a leader and unable to propagate the change

it this a valid use case - i.e. that chaincode can only be deployed to an org leader - if so a peer entry about trying to deploy to a peer that it not one might help

it this a valid use case - i.e. that chaincode can only be deployed to an org leader - if so a peer log entry about trying to deploy to a peer that it not one might help
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 21:57:17 GMT):<br/>
as the only hint it gave about anything being wrong was on the lscc lookup of the chaincode name

I started using Fabric 1.1.0 and its images. Trying out new fabric functionality CID. However, i am getting following error when instantiating chaincode `

@SashiKanth  `Install`: copy the built chaincode to endorsing peer (not exactly but that is the simplified version of it) on a channel.
`Instantiate`: Set the initial state of the channel.

Look at the `SimpleAsset` example. http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/chaincode4ade.html#terminal-3-use-the-chaincode

If you want to know what exactly `install` does, the source code is at: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/peer/chaincode/install.go
</p>
<p><strong>parsiya</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:16:46 GMT):<br/>
`Instantiate` basically calls the `Init` method from the Chaincode interface.
For `SimpleAsset` it's essentially a `PutState` with a key/value. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.1/chaincode/sacc/sacc.go#L23

Hi All, if keep fabric environment idle for 15 mins. if we add any smart contract then install chaincode is working fine. But instantiating chaincode is going into hung state and no error. Can anybody please help on this issue.

@muralisr Hello, I tried to import golang package-binary(※) when instantiating chaincode and got this error.(※)https://github.com/tcnksm/go-binary-only-package

"missing or invalid package binary for binary-only package ・・・"

Does Fabric(v1.0.0) support using package-binary?

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 00:36:27 GMT):<br/>
@freddyisaac I think you might have meant to say ` I believe (from my most recent adventures) that the instantiate .... ` (not `install`)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 00:38:16 GMT):<br/>
@y.yone sounds like you are trying to import a package that's not found ? typically implies you need to vendor the package 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 00:40:05 GMT):<br/>
@patelan need more information... what is getting into the hung state ? the client application ? what are you using for client (sdk ? CLI ?) .... need logs and basically lot more info

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=G6pzoaiY5kHcWjZ4t) @muralisr  Actually I had the same experience with @y.yone. I made the binary package and a dummy package for distribution and it got the chaincode built successfully locally. But when I tried to vendor all the necessary packages, the dummy package got vendered instead of the binary, and hence that error message occurred during instantiation phase. I am also wondering that if fabric supports using binary package for chaincode development? or are there any ways of vendoring binary package?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 01:07:51 GMT):<br/>

I am running Docker Toolbox on Windows. I have downloaded fabric samples from https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples. Modified the fabcar chaincode.

The first time I ran ./startFabric.sh to bring up the local blokchain network, the chaincode is getting picked up well and fine.

Now I make further changes to fabcar chaincode. But this time, my latest chaincode changes are not being picked up by the blockchain network. I still see old log messages and responses.

I have tried the following options already: 1) clearing up docker containers 2) restarting docker toolbox. 3) rerunning ./startFabric.sh from scratch.

The only time my chaincode changes are picked up is the "first ever time" when i use that particular chaincode. Thereafter the first chaincode somehow resides in the memory forever.

Please let me know what I am doing wrong.

 Its possible to build the chaincode, even though it raises the above issue.
I have written a simple chaincode.I am following this tutorial http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/chaincode4ade.html for deployment of chaincode.
But it raises the following issue.

how does someone update/upgrade chaincode after installing it? Is this process the same as the initial install and if so are there any plans to allow a broadcast of new chaincode to avoid the need for each peer to manually install it on its own?

 In the document it is written
`To create a signed chaincode package, use the following command:`

@pankajcheema don't use the "-s -S" option . It was put in place as a place holder for policies around chaincode lifecycle. The ongoing chaincode lifecycle work will make these unncessary and will likely deprecate those

@muralisr What should I use in place of -s and -S ?

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 09:21:35 GMT):<br/>
for now `peer chaincode package -n mycc -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02 -v 0 ccpack.out` is what I'd suggest
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 09:22:00 GMT):<br/>
this allows you to create ccpack.out once and use it to install on multiple peers 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 09:22:14 GMT):<br/>
like `peer chaincode install ccpack.out`
</p>

@joshhw all the peers that will be running the new chaincode will have to have the new chaincode installed. as with instantiation the upgrade command only needs to be called by one peer on the channel. 

i don't know if there are any plans regarding broadcasting new chaincode, but i'm assuming solutions for getting new chaincode on the peers is considered out of scope. one of the maintainers will have more concrete information for you

Hi,
I have a query :

Suppose I am making a scalable blockchain solution in which  organisations  are included in ledger frequently.Suppose my chaincode has an endorsement policy of some existing organisations,I will have to upgrade the chaincode on all the peers with the new endorsement policy involving in the new organisation.Until they updated all the peers, we wont be able to do any transactions invloving peers who might have yet to upgrade the chaincode.This limits either the transactions or frequently including new organizations. Any suggestions for us would help us a lot.

A quick question about chaincode, can chaincode work like a normal network client which establish network connection? As I remember the answer is no, because this can harm read-write-set semantics. But I can't find proof about it. Anyone knows if the answer is "no"? If my understanding is correct, how chaincode is forbidden from being a normal network client?

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 12:32:52 GMT):<br/>
@lclclc youre saying making requests to external sources from within the chaincode? there is nothing at the chaincode layer that stops you from importing an http library and using it to execute requests externally. but when it comes time to inspect transaction proposals peers will be in disagreement about the end state of the transaction and the transaction will fail the read/write set check, preventing it from being appended to the ledger 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 12:35:39 GMT):<br/>
@rock_martin yes, if the new organizations are completely unique entities with unique MSP identifiers the endorsement policy will have to be updated each time. perhaps you could create an umbrella MSP and manage users that way? as you add new users you will enroll them using the umbrella identity and when its time for the users to leave you can revoke their certificates
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 12:39:33 GMT):<br/>
@jojialex2 you can read chaincode data from multiple channels, if the admin is a member of all channels you should be able to find a workaround. maybe this will help https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces_stable.go#L65

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 12:47:09 GMT):<br/>
@lclclc oops i completely missed that! if i remember correctly the read/write stuff is enforced when the transaction is sent for ordering. to my knowledge there is nothing beyond that stopping the chaincode from accessing outside networks
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 12:50:57 GMT):<br/>
The problem is, if the chaincode take accessing outside network as the one step of the simulation, one chaincode container can succeed, aonther chaincode container can fail due to unstable network accessibility. Then client can not collect enough endorsement.

@lclclc yep youre absolutely right. i believe the current approach to that right now is "don't do that," but at the networking level im sure you could restrict any incoming/outgoing calls to just what the peer needs to participate in the network.

Hello, 
I understood that if I install/instantiate a new chaincode, a new docker is lauched. As a docker has a relatively short lifecycle. What happens if my docker dies ? 
Is it regenerate ?

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 07 Apr 2018 14:51:01 GMT):<br/>
@MonnyClara the chaincode runing in docker will stay up unless on some fault (connection loss, crash, manual stop etc). In those cases next request to the chaincode (such as invoke or query from CLI, or call from an SDK app) will bring it up automatically for you

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=ThuBpGJrkQqL9Lgdm) @jrosmith As the chaincode container is created by Fabric, I used to thought Fabric will take this into consideration and prevent inbound/outbound network traffic except for grpc.
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:27:16 GMT):<br/>
But according to my investigation, Fabric leaves this problem to developers.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:29:12 GMT):<br/>
what problem?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:29:17 GMT):<br/>
@lclclc 
</p>
<p><strong>luckydogchina</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:30:57 GMT):<br/>
 excuse me， the chaincode can be written with java in fabric？ 
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:40:46 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=gMfg5ftBX9MFanP6R) @yacovm the chaincode shouldn't access network, but no constraint as I observe from chaincode compilation side and container side.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:41:10 GMT):<br/>
why shouldn't it access the network?
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:45:27 GMT):<br/>
Because network is unstable, result from outside network will affect the simulation of the transaction calculation result. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:46:27 GMT):<br/>
that is correct
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:46:30 GMT):<br/>
so?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:46:43 GMT):<br/>
who said the chaincode execution *has* to be deterministic?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:46:59 GMT):<br/>
a chaincode can do anything you want - such as authenticate with an external system, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:47:21 GMT):<br/>
confining the chaincode to run without network limits many use cases
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:47:34 GMT):<br/>
where for example - you want to read from some external storage service
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:47:42 GMT):<br/>
or check stock prices, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:48:24 GMT):<br/>
If it is not deterministic, the simulation will vary in different container, then the transaction result is not determinstic, and the SDK can gather endorsement sometimes, sometimes not. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:48:31 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:48:45 GMT):<br/>
Of course there are requirement to check stock prices.
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:48:58 GMT):<br/>
but the request result will vary.
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:49:08 GMT):<br/>
That brings uncertainty to chaincode logic.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:49:15 GMT):<br/>
i know
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:49:25 GMT):<br/>
Other smart contract use a real sanbox
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:49:31 GMT):<br/>
like ethereum in evm
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:49:36 GMT):<br/>
well if the smart contract runs in a sand-box
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:49:43 GMT):<br/>
then it can't interact with the outside world
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:49:47 GMT):<br/>
but apparently Fabric does not think so.
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:50:03 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=7TFFc36rbxcMi3BdH) @yacovm That is why we design Oracles.

fabric is a permissioned blockchain... you install chaincode which you inspect beforehand
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:19:05 GMT):<br/>
it's not like ethereum where you run logic that someone else wrote 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:19:16 GMT):<br/>
it's a different mind-set
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:19:31 GMT):<br/>
the developer should do whatever he wants, even shoot himself in the foot if he really wants to
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:34:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's what I meant by "leave the problem to developers"
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:37:35 GMT):<br/>
And furthermore what I learned from other blockchain is. If you have a decentralized architecture, your transaction needs to be replayed in every node, your logic had better be designed as deterministic logic.

@lclclc one of the points of "simulation before commit" is to allow the chaincodes to be not restrictive. For example, one can go out to a local database (chaincode on all peers go to "http://mylocaldb".., ie, they execute the same code "fetch from local db") to get some data to do computation on. In the end if they don't output the same thing, they won't be able to commit the TX. I wouldn't use the word "non-deterministic" when talking about simulation (but I would be worried if there's "non-determinism" at commit time).  This "simulation before commit" and being on a permissioned blockchain so everyone agrees on the chaincode (just like they agree on the results from it) is what gives latitude to things other implementations cant.

I just read the new 1.1 document,  it looks like the author of this document doesn't like non-deterministic, either:
> Phase 1 ends when the application receives signed proposal responses from sufficient peers. We note that different peers can return different and therefore inconsistent transaction responses to the application for the same transaction proposal. It might simply be that the result was generated a different time on different peers with ledgers at different states – in which case an application can simply request a more up-to-date proposal response. Less likely, but much more seriously, results might be different because the chaincode is non-deterministic. Non-determinism is the enemy of chaincodes and ledgers and if it occurs it indicates a serious problem with the proposed transaction, as inconsistent results cannot, obviously, be applied to ledgers. An individual peer cannot know that their transaction result is non-deterministic – transaction responses must be gathered together for comparison before non-determinism can be detected. (Strictly speaking, even this is not enough, but we defer this discussion to the transaction topic, where non-determinism is discussed in detail.)

Hello, I am trying to develop an application on HLF v1.0  (following the tuna-app tutorial). From the tuna-chaincode.go
var tuna = Tuna{ Vessel: args[1], Location: args[2], Timestamp: args[3], Holder: args[4] }
How do I handle the case when some of the fields could be empty/null (or only 3 arguments passed assuming 4th is optional)?

var tuna = Tuna{ Vessel: args[1], Location: args[2], Timestamp: args[3], Holder: args[4] }
How do I handle the case when some of the fields could be empty/null (or only 3 arguments passed assuming 4th is optional)? Below is what I tried, but the issue is if args only has 3 elements, the check on args[4] != "" fails and chaincode errors out
if (args[1] != "") {lc.ShipmentDate = args[1] } 
	if (args[2] != "") {lc.ShipmentCarrier = args[2] }    
	if (args[3] != "") {lc.ShipmentTrackingNum = args[3] }  
	if (args[4] != "") {lc.ShipmentStatus = args[4] } 
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:52:23 GMT):<br/>
you are still accessing args[4] even if len(args) == 3 so it will panic
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:53:11 GMT):<br/>
when you call it you will need to set args[4] = "" assuming that args is big enouch to hole it else you will need to use append
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:53:19 GMT):<br/>
else use something like
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:53:32 GMT):<br/>
for i, v := range args {
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:53:36 GMT):<br/>
switch i {
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:53:47 GMT):<br/>
case 0 : 
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:54:03 GMT):<br/>
lc.ShipmentDate = args[0]
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:54:05 GMT):<br/>
}
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:54:05 GMT):<br/>
}
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:54:06 GMT):<br/>
etc.
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:54:23 GMT):<br/>
actually use i+1 and case 1:
</p>
<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:54:33 GMT):<br/>

As off Fabric Version 1.1, you can issue a read query to an already instantiated chaincode (External chaincode), but not issue write query to a different chaincode. Can be install and instantiate a (external) chaincode from another external chaincode ?

Hi guys. I'm currently trying to upgrade some chaincode running on fabric-samples/byfn. I am currently using fabric v1.1.0. I've noticed that in the utils.sh script there's a function to upgrade the chaincode (it runs on the cli container after the network starts i believe). However, when I'm trying to execute that call, i get "Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = chaincode error (status: 500, message: cannot get package for chaincode (mycc:2.0))". Does it have to do with the fact that starting with v1.1 there's no more go compilation done on the cli container (I'm still a bit unclear on that part)? I would very much appreciate some tips on how to properly upgrade chaincode running fabric v1.1.0. Thank you =)

hi guys:I want to issue cryptocurrency with hyperledger fabric. I find the sample chaincode chaincode_example02:
// Transaction makes payment of X units from A to B
func (t *SimpleChaincode) invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) pb.Response {
... ...
// Get the state from the ledger
// TODO: will be nice to have a GetAllState call to ledger
Avalbytes, err := stub.GetState(A)
.......
Bvalbytes, err := stub.GetState(B)
.........
Aval = Aval - X
Bval = Bval + X
............
err = stub.PutState(A, []byte(strconv.Itoa(Aval)))
.............
err = stub.PutState(B, []byte(strconv.Itoa(Bval)))
..... .....
}
Transaction makes payment of X units from A to B.
Now I assume a trading scenario:
User: A , B and C
A send 10$ to C include Tx1, and B send 10$ to C include Tx2.
If the Tx1 and Tx2 are blocked into one batch, can they be effective ? or throw one exception?

Hi All,
GetQueryResult(queryString) is returning the error "http: read on closed response body"
"{\"selector\": {\"dueDate\": {\"$lt\":\"20180410\"}},\"limit\": 25,\"skip\": 1,\"sort\": [{\"dueDate\": \"asc\"}]}"

I think the error is due to the "sort"

I need the response to be sorted based on the field dueDate
</p>
<p><strong>mna2016</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 18:35:37 GMT):<br/>
When i remove the sort portion from this queryString, the query runs fine.

hi all, i have just created the fabric network, successfully created the channel, install the chaincode in peer1, but when I instantiate the chaincode, i got below error, any hint?

@anishman you are runing in "dev mode". The screenshot shows the chaincode successfully registered with the peer and is waiting for invokes. Typically the first time you also install and instantiate (before you do invokes) just as you would with a chaincode running in docker in non-dev mode . Given that background what do you mean by `it hangs and doesn't output any result. ` ? Do make sure you follow all the steps

I would like to obtain the processing result of the chaincode using the node's SDK.
However, node - sdk returns only the transaction ID.

shim.Success returns bytecode.
Is there a way to get this bytecode?

Hi guys! Is there any way to get the latest block height in the chaincode?
I need to get the current timestamp in the chaincode for verification.
I think time.Now () is not deterministic so I tried to use the latest block height, but I don’t know how I get it.
</p>
<p><strong>gut</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 10:36:49 GMT):<br/>
@Brucepark bear in mind that if you query a peer timestamp it doesn't have to be the same one as in other peer. you can query block information invoking QSCC from the SDK and then show it externally. But, as you are writing to chaincode channel, I assume that you are trying to query it from inside the peer. From this side, my experience tells me that you're not allowed to do so. If you only need a Tx Timestamp, youu can access it querying its history (I don't remember exactly but it could be GetHistoryForKey function)

@kai_den probably a better question for #fabric-sdk-node, but you can access the specific results payload by grabbing `result.response.payload` , just call `.toString()` on it to parse the buffer.

Can you execute a chaincode function after a certain amount of time from within the chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 13:40:19 GMT):<br/>
@JeroenDePrest the chaincode functions are called on a request response basis (invoke proposal is the request). You should not have chaincode run somethig outside of that flow. Even within that flow, "waiting certain amount of time" is an anti pattern... you can do it but best to avoid such strategies

Hi all! Not sure if this is the correct channel, please direct me elsewhere if necessary :)
So I have a problem understanding the difference between installing and instantiating chaincode. As I understand it I need to install on all peers for all orgs but only instantiate once per channel..? Or once per org..? Thanks!

@SaraEmily Installing the chaincode allows the peer to interact with this chaincode (query/invoke ...) 
Instantiate it allows to initiate the objects of the chaincode : 
- for exemple in this chaincode : https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.1/chaincode/chaincode_example02/go/chaincode_example02.go, the Instantiatation calls the Init() function and set the value of A et B 
- in this one : https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.1/chaincode/marbles02/go/marbles_chaincode.go, you can see that the Init() function in not doing anything 
</p>
<p><strong>MonnyClara</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 08:08:34 GMT):<br/>
BUT in any case, you have to instantiate the chaincode one per channel to be able to interact with it

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 09:36:31 GMT):<br/>
@SouvikDey   - In dev mode, the chaincode does not run in Docker ... it simply runs as a standalone executable and connects to the peer.  The code which actually creates Docker images for chaincode in production mode can be found in the core/chaincode/platforms package for each supported language.

But let me ask ... what issue / problem are you having?
</p>
<p><strong>SouvikDey</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 10:01:20 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 - To instantiate the chaincode container from the peer, the environment varialble :
--env CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_EXTRAHOSTS=peer0.nodeX.example.com:<<internal docker ip of the peer>>
needs to be set. This is then reflected in the /etc/hosts file of the chaincode container. Without this property, the chaincode isntantiation is failing. Is this environment varialble mandatory and can we use not use the internal docker ip of the peer as the IP mapping?

I am working on a fabric based design that can potentially have 1000's of private transactions (as many chaincodes). From data privacy perspective, I am looking to have the optimum design. I can have individual channels for each private communication thus ensuring that only relevant transactions are stored physically on any node. However it means creating 1000s of individual channels. It creates operations/maintenance challenges and network stability. Any feedback would be appreciated.

You  can run multiple chaincodes with different names so each chaincode gets a unique namespace. If you want the same code to be run, you can just install the same chaincode with different names and instantiate them. They will be running the same code but under different containers with their unique namespaces

<p><strong>RitinPali</strong> (Sun, 29 Apr 2018 12:57:37 GMT):<br/>
but this fails
peer chaincode instantiate -n mycc -v 0 -c '{"Args":["a","10","b","5"]}' -C myc
gives error 
incorrect no. of args.. expecting 4
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 29 Apr 2018 13:06:10 GMT):<br/>
try ["invoke", "a","10","b","5"]
</p>

:clap:
that worked..
</p>
<p><strong>RitinPali</strong> (Sun, 29 Apr 2018 13:13:40 GMT):<br/>
but dont i have to init the balances through the init func?
this is just calling the invoke func?
</p>
<p><strong>RitinPali</strong> (Sun, 29 Apr 2018 13:17:36 GMT):<br/>
peer chaincode query -n mycc -c '{"Args":["query","b"]}' -C myc
returns 5.. 
which is correct
ok.. thanks

`stub.GetStateByRange` asserts that `startKey` and `endKey` are simple keys, why is this? Isn't it allowed to get a range using composite keys?
</p>
<p><strong>papegaaij</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 09:52:37 GMT):<br/>
I'm asking because the Java implementation of `getStateByPartialCompositeKey` calls `getStateByRange` directly, making it impossible to use composite keys in `getStateByPartialCompositeKey`
</p>
<p><strong>papegaaij</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 09:52:59 GMT):<br/>

We are using CouchDB as our backend database for our peers. Can we find the historical transaction data from the CouchDB instance. Is it stored in some database within CouchDB or in a file system outside CouchDB?
</p>
<p><strong>SouvikDey</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 10:47:18 GMT):<br/>
If some key is deleted from the back-end CouchDB database for one of the peers, will there be any auto-syncing of the data on the same CouchDB instance such that the key can be retrieved in future?

hey all, i'm consistently getting `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` for chaincode instantiations, but I'm really unsure why. my docker container comes up and even has the specific instantiation success log, yet when my sdk goes to verify the proposal response it still comes back as timed out. i've tried increasing the `executeTimeout` from 30s to 60s, but still no luck. 

this consistently happens the very first time i go to install and instantiate. follow up attempts to install and instantiate and are successful

Hello experts. I have a question about API of `Chaincode shim`. Is there any plan or discussion to add APIs to put/get/delete key-values per data object?

When a Chaincode has multiple data objects, it is common to use composite keys. Composite keys have the name of an object as a prefix.
Let’s say we have `Marble` as an object. `Marble` is used as a prefix. The key-values in `Marble` looks like: ` Marble_key1-value1` `Marble_key2-value2` and `Marble_key3-value3`.
When getting/putting a key-value, we call `stub.CreateCompositeKey(objectType, keys)` to generate a composite key.
In case getting all key-values in `Marble`, we call `stub.getStateByPartialCompositeKey(objectType, []string{})` to get key-values which has `Marble` as a partial key.

I know that table API in v0.6 was abandoned. However, it may be useful to add APIs like the below because we often implement these functions in Chaincode.
`GetObjectData(objectType, key)`: return a key-value which has a composite key consisting of `objectType_key`.
`GetAllByObjectType(objectType)`: return a list of key-values in an object (or return an iterator).
`DelAllByObjectType(objectType)`: delete all key-values in an object.

Hey guys, don't know if this is the right channel for this. But I'm looking for part of the Farbic codebase that's responsible for actually creating the CC docker images. Also, I'd look to know when in the CC life-cycle the image is actually built. Is it during install? Or during instantiate?

Hi the events generated in chaincode with shim.SetEvent emits the event when peers are simulating the trasnactions or when the transaction is committed
</p>

?
</p>
<p><strong>papegaaij</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 09:28:01 GMT):<br/>
afaik the event (only 1) is recorded as part of the block, thus when the transaction is committed
</p>
<p><strong>papegaaij</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 09:39:36 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels the code is in `core/chaincode/platforms`
</p>

Hi,
is there a possibility to determine if a chaincode is invoked by another chaincode? stub.InvokeChaincode() is not generating a new Tx, so Tx Creator is still the sender.
My idea is to create a "chaincode token wallet" (which is another chaincode) (like in ethereum, where a smart contract can contains ETH).
This TokenWalletChaincode have to be only invoked by this chaincode.
But the only method I see is stub.InvokeChaincode() and with this, I can not implement this use case. Are there any options to implement this use case in a similiar way?
</p>
<p><strong>papegaaij</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:22:11 GMT):<br/>
@schtho i don't know about your specific question, but i do see a different problem: you can only do read-only transactions on other chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>schtho</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:27:31 GMT):<br/>
If a tx on other chaincode can only be read-only, I can not implement this use case in Fabric.
Thank you for your quick response :slight_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>papegaaij</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:32:18 GMT):<br/>
@schtho i just rechecked the documentation, just to be sure, it seems it a bit more subtle: you can do write-transactions on other chaincode, but only on the same channel

Guys quick question. I did a little bit of scanning of the code-base today and I'd like to ask something about peer configuration through viper.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:34:26 GMT):<br/>
I'm building a tool to get Fabric working in Kubernetes so I'd like to know the following.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:36:49 GMT):<br/>
Peers build their own containers through the dockerclient, and pass-along some HostConfig. It takes that configuration from viper.*("vm.docker.${key}").

</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:37:46 GMT):<br/>
Would I be correct in assuming that if I add a file much like https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/core/chaincode/chaincodetest.yaml#L321 that I would override container hostConfig by adding a hostConfig section?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:38:37 GMT):<br/>
Also ensuring that the file is named `core.json`and is located at `FABRIC_CFG_PATH`.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:43:15 GMT):<br/>
Relevant files: Concerning the file name having to be `core.json` https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/peer/main.go#L87, setting `FABRIC_CFG_PATH` https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/core/config/config.go#L138 and setting the `vm.docker.hostConfig` keys https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/core/container/dockercontroller/dockercontroller.go#L127
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:45:41 GMT):<br/>
The reason I'm asking is because I need to set `dns-search` to an IP inside my kubernetes cluster. Using above approach would help in avoiding altering the DockerOpts on my VM's.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:46:23 GMT):<br/>
Which would require a restart of my nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>schtho</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:54:15 GMT):<br/>
@papegaaij thx, but there is no possibility to look up in metadata or somewhere else if a Tx is invoked directly by sender or by chaincode (apart from that, the Tx context is the same)?
</p>
<p><strong>papegaaij</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:29:49 GMT):<br/>
i don't know for sure, i'm not that familiar with the internals of fabric and how it passes these messages to the other chaincode, but i don't think it is possible to differentiate between the client and other chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>papegaaij</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:30:28 GMT):<br/>
you might want to look at the creator

Hello guys
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 05 May 2018 12:18:47 GMT):<br/>
@CodeReaper @jrosmith 1.1 has an event delivery on channel level which allows listener to get events from any block onwards http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/peer_event_services.html?highlight=channel%20event
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Sat, 05 May 2018 16:15:22 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr "Requests to receive events are accepted from identities outside of the peer’s organization (as defined by the channel configuration). This also provides greater reliability and a way to receive events that may have been missed" How does identities listening for events outside organization give way to listen events that have been missed?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 05 May 2018 16:19:54 GMT):<br/>
@CodeReaper when you start the listener you can specify the block to start listening from. SDKs expose this in their event API (for example see https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-channel-events.html for node SDK)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 05 May 2018 16:20:43 GMT):<br/>
the event client could keep track of last block processed and use that to get missed blocks
</p>

@CodeReaper To write unit tests you will need the functionality first. You have a (quite old) ToDo story in JIRA (FAB-5644) and a (newer) InProgress one (FAB-7603). They're different depending on what you need. You could contact the Asignee and help implementing it if you really need it now.

Hi all, I needed some assistance. When I instantiate the NodeJS chaincode, i get the error pasted below. Any help or guidance would be much appreciated.  
E0508 10:52:31.948211338      18 ssl_transport_security.cc:238] Could not get common name of subject from certificate.

I have a pretty specific question. We are trying to encrypt our data on the chain code but we don’t want to lose our mango queries to query inside an object in CouchDB. Anyone have any ideas? We looked at encCC but here we then loose our mango queries so this is not really an option. Another option we thought about was that we could use Vault from HashiCorp to manage the encryption keys and then encrypt the values but not the keys and then also encrypt the query in the same way to still be able to do the mango queries. If anyone has a better idea feel free explain it.

From your error, you are importing a package named "plugin", which compiler cannot find.

Hello, 
I have a really "simple" question : is it possible to split a chaincode code into mutliple files ? 
For exemple `main.go` with the main function as `Init` `Invoke` and `main`, then the `main.go` would call other go file like `query.go` or `update.go`

I am planning to write a chaincode that provides a look-up service using its internal lookup table.  I know there could be multiple way to achieve this functionality but I would like this question to stay focused on this design pattern.  The question: - what is the size limitation on a chaincode as my lookup data can get very large?

So it wasnt connecting to the chaincode container.

<p><strong>diestrin</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 13:38:42 GMT):<br/>
is it usual that a nodejs chaincode takes too much to instantiate? using the docker cli container, calling to install is pretty quick, but instantiate can some times take up to a minute to complete, is this fine?
</p>
<p><strong>diestrin</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 13:42:33 GMT):<br/>
actually, sometimes it just timeouts
</p>
<p><strong>diestrin</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 13:43:27 GMT):<br/>
and when I retry after a timeout, it's super fast, takes like 5 seconds

@albert.lacambra The problem I face was a issue in the creation of the docker network. You can see it here for exemple in the  fabric-samples/first-network/base/peer-base.yaml
```
services:
  peer-base:
    environment:
      # the following setting starts chaincode containers on the same
      # bridge network as the peers
      # https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/
      - CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_byfn
``` 
Has I didn't need a special docker network, I switched to a default one : `testnetwork_default`. This way all my dockers are on the same network and my issue is solved now !

@diestrin ive noticed the same with go, i think the ~1 minute is just how long it takes to run the instantiation transaction and wake to make sure it has come up properly. i've also noticed weird timeouts though, especially if i try to instantiate right after the network has come up

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 22:20:09 GMT):<br/>
@albert.lacambra since the instantiation is sent to the "lscc" chaincode, the error mentions "lscc" but the problem is likely elsewhere.  first thing I'd check is if the image got built successfully ... given that chaincode dev mode works, it could simply be a question of all dependencies in the GOPATH for dev mode but not packaged in the chaincode

@pankajcheema I think couchdb pagination is not yet integrated. We made a workaround integrating pagination on client app. It's not a good practice because you relay on the client correctness, but as we hope this is evolving we preferred to wait.
For the dates part, I'm sorry I have no response yet.

RESOLVED: there were a couple of issues, first you need to ensure that the GOROOT and GOPATH environment variables are set correctly. Also you need to ensure that the permissions on the respective folders referenced by those environment variables are set correctly and then you need to ensure that your GO installation is not corrupted

1. GOROOT should be the installation directory for GO
2. GOPATH: is the path to where you develop the source code
3. The user you're running the command with should have permissions on both of those directories

Hi, everyone.  I'm new to Hyperledger, new to chaincode, new to Go, and struggling.  I'm trying to get the name of the user who's invoking a chaincode command, using Go.  I found stub.GetCreator() but I'm not sure how to use the []byte it gives me.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 20:21:34 GMT):<br/>
@geekoftheweek you can decrypt the cert and get the common name from it: https://hastebin.com/anojacekum.go
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 20:21:49 GMT):<br/>
you can also use the cid library in 1.1 if it is enabled for your channel: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.1/core/chaincode/lib/cid
</p>
<p><strong>geekoftheweek</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 20:23:13 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith Thank you very much!  I'll try the latter, and fall back to the former.  Thanks again!
</p>
<p><strong>geekoftheweek</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 20:51:04 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith this is a developer instance, so I have complete control over what libraries are enabled on the channel -- where might I go to learn how to enable cid?

go get -u --tags nopkcs11 github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim

^ have you ran this? it will download the hyperledger fabric chaincode code depedency and install it to your local go folders
</p>
<p><strong>MeghaGupta</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:37:56 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:37:59 GMT):<br/>
after you run the above command you need to run;
go build --tags nopkcs11

to build the code and install it
</p>
<p><strong>MeghaGupta</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:38:01 GMT):<br/>
I did this
</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:38:27 GMT):<br/>
can you find this directory it is complaining about?
</p>
<p><strong>MeghaGupta</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:38:36 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>vick</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:48:17 GMT):<br/>
yeah, so i think the command which downloads and builds those libraries did not run properly
</p>
<p><strong>MeghaGupta</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:48:18 GMT):<br/>
Did I downloaded wrong package version 
</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:48:30 GMT):<br/>
which version of go are your using?
</p>
<p><strong>MeghaGupta</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:48:49 GMT):<br/>
1.10.1
</p>
<p><strong>MeghaGupta</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:49:21 GMT):<br/>
shall i remove that package and get it again
</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:51:05 GMT):<br/>
you can try to remove the whole folder, i would recommend that actually
</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:51:12 GMT):<br/>
and run the above commands again
</p>
<p><strong>vick</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:51:17 GMT):<br/>
or if you prefer take a backup of it
</p>
<p><strong>MeghaGupta</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:52:11 GMT):<br/>
ok let me try 
</p>
<p><strong>MeghaGupta</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:54:54 GMT):<br/>
Thanks a lot @vick that worked previously i followed the page https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Archive/learn-chaincode/blob/master/docs/setup.md
</p>
<p><strong>MeghaGupta</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 10:55:24 GMT):<br/>
this time run the cmd go get -u --tags nopkcs11 github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim

Hello ! I am using fabric v 1.0.3 and I am facing an issue with read/write semantics. writing unit tests for transaction that reads after writing into the ledger (same transaction), using mockStub, It will succeed. meanwhile when trying to do so in fabric it reads only what is committed (which means read after write in same transaction will not succeed). is this issue has been resolved in other versions ? 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 13:49:39 GMT):<br/>
@wael those are known as phantom reads, in a given transaction you cannot read your own writes. this behavior is by design: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces_stable.go#L81

@wael that makes sense to me, but i'm also not a maintainer so i can't really comment. you should open up a JIRA issue and the maintainers will address it

<p><strong>gut</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 08:31:11 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith @wael I don't think write+read issue is phantom read related, but an endorsement behavior. Because the data wael is trying to access in Fabric can be endorsed, but not yet committed, data state is not consistent in the readset. So your read access is rejected.
</p>
<p><strong>gut</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 08:32:21 GMT):<br/>
Also, keep in mind that MockStub is just a mock. The data commitment behavior is not reflected. It could, and if you create a JIRA issue for sure it will be a great feature. But since you put the new state, data is already there.

Hi all,
I have just start with chaincode.
I have two questions:
1) I understood that we will have a secure container to execute each chaincode. This mechanism cannot  provoke a performance problem when I will have an important number of smart contract.
2) Have you any link or tutorial that detail some recommendations and best practice to develop the smart contract.
Thanks in advance

`ERRO 692 [[e9585782 PUT_STATE ERROR]]No ledger context for %!!(MISSING)s(MISSING). Sending %!!(MISSING)s(MISSING)
ERRO 6a2 [bloqchannel][e9585782] failed to invoke chaincode name:"lscc" , error: timeout expired while executing transaction`

I am using Hyperledger Fabric v1.1.0 preview
I have 2 orgs and 3 peers per org.

Hi There, Is  there any way we encrypt  the chaincode data? or use binary code to install ?

@venediktov When a transaction is submitted via a chaincode, all the peers simulate the transaction and share their results. If the result of a transaction isn't deterministic, I think that the transaction will not be validated.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=keMkGEiTbnumnJvkq) @MonnyClara Ivan keeps saying "it will be rejected e.g. not update the ledger but will be stored in the blockchain" - This is very confusing .
</p>
<p><strong>MonnyClara</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 07:05:14 GMT):<br/>
Oh yeah that's right I forgot about it ! 
I never check if that was actually stored in the blockchain, but when you query the blockchain for a state (for example). The value that you will receive is the value of the ledger (the last valid value of the state) 

I think @gatakka is a fat more reliable source than me. You should thrust him rather than me ;)

ok will wait for @gatakka to get back to me ,will read more docs in the meantime about fabric implementation . However the question is still why fabric does not disable outgoing HTTP calls functionality , IO , random functions , all that should be disabled to guarantee determinism of smart contracts IMHO.

@venediktov In fabric's `send request to peers who need to endorse - collect responses - collection responses to be committed in a transaction - commit transaction` model, the `HTTP Calls from my chaincode`  falls under the `send request to peers who need to endorse ` phase. If they sent back different responses, the `commit transaction` will fail. In that sense it is deterministic.

Hi All
</p>
<p><strong>pathfinder2104</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 12:32:27 GMT):<br/>
I want to know that by current version of Fabric (1.1) which languages are supported for Chaincode ?
</p>
<p><strong>pathfinder2104</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 12:32:33 GMT):<br/>
I know about JS and GoLang 
</p>
<p><strong>pathfinder2104</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 12:32:38 GMT):<br/>
is Java supported ?
</p>
<p><strong>pathfinder2104</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 12:32:57 GMT):<br/>
JS using Hyperledger-Composer, if I am not wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 12:38:16 GMT):<br/>
@pathfinder2104 there has been discussion on Java support and ongoing work on that.. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8063 says 1.3 timeframe. Perhaps check with #fabric-java-chaincode 
</p>
<p><strong>pathfinder2104</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 12:38:41 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for responding :) 
</p>
<p><strong>pathfinder2104</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 12:38:44 GMT):<br/>
I will surely check there
</p>
<p><strong>pathfinder2104</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 12:38:56 GMT):<br/>
but can you please tell me currently whihc all languages are supported ?
</p>
<p><strong>pathfinder2104</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:10:03 GMT):<br/>
are there any significant advantages on using GoLang in place of Javascript as chaincode language ?
</p>
<p><strong>pathfinder2104</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 13:10:25 GMT):<br/>
or JavaScript in place of GoLang ?

<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:11:41 GMT):<br/>
Ok Came accross this QUESTION in a recent group discussion and I believe it was plausible to put it here for more inputs.

can someone put more light - LARGE text so please be patient with it.

I have 2 endorser nodes in the system with go language chaincode. 
we have a local Web-site running on each NODE (JSON WEB SERVICES) - That would be called by go language chaincode while doing invoke. 
Both Nodes JSON Web-services have different business logics to return data. And I want the data to persist to the BLOCKCHAIN if the EXTERNAL Web-service calls on both nodes return "true" - else the transaction be marked as "failed".
This indeed breaks the "deterministic" requirement of chaincode as the endorsers run the entire chaincode on each invoke and run locally on each NODE. 
But out of *curiosity* can this be done - are we on the right track?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:12:29 GMT):<br/>
Example Details:
--------------------------------------
Node 01 - 10.10.10.1 
Chaincode Name : agmchaincode:v1.0
JSON web-service URL : http://localhost/checkId?token=12234 (this is invoked from the chaincode) - returns "true" or "false"

Node 02: 10.10.10.2
Chaincode Name : agmchaincode:v1.0
JSON web-service URL: http://localhost/checkId?token=12234 (this is invoked from the chaicode) - returns "true" or "false"
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:13:11 GMT):<br/>
Scenario 
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:13:11 GMT):<br/>
Scenario 
------------------------------
I want to save following data to the chaincode (Endorsement policy is "both node01,node02 should endorse")
UserID, LoginDate, Status, Comments, Token to the ledger

1001, 12/05/2018, 1, 'First Login', TOKEN01 - is passed to the invoke (to NODE 01)
- the chaincode invokes http://localhost/checkId?token=TOKEN01 - this returns TRUE - the proposal is sent as successful
1001, 12/05/2018, 1, 'First Login', TOKEN01 - is passed to the invoke (to NODE 02)
- the chaincode invokes http://localhost/checkId?token=TOKEN01 - this returns FALSE- the proposal is sent as unsuccessful

In that scenario - the TRANSACTION is rejected - which is what I need.
Is this the right way?
Note: THE URL - always is hardcoded as "http://localhost/checkId?token=" (on all NODES)
Note: this way I can expose some of the logic of cross checking the data to an external ENDPOINT and enforce them to give "true" if the business logic returns true, else false
Note: for NODES with no "http://localhost/checkId?token=" url (site is not availbale locally) - I assume this is "true" and the nodes do not have any issue with this chaincode call
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:24:52 GMT):<br/>
@Amjadnz so basically, you have a chaincode that calls a web service and you want to ensure that both web services return true and only then, the transaction is persisted?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:25:09 GMT):<br/>
the chaincode - it calls the web service before or after its activity?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:37:40 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=kYbSjjD9CQKAgLP23) @yacovm - this is called before the activity.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:37:58 GMT):<br/>
If failure it returns an error
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:38:02 GMT):<br/>
oh so it's basically an authorization 
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:38:09 GMT):<br/>
In this case yes.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:38:11 GMT):<br/>
and if the client doesn't pass authorization - the endorsement fails
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:38:14 GMT):<br/>
aha! 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:38:20 GMT):<br/>
i have the *perfect* tool for you
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:38:24 GMT):<br/>
assuming you use v1.1 ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:39:29 GMT):<br/>
take a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L345-L366
and here is an example: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/core/handlers/auth/filter/expiration.go
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:39:46 GMT):<br/>
you can make this work as a binary plugin and be loaded dynamically upon peer startup
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:40:09 GMT):<br/>
the `expiration.go` is a check that the identity of the client hasn't expired
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:40:26 GMT):<br/>
you can do something similar and add this check at the entrance to the peer's endorser logic
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:40:44 GMT):<br/>
then - if this check fails, it rejects and doesn't continue to the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:41:06 GMT):<br/>
Very interesting - Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:42:00 GMT):<br/>
On the side node - I mean not just for authentication - maybe a generic business logic REST Service that search local databases before endorsing a transaction, is it a right way or use case of blockchain based systems.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:42:53 GMT):<br/>
so i have another tool for you
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:43:08 GMT):<br/>
there is a similar thing that intercepts the requests, and does some computation
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:43:15 GMT):<br/>
and then passes the result of the computation
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:43:16 GMT):<br/>
to the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:43:50 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L361-L366
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:43:57 GMT):<br/>
"decorators"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:44:42 GMT):<br/>
take a look here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.1/core/handlers/decoration
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:45:12 GMT):<br/>
basically... it intercepts the request from the user, it has access to the `Proposal` and also to the arguments the user passed
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:45:18 GMT):<br/>
it can even mutate the arguments the user passed ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:45:18 GMT):<br/>
it can even mutate the arguments the user passed ;)  and it adds "decorations" via adding to a `map[string][]byte`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:45:50 GMT):<br/>
and then the chaincode can call: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces_stable.go#L184-L187
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:45:54 GMT):<br/>
`GetDecorations() map[string][]byte`
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:46:49 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=jRbbHXcRCzfSACqZy) @yacovm - now this is interesting indeed.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:47:03 GMT):<br/>
if you think this is interesting wait for v1.2 ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:47:30 GMT):<br/>
Worth the wait for my test case though - not in hurry anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:47:43 GMT):<br/>
in v1.2 - the client doesn't need to know the endorsement policy
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:47:50 GMT):<br/>
nor the peers in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:47:55 GMT):<br/>
Oh - is it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:48:31 GMT):<br/>
yeah... look here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discovery-overview.html
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:48:39 GMT):<br/>
So the framework does the heavylifting. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:49:01 GMT):<br/>
yeah, long story short - the client has 1 or a few peers it "trusts"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:49:17 GMT):<br/>
and it asks them - "say, i want to endorse for chaincode foo, who are the peers i should ask?"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:49:59 GMT):<br/>
the peer returns an answer that is some object that the client can use to compute combinations of peers that each combination satisfies the endorsement policy
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:50:36 GMT):<br/>
so, i.e in the SDK you won't have to give peers to the channel anymore
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:50:47 GMT):<br/>
or to tell the channel to use certain peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:51:03 GMT):<br/>
it will be more smart
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:52:04 GMT):<br/>
Yes it does, So the doc is saying we have bootstrap the application. I assumed we define this in the channel config. How is that bootstrapping done?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:52:04 GMT):<br/>
Yes it does, So the doc is saying we have bootstrapped the application for the list of possible peers to endorse. I assumed we define this in the channel config. How is that bootstrapping done?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:52:17 GMT):<br/>
bootstrapping what?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:52:30 GMT):<br/>
when you bootstrap the SDK you already know use events, right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:52:56 GMT):<br/>

```The application is bootstrapped knowing about a group of peers which are trusted by the application developer/administrator to provide authentic responses to discovery queries. A good candidate peer to be used by the client application is one that is in the same organization.```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:53:35 GMT):<br/>
ah... yeah. you need a peer you trust, basically
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:53:40 GMT):<br/>
well but that's true even before
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:53:45 GMT):<br/>
you use the event service right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:53:50 GMT):<br/>
you trust that peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:53:57 GMT):<br/>
so you can use the same peer for events and discovery
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:53:59 GMT):<br/>
Yes I use event service.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:54:06 GMT):<br/>
Ok - got that.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:54:08 GMT):<br/>
so you already now have a peer you trust
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:54:32 GMT):<br/>
basically... as you know, a client doesn't have the blockchain inside of it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:54:35 GMT):<br/>
so it has to trust some peer
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:55:06 GMT):<br/>
So essentially we get the endorsement from the discovery service and no need to mention it as part of lets take NODE-JS invocations.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:55:31 GMT):<br/>
yeah exactly
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 20:55:41 GMT):<br/>
i only hope the node.js guys will actually code it.... ;)

One of the limitation I felt when I started with the this channel thing - May be my assumptions are not in line - Once the channel is defined with a set of participants, and we have to change it down the line - is there a chance of doing it in 1.1 or 1.2?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 21:00:59 GMT):<br/>
One way of doing it was to revoke certs (to remove some orgs).
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 21:02:13 GMT):<br/>
i don't understand

you can re-configure the channel

<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 21:11:14 GMT):<br/>
the clearing/approval cycles in some orgs are really time consuming. Hence these delays. But buying them in was the most difficult part. Like selling them a BMW cheap, and making them pay for spares.

Ok another question if someone may be able to help me out here.
Is there a guide on how to develop a possible cryptocurrency in FABRIC framework?
I know there is a balance transfer, marbles examples - but those are simple aspects of ownership transfer, marbles by marbles, or value by value.

Where as a formal UTXO type of cryptocurrency would involve a lot of features including, splitting, ownership transfer, unit distribution etc.
Since there is no concept of "mining" here - how can this be incentivized for "miners" to host nodes for endorsements.  
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 00:18:03 GMT):<br/>
I would'nt call it crypto-currency though - maybe a crypto-token.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 00:25:28 GMT):<br/>
A quick follow through led me to this

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:13:01 GMT):<br/>
@Amjadnz you're right, mining is an incentive for people to host nodes in a public, permissionless network. but fabric is a private, permissioned network. parties of a consortium have other business incentives to incentivize hosting nodes. fabric chaincode lets you model really any asset you want, i don't see whats stopping you from modeling the same behavior in a chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>MonnyClara</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:19:10 GMT):<br/>
Hey, little question about chaincode invokation : 
Is it possible for multiple peers to invoke the same chaincode at the same time ? 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:22:15 GMT):<br/>
@MonnyClara the same chaincode as in the same codebase, yes, but not the same instance of chaincode.

each peer installs its own instance of a chaincode, and when that chaincode is invoked, each peer is running its own transaction simulation on its own chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>MonnyClara</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:29:19 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith So for exemple if I got a network with 4 peers, and each of them has the basic chaincode_example02.go installed (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.1/chaincode/chaincode_example02/go). Let's say A=100. 

If I connect to all my 4 peers and I run on each peer at the same time `peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050  -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{"Args":["invoke","a","b","10"]}'`. The result should be A=100-(4x10)=60 or A=90 ? 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:30:53 GMT):<br/>
@MonnyClara yes, assuming the chaincode is deterministic all 4 peers will read the same world state, simulate the transaction the same way, and all 4 will endorse a transaction proposal saying "A should be 90 in the next world state"
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:31:10 GMT):<br/>
oh wait
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:31:22 GMT):<br/>
no i misread your example
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:31:54 GMT):<br/>
you were giving me an either or. the 4 peers would all agree A would be 90. 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:32:33 GMT):<br/>
not 60, because not all four peers are working together to determine an answer. each one is working independently 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:32:33 GMT):<br/>
not 60, because all four peers are *not* working together to determine an answer. each one is working independently 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:34:29 GMT):<br/>
its like asking 4 different people to solve "Person 'a' had 100 apples and gives 10 to person 'b', how many apples should person 'a' have after person 'b' receives the apples"
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 10:35:19 GMT):<br/>
everyone has the same information to start and has to come to some conclusion. that conclusion shouldn't change based on how many people are solving the problem.

I have two questions:
1) I understood that we will have a secure container to execute each chaincode. This mechanism cannot provoke a performance problem when I will have an important number of smart contract?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=bFXtWyoTzBmrbKRdQ) @jrosmith Thanks. I see the point. 
But my question is if it is  the use case we can pursue with the permissioned blockchain for a crypto-currency. 
Another option we were looking at was to have the business logic in FABRIC but delegate the finance part (token part) to an external entity like ETC/ETHER etc. 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 03:43:05 GMT):<br/>
@Amjadnz if thats the direction you want to go you may want to look at [SETH](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2017/08/22/hello-world-meet-seth-sawtooth-ethereum). i know the community in #sawtooth is active and friendly.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=haJWYwNqLEJBZ8jkG) @jrosmith - Regarding this question , if there are 4 different transactions posted to 4 peers sequentially - the answer would be "60" right?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 03:45:43 GMT):<br/>
@Amjadnz as in it gets sent to peer 1, peer 1 process and the transaction gets committed, and then the same command is sent to peer 2, etc?

yes
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 03:46:29 GMT):<br/>
because anyway the same transaction is replayed on all the nodes
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 03:46:41 GMT):<br/>
yes, then by the time peer 4 will finish the answer will be 60. after peer 1 process the transaction and it gets committed, the agreed upon world state is 90, after peer 2 its 80, etc.

Question: Am using NODE SDK and my chaincode gets intantiated (on ORG1/NODE01) with a specific endorsement policy. Now a new ORG (org2) has joined and I have to instantiate the chaincode there too. As per the docs I can modify the channel config by adding a new org2. Now If I specify a "rougue" endorsement policy on the org2 (comprising my own controlled endorsers), the instantiation still would continue right? 

Is there a way where I can enforce that all instantiation should have the same endorsement policy and reject instantiation if the policy is not consistent?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 07:48:34 GMT):<br/>
Or only admin nodes (nodes with ADMIN crypto) can instantiate the chaincodes on other nodes?

Hi, I have a method in the chaincode which should only be allowed to executed by one organization of the network. But the other organizations have to accept that the one organization has executed this method. What is the best pratices for this? Give the organisation as argument to the chaincode and check the name? Or this there a more generic way? Thanks in advance
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 13:02:19 GMT):<br/>
@akoenig  you could just use 

```	// GetCreator returns `SignatureHeader.Creator` (e.g. an identity)
	// of the `SignedProposal`. This is the identity of the agent (or user)
	// submitting the transaction.
	GetCreator() ([]byte, error)```

methond of `ChaincodeStubInterface`, to extract certificate of the user/client and check to which org it belongs 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 13:03:53 GMT):<br/>
@akoenig there is an CID library which you can make use:

</p>
<p><strong>akoenig</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 13:08:28 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin thanks to the answer and the CID i will implement it like this. The only issue i was thinking about if this is the right way to check this IN the chaincode or should we mange this via permissions identity or something else
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 13:15:19 GMT):<br/>
@akoenig I'd guess it depends on what exactly you trying to achieve, based on your initial question it seems like you need this into chaincode.

<p><strong>freddyisaac</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 01:21:46 GMT):<br/>

Getting a hang during chaincode instantiation.  Have CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMEOUT set to 60s. During instantiation, log gets to this:

```

2018-06-01 16:13:15.280 UTC [chaincode] handleMessage -> DEBU 614 [15c0d343d4680220d39e2a6b5ee0920d10ed3ca44627c79ff2b4fd04f138b8d8]HandleMessage- COMPLETED. Notify

```



Then it hangs for the remaining 60 seconds before giving me:

`2018-06-01 16:14:15.279 UTC [endorser] simulateProposal -> ERRO 618 [global][15c0d343] failed to invoke chaincode name:"lscc" , error: timeout expired while executing transaction`

Any thoughts on how the notification that the chaincode has completed is getting dropped or how I can get a little more debug info?  I can confirm that my chaincode Init() is definitely running because I can, for example, pass args to it and see an appropriate error message returned (i.e., 'Init() doesn't take arguments') in the peer logs, but that error also never gets sent back to the command line tool.

Hi, how can I get the chaincode-name in when in the chaincode? I want to implement a general purpose chaincode, on one channel I plan to instantiate multiple chaincodes, using the same chaincode-source-file. there is a function "getChannelID()" but not getChaincodeID()
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 05:53:20 GMT):<br/>
@TobiasN -  you can extract the chaincode name from the proposal sent to the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 05:53:27 GMT):<br/>
however - it will be always a single chaincode, no? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 05:53:43 GMT):<br/>
unless, you plan to install the same code under different names?
</p>
<p><strong>TobiasN</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 06:27:37 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thanks, I have been able to extract the name from the proposal: my code is this:
```
	proposal, err1 := APIstub.GetSignedProposal()
	prop, err2 := utils.GetProposal(proposal.ProposalBytes)
	input, err3 := utils.GetChaincodeInvocationSpec(prop)
	fmt.Println("chaincodeName", input.ChaincodeSpec.ChaincodeId.Name)
```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 09:29:16 GMT):<br/>
yep that should work @TobiasN

Given I'm using the NewAES256EncrypterEntity to encrypt entities which have attributes relating to other entities (aka foreign key constraints). When processing such an encrypted entity and fetching information from the related entity I leak this information in the read-write-set.
Is there a way to do a shim.GetState without it appearing in the RWSet (fully knowing that this might have an impact on consistency)?

I am trying to move the functionality of chaincode Docker in new 1.1 chiancode-dev set (1 orderer, one peer, one cli and one chaincode) to my Mac to build an IDE environment. Chaincode docker talks to port 7052 which does not exist in the docker compose. and not accessible from host. Any idea, how this command works inside the chaincod docker :CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:7052 CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=mycc:0 ./sacc

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 16:38:17 GMT):<br/>
@mvkmvk i dont believe theres a way to coerce `GetState` to not appear in the rwset, but if you're just looking up a key you could use [GetQueryResult](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces_stable.go#L138) to perform a rich query for the same key...the query isnt rerun during validation so i _think_ that means the contents aren't in the readset, but I'm not entirely sure. i'm sure you could run a check and find out
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 16:38:51 GMT):<br/>
@tronglx i'm not sure i understand what youre asking, are you trying to say you want to to make a coin implementation but not write any chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 16:41:05 GMT):<br/>
@gen_el you can access user information using the [cid library](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.1/core/chaincode/lib/cid). as for scheduled functions _inside_ of the chaincode, no, and i wouldn't recommend putting anything in there. if you wanted to create an out of band solution where an external client makes a chaincode request at a certain time interval, sure, totally possible.

is there any way to add a go get for your chaincode image creation somewhere in between? I have a package which can't be vendored due to some bug- https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/issues/237
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 22:50:41 GMT):<br/>
the vendoring is done at chaincode packaging @CodeReaper 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 22:50:51 GMT):<br/>
the chaincode instantiation only compiles
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 22:50:55 GMT):<br/>
it does not do `go get`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 22:51:13 GMT):<br/>
otherwise you'd have problems when the internet connection is crappy or when github is down
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 22:51:29 GMT):<br/>
which is what happens in node.js chaincode I believe

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 22:59:18 GMT):<br/>
i don't think it's a good idea
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 22:59:24 GMT):<br/>
if you want to put something in the chaincode package
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 22:59:30 GMT):<br/>
just put it in the chaincode pakcage
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 22:59:43 GMT):<br/>
and don't hack the chaincode image creation process with network IO 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 22:59:59 GMT):<br/>
the chaincode package has the chaincode in the form of a tar.gz or something like that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 23:00:08 GMT):<br/>
(if my memory doesn't betray me)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 23:00:20 GMT):<br/>
you can just programmatically add your files
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 23:00:29 GMT):<br/>
and then you take this modified chaincode file
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 23:00:40 GMT):<br/>
and then you instantiate the peer
</p>

you need to modify `code_package`  and it is created using `GetDeploymentPayload` - and according to the code it looks like it's a tar.gz like i said, @CodeReaper

`ERRO 692 [[e9585782 PUT_STATE ERROR]]No ledger context for %!!(MISSING)s(MISSING). Sending %!!(MISSING)s(MISSING)
ERRO 6a2 [bloqchannel][e9585782] failed to invoke chaincode name:"lscc" , error: timeout expired while executing transaction`

I am using Hyperledger Fabric 1.1 and Hyperledger fabric node SDK. The nodeJS version is 8.11.2. The chaincode is in golang.

Any help is appreciated.

Hi there, together with our team we are having a discussion regarding the pros/cons of writing chaincode using NodeJS or Go lang, what are your thoughts/experiences about that?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 15 Jun 2018 13:52:47 GMT):<br/>
@szytko its largely a question of your synergy in your env with regards to language and development skills. The other consideration would be what APIs are needed. They are sure to be in golang shim but new features may lag behind in some aspects (testing, usage, etc)...this would be something you'll have to check
</p>
<p><strong>szytko</strong> (Fri, 15 Jun 2018 13:56:10 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr thanks for the answer. But are there any differences between node and go, taking into account performance/speed ? 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 15 Jun 2018 14:01:38 GMT):<br/>
I don't know but given that the protocol to communication with the fabric is same and the processing on the fabric side is common, I'd say that there shouldn't be a significant difference (if any) between the two. ..but I don't know for sure
</p>
<p><strong>szytko</strong> (Fri, 15 Jun 2018 14:06:28 GMT):<br/>
okay I see, I'm wondering if we for example invoke 1000 or 10000 chaincode functions at the same time, how does it affect the load of the server

Hi there, I'm looking into the "peer chaincode package" and I couldn't understand it. I thought packaging is like I packaged it from one machine and then I could install the package to another machine with copying the source code. Can someone explain it to me a little bit about what it use for?

Hey I'm having trouble instantiating chaincode via the java sdk.
I keep getting the following error:
instantiation policy violation: signature set did not satisfy policy

The requesting user is the CA-Admin and should most definitely have permissions to do so.
We tried it with the default chaincode endorsement policies and changed them to even accept any member. Really tried a lot of different things and none of them seemed to work.
Help would be appreciated
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 16 Jun 2018 11:32:00 GMT):<br/>
@sh777 `I thought packaging is like I packaged it from one machine and then I could install the package to another machine without copying the source code.` that is correct. once you create a chaincode with `peer chaincode package -n <name> -p <path> -v <version> <packagefilename>`, you can simply install it on any machine with `peer chaincode install <packagefilename>`
</p>

@tinytiny123 can you check in #fabric-sdk-java please ?

@mdvenkatesh a few things:

i would discourage using `time.Now()` as the request will come to different peers at different times due to network latency. none of the peers will agree on what the value to write is and the transaction won't be committed. use [the client's transaction timestamp](https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#ChaincodeStub.GetTxTimestamp) instead so that all peers agree on the time at which the transaction occurs.

as a follow up, you're saying that `stub.PutState(key, []byte(value))` is not succeeding or is inputting the wrong key?

Form node sdk chaincode try to use some external api for validation purpose. 
Issue -1
Step 1- Using "http" to call the external api from smart contract.
Step-2 - From http request , getting proper response from the given url.
Step-3 - Using "callback" return all the value to invoked function.
Step-4- try to use stub.putState(result)
Step- 5- Below error

[[843804c0 PUT_STATE ERROR]]No ledger context for %!s(MISSING). Sending %!s(MISSING).
How to resolve the issue?

Issue -2
Even I try to return the value from chaincode to middle layer then also not returning any value. In middle layer we are getting null value though all value display in console .

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:08:00 GMT):<br/>
@naveedh27 if you're reference a sql style join then no, as fabric uses NoSQL dbs for storing world state. you can use a [rich queries](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/api/database/find.html#selector-syntax)
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:09:03 GMT):<br/>
@szytko fabric does not limit which go packages you can and can't use. just keep in mind that for valid endorsement results, multiple peers will need to agree on final world state.

Hey guys - when you call a `getState` in my chaincode - is this logged anywhere and how can I retrieve it? 
In composer you have the Transactions overview and when you execute a getter, it's also logged there 🙂

Hi guys ! 
I encounter some problem when using my chaincode on a real environment, I got the following error : 
```

Hi , is it possible to update collection configuration file for work with private tx ,
I found that collection file is setting when we instantiate chaincode ,
and there is an option in collections-config in upgrade chaincode command, but is it possible to change  'authorized' peer for concrete transaction on flight ?
or I still have to setup separate channel for this?
e.g. in the same channel i want to have private tx between A and B and B and C , and not private between A , B , C

</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=BzAD8Wd5m9qoWq3qA) @vladyslavmunin You can define two collections, one available for org A and B, while second one available for B and C... Normal (w/o collection name) writes will be available for A, B and C as usual. 
</p>
<p><strong>vladyslavmunin</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 11:30:33 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin  so , potentially if I have N members in channel and I want to anticipate potential private 'collections ' between all parties , I can  create    n*(n-1)/2 collections ( collection to each  between two nodes). I 'm right?

I have been using hyperledger fabric to develop my chaincode and have successfully instantiated on a channel with multiple organizations.
The endorsement policies have been set to be signed by all the organization using the consensus protocol, but I am not able to understand how would I accept the transaction when I call the invoke function
Do I have to pass some parameters in the arguments for the same? 
Please help me understand how to enable signing in the case of all the organizations agreeing to the transaction

Hi everyone,  my application will have some functionality to "sign" an existing object, imagine a legal contract. I was wondering if it would be possible to use the internal state versioning (like in read-sets) to find out which version of an object someone was referring to instead of passing the whole object. Is there a way to do it? Is this even a good design?
</p>
<p><strong>NilsPe</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 17:33:22 GMT):<br/>
Maybe to add one thing: this is done via middleware, so a user can not interact with the system directly.

Hello,

I have installed fabric 1.1 network and was exploring new chaincode feature of fabric 1.1 which makes use of client identity chaincode library  using node js sdk. 
Following are the observations.
1. Chaincode  install is successful, however chaincode instantiation fails with following error:

cannot find package "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid" in any of:
        /opt/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid (from $GOROOT)
        /chaincode/input/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid (from $GOPATH)
        /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid

The package "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid" doesn't seem to be inbuilt in fabric 1.1 images

2. I used govendor tool to make this package available locally in vendor folder. Chaincode install was successful, but chaincode instantiation again failed, but this time with following error:

error: [client-utils.js]: sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: 2 UNKNOWN: error starting container: Failed to generate platform-specific docker build: Error returned from build: 2 "# github.com/example_cc/go/vendor/golang.org/x/crypto/sha3

Any clue on how to resolve this error ?

Hi @medhak19 ,
I am running 1.1 on docker with cid. Do you include also the dependencies of cid in the vendor folder? I have 4 dependencies defined in my vendor json:

"github.com/golang/protobuf/proto"
"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/attrmgr"
"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid"
"github.com/pkg/errors"

Could you please let me know the go version and govendor version you are using? I was facing some issue with govendoring with my go version 1.10.3, hence I installed go 1.9.1 and was able to do govendoring successfully.(Not sure whether versions will matter here ) 
My go version:
go version go1.9.1 linux/amd64

My govendor version: v1.0.9

@asadhayat , @NilsPe , thank you for your help. I was able to get cid working with 1.1.  I followed the steps for govendoring again and everything worked fine, probably I was doing something wrong in the govendoring process earlier.

I downloaded few sample networks and created an archive and deployed it on playground. I got complete folder structure in my VScode editor but I am confused of how to start with my own sample application which can have a moderator and 2 participants. Any help will be appreciated.

<p><strong>medhak19</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 15:15:36 GMT):<br/>
Hello all,

I am exploring attribute based access control in chaincode using new cid package introduced in fabric 1.1

I successfully registered a user Roger with some attributes using fabric-ca-client command and can see all the attributes when I run "fabric-ca-client user list --id Roger as shown below:


root@pt-corcto15834:~# fabric-ca-client identity list --id Roger --caname  ca-usorg  --tls.client.certfile /root/fabric-ca/client/msp/signcerts/cert.pem --tls.certfiles  /root/cls/network/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/usorg.bank.com/ca/ca.usorg.bank.com-cert.pem --url 'https://ca.usorg.bank.com:7054'
Name: Roger, Type: user, Affiliation: org1.department1, Max Enrollments: -1, Attributes: [{Name:hf.EnrollmentID Value:Roger ECert:true} {Name:hf.Type Value:user ECert:true} {Name:hf.Affiliation Value:org1.department1 ECert:true} {Name:app1Admin Value:true ECert:true} {Name:email Value:rogerf@gmail.com ECert:false} {Name:attr1 Value:val1 ECert:false}]


However I am not able to fetch the attributes attr1 and email from chaincode 
The code snippet:
<<code snippet starts>>
val, ok, err := cid.GetAttributeValue(stub, "email")
	
	if err != nil {
		logger.Errorf("error fetching attribute value: %s", err)
	
	}
	if !ok {
		// The client identity does not possess the attribute
		logger.Errorf("ci doesn't posses attribute")
	
	}
	
	logger.Info("****************Attribute value: ", val)

<<code snippet ends>>
	
When this chaincode is called, the logger always prints "ci doesn't posses attribute". Which means though err is null, ok is false.

The following code snippet works as expected, i.e logger prints "enroll ID" as Roger. This proves that cid is getting executed for correct user i.e. Roger.
<<code snippet2 starts>>
cert, err := cid.GetX509Certificate(stub)
enrollID := cert.Subject.CommonName
	
logger.Info("$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$enroll ID: " , enrollID)
<<code snippet2 ends>>

Any pointers ?  Am I missing anything here.

I also have couple of questions:
1. id, err := cid.GetID(stub)
Here I am getting following value for id:
eDUwOTo6Q049Um9nZXIsT1U9dXNlcitPVT1vcmcxK09VPWRlcGFydG1lbnQxOjpDTj1jYS51c29yZy5iYW5rLmNvbSxPPXVzb3JnLmJhbmsuY29tLEw9U2FuIEZyYW5jaXNjbyxTVD1DYWxpZm9ybmlhLEM9VVM=

What does this value signify? 

2. Is it possible to register a user with attributes using node sdk ?  I never got it working.  + All examples/articles of cid (client identity chaincode library) provide only 1 way to register user with attributes and that is using  command:  "fabric-ca-client".  Does that mean node SDK does not yet support this?

@dharuq  - Chaincode to chaincode calls across channels are possible with the following limitations:

1) Each peer you invoke must be a member of both channels
2) Each peer must have the chaincode installed
3) You can only make read-only (query) calls across channels

@Legiit few things you could do (1) do `go build` to make sure chaincode builds (2) run in dev mode to for faster turnaround (3) change the default  values of `startuptimeout` and `executetimeout` under chaincode in core.yaml ... (strongly suggest 1 and 2 regardless)

Hi All! I've a question 
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 09:05:26 GMT):<br/>
Are there some API to interact with the blockchain missing in the Node version of Shim, respect to the Go version?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 09:42:16 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox do you think there is something missing in particular ?

No but I'd like to share experiences with the two differente techonologies

@ascatox The capabilities in both Go and Node.js Chaincode should be the same.

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 11:35:36 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox The capabilities in both Go and Node.js Chaincode should be the same from a fabric point of view (obviously each language lends itself to it's own unique capabilities)

Hi,guys! I have seen some chaincode examples,and when some of them define one assest,they use `ObjectType string        `json:"docType"` //field for couchdb`, I don't know meaning of the filed and how to  use it.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=TaH4BEjYaNqtNvkq8) Thanks a ton - what's the equivalent of `go build` for node chaincode? 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:41:19 GMT):<br/>
@Legiit use eslint. Drive it either through your editor, or as part of your unit test launcher that you should have for your code. 
</p>
<p><strong>Legiit</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:43:29 GMT):<br/>
Hmm Thanks :P Can we also use babel to use ES6 in chaincode? 
</p>
<p><strong>Legiit</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:43:29 GMT):<br/>
Hmm Thanks, I'll spin up a config and give it a try :P Can we also use babel to use ES6 in chaincode? 
</p>
<p><strong>Legiit</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:43:38 GMT):<br/>
the ES5 syntax is terrible lawl @davidkel 
</p>
<p><strong>Legiit</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:50:26 GMT):<br/>
And a last and final question - can we also pass other types of arguments besides and array? I've tried arraybuffers/json string but it doesn't seem to work
The process of parsing objects to arrays in your backend and parsing it back to an object in the chaincode is quite cumbersome and not very maintainable when you'd like to extend your data model/object
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:51:47 GMT):<br/>
@Legiit fabric currently uses node 8.9.4 so you can use ES6 + async/await
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:51:47 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Legiit</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 08:02:38 GMT):<br/>
I mean ES6 imports/exports, arrow functions etc :D 
& Any advice regarding the arguments? @davidkel 
Very much appreciated :) 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 08:05:20 GMT):<br/>
@Legiit Whatever is supported by node 8.9.4 you can use. I don't believe you can do much else than invoke chaincode from client side with an array of strings for the arguments

Sorry for posting again the question; but I really need to know if someone was able to use successfully the function `registerChaincodeEvent()`. Is better to user a  *ChannelEventHub* or just an *EventHub*? Here is a link for more details on my problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51363178/hyperledger-fabric-registerchaincodeevent-method-not-getting-the-event-from-ch.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 11:35:31 GMT):<br/>
@riccardopersiani I would highly recommend moving away from EventHub and going to ChannelEventHub. Hyperledger composer deals with chaincode events. The client side code is here
https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/blob/ee98244425d687026d25608a609451ad056d6093/packages/composer-connector-hlfv1/lib/hlfconnection.js#L272
The actual event emission is done by the composer runtime here
https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/blob/ee98244425d687026d25608a609451ad056d6093/packages/composer-runtime-hlfv1/lib/nodeeventservice.js#L50
which is an example of node chaincode doing event emission, but should be easy to see the equivalent in golang

hey guys, I am having a question when I try to use NodeJS chaincode. How to iterate the result returned in class StateQueryIterator?
</p>
<p><strong>mavericklam</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 08:47:28 GMT):<br/>
I can see any introduction in the documentation
</p>
<p><strong>mavericklam</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 08:47:30 GMT):<br/>
cant
</p>
<p><strong>mavericklam</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 08:47:51 GMT):<br/>
https://fabric-shim.github.io/StateQueryIterator.html
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 08:54:33 GMT):<br/>
@mavericklam cut down example from the tests
```
async function getAllResults(iterator, getKeys) {
	let allResults = [];
	while (true) {
		let res = await iterator.next();
		let theVal = (getKeys) ? res.value.key : res.value.value.toString('utf8');
		allResults.push(theVal);
		if (res.done) {
			await iterator.close();
			return allResults;
		}
	}
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>mavericklam</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 08:59:10 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel  thanks!!!! may I know if iterator.next() is async?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 08:59:38 GMT):<br/>
@mavericklam yes because you have to await on it
</p>
<p><strong>mavericklam</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 09:02:24 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel  is there any indicator like hasNext() to stop the loop?
</p>
<p><strong>mavericklam</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 09:02:55 GMT):<br/>
or res.done can do the same trick?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 09:10:45 GMT):<br/>
@mavericklam No it doesn't have a hasNext call
</p>
<p><strong>mavericklam</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 09:25:01 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel I got an error of "TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined". is there anything wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>mavericklam</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 09:25:04 GMT):<br/>
this is my code
</p>
<p><strong>mavericklam</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 09:25:13 GMT):<br/>
    try{
      resultsIterator = await stub.getStateByPartialCompositeKey("time~transcId", [time])
    }
    catch(err){
      throw new Error(err)
    }

    while (true) {
      result = await resultsIterator.next();
      console.log(result.value.value)
      let theVal = result.value.value.toString('utf8');
      resultsArray.push(theVal);
      if (result.done) {
        await resultsIterator.close();
      }

@mavericklam the above example from the tests assumes there will always be 1 result. You may need to handle the situation where there are no results. plus in your example you will loop forever, nothing breaks out of the loop

Hi, is there a way to get all functions of a chaincode?  E.g. in my ChainCode "foo" is a method "bar" with the inputs "xyz" and "zyx". Is there a way to get those infos? I need this to give the user some information about the existing methods of the chaincode which he maybe wants to use.
</p>

Hello, i was able to check a custom event using `registerChaincodeEvent()`, but the problem is that the event returned does not have a payload(undefined). Anyone know how to get it? In the official documentation is written the following:  "to see the event payload, the channel_event_hub must be connected(true)", but actually my channel event hub is connected to true with the `eh.connect()` after the `event_monitor`. 

</p>

Hello All, I am having some weird issues, sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't. I use a script to docker compose down, then clean and up again to restart my network. I use CLI tool to create/join peers to channel then chaincode container to install/instantiate a peer at the end of the restart. Sometimes my chaincode gets to init and somehow the connection to peer/orderer is disconnected and the chaincode container ends up in "Exited" status. Does someone know what may be causing this? I am not using chaincode dev mode:

I added a history query to my chaincode.  Unit tests pass locally.  Attempting to instantiate the code, I see:

```
chaincode/input/src/wagoncc/cc.go:993:38: cannot use entry (type *"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult".KeyModification) as type *"wagoncc/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult".KeyModification in argument to marshalHistoryEntry
```

Problem is, there's nothing vendored in my code:

```
$ find $GOPATH -name *vendor*
/* this space blank */
$
```

Nor do there appear to be any hidden cache directories:

```
$ find $GOPATH -name '.*'
/* this space blank */
$
```

My current assumption is that some previously-vendored version of this code is hanging around in a cache somewhere in the network itself, but I've totally torn down the network (while keeping the servers in place--they are very much pets and not cattle at this point), done my best to obliterate all state, ensured that `docker containers ls -a`, `docker image ls -a`, and `docker volume ls` all return nothing (including on my local machine where I run the CLI image), then brought everything up _de novo_, but I still see the issue.  I've run out of ideas.  Any thoughts on sneaky places I can check or better ways to debug this issue?
</p>
<p><strong>hamptonsmith</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 14:47:28 GMT):<br/>
Note that I _have_ "in-line vendored" the library in question:

```
$ find $GOPATH -path */queryresult
/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult
```

But without this, I see errors during chaincode installation:

```
$ peer chaincode install ...snip...
can't load package: package github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult: cannot find package "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult" in any of:
	/opt/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult (from $GOROOT)
	/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult (from $GOPATH)

Hi All, Is der a way to install chaincodes in all the peers together in a multi-host VM environment running on docker swarm environment ?
</p>
<p><strong>Varun2887</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 05:33:50 GMT):<br/>
@rajanashutosh is there any tutorial to host peers on multiple host, i am struggling to host it...
</p>
<p><strong>rajanashutosh</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 05:54:09 GMT):<br/>
@Varun2887 Its simple, first go to docker tutorials and set up multiclustered environment. Then once joined the cluster then use docker stack deploy --compose-file <compose.yml> networkname (Should be configured in your compose.yml as well)

In fabric is there a way to see all failed transactions?
Also how to resubmit a failed transaction?  Is there any sample codes showing how to send transaction, catch failed transaction then resubmit?

Hi, I have a quick question, in chaincode instantiation, we need to pass a POLICY and with private collection, we can also pass a policy at collection level in JSON. Does the policy in collection JSON overrides a Policy passed to the command ? OR is there any way to make policy at command level optional ?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=fMf8bJpHNxBzMg7yt) @dave.enyeart Thanks Dave, Got it. I have few more questions for clarification. Sorry some might be dump questions but just want to be clear -
1.	At a chaincode level, we can only have one endorsement policy. Currently, I have to instantiate a different chaincodes for different endorsement policies and respective distribution policies which results in different namespaces and have to query explicitly from different chaincodes to collect all the data. Is it possible to have an ability to define a unique endorsement policy for a given distribution policy or policies? Is this something we’re planning to address in ownable state enhancement? 
2.	Can an organization X have a same collection name (distribution policy name) in two different distribution policies (collections) for two different organizations so org X can query private shared data with 2 diff organization from the same collection?
3.	Can we have an organization in the endorsement policy that’s not in any of distribution policy in collection JSON? 
4.	Are we looking to add a querying capability to query across collections for a given chaincode ? I thought we were planning to have it in current v1.2 version.
5.	Are we looking to add a querying capability to query across collections and across chaincodes for a given channel?


</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 11:58:43 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi The policies are different... the endorsement policy on the chaincode instantiation defines who must endorse each transaction. The distribution policy in the collection JSON defines who the private data gets distributed to. For example the endorsement policy may be any three orgs, while the distribution policy for a particular collection may be four specific orgs. A different collection within the same chaincode may be different set of four orgs.

@VinayChaudharyOfficial please check in #fabric-orderer ... but I think you might be using mismatched configtx.yaml / fabric release (e.g., configtx.yaml from 1.1 with fabric 1.2)
</p>

@akoenig there is no "function" discovery ... you could simpy add one for your chaincode as a special query api perhaps ?

Hi all, do you know how to set CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT or CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=info? The peer tries to get the fabric--ccenv container up and the container gets deleted immediately. I want to increase the log level to see more messages
</p>
<p><strong>GowriR</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 08:01:35 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, I am trying to write my own chaincode from a sample code (I copied the entire folder - including the vendor folder). I am new to go. When i run chaincode instantiate from nodejs code - I can see the fabric-ccenv containers getting created and getting deleted almost immediately. Any help in this regard would be great
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 10:51:38 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi No, we can't allow it since non-members by design don't have the private data and therefore can't validate query result sets against private data.

Hey everyone, I've been facing an error while using the `InstantiateCC` method provided by the `fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/resmgmt` package (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/55ab46a8c2a69288dda370dd335a85a300d15aa5/pkg/client/resmgmt/resmgmt.go#L121:6) and am hoping to get some help. I have two orgs (Org0, Org1), each with two peers (peer0, peer1) who have joined a common channel and I've installed the same cc onto all 4 peers. The description for `InstantiateCC` states that instantiation will happen for *all* peers in the channel. In reality, instantiation only happens for the peers belonging to the org whose context is calling `InstantiateCC`. The dev containers for those 2 peers are launched fine and I'm able to invoke methods through any peer on that one org. I then try to instantiate through the client context for the other org, but the peers believe the chaincode has already been launched on the channel (which is has, but not for the peers of this org), so an error is thrown (`Chaincode status Code: (500) UNKNOWN. Description: chaincode with name 'exchangeCC' already exists`). Has anyone successfully made a similar scenario happen or have any ideas how to solve this?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 18:47:53 GMT):<br/>
@sarah you're misinterpreting the situation
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 18:48:09 GMT):<br/>
you only need to instantiate *once* a chaincode for a given channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 18:48:32 GMT):<br/>
what an instantiate does, is simply create a binding between the chaincode that is installed, to the channel 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 18:49:24 GMT):<br/>
> chaincode with name 'exchangeCC' already exists
tells you that you already instantiated the chaincode on the channel
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 18:54:58 GMT):<br/>
yes, I agree that I should only have to instantiate *once* per chaincode on a given channel. But, although all 4 peers have joined the channel, only 2 of them (those belonging to the org whose client context is calling `InstantiateCC`) actually have the `fabric-ccenv` launched and then `dev-peer...chaincodename:version` created. So the other two peers don't have a container with instantiated chaincode. 
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 18:56:19 GMT):<br/>
so when I try to invoke any methods through peers of the org who I didn't use to call `InstantiateCC`, it fails to find any peers because that peer doesn't have chaincode instantiated for it
</p>

<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 18:57:58 GMT):<br/>
i.e. I have a client context for org0, I use that client context to call InstantiateCC, and containers launch for dev-peer0.org... and dev-0peer1.org0... but nothing launches for org1. The logs for those peers say that chaincode has already been launched.

how do you know that's the reason?

chaincode launches upon demand....

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:02:01 GMT):<br/>
on a peer that is invoked
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:02:12 GMT):<br/>
not on all the network because you instantiated
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:02:16 GMT):<br/>
I'm assuming that's the reason, since there is no container with that chaincode launched for those peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:02:30 GMT):<br/>
that's not the reason....
</p>

what is the reason?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:02:52 GMT):<br/>
let's start from you showing the logs on these peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:03:08 GMT):<br/>
of those that you can't invoke on

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:04:18 GMT):<br/>
that's not a log
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:04:50 GMT):<br/>
which logs do you want? that is from `docker logs`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:05:33 GMT):<br/>
i want the relevant lines from the log of the peer
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:36:05 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure which you consider relevant other than the line I previously sent

</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:36:17 GMT):<br/>
that is everything

>  so when I try to invoke any methods through peers of the org who I didn't use to call `InstantiateCC`, it fails to find any peers because those peers don't have chaincode instantiated for them. 
can you elaborate on this please? @sarah  ? 
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:50:11 GMT):<br/>
my thought process is that because there is no container named `dev-peer0.org1-chaincodename:version` or `dev-peer1.org1-chaincodename:version`, the chaincode is not instantiated on peers of org1. Those containers do exist for peers of org0. When I use a fabric client set up wrt the context of an admin user of org0, I can invoke methods belonging to that chaincode. I cannot invoke methods belonging to that chaincode from peers belonging to org1.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:51:15 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean "from peers" ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:51:24 GMT):<br/>
what is the error you get when you try?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:52:35 GMT):<br/>
> my thought process is that because there is no container named `dev-peer0.org1-chaincodename:version` or `dev-peer1.org1-chaincodename:version`, the chaincode is not instantiated on peers of org1
that's not how it works... when you instantiate, it just simulates the `Init()` function of the chaincode on the peer. You can have 100 peers in a single org, instantiate on one of them, and you'll only see a single container
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:52:54 GMT):<br/>
the reason is - a peer spawns the chaincode container only when it needs to
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:55:34 GMT):<br/>
by "from peers" I mean that I set up a context creator and channel client for the exchange-channel, using the admin user of each org. So when using the channel client in the context of that org, wouldn't requests go through an available peer belonging to that org? i.e. when I use `channelClient.Execute(channel.Request)`
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:55:55 GMT):<br/>
oh I see I didn't know that the containers spawned only when needed
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:56:58 GMT):<br/>
when I call `InstantiateCC` why are two containers built? if there's currently no need for both
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:57:36 GMT):<br/>
I have no idea why, to be honest... I would ask in the #fabric-sdk-go channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:57:55 GMT):<br/>
But there shouldn't be 2 containers for sure
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:58:20 GMT):<br/>
>  So when using the channel client in the context of that org, wouldn't requests go through an available peer belonging to that org?
I don't think it should
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:58:27 GMT):<br/>
let's try something
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:58:38 GMT):<br/>
what is the fabric version of the peers?
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:01:12 GMT):<br/>
I asked in #fabric-sdk-go as well! When I call instantiate, I list the target peers instead of not including any options, would that have any impact on the # of containers launched?  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:01:53 GMT):<br/>
oh... could be
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:01:59 GMT):<br/>
but let's try something to be certain
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:02:03 GMT):<br/>
what's the fabric version?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:02:05 GMT):<br/>
of the peers
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:02:42 GMT):<br/>
the fabric version on the peers is 1.2.0
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:02:49 GMT):<br/>
very good
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:03:13 GMT):<br/>
please read this tutorial and list the peers of the channel https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discovery-cli.html
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:03:22 GMT):<br/>
(after you instantiated them, like the status now)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:03:38 GMT):<br/>
you can get the binary from https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/hyperledger-fabric/
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:04:38 GMT):<br/>
so you need to do something similar to `discover --configFile conf.yaml peers --channel mychannel  --server peer0.org1.example.com:7051`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:05:13 GMT):<br/>
and this would tell you whether the peers all "have" the instantiate transaction in them
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:05:34 GMT):<br/>
great I will do that now!
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:26:27 GMT):<br/>
within bash of a peer, I can't seem to use the `discover` CLI. I'm getting `discover: command not found`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:29:00 GMT):<br/>
that's why i said you need to get it from that link
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:29:05 GMT):<br/>
and copy that into the container via `docker cp`
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:29:29 GMT):<br/>
ohhh gotcha. I just clicked on the tutorial link and tried to start from there. I'll do that now, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:30:15 GMT):<br/>
you can also just compile it from source
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:30:18 GMT):<br/>
`make discover`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:30:23 GMT):<br/>
in the fabric repo https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:05:55 GMT):<br/>
... maybe i shouldn't have said to compile from source.... i don't want to be held responsible or accountable for any psychological damage 
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:39:41 GMT):<br/>
ok at last the discover command has worked
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:40:31 GMT):<br/>
it is showing ledger height 2 for both Org0MSP and Org1MSP, and lists exchangeCC under each
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:40:31 GMT):<br/>
so `discover` run on a peer of org0 lists exchangeCC on both peers of the network
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:41:01 GMT):<br/>
some psychological damage
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:44:00 GMT):<br/>
going to check org1 now
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:49:27 GMT):<br/>
each peer in org1 also has exchangeCC listed under "Chaincodes"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:35:31 GMT):<br/>
@sarah that means that the instantiate worked
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:35:41 GMT):<br/>
and all peers see the chaincode in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:36:11 GMT):<br/>
:frowning2: hmm
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:36:11 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:36:25 GMT):<br/>
>  some psychological damage 
I am sorry... with time you get used to the pain and you start to think it's not real pain
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:36:34 GMT):<br/>
so I think you use the go SDK in the wrong way
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:36:39 GMT):<br/>
you don't need to specify peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:36:43 GMT):<br/>
let us try something more
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:37:07 GMT):<br/>
`discover endorsers --channel mychannel --chaincode exchangeCC --target peer0.blabla:port`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:37:07 GMT):<br/>
`discover endorsers --channel mychannel --chaincode exchangeCC --server peer0.blabla:port`
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:37:16 GMT):<br/>
I don't specify peers, just the admin/org when I set up the client context, which I think I need to do
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:38:22 GMT):<br/>
ya I also think it is a problem with the endorsers! I set the policy as SignedByAnyPeer but that didn't do anything besides produce the output `NO_PEERS_FOUND. Description: targets were not provided` when I attempt to execute a cc request. I will try `discoverer endorsers` now!
</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 22:38:22 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 23:14:12 GMT):<br/>
that returned `[server returned: failed constructing descriptor for chaincodes:<name:"exchangeCC" > ]`

Hi everyone, 

I hope I'm in the right channel here. If not, please let me know. 

I've started developing a new Shim for .NET which I have proposed on Jira here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11460

I'd love to get some feedback, if this is something which I could contribute to HLF.

Thanks in advance for your time and feel free to drop me all your questions. :)

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:14:20 GMT):<br/>
basically the flow goes like this
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:14:32 GMT):<br/>
1) You get a working PoC that works with the peer

3) If the community sees it's a useful and good idea, then I guess the linux foundation might create a project for you under https://github.com/hyperledger/

@yacovm Thanks for your answer. I've a working PoC (linked in Jira), its running on linux, macOS and Windows (thanks to .NET Core) and I did the mail to the mailing list. :-) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:20:30 GMT):<br/>
you can take a look at the java shim
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:20:32 GMT):<br/>

Jep, and your flow seems to be right, the same was told by @cbf as well as written down in the docs: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/CONTRIBUTING.html#making-feature-enhancement-proposals

if you want to propose to schedule one (it's recorded) you can do it to promote your idea
</p>
<p><strong>ManuelRauber</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:26:14 GMT):<br/>
You mean to record a video about the idea itself and show the working PoC? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:26:33 GMT):<br/>
it's usually a presentation where you go over the details
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:26:41 GMT):<br/>
but some add to the mix a live demo

@ManuelRauber this is great, i've been saying for ages that .NET would be a great win for Fabric - once you have JavaScript, Java, .NET you cover such a huge developer base! @mbwhite is doing some work on chaincode in FAB-11246, he's gonna reach out to you to discuss how the same could be applied to .NET in future.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:35:42 GMT):<br/>
wait, javascript is a language? :O 
</p>
<p><strong>ManuelRauber</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:37:26 GMT):<br/>
@sstone1 Thanks! Sounds good :)

It would also be interesting to convert the JavaScript Chaincode to TypeScript, then you get the definitions (just saw that in FAB-11246) as well as JavaScript for Node.js also (and if someone wants, he/she could use Node.js with TS as well). 

So I'm waiting patiently for @mbwhite :)
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:38:38 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, the Typescript stuff is on the way as well
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:38:47 GMT):<br/>
Have you considered doing a Fabric SDK for .NET btw?
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:38:55 GMT):<br/>
For building .NET client applications that submit transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>ManuelRauber</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:39:51 GMT):<br/>
I've taken a look into the Node.js SDK to get an overview how much code that is. 
If .NET is relevant for HLF, I would be willing to start the SDK as well, so .NET is fully covered.
For now, I just have started with the Shim to get some feedback from HLF

<p><strong>ManuelRauber</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:42:50 GMT):<br/>
Hope so. Let's see when and what feedback will be posted into Jira. :)
</p>
<p><strong>ManuelRauber</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 10:44:09 GMT):<br/>
Not sure, if I should update the jira ticket with that information as well?
</p>

<p><strong>GowriR</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 12:47:58 GMT):<br/>
Hi all my fabric-ccenv container gets deleted as soon as it is started by the peer. The Go chaincode is mostly a rip off from the sample chaincode, with relevant changes. Is there anyway i can debug the problem.

@yacovm the peer logs pointed me in the direction of an incorrect endorsement policy...turns out I accidentally had Org0, Org1 instead of Org0MSP and Org1MSP

<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 15:22:54 GMT):<br/>
FYI, as part of the work on the updates to the chaincode api for node mentioned earlier today.  Part of this is a updated example/sample.  This is to be considered a work-in-progress - but it is on github at https://github.com/mbwhite/chaincode-commericalpaper

The plan is to add Go and other languages in the same sample and intergate with the rest of the samples. Github is a 'staging' place at present.

Hopefully a real example will help provide clarity on the direction being taken.

Hello. I am a new to hyperledger fabric. I understand How hyperledger works. The chain code still confuse me.  Also, the syntax of the chaincode.  For example , I read code like this in the init method: func (t *SampleChaincode) Init(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) peer.Response . Any explain to this line 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 05 Aug 2018 15:02:25 GMT):<br/>
@mohamedbaza The chaincode interface supports two basic calls - Init and Invoke. Init is called exactly once when the chaincode is "instantiated" on the ledger and Invoke is called for every proposal sent to it. The "stub" refers to an interface supplied to those calls which the chaincode developer can use to interact with the system. For example various "Put" and "Get" methods on the stub interface allow one to write / read states from ledger. Response the return value that encapsultes status (success/error) and payload 
</p>
<p><strong>mohamedbaza</strong> (Sun, 05 Aug 2018 16:08:34 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr thanks for your nice explaination. what is peer.response in the "invoke declaration"  refer to?? Also (t *SampleChaincode) ? 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 05 Aug 2018 16:16:51 GMT):<br/>
It is the return data from the call to Invoke (contains status and payload of the response)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 05 Aug 2018 16:16:51 GMT):<br/>
It is the return data from the call to Invoke (contains status and payload of the response)... note we are basically discussing GOLANG syntax at this point `(t *SampleChaincode)` is better understood from GO syntax angle ... nothing inherently  chaincode-specific about it

Hi guys. I'm getting a MVCC_READ_CONFLICT in one of my contracts.

I'm testing fabric performance using caliper with a rate of 3 Tx/s. Is there a way I can avoid getting this error other than using the delta solution proposed here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release/high-throughput

So far there is hardly any difference between using a PutState() with a regular key and a composite key. I get MVCC_READ_CONFLICT's on both.

hi, suppose a key, just as the car in fabcar,  has two attributes, say attr1 and attr2. My question is: can the two attributes be writen by two client applications respectively? and after the second attibute is writen and the ledger is updated,  the event can be received by a third client application? Thank you.

@GowriR  `go version` output looks like a chaincode output (this would happen if your chaincode is a folder called "go/mychaincode.go" and did a `go build` there)... so the above output just confuses the issue. I assume your intention with `go version` is to show some information about the `go` env and not to run the chaincode. Secondly (and this includes @mogarg issue as well..) not sure why you think its a vendoring issue. I'll look at the peer logs during instantiate ..if the chaincode built successfully, then its NOT a vendoring issue. The other possibility is the chaincode crashed for some reason. you should be able to look at logs - both peer and chaincode -  and other tell tale signs (exited container for example) to determine root cause

I'm having a strange and seemingly out of the blue issue that persists even as I revert to commits that were stable. When instantiating CC on a channel, I'm providing the endorsement policy as usual, but am getting this error in the peer logs: `NO_MATCHING_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY_ENTITY. Description: premature execution - chaincode (exchangeCC:0) launched and waiting for registration`. I've tried to view the endorsers for the channel using the `discovery CLI`, but it's returning only: unknown service discovery.Discovery. I used `discover` to create the `conf.yaml` successfully. Anyone encountered a similar issue?

@muralisr Now am facing a new problem. I have chaincode version 0 installed and instantiated perfectly. Now i want to make a few lines on change in the chaincode and test it again. Hence i install v1 and try to instantiate v1. This fails. Once i remove/stop docker containers and the installed chaincodes from the peer it works. Then i install v0 again and start testing. Is there a better way to do it?

I run "peer chaincode package -n mycc ....  " without -i option.  According to release 1.2 doc,  any org admin of the channel can run "peer chaincode instantiate -n sacc -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":["john","0"]}' -P "AND ('Org1.member','Org2.member' ....". However, the fact is that only the admin who package the chaincode can instanticate the chaincode.

I have list of Docker images running on Fabric
hyperledger/fabric-ca, hyperledger/fabric-orderer, hyperledger/fabric-peer, hyperledger/fabric-ccenv , hyperledger/fabric-couchdb 
I have written Chaincode in go to read and update the ledger and compiled successfully
Next - What do I need to do and not able to do and Where I am confused?
Register my Chaincode to a peer – How do I find which Peer I need to register I tried to follow this video but it uses YAML and I do not have it and it gives error-

Also followed few more tutorials but still confused what to do

Instantiate my Chaincode 
Query my Chaincode - I will be able to do it once Chaincode is registered and deployed
Invoke my Chaincode to update the ledger - Same as above 
Please help in above step or let me know if there is any good source of clear steps to perform registration and instantiation of chaincode.

@GowriR the typical approach to installing a new version is to use the "upgrade" command. Alternately you can install a new chaincode name (but won't have access to the previous chaincode's state)

@qsmen not sure what you are running into ...the command `peer chaincode package -n mycc -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/example02/cmd example02.pack` just generates the package which can be installed on different peers/orgs with the command `peer chaincode install example02.pack`

As an example, the command `peer chaincode package -n mycc -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/example02/cmd example02.pack` just generates the package which can be installed on different peers/orgs with the command `peer chaincode install example02.pack`

Hi @muralisr 
I changed my approach slightly and installed sample-networks and I could see the directory
ubuntu@ip-172-31-22-155:~/KaranHypeledgerFabric/GoLang/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/fabric-samples/fabric-samples/bin$ ls
configtxgen    cryptogen  fabric-ca-client      idemixgen  peer
configtxlator  discover   get-docker-images.sh  orderer
ubuntu@ip-172-31-22-155:~/KaranHypeledgerFabric/GoLang/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/fabric-samples/fabric-samples/bin$
Following which I am manually generating the artifacts but unfortunately cryptogen command is not running and saying cryptogen command not found
rFabric/GoLang/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/fabric-samples/fabric-samples/bin$ cryptogen generate --config=./crypto-config.yaml
cryptogen: command not found
Can you please help me out?
Then I will be Creating a Channel Configuration Transaction and starting the network – following which I will Create & Join Channel then update the peer and install chaincode
Please confirm if this approach will be fine. I am following below tutorial
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/build_network.html

@KaranBlockchain try the `cryptogen generate --config=./crypto-config.yaml` with a "./" in front as in `./cryptogen generate --config=./crypto-config.yaml` please ... if you are following the procedure in the tutorial, it should otherwise be fine

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=x2NoHismrfZxcDujB) @muralisr Thanks @muralisr - so the steps would be install and instantiate version 1. Install version 2 and upgrade to version 2. Am I right? If so, I shall try it tomorrow and hope it works. Any pointers on why I see comments from a chain code whose code is commented ? I can’t get a hang on where it is picking it up from

Hi, I have a doubt, I have installed chaincode on 2 peers of 4 (anchors) but then :
- do I need to instantiate it on each peer where it is installed ? or is it done at the channel level (in tutorial they speak about "instantiating chaincode on channel", not on peer) ?
- same for upgrading, do we need to upgrade each peer (after having installed new version of chaincode on each) ? or is it done at the channel level too ?

@RockyRacer chaincode is installed on every endorsing peer. instantiation only needs to happen per channel.

upgrading a chaincode is really just instantiating a new version. in order to upgrade the new version needs to be installed on every endorsing peering. instantiating the new version only needs to happen per channel.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=jjPQKk25hyzav3mJb) @jrosmith Thanks, but the container running the chaincode is created on instantiation right ? For example if I run the instantiation as _peer0.org0_, I get a single container `dev-peer0.org0.example.com-mycc-1.0-xxxxx`
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 13:44:17 GMT):<br/>
@RockyRacer the chaincode container is created when a transaction is run against an endorsing peer. the peer that processes the instantiate proposal will run the chaincode's `Init` function. you'll have to run a transaction against the other peers and their respective chaincode containers will appear.

2 - When I upgrade chaincode, it runs new containers for the new version, but old containers holding the old version are still running, what is the purpose of this? Do we have to do some container cleaning after multiple upgrades ?

Hey all, I'm conducting some research into Hyperledger Fabric to better understand the developer experience. The data will be used to understand what kind of developers use Hyperledger Fabric aswell as what learning methods and tooling are generally used. I'm also interested in what it's like to pick up learning Chaincode. Any further questions about the survey I'm happy to answer 😁

<p><strong>pkarolis</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:44:46 GMT):<br/>
I was trying to corrupt peer state db and see if my ongoing transactions will be rejected. They were not rejected.

My test:

running two peers on Hyperledger fabric network with on 1.2 version.
I create two objects. Key1>User1 and Key2>UserCompany1.
On peer2 couchdb I delete Key2 for UserCompany1.
I create a transaction on peer1 which updates object User1. Transaction is successfully committed to network.
Given peer2 hasn't got Key2 for UserCompany changes to User1 are not replicated on peer2. However, i don't see any logs indicating this second block was invalid and could not be added to peer2. Update on peer2 is not available either on leveldb or couchdb. 

I understand Read-Write set  check fails validaton on peer2 and hence trx not committed. But I have no of knowing it has failed.

how do I make sure that peer2 does not get out out of sync with peer1? Is there a way to find it? 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:54:52 GMT):<br/>
Fabric uses an endorsement policy where peers from different orgs must return the same results for transactions to be validated.   If ledger state data had been altered or corrupted (in CouchDB or LevelDB file system) on a peer, then the transaction results would be inconsistent across endorsing peers, the 'bad’ peer/org will be found out, and the application client can throw out the results from the bad peer/org before submitting the transaction for ordering/commit. If client application tries to submit a transaction with inconsistent endorsement regardless, this will be detected on all the peers at validation time and the transaction will be invalidated.
  
If you are doing read-only queries rather than update transactions, then you can similarly query multiple endorsing peers and verify the results from each are consistent.
If there is doubt about state database integrity, the state database can be dropped and it will automatically get regenerated from the chain source of truth upon peer restart.  If there is doubt about the chain integrity itself, you can run a verification utility to scan the ledger to check its hashes and overall integrity, one such utility can be found here: https://github.com/C0rWin/ledgerfsck.

If you find the peer has been corrupted or tampered during the verification check, then the peer itself will need to be rebuilt and the chain will be the transferred from another peer upon re-joining the channel.

Later i added peer1 as well to the channel and then the query works fine...

Hi all
I've run `go-get` to download `github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim` and `github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/peer` to download required libs for a chaincode development
but as I can see, an entire repo is downloaded from `github.com/hyperledger/fabric`. is it really needed to be downloaded? 

and there is one more question: is it a good practice to store that vendor packages (from repos above) with the chaincode project in VCS? for example, if I want to stick to v 1.2, I have to store these libs, because after another release, `go-get` will download a newer version

Hi team! I have a question about peer container during the instantiation of a chaincode. Recall the example "Build your first network", the chain code is instantiated on peer0.org2 and this “instantiation” results in a container by the
name of dev-peer0.org2.example.com-mycc-1.0. Is this because peer0.org2 was the last peer in which the chaincode was installed? There is another reason? Please help me.

@PradeepC "[are] there any tool kits that help with the Go or Node.js. or we have write them from scratch"

For writing Chaincode, you can look at examples. There are a few examples out there:

* Chaincode tutorial: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/chaincode4ade.html
* Fabric-samples: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples - there's also a channel #fabric-samples 

Supposedly [Composer](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/) generates chaincode code but I have never used it.

@WCamaly did you check the casing of your files? Linux is case-sensitive, as you write, it does not find `dataModel` but in your dependencies you write `DataModel` with a capital D.
</p>
<p><strong>ManuelRauber</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 06:17:13 GMT):<br/>
And additionally, as the error message reads, your local package needs to have a `package.json` directly under `dataModel` folder

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 13:02:47 GMT):<br/>
@Rachit_gaur cross chaincode invocations only work when the chaincodess are on the same channel. 

as for your other question about backtracing, GetHistoryForKey only works for updates to the same key. Consider the case of txM with id of 1 that transfers 100 from entityA to entityB, and a separate txN with an id of 2 that transfers 50 from entity B to entity A. these are two independent transactions with no stored information linking them apart from the fact that the transactions occurred between entityA and entityB. you could have a special query that returns all transactions between two entities, but you would not be able to accomplish that with the txM's id of 1 or txN's id of 2 alone.

Can anyone shed some light on the platform chaincode build process design methodology? The concept of performing a build in a container in a production environment then using the results to tag an image for chaincode invocation by peers seems far more complex and error prone, not to mention less secure than using a seperate dedicated build environment to create strongly versioned container releases for chaincode...
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 19:50:41 GMT):<br/>
@StefanKosc i believe that would be an anti-pattern. chaincode installation/instantiation happens at the peer/channel level, respectively. how would a single instance of a chaincode know which peers to install the second chaincode on? how would it have the credentials to do so?

Guys I have a question.  I use the NodeJS SDK to interact with the network which is all working fine. When calling a chaincode I return an error (on purpose) and I want to parse that error. To my surprise Fabric is prepending text to the return value of a `shim.Error("{\"someProperty\": \"some message\"}")` call? Making it look like this: `2 UNKNOWN: chaincode error (status: 500, message:{"someProperty": "some message"})`. Instead of this: `{status: 500, message:{"someProperty": "some message"}}`. Why is that text being prepended? That makes no sense whatsoever.

I'm trying to perform to `PutState` in a single call:

```
func ccFunc() {

func putState_1() {
	...
	stub.PutState(key, value)
}

func putState_2() {
	...
	stub.PutState(key, value)
}
```

in this case, putState_1 will not change the ledger state (assume all endorsements and validations are fine)
Is there anything I should take into account? Because such a behavior look weird

@rnisar you can use any standard library go packages for encryption and decryptions, theres a lot of examples online. but i'm not sure you want to put crypto inside of the chaincode. crypto can be expensive, and you're going to be running that during endorsement and validation. it might be better to do the relevant encryption and decryption outside of the chaincode in the application level.

@Rachit_gaur the closest thing would be [GetStateByRange](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces_stable.go#L102), I don't know of any functionality to query by block number as the chaincode interacts with the world state stored in couchDB, not the entire history of the ledger.

Hi everybody!

I use setEvent() https://fabric-shim.github.io/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html#setEvent__anchor in my chaincode on node.js.
And I have a problem. 
For example:
`
console.info('=========== Node.js Chaincode query with Set Event Start ===========');

try {
    stub.setEvent('TransferTestEvent', Buffer.from('testPayload'));
} catch (e) {
    console.info('Catch Error: ');
    console.info(e);
}

console.info('Event add :');
console.info(stub.chaincodeEvent.getEventName());

console.info('Payload add :');
console.info(stub.chaincodeEvent.getPayload().toString('utf8'));

console.info('=========== Node.js Chaincode query with Set Event End ===========');
`
After that I can see event name and payload in logs:
`
=========== Node.js Chaincode query with Set Event Start ===========
Event add :
TransferTest
Payload add :
test
=========== Node.js Chaincode query with Set Event End ===========
(node:19) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rejection id: 1): TypeError: Illegal buffer
(node:19) [DEP0018] DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.
`
So I have error: TypeError: Illegal buffer
Does anybody faced with similar problem?

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 13:58:49 GMT):<br/>
The error is from a different part of your code.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 14:00:07 GMT):<br/>
The payload is outputting: `test` and there is no `Catch error:` message in those logs. So you're not handling a promise rejection somewhere down the line.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 14:00:57 GMT):<br/>
Unless setEvent returns a Promise that is.
</p>
<p><strong>dmk88</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 15:33:39 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels there is no `Catch error` message because there is no error. And as you can see here https://fabric-shim.github.io/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html#setEvent__anchor setEvent(name, payload) is not async function. It`s only simple setter. So I can`t solve the problem of `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning`. 
I think that problem is in encoding payload `TypeError: Illegal buffer` in fabric-shim

@Rachit_gaur ` even after i downloaded the util package` -  not sure what this means but this error implies  the go-package was not included in the chaincode install package. Dependent go packages not provided by the fabric chaincode image build env are provided in the chaincode install by "vendoring" depencies (which tools such as dep or govendor).

<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 20:35:37 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, is there an example of using MockStub in a test peer where the transactions are actually generated by a real SDK?  I'm thinking I'd like to test my app backend by having it make real requests against a fake peer that's implemented using MockStub
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 20:36:57 GMT):<br/>
In particular, I want real data being returned from the GetCreator, GetTransient, GetBinding, GetSignedProposal methods, and it seems natural to have a real SDK supply those as it would for a real transaction.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 14 Sep 2018 03:19:15 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking it would be something that implements the Endorser service defined in peer.proto, so that the app's SDK can connect to it and issue GRPC requests

Hello, I am testing out the private data collection. I understand that the key of the private data is hashed and then used as a key in the public ledger.
My question is: does Fabric check for collision of this hashed value with other keys on the public ledger? If not, how do we check for that in the chaincode?
For example: my private data key "client1" gets hashed into let's say "f53a7". Does anything prevent this data to overwrite a public data entry with key "f53a7", or another private data whose key also hashes to "f53a7"?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=pYfPqJZ8tb4vsgtXd) @StefanKosc I don't think it matters in term of efficiency.

In general, you want to extract what you want from stub in the invocation function and then pass them to lower functions as needed. In higher function you can check for errors in stub and/or invalid parameters and return errors immediately.

In lower functions, you do not need to care about where these parameters come from, how to extract them from stub, and if they are valid. It increases your code's readability and helps with refactoring down the road.

If you want to learn more about idiomatic Go code (it's the equivalent of pythonic in Python), these two resources are the way to Go:

* https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html
* https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments

There are somethings lik goroutine which are heavily "suggested" in Go that are best not used in chaincode. But usually good chaincode is good Go code.

Hi all,   I have a question. Is it possible to execute a chaincode based on time (for example for every 2 minutes chaincode needs to be invoked), if yes ,are there any examples?
</p>
<p><strong>TobiasN</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 06:57:57 GMT):<br/>
@lucky114407 yes you can, but you have to be clear, every organization is running the chaincode on different hardware, with potential different connections between peer and its CouchDB. So the precision should be very low, as allowing one peer easily to be twice that fast as an other still producing the same outcome. I would highly recommend, not to do that.

Another question.
Say I want to create 'Customers' in the ledger/world-state, and each customer has a number of extra data.

Two questions:
1- When the application invokes a 'createCustomer( data...)' function in the chaincode, the chaincode couuld mantain a key named 'allCustomers' that is a JSON with all the existing customers. Say each customer has an ID, then the next Id to use is the max(Id)+1 of the current JSON of the key 'allCustomers'. My question is, is this a reasonable or idiomatic way of doing this?, I mean for storing the list of customers, and for solving the problem of deterministic Id for them.
2- Say I implement idea of the last point. It would make sense to store for each customer its own extra data in a composite key?, say objectType='Customer' and an attribute 'Id', which is the corresponding one of the customer from the key 'allCustomers'?
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:56:32 GMT):<br/>
I ask this because there may be some good design ideas about doing this kind of usual things.
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 19:08:11 GMT):<br/>
@waxer why not store each customer as their own JSON blob in couchDB and just have a special view to retrieve them all? 
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 19:12:08 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith , how you choose the key corresponding to each customer?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 19:12:47 GMT):<br/>
@waxer set to whatever unique identifier you have for them, or use the txID for the createCustomer request
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 19:13:52 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith , oh, you're saying using some kind of 'natural primary key' for the domain. For example, their national document Id number. Not really an abstract sequence of Id numbers, right?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 19:14:38 GMT):<br/>
@waxer yes, if that makes sense for your use case. if not i think it makes fine sense to use the txID since it by definition will be unique
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 19:15:26 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith , right.. I don't know if there's some constrain about the length of the key. Because txID I think is quite lengthy.
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 19:16:47 GMT):<br/>
@waxer its only 64 characters, you can also decode the hex string to bytes then encode those however you see fit

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=SumQLwhkodjbaeJJD) @dave.enyeart Thank you. So private data key hashes cannot collide with public data keys. What about collision with other private data keys? They would be in the same namespace right?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 02:57:30 GMT):<br/>
the keys and their private data hashes are each scoped to their own namespace within the channel/chaincode/collection.

Question. A priori if two peers have installed different chaincode code, but as the same name and version. It will only be noticable when some endorsing policy will be violates because different read write sets? Or somehow the network could detect this situation in another way?
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 03:02:49 GMT):<br/>

Hi all, again I have a question about private data:
In the example tutorial at https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/private_data_tutorial.html , the invocation of the chaincode uses "normal" fields for its arguments. As a result, every invoke action with all the private arguments can be viewed in plain text in the blocks from the ledger, making the data basically public.
The page on private data briefly mentions I can use the transient field during, but I am confused at which format it should be in. I keep getting errors similar to this:
`# peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050 --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA -C mychannel -n transienttest -c '{"Args":["initMarble","marble1","blue","35","able","99"]}' --waitForEvent --transient '{"key1":"12345"}'
Error: error parsing transient string: illegal base64 data at input byte 4 - proposal response: <nil>
`
Can anyone tell me how to properly use the transient field for invoke?

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:51:56 GMT):<br/>
@waxer a certain chaincode version with a certain fingerprint (hash) is instantiated on the channel (on the blockchain), this spans all peers and is the source of truth.  if any peer locally installs a chaincode with that name and version but different fingerprint, then endorsement requests to that peer for that chaincode execution will fail, as the local fingerprint it checked against the blockchain.

@gen_el `It refused to start and attach no matter what i tried. ` cannot interpret that... assuming you fixed the reason for the ` uncatch error` and reinstalled/instantiated the chaincode one thing you coukd try is to remove the old chaincode docker image (the `docker rmi ..` command). If you used the same parameters (name, version etc) to the fixed chaincode and did not remove the old image, fabric would just use the old existing image

<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Sun, 23 Sep 2018 00:30:10 GMT):<br/>
For example, it is supposed that your chaincode invokation should satisfy some kind of determinism.
</p>

Calling an external API doesn't necessarily means non determinism, but sounds odd.

<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Sun, 23 Sep 2018 00:31:15 GMT):<br/>
Moreover, if you have endorsing peers in different infrastructure, all of them should be configured correctly to access the external resource.
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Sun, 23 Sep 2018 13:22:28 GMT):<br/>
@Jgnuid  so good approach would be to fetch all resources before running transaction right ?

Hey all, is there an easy way to delete chaincode from the peer?  Chaincode that's not currently instantiated, obviously.

Hello all! I'm having an issue. When I query the chaincode from the CLI container I get a response, but when I do it from a Node app, there is an empty payload, and no errors in the peer logs. Anyone has an idea why?
</p>
<p><strong>zale144</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 08:14:37 GMT):<br/>
The endorsement goes fine, but seems that the request never reaches the actual chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>zale144</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 08:51:34 GMT):<br/>
The Node app in question is Marbles. It successfully installs and instantiates the chaincode on my network, but when I start the app and it performs checks to see if there is chaincode and it's version, it fails because of the reason I already mentioned

<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 17:49:14 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, how does one retrieve the peer's identity within a chaincode invoke call?  I get that using a peer-dependent value is asking for non-deterministic transaction results, but with the advent of private collections (which generally also use the "transient" field of the transaction), you're going to have different peers working with different data anyway, and it's the responsibility of the chaincode implementer to guarantee that the transaction results are deterministic.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 17:49:50 GMT):<br/>
One hacky way to do it would be to send the peer's identity in via the transaction's transient field (on a per-peer basis), but this is open to mistake and deception
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 18:04:46 GMT):<br/>
Hmm.. further question: do modifications to a private collection show up as hash values in the publicly visible portion of the transaction?

Hi, Is it possible to send an event back to the peer and hence the client ChaincodeEvent Listener using the setEvent(name, payload) method on the stub in the init method of a chaincode? (I am using the node chaincode containers but i guess it  should be same for every language).I am seeing events from other methods but not from the init method.

Hello! 
1. Why do my chaincode containers have prefix `dev-`. Peers are started not in dev mode.
2. When a new version of chaincode has been deployed, old version container is still alive. Why? 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 28 Sep 2018 12:03:55 GMT):<br/>
@krabradosty `dev-` is a prefix which is defined in the configuration of your peer. See the docs about point 2 here https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4noah.html#upgrade
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 28 Sep 2018 12:08:41 GMT):<br/>
@Legiit In summary
1. start fabric in dev mode
2. Go to your nodejs chaincode and do `npm install`
3. run your node.js chaincode with the parameter --peer.address grpc://localhost:7052 and a specify a chaincode name and version eg
`CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME="mycc:v0" mychaincode.js --peer.address grpc://localhost:7052`
4. Install some dummy chaincode onto the peer and with a name of mycc and version v0
5. Instantiate the chaincode with name of mycc and version v0

<p><strong>Legiit</strong> (Fri, 28 Sep 2018 12:23:46 GMT):<br/>

@JuanSuero I;m not answering the question directly (need to look into the chaincode properties) but you could redirect chaincode logs to peer logs by adding  `CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true` to the peer (ie, to the continaer that does `peer node start`). In addition you could control chaincode log level there with env CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL (as in `CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG`)

@Andres3741 there are two aspects to the question....(1) `Instantiate` command targets the instantiate proposal at the peer it is directed to. But the Commit of the instantiate transaction happens on all the peers in the channel. In other words, all the peers in the channel will see the instantitate TX and the states due to that TX after commit (2) to do the Instnatiate proposal itself on multiple peers, the proposal has to be sent to all the peers. Typically the SDKs take care of this. Based on the context of the question,  `how can I instantiate chain code automatically in a new peer` - given (1), a new peer joining will sync up and get the instantiation TX. In addition, if the chaincode itself is installed on the new peer and it satisfies the endorsement policy, you can direct invokes and queries to the chaincode.

As well as, I am looking for two more help. 1. I have created a fabric network with `2-ca and 2-orgs with 2 peer node and one of them is endorsing node`. I am doing a value transaction in the `chaincode`. Whenever a transaction is invoked, the chaincode will be simulated in all endorsing peers. So, in my case there should be 2 simulations should happen. But value transaction is don only once. (value transaction means sending money from A to B). Actually, It should have been transferred twice, isn't it? What I am doing wrong????? 2. How to set up a real-time multi-organization fabric network?

@Legiit you run it on a command line ,eg 
`CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME="mycc:v0" node mychaincode.js --peer.address grpc://localhost:7052`

</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 12:51:04 GMT):<br/>
@hyper-sunder there are two simulations but only one transaction. the transaction is considered valid if and only if all simulations (as required by your endorsement policy) have the same output.

In regard to calling a chaincode(go lang) through  fabric nodejs  API, The Request Object for the method sendTransactionProposal(req ChaincodeInvokeRequest) the ChaincodeInvokeRequest accepts only Array.<string> as arguments for the invoke method to be called, IS there any other way/mechanism to pass arguments say..JSON, name/values.. .. present ordered way of arguments looks very odd.I am referring to Fabric V1.2 https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/global.html#ChaincodeInvokeRequest.

</p>
<p><strong>hyper-sunder</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 17:56:57 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith thanks for the reply. The simulation actually executed the `chaincode` end to end and endorse them if they are valid. Once the simulations are done the `orderer-service` sends to `committing peers`. How does the value transaction from `A` to `B` is transferred only once. Hope I am clear.

</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 10:08:58 GMT):<br/>
@tahaf10 the choice between couchdb and leveldb is a peer configuration. The only time chaincode cares what the state database is when performing a rich query on the world state.

Some codes follow the format ```

``` 
</p>
<p><strong>tahaf10</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 10:35:16 GMT):<br/>

``` 
</p>
<p><strong>tahaf10</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 10:35:51 GMT):<br/>
whats the difference between pb.response and ([]byte,error) or is it the same thing?

@tahaf10 the `Invoke (stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) ([]byte, error)`  API interface was replaced with `Invoke (stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) (pb.response)` interface. The two versions of `createChaincode` probably reflects that

Hello All, 
is it a good practice to initialize variables in Init function of smart contract(we used golang SC)?

We faced a scenario where the chaincode containers were stopped however after invoking smart contract the chaincode container was up which resulted in non-initialized global variables leaving a few transactions non-functional.

Any comments are appreciated.
</p>
<p><strong>sheetal-hlf</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 05:45:20 GMT):<br/>

Sorry for the issues with the JSDoc; we're adjusting the docs to support multiple versions on the same URL. Few changes to line up, up the end result is intended to follow the pattern   `fabric-shim.github.io/release-v.r/ `  with the 'master' branch docs at `/master/`  and the home url resdirects to the latest release docs

Alright thanks! 
& to circle back to the chaincode in dev mode - I've done started the `chaincode-dev-mode` network and executed `CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME="MyChaincode:143543" node dist/MyChaincode.js --peer.address grpc://localhost:7051`
But it returns `chat stream with peer - on error: "Error: 12 UNIMPLEMENTED: unknown service protos.ChaincodeSupport`

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 10:54:55 GMT):<br/>
@Legiit I would check that the version of the shim you are using matches the fabric peer you are talking to. Never use `latest` or `unstable` to reference a version of the fabric-shim you should always be specific, eg `^1.2.0` or even `1.2.0` to be even more specific

@theathibm the node.js chaincode container runtime is 8.9.4 for 1.2 and I think is moving to 8.11.1 for 1.3. It will probably stay on Node 8 Lts for the 1.4 release, but I see that 10 is due to go LTS this month, but I think it unlikely it will move up to 10

Hi Team,

There is an illustration of model .bna using Participants (traders), Assets (commodities) and transactions in Hyperledger Fabric session. You might have several Traders & commodities and their transactions. 

My query is mentioned below. when Trader1 logs into the the application using thin client (web interface),
- how do you authenticate him as Trader1
- how does the signing of transaction by Trader1 happens using his private_key

</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 09:51:04 GMT):<br/>
At this exact point in time - it's the URL modification. 
I would like to add to the main body of the read mes, some text links to the different version. 

A drop selection box for version would be preferred; though the JSDoc Template in use has no support for this. To start along the journey for that I have another JIRA in place to move the template from a 3rd party dependency into the main repo. Then that can be modified to provide a better experience.

I have developed and implemented chaincode for my logic on Fabric. Any tips on how to expose this logic now in the form of APis?

@sheetal-hlf the fabric function of Init is called when the chaincode is instantiated and is meant to seed values in your ledger. you should not use this function to seed package level variables within the chaincode. in order to guarantee that package level variables are present in all instances of the chaincode when a container comes up, use go's built in [init](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html?#init) function

@hyper-sunder @Legiit you can send an endorsement policy up with node-sdk using [sendInstantiateProposal](https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/Channel.html#sendInstantiateProposal__anchor), which takes in a [ChaincodeInstantiateUpgradeRequest](https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/global.html#ChaincodeInstantiateUpgradeRequest) object that has a property of the [EndorsementPolicy](https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/EndorsementPolicy.html) class.

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 16:20:15 GMT):<br/>
@atirekg what do you mean by 'create valid key dynamically'? the `key` reverenced in `PutState` is key for the transaction in the stateDB

Hello, I am working on a chaincode where I need to read data previously stored from another one. They are instantiated on the same channel and I can use them individually to read and write data separately. In one of them (A) I implemented invokeChaincode(B), to read data stored by B.
```
func (chaincode *SimpleChaincode) queryMarblesFromAnotherChaincode(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) peer.Response {

	queryMarble := "queryMarble"

	if len(args) != 3 {
		return shim.Error("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 3")
	}

	chaincodeName := args[0]
	chaincodeArgs := toChaincodeArgs(queryMarble, args[1])
	chaincodeChannel := args[2]

	response := stub.InvokeChaincode(chaincodeName, chaincodeArgs, chaincodeChannel)
	if response.Status != shim.OK {
		return shim.Error(fmt.Sprintf("Failed to query chaincode: %s", response.Payload))
	}
	return shim.Success(response.Payload)
}```
 Running that method using `peer chaincode invoke ..` , I receive `status: 200`, but Payload is empty. Could you advice on what I am doing wrong?

I have installed First-network with respective peers and organizations and created and installed my own chaincode to perform transactions on the state ledger.

@atirekg why not just use the transaction id generated by fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 14:05:49 GMT):<br/>
@nicolapaoli try logging the response before returning `shim.Success` so you can see what the chaincode youre reading from is actually returning
</p>
<p><strong>nicolapaoli</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 15:48:02 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @jrosmith , I did that. Both `response.Payload` and `response.Message` are empty, while `response.Status` is `200`

I am reading through key-level endorsement. As per the document we could write logic inside the chaincode to change the endorsement policy based on asset state. In this case suppose the chaincode at the peer is not updated with the latest version and mean time a transaction start then what will happen for the transaction endoresment.

In this case suppose the chaincode at the peer is not updated with the latest version and mean time a transaction start then what will happen for the transaction endoresment.

@KaranBlockchain the transaction from invoke woukld be sent to commit. Depending on config and load this could take a few seconds. Did you retry query after a bit of time ?

Hi Murali, I tried it several times after that but it did not work out not sure why. When I tried to query with the values from the instantiated Chaincode args it was successful but unfortunately invoke was not working

It'll be good to see Invoke code.. in any case, given that you have been changing code and retrying its possible that fabric is actually using chaincode image from previous runs. Suggest try deleting the old chaincode image (`docker rmi <cc image>`) and try

@Andres3741 if you were trying wit 1.2.1, the error `Channel capability V1_3 is required but not supported: Channel capability V1_3 is required but not supported` implies invalid configuration file such as configx.yaml. If the problem persists after you clean up before trying 1.2.1,suggest you try in #fabric-orderer

</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 15:23:38 GMT):<br/>
@tahaf10 the general rule is to keep it as simple as possible. keep in mind that chaincode gets run during both endorsement and validation, so if you put computationally expensive functions inside of the chaincode the slowdown will be twofold.

Hi, is there any chance to write an policy with "this user" should not endorse the chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>akoenig</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 13:14:01 GMT):<br/>
there is just AND and OR and not NOT for example

Hi guys, I've a rest api, on chaincode I change the status of response before return shim
e.g
```shimError := shim.Error(err.Error())
			errorCode, err := strconv.Atoi(result)
			if err != nil {
				return shim.Error(err.Error())
			}
			shimError.Status = int32(errorCode)
			return shimError```
. But at fabric-sdk-go the chaincode status is always 0
```
resp, err := channelClient.Execute(invokeRequest)
			if err != nil {
				log.Printf("Put Error:\n%+v\n", resp)
				w.WriteHeader(int(resp.ChaincodeStatus)) # always 0
				w.Write([]byte(err.Error()))
				return
			}```
</p>
<p><strong>vieiramanoel</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:49:10 GMT):<br/>
how do I get status returned at pb.response?
</p>
<p><strong>vieiramanoel</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:49:42 GMT):<br/>
I want to manage error codes between chaincode and rest, instead of returning always 500 for internal error

@muralisr  any thoughts regarding the invoke chaincode, its not working - it gives success message at the end but query doesn't works for the new values even after waiting for long time. Here is invoke code without any comments ```
func (t *SimpleChaincode) invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) pb.Response {
	
	var Username, Fileuploaded string
	var err error

	if len(args) != 2 {
		return shim.Error("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 2")
	}

	Username = args[0]
	Fileuploaded = args[1]

	// Get the state from the ledger
	// TODO: will be nice to have a GetAllState call to ledger
	
	// Write the state back to the ledger
	err = stub.PutState(Username, []byte(Fileuploaded))
	if err != nil {
		return shim.Error(err.Error())
	}


	return shim.Success(nil)
}
```

Small suggestion for fabric-shim-node - winston is currently at version 3 and has it's types included in the repo
Thus it's possible to upgrade winston and remove @types/winston as it's not maintained anymore

<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 13:20:51 GMT):<br/>
will depend on how your fabric is configured... usually the chaincode is started with `--peer.address=localhost:7052` for a dev environment

Hi all, how does one disable the "Queries on pvt data is supported only in a read-only transaction" check for private collections?  I understand why a draconian default would be used to guarantee that private data has zero chance of making it onto the public ledger, but that's a very special subcase.  I would like to satisfy that contract myself without this unnecessary rule, as some of my mutation transactions on private data require -- suprise, suprise -- reading that private data in order to decide what to do.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 23:49:20 GMT):<br/>
I realize that it's possible to break up the single transaction that I want to write into several transactions to satisfy the strict privacy constraint, but this really complicates things

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 11:57:41 GMT):<br/>
@vdods The reason rich and range queries are not allowed in private data read/write transactions, is that private data may be missing on a peer and therefore the range or rich query may give you incomplete and different results across peers - not something you want to tolerate in a transactional system.  If you are determined to do it anyways, you can split it into a read range/rich query followed by separate transactions for each key, where you read/write each key individually (single key reads are safe in read/write transactions as missing data can be identified based on the public hash and you'll get an error if it is missing). Alternatively you can make at least the keys public and do range queries on the public keys and writes to private keys, in a single read/write transaction.

Hi,

    Cud u like help me to solve this problem in hyperledger fabric, i was trying to setup a fabric network consisting of 3 Organisations and 12 peers.
I have used ur chainhero tutorial as a reference. I have built the network and it is up and running but when i try to run the built file (./chain-heroes in ur example) the SDK and resource management gets created but then this error shows up


Unable to initialize the Fabric SDK: failed to save channel: create channel failed: SendEnvelope failed: calling orderer 'localhost:7050' failed: Orderer Server Status Code: (400) BAD_REQUEST. Description: error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: policy for [Group]  /Channel/Application not satisfied: Failed to reach implicit threshold of 1 sub-policies, required 1 remaining



Then i checked the orderer logs and i see this


[cauthdsl] deduplicate -> ERRO 259 Principal deserialization failure (MSP Org1 is unknown)


Now my doubt is that i have used the same setup.go file u have used in ur tutorial. Is there any issue in using the setup.go file u used for single org setup for multi org setup?
Please do help me, thanks in advance.

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 16:45:51 GMT):<br/>
you can look at the name of the target cc in the proposal... and if it's not the same as your chaincode then it means it's a CC2CC 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 19:38:21 GMT):<br/>
@tahaf10 if you are going to be using time in your chaincode you should be retrieving it from the proposal, using `stub.getTxTimestamp()`, this ensures the time will be the same across all endorsing peers. you can parse the epoch time from this timestamp and manage it that way. 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 19:39:08 GMT):<br/>

Hello! Regarding invoking/Querying chaincode from nodejs to fabric shim.IS there a way of passing the data from fabric layer through peer.response , which returns a byte array, what if we need a json to be populated , how to pass on json style data from peer.response(byte[]), which is received through Response.Payload,however you could get those as byte[], the need is to receive it as JSON/struct ,how can we achieve this?
In simple how to send json data through peer.response?

I have defined 2 structs in my chaincode. When I insert an object of first struct with ID 1 it gets inserted, but when I insert another object of type 2nd struct with ID 1 it says ID already exists. Using couchdb for statedb. Shouldn't these 2 be 2 different tables?

Hey :) Have you used `github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid` ? when I am getting the identityID using GetID(stub) it returns some huge string which looks like a public key or something like that. Do you have any idea why? If I cannot take the userID via this library, how can I?

So the hyperledger docs mention it is possible for two different chaincodes to access the same ledger: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/peers/peers.html#multiple-chaincodes
however, when running the peer command to instantiate a chaincode there is no option to specify the ledger name. The resulting couchdb tables are separated by chaincode name and calls to get/put state can't reach across the boundary either. Do the docs really just mean that multiple chaincode functions in the same deployment can share a ledger? Any suggestions for what to try?
</p>
<p><strong>MikeEmery</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 17:32:38 GMT):<br/>
I've been working around it for now by invoking against the other chaincode by name, but it doesn't seem ideal
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 17:37:45 GMT):<br/>
@MikeEmery In that doc context ledger=channel.  For clarify let's use channel term instead of ledger. When you instantiate a chaincode you do indicate the channel.  The channel can support multiple chaincodes. Chaincode data lives within its own namespace on the channel. A chaincode can only access it's own data.  But a chaincode can invoke another chaincode on the channel, thereby supporting channel transactions spanning multiple chaincodes.  This separation is designed on purpose, for example you may have different access control logic in each of the chaincodes.

@dave.enyeart perfect, thank you very much for the clarification!
</p>
<p><strong>MikeEmery</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 17:49:16 GMT):<br/>
So in a sense, there isn't really a difference between accessing data across different channels (assuming they are both installed on the same peer) and within the same channel
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 18:36:15 GMT):<br/>
@MikeEmery There is one significant difference... you can do cross-chaincode transactions within a channel, but not across channels.  Read more about it here: i’d be interested in seeing those logs, for the three scenarios (regular data, private data scenarios with push, and private data scenarios with pull), for each leveldb and couchdb.  total of 6 tests.

hello
is there any way to call system chaincode?
for example, If I want to get a list of channels available for client, can I somehow call `GetChannels` function from `cscc`?
I stuck here, because a channel must be specified when invoke/call chaincode. but which one should I use in this case?

@gravity system chaincodes can be called from other chaincodes provided they are allowed to be called from other chaincodes. `cscc` by definition is not allowed to be called from other chaincodes
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 03 Nov 2018 23:18:36 GMT):<br/>
@GiovanniNapoli the `qscc` system chaincode queries ledger for blocks, transactions etc. That might be a good example for you to model. 
</p>

I saw in `peer/node/start.go` thant there's an initialization which inits also this so-called "provider" using the Singleton pattern. In my SysCC I need to replace some data on the blockfile_XXXX (replace an entire transaction, for instance)...How can i do that?

Hi experts,

I have built a simple rest API in Go using “github.com/gorilla/mux” with a simple POST and GET method. I build my chain code with a simple structure and It works. The chaincode has two methods, one that puts new elements to the chaincode and get elements from the chaincode. 

I’m connecting to the peer (“docker exec -it cli bash”) and calling the invoke method from the same terminal that I installed the chaincode, and it works. I’m checking the Couch Db and the records gets updated.
The invoke method looks like this:
peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050 --tells --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem -C $CHANNEL_NAME -n marbles01 -c '{"Args":["CreateWareHousesFromFile","mr1","BCN","35","Tom", "Alex"]}'


Know I’m traing to make the same Invoke call from my Go REST API and I’m stack, any wane knows how to make this call from the Go REST API?

</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 14:18:56 GMT):<br/>
@Mr.Reddington if i'm understanding correctly you're saying that instead of doing an invoke with a cli you want to make a request against your REST API server, which will in turn perform the invoke? if that is the case, your api server will need to make use of #fabric-sdk-go in order to interact with the peer

Hey Devs,
I want my first client after a chaincode update to not have to wait for the chaincode container to spin up.

Is the best way to get the chaincode container up and running still:
1. Update chaincode on a peer.
2. Wait for the peer to gossip the chaincode to all other peers,
3. Then call an intentionally bad chaincode query on each peer to get the chaincode container started.

That was a best practice as of a few months ago, but I wanted to loop back to the experts.

@amolpednekar yes, that's what he means

<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 12:24:36 GMT):<br/>
@krabradosty There are certain situations when multithreaded chaincode makes sense, such as when the update-to-ledger frequency is fairly low but it requires a lot of (parallelizable) computation for an endorser to get a result. That said, it's more typical that you're wanting to improve transactions-per-second and do this by making your chaincode use composite keys (so they don't stomp on each other within a block through MVCC) and then scale out to more endorsers per (relevant) organization.

@githubcpc It looks like your chaincode exited with an error (or panic) and the peer returned a 500 HTTP response. Try debugging in devmode and trace the logic to see why it's crashing

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=kXZ63Jb3i4QwpejHp) @ruien So a chaincode can't be a bottleneck? Do I understand correctly that all chaincodes invocations are executed in different goroutines?
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 12:39:47 GMT):<br/>
I can't recall if chaincode execution is parallelized (I know certain elements of the VSCC are), but chaincode isn't a bottleneck in principle because you can add more endorsers and run those in parallel.

you can stop peer, drop couchdb data (delete from /opt/couchdb/data), then restart peer.  State database will automatically be rebuilt from the blockchain.

@adamhardie GetCreator pertains to the ID that submitted the proposal (see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.3/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L313). As far as fabric is concerned the "client"

Hi, quick question, In the collection_config JSON, when we define a policy with participants using "OR" or "AND" , how does it make a difference. I thought using collection level policy, we are defining a distribution policy and all parties listed in this should receive a private data. Shouldn't it be always "AND "?

Hey there, I am having an issue deploying my chaincode to a local fabric ledger. 
I am working with a Fabric basic-network. The setup goes fine. I can install my chaincode on the peer, the problem is when I try to instantiate.
It goes into timeout and nothing happens, my code is never instantiated on the channel.
After looking at the logs and investigating what could be happening it seems the orderer receives the transaction information, validates it and then starts a broadcast loop at the cli:59208 and then nothing happens.
Any idea what I might be missing? what config/files could be helpful for me to test on ?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 16:08:42 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi the private data distribution doesn't have to go to all orgs at endorsement time, so the list of orgs in the collection config is modeled as OR.  Admittedly this is not a great format to model the list of orgs, but it was used as it already existed for endorsement policy syntax, rather than inventing a new syntax for distribution policy.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 16:09:44 GMT):<br/>
concerning your problem, I suspect the collection did not get defined when the chaincode was instantiated, maybe there was an issue with how it was passed from the client side that you need to investigate
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 16:10:17 GMT):<br/>
if you are using sdk, you can query for the available collections, see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.3/fabric-client/lib/Channel.js#L2313

Hello guys i need a little help .
</p>
<p><strong>deenario</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 05:33:49 GMT):<br/>
I have two struct in my chaincode. 
Student and Teacher. 
The student table has Student ID and Teacher table has TeacherID.
Now upon insertion i am checking if the studentID 1 already exsists or not.  What i am doing for it is this. 

StudentAsBytes, err := stub.GetState(studentID)
	if err != nil {
		return shim.Error("Student Failed with Error: " + err.Error())
	} else if ConversionAsBytes != nil {
		return shim.Error("The Inserted Student ID already Exists: " + StudentID)
	}

The Problem is even. There is no data in the student struct but the teacher table has ID 1. So it will give me this error for the student Table that ID 1 already exsists.
</p>

How can i make it check ID one only in the same struct i am sending data to.

Hi guys, I have a question regarding the hyperledger fabric. Can we exchange data between two channels? 
*For example*: Consider the hyperledger fabric consisting of three orgs (such as A, B and C) with two channels A-B and A-C. A record is created in channel A-B. Can it be checked from channel A-C? Is it possible?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=SbxkS4R3jCjdhtWTk) @deenario The State database is a "document store" noSQL database - there is no concept of tables, just the *Key* and the *Value* for each document. 
You will need to maintain the uniqueness of each Key across your whole data domain - Fabric does help with this, allowing for composite keys, so in your case you could create a composite key for Student and 01, and also for Teacher 01.  If you search the Fabric Docs, and the Shim doc you will find Composite keys, and this is a good place to start: https://fabric-shim.github.io/release-1.3/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html#createCompositeKey__anchor

So you can't automatically replicate data between channels, but you can write code to do it yourself.

Hi all, I'm trying to experiment with chaincode in devmode.  I am following https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/chaincode4ade.html, but am not using docker containers since that's not how our environment is set up.  I am running one peer and one orderer; I am able to register the chaincode with the peer, but the CLI install command fails: `ubuntu@ip-172-31-41-77:~/src/chaincode-sandbox/tutorials/sacc$: peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 0 -p .` `Error: error getting endorser client for install: endorser client failed to connect to localhost:7051: failed to create new connection:`  But my peer is listening on 7051. What's going on?

Hi all, I'm trying to run the SimpleAsset example from https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/chaincode4ade.html, with the caveat that I am not using Fabric Docker images, but deploying a custom network.  Unfortunately, I keep running into permission issues when using the peer CLI: e.g. `peer chaincode list --installed` results in `Error: Bad response: 500 - access denied for [getinstalledchaincodes]: Failed verifying that proposal's creator satisfies local MSP principal during channelless check policy with policy [Admins]: [This identity is not an admin]`.  I have an admin cert in `msp/admincerts/peer0-admin.cert.pem`, and it looks like it's being loaded at some point, so I'm not sure what is causing the error.  Any help would be appreciated, I've been stuck for hours :/

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=jWhqtt5bkw6TxPgjM) @dnquark well, to some extent, it depends on that 'custom network' you mention. This thread (albeit an earlier Fabric release, but same issues apply) - click 'more' to expand may give you some clues -> https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric/topic/24092472#4257 - suggestion is setting of CORE_PEER_CHAINCODEADDRESS  - ie you need to make sure the chaincode container can successfully resolve the peer's address, and connect to it on the right port (eg 7052). It can also occur (looking at the admin error - and depending on the environment) if the certificate generated has not been uploaded to the peer / the admin you're using is not recognized by your Fabric CA server .

Hy ladies and gents has anyone implemented Application level ACL on Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode? Like restrict access to say fabcar -> changeOwner method so that only a specific orgs user may access it... This is supper simple in Hyplergder Composer I know... But I am running multiple channels and Composer does not directly support multiple channels also less flexible
</p>
<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 12:38:27 GMT):<br/>
@Switch2Logic you might want to use the Client Identity Chaincode Library for that as an attribute (eg, restrict access to a app group/role ; invocation denied to those not a member by virtue of a custom attribute for the identity etc) -> https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/lib/cid/README.md#client-identity-chaincode-library

@Switch2Logic https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/access_control.html#how-acls-are-formatted-in-configtx-yaml gives overview of ACL both from chaincode and the "resource" based ACL. Perhaps you have looked at this already ?

With Fabric supporting calls from one chaincode to another, is there some way (e.g. meta data somewhere) to tell if the current executing chaincode was called directly or delegated via another contract?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=pGGqiBd59ndd6eEBA) @dileban There is nothing built in to provide this, but you can easily add a parameter to the called chaincode and pass a field to indicate the caller.
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 12:06:33 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart Thanks, but I'm looking for something that's secure. i.e., I would only want the invoked contract to take certain actions iff a former contract was invoked.
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 12:06:57 GMT):<br/>
Are transient fields preserved across called contracts?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 12:07:30 GMT):<br/>
Not sure, @muralisr is an expert in this area and may know
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 12:09:13 GMT):<br/>
Cool, I might have a chat with him. It would be desirable to have some meta data injected by the platform in scenarios where contracts call other contracts, that's secure and unforgable. There's a nice benefit from a design standpoint especially when creating reusable contracts.  
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 12:10:01 GMT):<br/>
agreed, please create a Jira enhancement after discussing options with @muralisr 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 20:50:52 GMT):<br/>
@dileban you can extract the original chaincode name from proposal object returned by stub.GetSignedProposal ... if that's same as your chaincode then its not called by another. Would that work ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 20:51:27 GMT):<br/>
but yes, this might be made a first class option
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 20:51:27 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 20:53:40 GMT):<br/>
Also agree, it would be nice if the ChaincodeStubInterface's InvokeChaincode function supported passing additional map of meta-data that can only be sent through only by a delegating chaincode

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 20:58:58 GMT):<br/>
well, we certainly can discuss in a JIRA.. but how would you pass the metadata (over and above the args you pass to the chaincode anyway ?) ... I guess the use case is the key here
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:03:40 GMT):<br/>
I have one in mind, but let me think through this a bit to see if mine's not an edge case and this can be generally useful
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:05:05 GMT):<br/>
If InvokeChaincode isn't the right approach, perhaps this can be done differently. But, to your point, a first class API could be useful

@nadineouro Getting a pb.Response is consistent with the documentation ( https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#MockStub.InvokeChaincode ), but I can't really say why it's this way. Maybe that makes it more forward-compatible if Invokes (as opposed to just Queries) are ever supported in the future?

Does anyone know how to determine if chaincode is called by chaincode? I want to restrict a chaincode function such that it can only be invoked by another chaincode

</p>
<p><strong>billchen</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:18:40 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith Potentially. Would it be a fair assumption that if the called chaincode is different (if a peer installed a different version of the called chaincode under the same name), then the endorsement is invalid?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:35:21 GMT):<br/>
@billchen the chaincode wouldn't come up if the fingerprint on filesystem does not match the instantiated chaincode. So it request would fail

Hello,
When chaincode container remains idle for some time then it stops with error:
```
ERROR [lib/handler.js] Chat stream with peer - on error: "Error: 14 UNAVAILABLE: EOF\n    at createStatusError (/usr/local/src/node_modules/grpc/src/client.js:64:15)\n    at ClientDuplexStream._emitStatusIfDone (/usr/local/src/node_modules/grpc/src/client.js:270:19)\n at ClientDuplexStream._receiveStatus (/usr/local/src/node_modules/grpc/src/client.js:248:8)\n    at /usr/local/src/node_modules/grpc/src/client.js:804:12"

```


And when the first request comes after idle time it gives an error of 
```
Error: 14 UNAVAILABLE: TCP Write failed

```

And after that all works fine. How can I solve for the first request? Please help

hi Muralisr,   chaincode A is from channel A, and chaincode B is from channel B, do they run in different containers? If chaincode A and chaincode B both are from the same channel, do they run in  one container? Thank you.
</p>

Furthermore, is it possible for a software running on host to steal data in a container ?

@qsmen chaincode A and B will run in one container each across all channels on the peer (so 2 containers total). The channel is part of the context passed to the chaincode and associates/isolates the running code from the ledger (ie, state)
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 01:17:40 GMT):<br/>
You mean one container per channel? so chaincode a and chaincode b run in one container if they are in one channel.  if they are in different channel, they will run in different containers. Thank you.

<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 13:59:45 GMT):<br/>
@tanguyracinet Have you invoked the chaincode yet? It won't build on a peer until the first endorsement.
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:11:29 GMT):<br/>
@ruien when I tried to invoque my initialisation chaincode function (to create test data), it failed. Because the function doesn't exist. My chaincode is not the chaincode being executed. It starts fabcar, the IBM example on the ledger. I have no idea why this is when I specifically installed and instantiated my custom chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:12:48 GMT):<br/>
I do not have any mentions or code samples from fabcar in my development environment so I can only assume fabcar is hardcoded somewhere on one of the fabric images
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:14:21 GMT):<br/>
I am using the basic-network folder from fabric-samples, but I cleaned it out. Only the essential parts remain and my code. But it still installs and instantiate a fabcar chaincode on the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:15:18 GMT):<br/>
It sounds like you might have some old docker containers lying around and/or ledger data. Are you completely clearing out everything before starting your network? Fabcar isn't hard-coded anywhere, because I've never actually even run that sample before.
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:16:23 GMT):<br/>
i do docker system prune between each restart
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:16:33 GMT):<br/>
should I be even more drastic with my cleaning?
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:16:51 GMT):<br/>
the weirdest part for me is that the container takes the name of my chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:16:56 GMT):<br/>
but contains fabcar code inside
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:18:04 GMT):<br/>
I don't keep my ledger data in docker, so I have to clear out the ledger data directory (/var/hyperledger) as well, but if you're cleaning out the data and your 'docker container ls -a' is empty, that's pretty clean. I'm assuming this is a Solo orderer; if you're using Kafka, you have to clean that out too.
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:18:55 GMT):<br/>
I am not dealing with kafka directly, but I have seen mentions of it, not sure if the `basic-network` uses it in the background
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:19:27 GMT):<br/>
and yes, it is a solo orderer
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:20:50 GMT):<br/>
I believe the data is kept in the docker container, because if I don't clean it before restarting, it tells me the customcc-v1.0 already exists
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:21:44 GMT):<br/>
yes, and you should also see that customcc container in your docker container ls', too. But there should be no fabcar there.
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:22:05 GMT):<br/>
If you're seeing fabcar, then I'm not sure what to suggest. Something's running fabcar, but without really knowing what commands are being run it's difficult to speculate. Can you eliminate docker from the equation and just start up the network one command at a time?
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:22:31 GMT):<br/>
I see it, and I also see the dev-peer0.org1.example.com after the instantiate. But when I go looking into the dev-* I see teh fabcar code instead of my chaincode

I just now reset --hard'ed my fabric-samples and checked out release-1.3, and then looked at the basic-network sample. There's nothing in here specific to fabcar, and everything seems very straightforward.
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:30:59 GMT):<br/>

how did you proceed to reset --hard your fabric ?

I don't have such a tutorial -- it took me a week to peel away the layers of complexity and understand what's actually going on. In the end, it's just edit a few yaml files and `./orderer` and `./peer node start`. No docker (on the outside) needed at all -- just one created by the peer for the chaincode and that's all.

I'm not sure what to say. I can't see any possible way you started with the `basic-network` sample and ended up with fabcar.

<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:38:47 GMT):<br/>
I sympathize, I just don't know what to suggest. The docker-compose file isn't storing data outside of the container as far as I can tell (such as mapping a volume from the host for persistence), and so if `docker container ls -a` is empty and `git status ` on the whole `fabric-samples` is clean, then the only last variable seems to be a bug in one of the images itself -- which seems very unlikely.
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:39:21 GMT):<br/>
what `dev-*` are you referring to?

<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:41:03 GMT):<br/>
the docker image that is started by the peer after instantiate. it's named dev-peer0.org1.example.com-customcc-1.0 in my case

oh, you mean the chaincode image docker container. Right.

<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:44:03 GMT):<br/>
I've never tried node chaincode, so maybe there's something strange about the way the path in `peer chaincode install` works
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:44:42 GMT):<br/>
I'm used to saying something like `peer chaincode install -n mycc -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/mycc -v 1.0`
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:45:03 GMT):<br/>
the only difference is -l node
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:45:11 GMT):<br/>
or it should be
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:46:06 GMT):<br/>
No, that's not the only difference. In my example, the path specified with `-p` is a go library path that I know is correct. I'm not sure how the path for the node stuff works -- maybe it's finding the wrong chaincode there?
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:46:55 GMT):<br/>
no, it's finding the package.json. Then it does npm start which is defined in the package as node customcc.js
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:47:39 GMT):<br/>
when I check the logs and install+instantiate, it seems all fine. But in the chaincode container, it has code coming from fabcar, which I cannot understand.
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:48:21 GMT):<br/>
I think I have to give up. Really not sure what to say other than that's weird.
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:49:37 GMT):<br/>
Hmm..
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:49:53 GMT):<br/>
Why are you running `peer channel join` from the peer's container instead of `cli`?
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:50:19 GMT):<br/>
same for `peer channel create`
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:50:34 GMT):<br/>
I doubt these are the problem, but it's odd to me, and who knows
</p>

<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:53:04 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, here's a summary:
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:54:39 GMT):<br/>
I have a custom chaincode using fabric-samples/basic-network.
I can install and instantiate without errors.
When checking the cli, it has code form my custom chaincode.
However, the code on the docker image created after instantiate `dev-peer0.org1...-customcc-1.0` doesn't have my chaincode. It has IBM's example chaincode: fabcar
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:54:39 GMT):<br/>
I have a custom chaincode using fabric-samples/basic-network.
I can install and instantiate without errors.
When checking the cli, it has code from my custom chaincode in the expected folder: `/opt/gopath/src/github.com/customcc`.
However, the code on the docker image created after instantiate `dev-peer0.org1...-customcc-1.0` doesn't have my chaincode. It has IBM's example chaincode: fabcar
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:56:21 GMT):<br/>
tanguyracinet has completely cleared out all docker containers and is running from a fresh `fabric-samples` with the only exception being that he's added a `customcc` nodejs chaincode in fabric-samples/chaincode (which should then be mapped into the`cli` container as a volume), and then starts the network and sets it up according to the paste from earlier. However, after instantiating the chaincode, he sees `fabcar` chaincode docker image instead of `customcc`. The code inside the `cli` container from where `peer chaincode install` has the correct chaincode at the specified install path. This is my understanding. Done.
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:00:55 GMT):<br/>
ok, I am done completely destroying any and all docker images, etc. I am running the boostrap script from fabric-samples to re-download the latest fabric images (v 1.3).
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:01:31 GMT):<br/>
(make sure your `fabric-samples` is on the latest commit on `release-1.3` branch as well)

same problem. 
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:12:28 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:12:34 GMT):<br/>
any ideas @muralisr 
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:12:34 GMT):<br/>
any ideas @muralisr ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:13:10 GMT):<br/>
sorry got distracted..reading now
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:14:48 GMT):<br/>
so you are installing with something like `peer chaincode install -n customcc -v 1.0 -p github.com/customcc`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:15:43 GMT):<br/>
and instantiating with something like `peer chaincode instantiate -n customcc -v 1.0 -C channelname -c '{"Args": "someargs"}'`
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:15:43 GMT):<br/>
yeah, with a -l node. I am using the node SDK
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:15:48 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:16:24 GMT):<br/>
so `peer chaincode install -n customcc -v 1.0 -p opt/gopath/src/github.com/customcc `
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:16:24 GMT):<br/>
so `peer chaincode install -n customcc -v 1.0 -p opt/gopath/src/github.com/customcc -l node`
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:17:16 GMT):<br/>
No, his has an absolute path: `/opt/gopath/src/github.com/customcc`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:17:46 GMT):<br/>
right, didn't mean to leave out the `/`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:18:40 GMT):<br/>
before you do the instantiate `docker images | grep "dev-peer" ` returns empty 
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:18:49 GMT):<br/>
hmmm I think I've had some progress... It seems the peer (or CLI ?) image had a container that was not purged
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:18:49 GMT):<br/>
hmmm I think I've had some progress... It seems the peer (or CLI ?) image had a container/image that was not purged
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:19:16 GMT):<br/>
and the hard reset cleaned that
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:19:22 GMT):<br/>
`docker container ls -a` definitely needs to be _empty_
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:19:31 GMT):<br/>
so one thing to remember
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:19:44 GMT):<br/>
(and this may have nothing to do with your current problem)
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:19:48 GMT):<br/>
the docker container ls -a was empty, but not the docker images
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:20:17 GMT):<br/>
assuming docker images shows `dev-peer0...-customcc-...`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:20:52 GMT):<br/>
(first of all . do you see that ?)
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:21:11 GMT):<br/>
yeah, after the docker system prune, the image dev-peer stil exists
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:21:11 GMT):<br/>
yeah, after the docker system prune, the image dev-peer still exists
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:21:25 GMT):<br/>
so that might have been my problem
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:21:30 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:21:48 GMT):<br/>
that means that between each restart of the ledger, I'll need to remove any dev-* image
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:22:02 GMT):<br/>
if you make changes to the node chaincode, manually remove that image
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:22:43 GMT):<br/>
only if you make chane to the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:23:10 GMT):<br/>
(and redeploy of course)
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:23:21 GMT):<br/>
ok. I'll probably add that in my restart operations to be sure not to forget
</p>
<p><strong>tanguyracinet</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:23:32 GMT):<br/>
Many thanks
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:24:13 GMT):<br/>
more efficient to purge ONLY if you change chaincode and redeploy 
</p>
<p><strong>ruien</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:24:13 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, now that the solution is evident, it reminds me that this has been part of my cleaning script from long ago:
```
    ids=$(docker image ls -a | grep mycc | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
    if ! [[ -z "$ids" ]]; then
        docker image rm $ids
    fi
```

@Rajatsharma those docs relating to building the peer with your SCC are no longer valid. If you are NOT loading your CC as a plugin but want to build it with the peer as of old, the approach would be to have the chaincode implement the "SelfDescribingCC" interface https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.3/core/scc/sysccapi.go#L78 and register an instance of it in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.3/peer/node/start.go#L549

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:30:37 GMT):<br/>
you could follow anyone of the system chaincodes (cscc, lscc etc) there 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:33:09 GMT):<br/>
BUT... better to load your CC as a plugin. That way you don't have to build the peer every time you change your syscc. You _do_ have to build the peer once to enable loading plugins (see https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7710)
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 17:09:35 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=zcGjoEqm8hDhZoFZL) Thanks. I'll try this. I guess I could use this for my case. 
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 17:10:40 GMT):<br/>
Well still do you know any resource for deploying our own System Chaincodes. 
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 17:27:46 GMT):<br/>
Going through these files mentioned, Initially I thought, 
that I had mentioned in the core.yaml file,
chaincode:
  systemPlugins:
    - enabled: true
      name: myscc
      path: /opt/lib/myscc.so
      invokableExternal: true
      invokableCC2CC: true
and even whitelisted the chaincode myscc with the build file present at /opt/lib/myscc.so.
It should have started the chaincode, as other mentioned chaincodes(qscc,lscc) start too.
 
So the only way out is that I'll have to make the changes and build the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 18:32:24 GMT):<br/>
@Rajatsharma you have to build the peer once for enabling loading plugins.. here are the steps 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 18:38:19 GMT):<br/>
```
1. build your scc
cd to/your/scc/dir
go build -buildmode=plugin

this will produce a <my-scc-name>.so

2. build your peer to enable loading GO plugins 
GO_TAGS+=" pluginsenabled" make peer

this needs to be done only once

3. configure peer to use the SCC. For example make the changes in core.yaml
a) enable the scc by adding "my-scc-name: enable" under chaincode:system (you'll see other system ccs enabled here)
b) add a stanza for the plugin under chaincode:systemPlugins
      - enabled: true
        name: my-scc-name
        path: to/your/scc/dir/<my-scc-name>.so
        invokableExternal: true
        invokableCC2CC: true

restart the peer
```
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 18:38:58 GMT):<br/>
that should take care of it...

Hello friends. I am having some issues with chaincode instantiate that I've never experienced before. If anyone has any inside please help.
Context:
Kubernetes deployment with couchdb, peer, dind in the same POD. Using fabric-samples/example_02/go chaincode.

After instantiation, the instantiation is successful, I can see from peer logs Aval and Bval got instantiated and using docker exec dind container, i can see the chaincode container created.

The problem occurs when I try to use peer chaincode list --instantiated -C foo, the chaincode doesn't seem to be instantiated. Using peer chaincode list --installed, I can see the cc got installed.

I checked the couchdb at endpoint/_utils and I only see the foo_ and foo_lscc created but foo_lscc documents are zero.

From other environments when instantiation is correct, foo_lscc would contain 1 document that contains information about the chaincode and the foo_chaincodeid db would get created.

Can someone help me debug and find out why the foo_lscc and foo_chaincodeid isn't being modified? I've tried exec'ing into the cc container and using localhost:5984 to check the connection to the db and its there.

I've set CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS to localhost:7052 and CORE_PEER_CHAINCODEADDRESS to localhost:7052 and to my peer container.

One huge question is, if the database isn't being created in the couchdb, how can the cc use Putstate and Getstate successfully ?

Thank you for your help
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 23:04:04 GMT):<br/>
@httran88 sounds like the instantiation proposal was successful, but the instantiation commit was not. this means you won't be able to invoke the chaincode on the channel. check your peer logs when you instantiate... i suspect the peers either aren't getting the instantiation transaction or it is getting invalidated.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=zyLFEKdXi7dQJKCdu) @muralisr Thanks a lot !!! This really helped, although when I was using make peer-docker, it was throwing warning "In function `pluginOpen': Using 'dlopen". And when I followed the specified method, the peer docker container exited on restarting. Then I used the peer make method,  build the image and container and it worked fine. But I'm still unable to figure out what's the problem with the make peer-docker method.

Hi, I have tried rich query, composite key query,partial composite key query and passing all the necessary arguments. But when I see in the particular peer's container log, it gives an error 'Document Not Found'. However when I query to couchdb through rest calls, it gives document details. So data is going into state but I am unable to query through query methods. Can anyone help with this?

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 12:43:56 GMT):<br/>
@akshay.lawange The query should be same whether via chaincode or via CouchDB REST. Turn on peer debug so that you can see the actual CouchDB queries being made, and then compare that with your REST query that works.  I expect you'll find something different. Sample debug: `CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=info:couchdb=debug peer node start`

Error: endorsement failure during invoke. response: status:500 message:"GET_STATE_BY_RANGE failed: transaction ID: 33bbe785870bf3ee6ca6e97fce28a76f5bed421550d23456ccb5ba595a68455b: version field ~version was not found"

<p><strong>akshay.lawange</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 13:14:20 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  yes. apparently the peer's container log does contain the REST query, i tried the same url with GET which they have used with POST and i got the data but via chaincode somehow i am not getting.

@ShefaliMittal If you are upgrading from v1.0 then as part of the upgrade process you need to drop your CouchDB state database. It will automatically get rebuilt on the first peer start post-upgrade.

`The endorsing peer sends the proposal response back to the client with public data, including a hash of the private data key and value. No private data is sent back to the client. `
We  got this information from the Fabric 1.2 document, under the Private data section
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/private-data/private-data.html

Our requirement is to get  the hash of the private data (key and value) when endorsing peers send back the proposal response back to client.
Kindly let me know this is possible

When chaincode container remains idle for some time then it stops with error:
```

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=6m4TJmpHq5syovYsc) @muralisr I just started looking into this and before I get coding I wanted to confirm something. When a chaincode calls another chaincode, the fact that the original transaction context is preserved let us retrieve the first chaincode's ID from stub.GetSignedProposal(). How do I dynamically retrieve the second (called) chaincode's ID in order to compare with the one on the original transaction context? I suppose this something I would have to set in the call to the second chaincode's Init() function. Is there a better way for me to do this?

@HoneyShah Either you have a network problem or there is a problem with the orderer itself, you might want to as on #fabric-orderer as well as get debug logs from the orderer itself. If it's a network problem then that tends to be environmental and unique to your setup so you would need to look into how to investigate these types of problems

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=q5LP2jJm7Ngq7zM8q) @ShefaliMittal Did you by chance upgrade from v1.0?  It's saying that the version field that Fabric writes to the document is not there.  This would be true if you upgraded from v1.0. You can drop the state database (delete data from /opt/couchdb/data) and restart peer to rebuild state database with correct format.  Note that this has nothing to do with an index... an index is used for JSON queries, not range queries.

I am trying to integrate pagination using node js but I am stuck with point. When I iterate through data I am getting value in the form of:
```
ByteBuffer {
  buffer: <Buffer 0a 96 02 0a 93 02 0a 08 65 70 72 6f 63 75 72 65 12 24 36 30 64 65 61 34 30 30 2d 32 66 32 65 2d 34 35 38 38 2d 62 34 34 33 2d 3263 33 63 36 63 65 32 ... >,
  offset: 57,
  markedOffset: -1,
  limit: 281,
  littleEndian: true,
  noAssert: false }

```

How can I get back into string? Anyone has done this?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=EkGQXvLBbN8Y4tEgT) @HoneyShah afaik there is no "count" feature.  You will have to return all the results and then interrogate the returned object to find the count.  You can use `getStateByRange()` or `getQueryResult()` - both of which will return an iterator object. https://fabric-shim.github.io/release-1.3/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html#getQueryResult

Hi all
how to read chaincode logs?
I've set up logging in a chaincode like this `var logger = shim.NewLogger("example_cc")`, set log level `	logger.SetLevel(shim.LogInfo)` 
and log messages in `Init` and `Invoke` functions like this `logger.Warning("init func: received apiKey=%v", apiKey)`

also, peer config has this env variable:
`CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO` 
when I do `docker logs <chaincode_container_id>` I receive empty output

<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 06:41:29 GMT):<br/>
@Naveen4091 I guess you need to expose respective getter/setter functions and, if you want to restrict access to the other chaincode, you would like to check the identity of the callee

Is it possible to access chaincode events from within the chaincode? And maybe even to filter it by payload?
</p>
<p><strong>Naveen4091</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:29:32 GMT):<br/>
@haggis Thank you for the response. I suspect that you might have confused with my question. I am creating an asset in one chain code and trying to access that asset using another chain code. My objective is the user of first chain code is from one org and the chain code2 user is from different org. I am trying to test the buyer and seller analogy. The Seller will raise the invoice and buyer will approve. However  the chain code2 is not able to access asset created by chain code1.
</p>
<p><strong>Naveen4091</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:29:54 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:45:54 GMT):<br/>
@Naveen4091 That's intentional. To do this you would need to have a getter function at the CC which holds the data. There's no shared data between different chaincodes afaik
</p>
<p><strong>haggis</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 10:49:44 GMT):<br/>
I've got *two questions*:
1) Is it possible to access chaincode events from within the chaincode (and maybe even to filter it by payload)?
2) Should (node) chaincode always return a Buffer? If yes, why? Just asking because that's what is done in examples.

Hi,

I am working on a simple asset tokenization chaincode on v1.3. I am using first-network setup from fabric-samples where I have 2 orgs – Org1 and Org2. I have defined one collection per organization for 2 different users. 
User Alice belongs to Org1 and has collection with name “Alice”. User Bob belongs to Org2 and has collection with name “Bob”. I have configured a collection_json with respective organization accordingly.  

I have a very simple chaincode where it issues an asset/token with asset name, qty, owner. I can issue an asset for Alice and Bob and query them. 

For asset transfer between Alice and Bob, I am written a transfer Function. Let’s say Alice (Org1) is transferring her asset to Bob (Org2). 
In function, I retrieve a Alice asset using GetPrivateData and “Allice” collection and change owner to Bob and PutPrivateData using “Bob” collection. I also do DelPrivateData on “Alice” collection. 
The transaction proposal is invoked by Alice using Org1 peer0. In this case, transfer doesn’t work and Alice’s asset remains with Alice.

I think the reason is because Org1 doesn’t have an access to Bob’s collection from Org2. Is this correct? If yes, what is the solution for such a usecase. 
Do we always need third-party Org3 which is part of both “Alice” and “Bob” collections and that invokes this transfer transaction from its own node?

Can someone pls help me clarify this. Thanks.

Hrishi

@nhrishi Org1 peer can indeed write to a Org2 collection, to support these types of scenarios. Some people don't want this ability and therefore there is plan to add a collection config option to control this behavior, but in current releases it is supported out of the box. What is the error that you get?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 17:14:29 GMT):<br/>
Note that you will Org1 peer will send the private data to Org2 peer via gossip at endorsement time, based on collection config settings, so it is critical that gossip is configured correctly (which should be the case in first-network)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=k55HnZyErgxGz6XNX) I tried with passing 2 endorsing peers (one for org1 and other for org2) and it worked. For private data, do we need to pass all the org's peer that are involved in the private data transaction. With public transaction, I always used to only pass one peer of submitter organization. Could you please confirm this. Thanks.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 03 Dec 2018 03:34:27 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi You just need to satisfy the endorsement policy that is set at chaincode instantiation time.  If the endorsement policy is one org, then you need to submit to one org. If the endorsement policy is for two orgs, then you need to submit to two orgs.  The peers will automatically distribute the private data to the other orgs peers that are members of the private data collection.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=uePYaw64XoSAzi9qz) @dave.enyeart Okay got it. Last question - so policy is in the collection is only for distribution. Policy passed using -p on chaincode instantiate command is taken as a endorsement policy. When we implement key level endorsement policy inside the chaincode, it would override the chaincode instantiate command level endorsement policy.  Is this understanding correct?  And in key level endorsement case, we need to make sure to pass all required peers in the invoke transaction depending on all policies set in the chaincode ?

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 03 Dec 2018 06:21:43 GMT):<br/>
@HarshiChandraSekar No, different endorsing peers will be adding to ledger in parallel, you don't want collisions by having them read from a sequence. You're better off using an id from a source system or using a UUID.

I found these lines in configtx.yaml of basic-network. What does batch and message mean here? Do they mean block and transaction?

# Batch Timeout: The amount of time to wait before creating a batch
BatchTimeout: 2s

# Batch Size: Controls the number of messages batched into a block
BatchSize:

# Max Message Count: The maximum number of messages to permit in a batch
MaxMessageCount: 10

# Absolute Max Bytes: The absolute maximum number of bytes allowed for
# the serialized messages in a batch.
AbsoluteMaxBytes: 99 MB

# Preferred Max Bytes: The preferred maximum number of bytes allowed for
# the serialized messages in a batch. A message larger than the preferred
# max bytes will result in a batch larger than preferred max bytes.
PreferredMaxBytes: 512 KB

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 14:02:32 GMT):<br/>
@ShefaliMittal - @haggis and @AndresMartinezMelgar.itcl  are correct, there is no mechanism to 'schedule' a transaction from within the chaincode, nor should that logic live there. an external application should be notified of the commitment of the first transaction and then schedule the next transaction for timestamp + 5 hrs.

Hi,
We are using first-network (two-org) configuration for 1.3 version. Its the same sample configuration, but the only difference is we have installed 2 chaincodes on the same channel, among which one invokes the another.
We are using private data for invocation, so we have provided with same collection names to both the chaincodes. While starting the network log shows as it instantiated the 
chaincodes but when we invoke through cli it gives an error for each peer's instantiation as below on cli log.

``Error: error getting endorser client for invoke: endorser client failed to connect to peer0.org2.example.com:7051: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded``

Also in peer container log, it shows "ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE" although policies are correct. Can anyone please help with this? Thanks.

While specifying endorsement policy, MSPID.Member/MSPID.Admin , how peer decides to endorse the transaction as Member or Admin? Can there be a case where a peer ( Peer0 part of Org1) is not an admin, but endorsement policy requires it (Org1.Admin).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=fqdNbeaQ4EQWFqyTx) @haggis Yes clients can parse the transaction in the events and do any filtering they like. Ask any follow-up questions in the #fabric-sdk-* channel depending on which sdk you use.

first one is role

`cert.Subject.OrganizationalUnit[0]` always will be role, right?

As in one of the JIRA issues explained, this occurs due to the fact that the chaincode has been instantiated and verified (via list instantiated chaincodes) on the org1 peer but it doesn't verify that the org2 peer has received the updated LSCC info. However once the chaincode is instantiated container list does contain containers for both organisations. Should we edit the system chaincode for this as they have explained in the solution on JIRA. This is the link the for the JIRA issue - *https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10578*

Hello guys, do you know how to implement key-level endorsement policy. I couldn't find any samples using SetPrivateDataValidationParameter(collection, key string, ep []byte) function.

Suppose there are two peers I want one one peer to setup the some rules then the second peer has to initialize the data , but while initializing it has to check and satisfy the rules created by another peer …. Where should I write this thing?

Hello!

Can someone give advice with testing chaincodes?

I have a main "chaincode_A". It calls the other 5 chaincodes. I'm trying to write "chaincode_A_test", which mocks all 6 chaincodes, and executes some scripts with them.
Actually the problem is that all 6 chaincodes are in different "main package", but I need to import them all into "chaincode_A_test".

How best to solve this problem? Can I just rename all the "main package"? Are there any best practices? Or maybe someone has a repository with a similar solution?

@MuhammedHafil if you are only storing a document identifier in the ledger its better to have it passed in by the client application

@hyperlearner to my knowledge, no. there might be a different way of interacting with the history db but it is not readily available in the docs

In Fabric Sample, Balance Transfer, We register user using node sdk and then we create channel, join, install,instantiate,invoke chaincode using the same user's token. How Every user has all these accesses? Is Every user by default admin? How can we prevent this?

@VarunVerma do you mean 'how can I specify [nested] field from array in your selector'? the links I sent previously do exactly that. Also I believe (given the structure you posted) you want to query `marbleStore` for color, rather than `storeName` (on the basis of querying by color in the `Marbles` array) - nested examples also shown [here](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.2.0/api/database/find.html#find-selectors)

@mallikarjunasai995 use an array to store the state? the setOwner function would have to change to something like ```setOwner(newOwner) {
        let existOwner = [];
        if (! this.isIssued()) {
            existOwner = this.getOwner();
        }
        this.owner = existOwner;
        this.owner.push(newOwner);
    }``` in paper.js etc - but you would need to review the code, eg. currently the transaction functions in that sample are decorated for String not Array etc FYI)

@mallikarjunasai995 you have to understand what your use case is: you can store the agreement number(s) in the 'assets based on that agreement' - and able to reference that agreement as and when. Sorry, I don't know your use case, some of which is dual or multi-stage approval, some is referential update and some is state change :-)

Hi Experts,
I have been using hyperledger fabric with nodejs SDK from past many months now and i haven't faced any big issues but from last week some containers of my network infrastructure kept shutting down  which some how i recovered but but i am not able to start the chaincode containers which were automatically generated after installing and instantiating the chaincode. it keep on shuttiing down. and now it says 

"x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "x509: ECDSA verification failure" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "serial:71333524560576167915191865139975345404"

@NeerajKumar are you trying to manually start the chaincode containers? there's no need. once the peers are back up, execute a transaction against the system. the peer will restart the chaincode container. if theres an issue with the actual peer container coming back up, #fabric-peer-endorser-committer will be the better resource

</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 13 Dec 2018 20:06:30 GMT):<br/>
@alejandrolr have not done this myself, so i am just speculating. but the cid library just checks specific parts of the cert that signed the transaction proposal, so you should be able to use [MockInvokeWithSignedProposal](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.3/core/chaincode/shim/mockstub.go#L149). from there you just have to figure out how to go about generating certs with the attributes you want. should be possible since theyre just x509 certs.

@zimabry when you say invoke another transaction do you mean the entire transaction or just the state change associated with it? it's perfectly feasible for a function to trigger another that also contains `PutState`, but if you want a full transaction (signed by a specific cert, specific arguments, specific transaction id in the ledger) you should handle this logic outside of the chaincode and in your application

@zimabry another full transaction or just state changes associated with it? if you just want the associated state changes, its perfectly feasible for one function to call another that contains multiple `PutState` calls. but if you want the full transaction (signed by specific certs, has specific args, has specific transaction id, satisfies specific endorsement policy...all the txn bells and whistles) you should handle this logic outside of the chaincode and in the application itself.
</p>
<p><strong>zimabry</strong> (Thu, 13 Dec 2018 20:22:24 GMT):<br/>
Okay thank you @jrosmith we will have to handle it in middleware itself

Using 'https://godoc.org/github.com/jiangzhx/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#ChaincodeStub.InvokeChaincode` can't we invoke a chaincode on any other channel ??

@Rajatsharma if i recall correctly cross channel invokes are not permitted. they may be read only. you can only invoke chaincode to chaincode if the chaincodes are installed/instantiated on the same channel
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:57:54 GMT):<br/>
looked at the [source code](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.3/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L66), the above is correct.

With a local instance running quite well we are really starting heavy chaincode development. Would this be the best channel for questions relating to a few of the Stub calls? Specifically, the docs say getQueryResult shouldn't be used to read state in a tx that will write state. Um, okay so they what *should* we use to read state?  I'm coming from Ethereum, EOS, where validation of blocks is handled differently.

For reference, Stub.getQueryResults docs state ---- The query is NOT re-executed during validation phase, phantom reads are not detected. That is, other committed transactions may have added, updated, or removed keys that impact the result set, and this would not be detected at validation/commit time. Applications susceptible to this should therefore not use GetQueryResult as part of transactions that update ledger, and should limit use to read-only chaincode operations

@alejandrolr this is likely not what you are looking for exactly.... just a

 https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/chaincode/go/enccc_example/enccc_example.go uses the `ext` library just as you use the `cid` library. The https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/chaincode/go/enccc_example/enccc_test.go UT might give you some pointers as to how to go about your UT

Has anyone tried making a channel from within a chaincode ?? Is it possible ??
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 19:47:55 GMT):<br/>
@Rajatsharma theoretically i don't see why not, but you would need to import an sdk and configure it properly in order to do so. if that is not enough reason to deter you, it is fundamentally an anti-pattern. chaincode must be deterministic as it  gets executed on multiple peers. if you try to create a channel from within the chaincode, multiple peers will attempt to create the same channel. the first may succeed, but the others will fail, causing the entire transaction to fail unless your endorsement policy only requires one valid proposal from one organization (which is also an anti-pattern). 

logic for creating a channel should be handled at the application level

@KvdB if you change the chaincode but deploy it with the same name, you should delete the chaincode docker image created by fabric manually

Hello, can I implement a feature such that when a contract asset's status is changed to "approved", other peer updates their own account balance? I'm using private data so the peer that changes the status to "approved" cannot change my balance. Hope I could explain well.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 13:34:28 GMT):<br/>
@halilkalkan chaincode logic can have a mix of private and public data, you should be able to meet both your objectives in one chaincode function.

@Rajatsharma typically you would run the join from `cli` image and change the env vars to point to different peers with appropriate IDs

hi experts here,  in "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim,   invokechaincode can be used to invoke some function from other chaincode. My question is  whether invokechaincode can run a piece of code that is not from other chaincode, but is a input parameter.  I think the answer is no.   I am wondering: add an api such that the api can run a piece of code whichi is a parameter to current chaincode.

Hello

I'm having trouble creating the ClientIdentity object in my chaincode. I'm getting a JSON.parse error in the constructor.
This is what the object looks like:

{ keyUsage: 'Digital Signature',
basicConstraints: 'CA:FALSE',
subjectKeyIdentifier: '8B:98:45:88:4B:61:C7:E4:72:16:5E:45:AD:C1:6D:1A:A1:2A:1E:E3',

See the weird question marks right before the start of the JSON object... I don't know what causes this, anyone any idea?

@Memo99 assuming you are deploying a GO chaincode ...  if your chaincode is `/a/b/c/src/e/f/g/mycc/<chaincode files>` , your GOPATH is `/a/b/c` the `-p` param would be `e/f/g/mycc` ... in general the -p param for go chaincodes would be relative to GOPATH

Please answer me

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 21:15:19 GMT):<br/>
@mattmaru by definition whatever asset you have does not reside on a specific peer. using private collections you can ensure that the asset resides on a specific subset of peers, but if your usecase requires one node to have the data you may want to reconsider the usecase.

@johnlohith could I ask what the scenario you where working with at the itme?
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 10:39:21 GMT):<br/>
I would expect that if in the chaincode, adding the x509 library explicitly at a fixed level should workaround the issues  `npm install --save x509@0.3.3`   The shim's package.json references ^0.3.2, so if you specifically add in the 0.3.3 version NPM should be happy
</p>
<p><strong>johnlohith</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:25:09 GMT):<br/>
The issue popped up yesterday on chaincode that was working fine previously
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:52:42 GMT):<br/>
@johnlohith node and npm provide the concept of a shrinkwrap which locks down the exact npm modules to use. This protects against module changes that (although are supposed to be backward compatible and not introduce bugs) may affect the final application. I haven't tried but I would hope that fabric when it builds the node chaincode image would honour a supplied shrinkwrap file.
</p>
<p><strong>johnlohith</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:53:52 GMT):<br/>
I just tried adding the 0.3.3 version of x509 and the issue is resolved
</p>
<p><strong>johnlohith</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:55:24 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the info @mbwhite  and @davidkel 
</p>
<p><strong>johnlohith</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:56:19 GMT):<br/>
Simply adding it to your chaincode's package.json file overrides fabric-shim's package.json file
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 12:34:19 GMT):<br/>

@qsmen what is the usecase ? All endorsers would have to execute the same code (so it cannot be peer/org specific in general). If all you are looking for is late binding plugins as defined here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L321 might be an option.

@muralisr @chuda range queries use a lexicographic order, not numeric order, so this looks correct

if you want numeric order, you can zero pad or do some other order preserving encoding for your keys

I am using Basic network with my changed organizations "user" and "legaldocxauth" and fabcar chaincode to run with it (later i will change chaincode functions according to my use case) but whenever i run startFabric.sh on instantiating chaincode it gives error "failed to deserialize creator identity, err usermsp msp is unknown"

Docker version latest 18.09.0

I have changed other network files configtx , docker-compose yaml and crypto configtx Msps accordingly

I have also tried other solutions(on stackoverflow) of similar problem but no luck :(

binding is explained [here](https://github.com/yacovm/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L323). As for Decorations, a peer may add additional input to the chaincode input via custom endorsement handlers. You need to specify a plugin file in the [core.yaml](https://github.com/yacovm/fabric/blob/release-1.4/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L359) section that implements a [decorator](https://github.com/yacovm/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/handlers/decoration/decoration.go#L14-L16).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=ziARQnx4DGXZRqxsh) @yacovm Thanks, yacov, but I am still not sure what information inside the []byte got from `GetBinding()` and how to use them. Is there an sample or integration test covering it?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 23 Dec 2018 18:39:37 GMT):<br/>
it's just hash over nonce || creator || epoch
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 23 Dec 2018 18:39:46 GMT):<br/>
and i don't think epoch is used anywhere currently...
</p>
<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Mon, 24 Dec 2018 04:09:14 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Ooh I see, I guess nonce is related to transaction id randomness, creator is what we can get from getCreator and feed into client identity library. Emm, is epoch related to txTime? Is my guessing correct?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 24 Dec 2018 07:29:04 GMT):<br/>
yeah sort of

While I can get the network up and install the default chaincode onto the peers, I cannot switch the default with our custom chaincode that uses the Go extensions in the vendor folder (I think it uses fabric v1.3). Does anyone have any sources for deploying Fabric 1.3 onto AWS with a custom chaincode using Go extensions?

Hello! I'm trying to add 'affiliations' to a user's certificate at the time of registering him. I'm running fabcar network and adding affiliation: 'org1.department1' in the object in fabric_ca_client.register() function.
But after successfully registering & enrolling the user, when I see the user's certificate I find the affiliation's value to be empty.
Another question, how can I add attributes while registering or enrolling the user? I tried to run the script by adding attrs: [{"email": "testemail.com"}] in the register function. I tried to add it in enroll function as well. But it's not working. Could anyone show how it's done.

Hey guys, I currently have a problem when invoking a chaincode that is installed in multiple hosts.
If I call the host where the chaincode was instantiated, everything works fine, but if I call any other host where the chaincode was installed but not instantiated, I get an error like this: "failed to execute transaction d4957f13633f908ed9c78c200bcd706b53d6b8d2c644cf210f2bda1b150e3819: [channel channel] failed to get chaincode container info for chaincodename:1.1: could not get chaincode code: chaincode fingerprint mismatch: data mismatch"

This is the order I am installing and instantiating the chaincode:
1. Install in host 1
2. Install in host 2
3. Instantiate in host 1

The chaincode should be instantiated only once, right?

I read this doc (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4noah.html) and I think I know what is wrong: Every host has its own copy of the chaincode code in node. This doc says something about packaging the code before installing it... Is this the problem? If so, how I am suposed to do it? I didn't find the doc clear enough.

(1) assume you are using node SDK... ?  (2)  do you see errors on the peer ?(3) did it work before `after editing configtx.yaml` ? (4) does it work if you undo the change ? (5) what change did you make to configtx.yaml  .... ?

@DeepaMotwani - the problem is that your chaincode container cannot connect to "registry.npmjs.org:443" when it is being created - perhaps you are behind a proxy, or on some private network.  If you use an `npmrc` file for other nodejs development work you need to specify this for your chaincode container - I _think_  you need to put the npmrc file in the root folder of your chaincode package, but you may need to experiment with the location of the file.

Hello, 
If i wanted to reset some values on my assets, or perform calculations every 5 minutes, how can it be done? Should I send a transaction that orders such reset/calculations or is there some other way to make a certain action performed every 5 minutes ?

I am developing a chaincode. Having trouble during debugging.  Written a script to automate bring the network up and install the code everytime. Though I clean the previous chaincode containers , the changes are not reflected until I clean the images. Anyone had this issue ?

<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 11:28:35 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=smA2RLWjbcSCd9GZ9) @javapriyan I have seen problems with 'old' containers and images - and also seen problems with old docker volumes that were not removed/pruned.
If you are doing lots of cycles of debugging and testing and re-writing, have you seen the feature to start a peer in dev mode so that you don't get a new image/container for each iteration? `--peer-chaincodedev=true` ?
There is also the IBM VSCode extansion which lets you run Smart Contracts (chaincodes) in Debug mode in VSCode.

@MikeT16 I don't lknow of a turorial but the mechanics should be identical ... just as you would start the go executable with the right env vars, start the java chaincide with the same env vars

Hello guys. Can anyone help me ? I would to build a REST service to use my chaincode. How can i do? I wrote my chaincode with GO

 

</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 17:12:45 GMT):<br/>
@mattmaru you can use the Fabric SDKs (available for Node.js, Java, and Go) to write a REST server that interacts with your deployed chaincode. see https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html for a Node.js example (fabcar)
</p>
<p><strong>Taffies</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 03:14:33 GMT):<br/>
Hi, is there a direct way in the chaincode to return the number of query results together with the results themselves?
</p>
<p><strong>Taffies</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 03:16:25 GMT):<br/>
Else, what would be the best way to go around doing so?

@Taffies  so in this example](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/chaincode/marbles02/node/marbles_chaincode.js#L343) the results array can be found with `resultsArray.length` ?

As the type of the transaction-functions in an extended Contract class (node.js with typescript) are of type string, does it make sense to JSON.stringify an object in the client to hand it over?
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 17:19:50 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=xAzrszMWzRt932YBp) @AVetter yes - all parameters from a Client SDK app must be passed as Strings to SmartContract (chaincode) functions.
</p>
<p><strong>rsoeldner</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 19:11:40 GMT):<br/>
Just to make sure I understood correct, It is possible to invoke a chaincode fuction with just User credentials WITHOUT instantiating/ ... in the client side, right ?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 19:14:09 GMT):<br/>
@rsoeldner Chaincode must be instantiated first before you can invoke any of it's functions
</p>
<p><strong>rsoeldner</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 19:14:57 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel yes but a Client, just using the peer command, do I need to run it on every node talking to the network ?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 19:20:57 GMT):<br/>
@rsoeldner chaincode instantiation is channel wide, not a specific act for each individual peer
</p>
<p><strong>rsoeldner</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 19:21:12 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 19:22:06 GMT):<br/>
But for each endorsing peer you have on that channel, it will need to have the chaincode package installed onto it

When creating a composite key with for example version~key, how can I query on this exact combination? Can I achieve this with 'getStateByPartialCompositeKey' ?
</p>

<p><strong>WouterVanHecke</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 12:25:22 GMT):<br/>
Composite key question.

Trying to create a composite key as follows:
v1~ObjectId
v2~ObjectId
v3~ObjectId

With 3 times the same ObjectId.

Creating this works I guess, the normal object is saved on the ledger, together with a seperate object with the composite key and an empty buffer.

I want to query on the id and get all the versions, but when i tr to do this, I get an empty iterator:

```
export const queryWithCompositeKey = async (stub, id) => {
  const iterator = await stub.getStateByPartialCompositeKey(`version~id`, [id]);

  return compositeKeyIterator(stub, iterator);
};
```

Can someone show me what exactly I'm doing wrong and how to fix this?

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 18:49:05 GMT):<br/>
@raviranjan14 In current releases you would have to upgrade the chaincode to add a new organization to a collection
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 18:50:13 GMT):<br/>
@david-lsq SDK has API to retrieve deployed chaincodes, and has API to retrieve collection definition per chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 18:51:25 GMT):<br/>
Note that there are plans to implement dynamic collection in the future where you don't have to statically define the collections, that will help with both of your questions
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 18:57:40 GMT):<br/>
@bandreghetti if I were to guess, I think this is due to request having timed out and releasing the request context.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=G6rHzPSigKovTuGzm) @muralisr I was actually trying to do this dynamically, like building a script to add a peer in a existing Fabric network or add a new organization with peers to the network or update a channel with a new organization but was facing minor issues like older peer goes down while creating a new one. I'm figuring out some stuff but just wanted to know if there's any resource other than `eyfn.sh` that I could refer to.  Because for most of the issues and work I'm referring to the documentation like `https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/examples/configtxupdate`, `https://medium.com/@wahabjawed/extending-hyperledger-fabric-network-adding-a-new-peer-4f52f70a7217` So I was just asking if there's any suggestion for a source I could refer too.
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 19:41:06 GMT):<br/>
Most of the work is being done using `cryptogen extends ` and  `configtxlator`. But I could not find a very good resource and even for any problem, it's a bit difficult to resolve them. So that's why was just asking over this. Because it's working fine over my network, but as I wanted to make it purely dynamic then I face some issues.  
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 19:45:18 GMT):<br/>
And moreover, even If I'm able to do it. I was not able to understand that part fully. Like `cryptogen` generates certificates for all the entities in the starting but how is it able to work on a currently spawned network. How is that part really working seems to be a bit unclear.

@ashuu-gupta  couple of things come to mind: is your field defined as `Status` or .. `status` ? You refer to the marbles GO example: you should easily be able to paste in these functions (lines 541-580) from https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/chaincode/marbles02/go/marbles_chaincode.go#L541 and test your querystring (as these functions work :-) )  : if you still get no results, you need to check the data match (view in CouchDB?) vs what your query is trying to find. HTH.

@ashuu-gupta not really sure (you're trying to replicate something that works in marbles sample etc), but possibly how you're escaping (from reading other threads) - have you tried `queryString := fmt.Sprintf("{\"selector\":{\"Status\":\"PO_REJECTED\"}}")` - you should look at the CouchDB and chaincode / peer container logs in docker for more information on the issue

when using the chaincode-docker-devmode folder from fabric-samples, do you guys have to keep go getting the shim and protos package from golang everytime you kill docker and summon docker compose up again? should i be just keeping my docker images up all the time and can I install multiple chaincode versions on machines that are already running?
</p>
<p><strong>millengustavo</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 13:27:15 GMT):<br/>
I guess I should be using the "peer chaincode upgrade" command, right?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=FdyhywdZCWxsCuB2J) @millengustavo yes, keep containers running - probably best to look at the docs https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/peer-chaincode-devmode.html for an example of what you want to achieve in dev mode.

<p><strong>millengustavo</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 14:29:40 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=jLZfqfG6pkofAiHgj) @mahoney1 the Docs don't say much about what to do when making changes to the code, by reading it you is lead to believe that you should start from scratch at each step since peer chaincode upgrade is not covered there

<p><strong>AVetter</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 09:16:30 GMT):<br/>
Is there a way to encrypt data via chaincode, but let only endorse the transaction by organisations who have access to the key? (As not every organisation should be able to read and therefore endorse the transaction)
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=9nArTZ5QFCFuqXgPX) If I understand it right it is possible to do this with the discovery service. By creating a collection with all peers that should have access and stating it in the "endorsement_hint" in the request for the transaction proposal (https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.4/tutorial-discovery.html)
Can anyone confirm this assumption?

Hi guys, I'm using chaincode-docker-devmode folder for testing my chaincode quickly. I tried to implement the stub.GetHistoryForKey() function to get the timestamp and other history info about my assets, but the program is returning only the current state for the asset (like a query for getting the asset does). After researching about it I find that According the documentation, I should set core.ledger.history.enableHistoryDatabase to true. But now I don't have core.yaml file, where I should set core.ledger.history.enableHistoryDatabase?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 16:36:58 GMT):<br/>
@millengustavo It is true by default.  In fact if your call to GetHistoryForKey() returned successfully, it means it is set to true in your environment
</p>
<p><strong>millengustavo</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 16:41:11 GMT):<br/>
I implemented my function exactly like the marbles example, but the response I get from calling the function does not contain any timestamp info or other stuff, how can I get that?

But I am not sure how to implement Listener at Peer0.Org1 which will listen to the  Chaincode events raised at Peer0.Org2. I am using hyperledger fabric v1.2
Can anyone please help me.

I am implementing **Attribute based Access Control. 
While registering user, I have specified attributes like `fabric_ca_client.register({ enrollmentID: username, affiliation: 'org1.department1', role:'client' , attrs: [{ name: 'firstName', value: 'Mathan_sir', ecert: true }]}, admin_user);`
Also specified same attribute while enrolling user like `fabric_ca_client.enroll({ enrollmentID: username, enrollmentSecret: secret, attr_reqs: [{ name: "firstName", optional: false } });`
So when I tries to call chaincode function, I am not able to use these attrs which i set during user registration. Before calling chaincode function, we are verifying user first and then calling *getUserContext * function which validated user. 
In above scenario, I will set different attributes for different level of user and whenever they want to interact with chaincode, using their set attributes, I will restrict their access. Currently I am not able to get these attributes. How could I get these attributes user wise? Could anybody help me on this line? Any help would be appreciated.

</p>
<p><strong>Bentipe</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 15:18:54 GMT):<br/>
good, question, just guessing here, but it might be because of transpaency, it is supposed to be transparent the code for everibody so if you install the binaries or the jar right away this can not be audited by other peers

 Hi, i have a serious issue with Identity management at the chain code level, i am building an app where people can upload their education and work exeperience documents and the educational institutes and previous companies can approve it, i have this issue in doing so:

Person is a universal participant, he is not dependent on any organization, i want to give him a universal identity irrespective of organizations and msps, because he can use any organization just to connect to the network as he does not maintain any peer. Now since i am not relying on the MSP credentials inside the chaincode, how can i validate that it is the same person who has invoked a function. For example in Etherum, we can just use msg.sender as this is the user's Ethereum address and this is a universal identity.
There is no import private key function in fabric-ca-client node sdk, how can a Person import his old private key when he switches organizations or uses a peer from a different organization?

Please help me in understanding how to implement universal identity for participants and authentication at the chaincode level
I am an experienced developer with Ethereum, this is my first project on Hyperledger Fabric, if somebody can help with this, it would be awesome
i can teach Ethereum in return

@naqvijafar91 replying with the same answer and a bit more detail here as well in case someone else has more input. Using [GetBinding](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L319) you can bind a fabric transaction context to an external transaction context. if the users are irrespective of org, perhaps you could have an application layer in front of fabric that handles user authentication and binds this context to whichever fabric organization is processing the transaction. with this setup all of the fabric organization would need access to a global end user store

I am pretty sure you can install only 1 chaincode on 1 channel, however you can have a Peer being part of multiple channels and therefore multiple chaincodes

@yacovm have you had a situation where one chaincode is duplicated? So the couchdb and functions for chaincode A are exactly the same for chaincode B when chaincode B should have a different db collection and different functions
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:22:53 GMT):<br/>
just give it a different name
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:23:02 GMT):<br/>
install it twice under different names 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:23:04 GMT):<br/>
and instantiate it again
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:23:23 GMT):<br/>
you'll have the same chaincode code, but in 2 different namespaces
</p>
<p><strong>tommyjay</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:30:09 GMT):<br/>
so `peer chaincode install ...` twice and `peer chaincode instantiate...` once? @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:33:46 GMT):<br/>
instantiate twice
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:34:02 GMT):<br/>
you need to install twice to make 2 chaincodes with the same content, but different name
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:34:10 GMT):<br/>
then, you instantiate each on the *same* channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:34:27 GMT):<br/>
the result would be that you have 2 chaincodes that are of the same logic
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:34:32 GMT):<br/>
i.e - same business rules
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:34:38 GMT):<br/>
*but* they write to different namespace
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:34:38 GMT):<br/>
*but* they write to different namespaces
</p>
<p><strong>tommyjay</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:35:21 GMT):<br/>
but in my case, the two chaincodes are different business logic. for example, chaincode A handles token transfer and chaincode B stores meta data about the transaction
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:36:34 GMT):<br/>
you said one chaincode is duplicated
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:36:38 GMT):<br/>
doesn't seem like it's the case
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:36:48 GMT):<br/>
please clearly explain what you're trying to do...
</p>
<p><strong>tommyjay</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:40:51 GMT):<br/>
yeah i have two CCs with different biz logic. for some reason one chaincode is installed twice under different names. so even though the chaincodeId is different, the functions and couchdb collection are exactly the same
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:42:22 GMT):<br/>
all right, and...?
</p>
<p><strong>tommyjay</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:46:47 GMT):<br/>
i'm trying to fix that. they are meant to be separate chaincodes. imagine two ethereum smart contracts. A does something and passes the data to B.  i want to do the same thing but the functions in the installed contract B are the ones in contract A. even the couchdb collection for contract B has the data that's meant to be in contract A.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:48:33 GMT):<br/>
how are you trying to fix? what is the desired layout?

@jrosmith thanks again for the info, i already thought of the solution as putting all the Persons behind a single Organization, and the user authentication can be implemented within an application for that organization, but what will happen if that organization shuts down after lets say 10 years, in that case the data of all the persons would be on fabric, but since authentication for individual persons was inside a centralized database, it is gone. 
</p>
<p><strong>naqvijafar91</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 06:35:53 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith in short, to summarize this problem, i want to implement a user authentication at the chaincode level irrespective of organizations, a user can obtain a certificate from any organization on the network but still has a unique id which could be confirmed by the user's private key, similar to what happens in Etherum:

the user would have to keep his private key with him securely, whenever he imports the key into any organization's application, his public key is generated and he gets a certificate from the organization's CA
then inside the chaincode , i derive the user's public key from the certificate and use it as the user id

Would that be the correct implementation?

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 14:00:37 GMT):<br/>
@naqvijafar91 thats a good question. you can absolutely retrieve the public key from the cert in the chaincode, you can also do offline signing (end user is in control of the private key) with #fabric-sdk-node , but i don't think you can have a end user freely register with any organization and have the same private key as a signing identity. based on my understanding of the problem now, i think this is more about user management than it is about chaincode. #fabric-ca will be able to help you determine if your usecase is feasible with fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 14:01:57 GMT):<br/>
@WouterVanHecke please post the logs of the peer during restart and the description of your problem to #fabric-peer-endorser-committer , the issue is most likely with the peer container and not with the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 14:03:50 GMT):<br/>
@AkhilKura please do not spam multiple channels with the same question. your question is not relevant to chaincode development and does not belong here.

Hello guys. Is there any way to register a new user with the CA (issue certificate and private key) using the SDK?
What I'm thinking is a way to create all the mechanisms to enroll a new user with the fabric, using my application withou the need to "someone" generate and send the certificate and private key to user manualy. Maybe I'm missing something in the documentation, but I didn't figured out how I can do this.
Thanks in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>dan13</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 17:33:08 GMT):<br/>
@PMoura I think you are talking about the enrollment process -- enroll using username + secret and that gets you the Enrollment object back with the certs and keys. If java, I found this useful for some direction: https://github.com/vishal3152/HyperledgerFabric-Java-Client. Probably also better Q for #fabric-sdk-java or #fabric-sdk-node depending on what you are using

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=pqSfuCcgTrXA2dWk5) @tahaf10 The Contract interface / Class is a high level contract API (rather than having to make do with the lower level chaincode interface) for application developers to implement Smart Contracts using business logic, including methods for greater control, eg what gets executed before / after a given transaction. See https://fabric-shim.github.io/release-1.4/fabric-contract-api.Contract.html
The Context class provides a high level transactional context, per transaction (execution) in your contract - this permits contracts to use their own subclass of context to add additional processing. Eg. An example would be prepping/mapping application object fields/ids to become world state composite keys

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=jLzrD2gNE5qGdEEyr) @KartikChauhan I would _think_ that the chaincode container has a compiled binary version of the chaincode and so does not need the go development environment.
(don't know for sure)
</p>
<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 15:32:47 GMT):<br/>
yes, the core.chaincode.go.builder setting in the peer's core.yaml indicates which Docker image the chaincode images are built from and that image would have the go compiler on it  @KartikChauhan  @rthatcher   (going by memory on that setting but eyeball the file and you should be able to find it)

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 21:43:34 GMT):<br/>
@tommyjay the nodesdk would just call `funcA` in chaincodeA, the logic to call `funcB` in chaincodeB will exist within chaincodeA inside of `funcA` since you are attempting to do a chaincode to chaincode call. see the [documentation in the source code](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L62)

`After installation my chaincode reached to orderer node at var/hyperledger/production` - the chaincode install process should not have anything to do with orderer. I'd go through the details of the samples in the node js SDK to make sure you are following the practices there.

hi i have an endoresement policy that needs endoresement from Org1 peer and Org2 peer

I have version one of the chaincode installed on all the peers and have a state say the key is CAR0



I have a lastest version of the chaincode ( 2.0 ) installed on the peer of both the orgs
peer0org1 and peer0org2 and upgraded it on the channel

I created a new state CAR10

Now i updated a field of CAR0 , This transaction fails because of endoresement policy mistmatch

I am developing chain code using go lang. i have my doubts on writing chain code in go lang . Lets suppose if i am using some dependent go library for my chain code. For that i have to download that library in my local machine. What about in peer nodes how my go chain code file look for my dependency in peer docker

Has anybody experience with peer dev mode and Java Chaincode? For Go chaincode it works for me, but when using Java Chaincode, the peer tries to start a new container.. why?

@kevinkbc ...assuming you are on 1.3 and above set the following envs on the peer (1) FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=DEBUG (2) CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true (3) CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug and (4) CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_SHIM=debug 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 21:32:02 GMT):<br/>
all chaincode logs will be sent to the peer logs in one place (you could add your own printfs in the chaincode too)

@AvinashMeda guessing you sent proposal to two or more peers. The responses from them do not match
</p>
<p><strong>AvinashMeda</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 14:52:11 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr : I am sending the proposals to 2 peers.  The response dumps only the first peer's response
</p>
<p><strong>AvinashMeda</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 14:52:27 GMT):<br/>
How do i see the resposne from both the peers
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 15:16:40 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if turning on debugging will help (a quick glance in CLI doesn't make it seem likely). you could try turning on debug on the peer to see if there's any tell tale logs
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 15:17:45 GMT):<br/>
on the other hand if you have downloaded fabric and built CLI yourself, its not too hard to add a debug statement to the cli to print all proposals
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 15:18:11 GMT):<br/>
(I'm assuming you are using CLI though... going by the above output)
</p>
<p><strong>AvinashMeda</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 15:22:55 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr : Yes i enabled debug logs on the peer as well but it does not output the proposal .

Hey Gurus! I understand that the Kafka mechanism ensures transactions are stored in logical order. However is there a way to reference the transactions in chronological order, since transactions may not arrive in order submitted due to network latency?

hey!  have been installing chaincode happily for a while now,. but have just setup a new network...

When i try to instantiate a chaincode from the cli container, with the command:
peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer0.company:7050 -C messagebus -n nodecode -l "golang" -v 4.0 -c '{"Args":[""]}' -P "OR ('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')"

i get this error: 
API error (500): Could not attach to network company-new_net: rpc error: code = NotFound desc = network company-new_net not found

My question is where is company-new_net coming from? The peer is connected to a network called node_node.
I have run a network called company_new_net previously; but have since changed all instances within the configuration files. So i am wondering how the chaincode script is picking that name up. Hope you can help!

Hi all, sorry to bother you. I've read the documentation on read-write sets but still had a couple of questions I was hoping someone could help me with? Thanks in advance!

1) Double Read - Is there protection built into Fabric against a world-state key being updated during a chaincode endorsement?
As I understand it, if you were to perform a GetState on the same key twice within a single transaction, the peer could potentially have received a block and committed an update to that key in the interim. In this scenario would the peer return the latest known value each time, and what would be stored within the read-set? The documentation indicates the read-set is a unique set of keys, so would the latest version take precedent? Or would both versions be stored (resulting in it failing at commit stage).

2) Confirmation that empty reads included in the ReadSet
I understand (nil, nil) is returned if you GetState on a key that doesn't exist, I'm just checking that it is also added to the ReadSet in this case. In other-words if two separate transactions read and write to a previously non-existent key, is there a versioning conflict at commit stage, or would both transactions be committed.

I'm running fabric-sample/basic-network. I checked into fabric-ca-client docker container and looked for admin certificates in certificates table of fabric-ca-server.db file. The admin certificate that I found didn't match with any of the certificates present in the peer docker container. If these two certificates belong to different entities then two questions come to my mind. Why there're two admins? and if I register a new admin/user through fabric-ca-client then how will I get his certificates in peer docker container?

@albert.lacambra @muralisr - I used dev-mode this week with Fabric 1.4.  I used the Fabcar javascript sample on the basic-network.  (have not tested with go)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=s9FLWYkxjzqPxceFK) @KartikChauhan You can use the *Fabric CA Client* to `register` new IDs, then `enrol` the new ID to get the Certificate and Key.
This is the reference for the Fabric CA client - https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html#fabric-ca-client
and there is a #fabric-ca channel for questions about CA.
Your workflow might be like this:
1. Enrol the admin user to retrieve the admin credentials (certificate/keys) in the right format
2. Using the admin credentials - register the new ID
3. Enrol the new ID to retrieve the credentials

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=BQcfBtqdKnuyNgHhR) @manish-sethi That's great. I wasn't aware of the rwlock but will look into it, that very much simplifies dealing with edge-cases in chaincode. Thank you!

<p><strong>Legiit</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 10:58:52 GMT):<br/>
Where do you set the chaincodeId in the chaincode? How do I know what ID is used with the new programming model? 
</p>
<p><strong>Legiit</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 10:59:21 GMT):<br/>
I can't seem to find a reference, for ex: in commercial papers the contract is retrieved using "papercontract" but it's nowhere defined/exported as that exact name

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=yCKw5Lb6kTg2ipqdN) @KartikChauhan you could install the fabric-ca-client in the cli container and repeat the process, or you could use a mapped volume in the docker-compose.yml file so that the credentials are available in the cli container.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=pRGDuSH8Kuh2yzvgJ) @Legiit I believe it is on the Install and Instantiate command lines:
docker exec cliMagnetoCorp peer chaincode install -n *papercontract* -v 0 -p /opt/gopath/src/github.com/contract -l node
docker exec cliMagnetoCorp peer chaincode instantiate -n *papercontract* -v 0 -l node -c '{"Args":["org.papernet.commercialpaper:instantiate"]}' -C mychannel -P "AND ('Org1MSP.member')"

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=JwpfFTuWZLir9ish4) @Legiit `papercontract` is not defined in the chaincode files (package.json or index.js etc) . It is defined at install/instantiate so you can start more than 1 "copy" of the exact same chaincode with a different ID.  (e.g. peer chaincode install -n paperthatcher -v 0 -p /opt/gopath/src/github.com/contract -l node )

@Legiit I doubt you are running into that scenario (superficially may look the same). ... going by the stack trace I'd say the chaincode launch failed, assume during invoke ? The timeout is just a side effect of that by the peer waiting for the launch sequence to complete. You might see a chaincode container exited and retrieve logs from it to debug...

@krabradosty you are probabky getting partial dependencies and getting into collision issues due to that.  A quick way out 
```
mkdir -p ~/fab1.4/src/github.com/hyperledger
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric.git -b release-1.4 ~/fab1.4/src/github.com/hyperledger
export GOPATH=<path to my chaincode>:~/fab1.4

Hi @dave.enyeart 
I have a question regarding the ComposityKeys in a chaincode. How their behavior differs for CouchDB and LevelDB?
are there any performance penalties in using CompositeKeys in a chaincode?

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 12:33:01 GMT):<br/>
No difference in composite key function across CouchDB and LevelDB.  Composite key queries use range queries under the covers (in both CouchDB and LevelDB) and they are very performant in both since the keys are automatically organized in an index on both.

Is there any way through which I can declare participants inside fabric chaincode while making a business network (for eg, I need to include manufacturers, shippers, wholesaleperson, etc inside chaincode alongwith few enumeration).
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 02 Feb 2019 19:18:44 GMT):<br/>
@shrek95 the ledger is not directly accessed by the chaincode. The stub APIs such as GetState are translated to a chaincode<->peer protocol over gRPC and the peer access the ledger on behalf of the chaincode.  
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 02 Feb 2019 19:30:02 GMT):<br/>
@Basil-3 the chaincode is at an application layer whle the proposal is a layer below. "Participant" can mean different thibgs depending on which layer we refer to. The Proposal is sent by a "participant" who needs to be identified with an MSP which participates in the channel. This "participant" or better "member" can be accessed in the chaincode. The "participants" you refer to could be modeled using MSP id of particioating in the network. Another approach would be to have applicatuion level identities one level higher than the fabric MSP Id (ie, member of a channel will send proposal on behalf of other entities aware to the application). for example, this could be based on x509 cert of the client.For golang chaincodes  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.4/core/chaincode/lib/cid is a library that provides convenient access to both the proposal and the x509 properties.

@muralisr I can explain my issue by example. Like in supply chain business network, we have manufacturers, shippers, wholesaleperson, etc. So I am considering these personnels as participants in my business network with admin being the MSP. Also, I have to secure the authentication of each of these participants. So using fabric chaincode I want to solve these issues.

hi Fabric Developers

just letting you know about the "Hyperledger Fabric Developer" community call (lasts approx 30-60 mins) currently scheduled for  Thursday February 7th 5pm UTC (5pm UK, 12pm ET, 9am PT). 

The plan is to initially host this community call bi-weekly via Zoom webconference and is aimed at :

- helping the worldwide Fabric Developer community grow in their development journey (eg.  developing applications, smart contracts, chaincode,  developing clients, using the SDK etc - eg. whether its NodeJS, Java, Go etc etc) 
- caters for the developer perspective and the developer community.
- help developers understand / hear more about exciting new things in Fabric,eg. features upcoming or work in progress - ie things that appeal to the developer
- to foster more interest, best practices etc in developing with Hyperledger Fabric.  
- opportunity to ask questions of the Fabric team eg. you may have feedback/questions on your experiences developing with Fabric
- to share stuff you've done with the community, eg sample code / sample use cases that others may be interested in

If you wish to share content on a call, just let me know via email direct or DM me on Rocketchat (ID: mahoney1) and I'll put an item on the agenda. Provide the following:
-  the topic (state whether its presentation, or demo etc)
- the full name of the presenter, and 
- approx length of your pitch in minutes

The Zoom webconference ID is https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community   and the aim is to grow interest in the Fabric developer ecosystem (this 'Fabric Developer' call clearly has a much broader scope as indicated - feel free to make suggestions too  !). 

The current agenda is shown here -> https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Fabric+Developer+-+Meeting+Agendas+

many thanks for your time - feel free to forward this email if you think it is of interest to a colleague.

<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 19:12:24 GMT):<br/>
I have questions regarding the difference between the smart contracts as seen in the comercial-paper demo and the channel state that houses the "balances" in the balance-transfer demo
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 19:12:39 GMT):<br/>
specifically why wouldnt the balance transfer demo also use smart contracts?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 19:13:13 GMT):<br/>
when is it appropriate to use smart contracts as opposed to simply setting state in the channel directly like balance-transfer does?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 19:18:39 GMT):<br/>
it seems like balance-transfer only uses world state in the ledger, since i cant find any instances of the Contract class being implemented in that example
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 19:19:58 GMT):<br/>
ahh i think i found a clue
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 19:20:00 GMT):<br/>
https://fabric-shim.github.io/release-1.4/index.html
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 19:20:22 GMT):<br/>
so balance-trasnfer uses the fabric-shim sdk to do the smart contracting
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 19:25:10 GMT):<br/>
hmm but theres no reference to actualy create the smart contract in balance-transfer, 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 19:26:03 GMT):<br/>
like there's a reference to handle the contract since thats the bit you use the shim for. but theres no reference to fabric-contract-api that actualy lets you define the smart contract
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 20:30:08 GMT):<br/>
ok i think i understand
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 20:30:32 GMT):<br/>
so balance-transfer doesnt use smart contracts per se. it only sets state in the ledger and overwrites it
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 10:04:05 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=AuY9Bm7GTQsw2QJ3n) @Antimttr The "Commercial Paper" sample uses the "New Programming Model" from Fabric 1.4, using the `fabric-contract-api` in the Smart Contract, and using the `Gateway` class in the Client SDK program.  This new programming model is sometimes called the high level programming model.
The "Balance Transfer" sample does not use the New Programming Model, it uses the "traditional" model.
The new model refers to Smart Contracts and the traditional model refers to chaincode - they are essentially the same thing, but the Smart Contracts have some additional constructs that make it a little easier.
The New Programming Model is intended to be easier to use to allow developers to focus on business logic, but the low-level traditional api allows additional flexibility.
If you wish to compare the 2 different models, the Fabcar sample has a 2 examples - "javascript" for the new model, and "javascript-low-level" for the traditional model.
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 15:46:17 GMT):<br/>
@rthatcher thanks for the in depth response! i was looking at the marble example and it was great, I suppose that's using the old model.
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 16:00:07 GMT):<br/>
it seems like the gateway interface doesnt allow direct writing and reading of state, everything has to be a contract
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=ZmcCgdhnTKFNdw9Aa) @Basil-3 Probably best to look at the 'Modeling language' section of [this guide](https://davidkel.github.io/docs/Porting/TOC.html) . You could look at Typescript as opposed to Javascript for developing both your client and chaincode applications. Typescript allows you to model your data and provide compile time validation of your code. Also I'd recommend looking at the documentation, where a full [scenario is described](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/developapps/scenario.html) and also a detailed explanation of the [sample Commercial Paper smart contract](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/developapps/smartcontract.html) which you can download from the Github [Fabric Samples repo](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/contract)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=2kcqgqtNLWqpxyN3X) @Antimttr probably need to do a chaincode upgrade? See https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/commands/peerchaincode.html#peer-chaincode-upgrade-example for Fabric 1.4 - or (if looking to use for dev purposes) you could alternatively download this [free VScode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform) and use with Fabric 1.4 contracts to upgrade your smart contract more easily (see 'upgrade smart contract' in the doc link).

Is there any way/solution to avoid phantom reads on query result ? I am facing this issue while adding a txn into the ledger. But before adding, I am reading some value from query result of another asset and there can be chances that 2nd asset can get updated/modified in case of concurrent transactions. Can anyone help to avoid this issue ?

Hi guys, i have a question relating chaincode in java. It's supported since  1.3 (for gradle project  only and since 1.4 also for maven) and i am wondering if there are any restrictions/ features that are not yet implemented for Java chaincode but are supported in node js and go lang. So basically the question is if would you recommend using java chaincode when going on production orrather stick with go or node js ?

Hello everyone. I'm sorry to bother, but i'm stuck. I'm relatively new to fabric and I am trying to invoke a chaincode function via "peer chaincode invoke".
I followed this guide: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/chaincode4ade.html?highlight=sacc#terminal-3-use-the-chaincode
I have the "sacc" chaincode from the fabric-samples repo instantiated and am trying to invoke a function: namely "set"
So as per the tutorial I am calling ``peer chaincode invoke -n mycc -c '{"Args":["set", "a", "20"]}' -C myc`` but i get the response 

"Error: endorsement failure during invoke. response: status:500 message:"Invalid invoke function name. Expecting \"invoke\" \"delete\" \"query\"" "

@Valansch I assume you modifed a sample (example02 ?) and tried to deploy..... if you used the same name ("mycc" ?) you would need to delete the docker image associated with the original chaincode (or deply with a new name resulting in a new image).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=TLACYry3xXaaHd9T6) @HLFPOC If I understand your situation correctly, you care about the changes in the items that you read during the query but you don't care about the phantom reads. In other words, you want read committed isolation level as opposed to the serializable isolation level (hlf's model). Ideally, we could allow a transaction submitter to specify the isolation level per transaction and evaluate the validity/invalidity of the transaction per that option. However, this option is not there yet...
In the absense of this you can do following... 
instead of "I am reading some value from query result", you can pass the info in the chaincode parameter about what exactly you want to read and perform a pointed reads for those instead of performing a range query. I don't know you app well but hope that this is possible.

Is there a way to see what chaincode is running on what chaincode is running on a peer? I have installed my chaincode on my channel? I change my chaincode and install it, but it doesnt seem to hold, it still executes as if i never changed it. I'm using "first-network" with sacc chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:04:05 GMT):<br/>
What would happen if two peers install different code as the same chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>Valansch</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:04:49 GMT):<br/>
You get different results^^
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:04:56 GMT):<br/>
Does the network somehow check that the write set was generated by the same code?
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:08:03 GMT):<br/>
@Valansch so basically if the two codes are different but produce thr same output, then it would never be noticed?
</p>
<p><strong>Valansch</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:09:03 GMT):<br/>
I'm new to this aswell, so dont take my word for it. But how i understand it you install the chaincode on a peer, not on a channel.  The "peer chaincode install" command lacks any Channel flag: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/commands/peerchaincode.html#peer-chaincode-install
</p>
<p><strong>Valansch</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:09:51 GMT):<br/>
So from my understanding, yes you would not notice the chaincode being different versions if the result is the same.
Please anyone correct me if im wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:11:03 GMT):<br/>
Umm, let's wait for an expert to check this then 😀
</p>
<p><strong>dan13</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:52:33 GMT):<br/>
@Valansch @waxer Just a guy, but this may help? Upgrade is separate action than Install, and Upgrade does apply to a channel. https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/chaincode4noah.html#upgrade 
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 01:20:21 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but doesn't mention anything about checking that the new version in each peer are the same. The only thing I can imagine is that the proposal response of the peer that is signed, contains a hash of the chaincode. That way the client could see that different peers have different code of the chaincode.

@ShefaliMittal  something like (replace with your own fcn names etc)  ```	let network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel');
	// blah blah
// wait until event is received...
        let eventReceived, eventError;
        let eventPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            eventReceived = resolve;
            eventError = reject;
        })

        const chaincodeEventEmitter = new ChaincodeEventEmitter(network);  // chaincode emitter  'included' : register an event listener with the NodeSDK
        await chaincodeEventEmitter.initialize();
        chaincodeEventEmitter.on('ChaincodeEvent', async (event) => {
            console.log(event);
            const result = await this.contract.evaluateTransaction('queryOwner', commodity.ID); // eg
            event.commodity.owner = JSON.parse(result.toString('utf8')); // eg
           // blah blah
            console.log(event.commodity);
            eventReceived();
        });

        chaincodeEventEmitter.on('error', (err) => {
            eventError(err);
        });

        // send transaction
        try {
            await this.contract.submitTransaction('tradeCommodity', JSON.stringify(trade)); // setEvent done in yr contract function eg ctx.stub.setEvent('tradeEvent', Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(commodity)));
            let event = await eventPromise;
        } catch(err) {
            console.log(err);
        } finally {
            chaincodeEventEmitter.disconnect();
        }
    }     ```  - also see also the 'Chaincode event listener' section of the docs -> https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-channel-events.html and you can get the client

@ShefaliMittal The example is taken from https://github.com/davidkel/bnaport/tree/master/trade-network/native/client-js where you will find the implementation of `ChaincodeEventEmitter` and a contrived use of it can be found in `txactions.js`. I say contrived because it is a single shot type invocation to demonstrate how it works rather than best practice of how a client application should handle chaincode events. For example the sample sets up a promise to wait for a single chaincode event and disconnects the emitter before terminating. You would only disconnect the emitter for example when you application terminates not when you have received the event.

Hi Guys, is there any out of the box functionality of so called transactions in chaincode ? Let's say that there are 3 values that i wan't to put on ledger: `key1` -> `value1`, `key2` -> `value2`, `key3` -> `value3`. To add them i have to execute `chaincodeStub.put(key1, value1)`, `chaincodeStub.put(key2, value2)` , `chaincodeStub.put(key3, value3)` and  business requirement is that all these values should be saved with rule "all or nothing". I mean if `key1` and `key2` will be saved successfully but issue will occur with `key3` then  none of them should be saved on ledger.

@silliman , because i coudn't find anything like transaction in shim. Once line `stub.putStringState(key1, value1)` will execute successfuly, data will be saved on blockchain. If in next line `stub.putStringState(key2, value2)` will fail,  `key1` will be saved anyway. That's the issue that i am trying to overcome and can't just wrap it in transaction like with database operations

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 18:19:27 GMT):<br/>
@alek When you PutState() in chaincode it doesn't write to the ledger at that time.  The chaincode execution produces a set of proposed writes in a single transaction, which is then submitted for ordering, validation, and commit.  The commit is atomic such that all writes from a valid transaction are made at the same time. See the transaction flow doc: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/txflow.html and for more details: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/peers/peers.html#phase-1-proposal

@alek to add to what @silliman  and @dave.enyeart said above, part of the confustion I think is the use of the word `transaction`... you'll send a proposal to the chaincode, execute three PutStates. The result of that operation (ie, response to the proposal or "ProposalResponse") will be part of a _single_ transaction sent to the ledger for commit (and here's the actual meaning of "transaction" in fabric context).Can you read back the comments with that definition transaction and see if that helps please ?

@silliman @dave.enyeart @muralisr  thank you guys for your responses.  I am quite familiar with transaction flow and if i understood you correctly, all three `putState` operations will create on transaction.
But the question is what factor determines that all of these operations will be part of exact ONE transactions proposal send to endorsing peers ?
Please look into diagram that i created, looking into these operations i am wondering about some edge cases:
1. How many operations will be part of one transaction proposal send to endorsers assuming that N is rather a large number
2. How many operations will be part of one transaction proposal send to endorsers assuming that values that were added to ledger will be a large file and it will take some time to add them
3. How many operations will be part of one transaction proposal when we execute "putState" N- times, then we execute some business logic and then again start updating ledger, will that be part of one transaction ?

@alek It doesn't matter how many PutStates() your chaincode executes... each chaincode invocation will result in one transaction. The chaincode logic determines how many PutStates() will occur in this transaction.

Now query chaincode ChaincodeID(private_data_cc7_go:github.com/private_data_cc:1) on channel bar for the value of b expecting to see: 250
java.lang.AssertionError: Failed query proposal from peer peer0.org2.example.com status: FAILURE. Messages: Incorrect 'ou' returned, got '' expecting to end with 'department1'. Was verified : false
	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88)

	at org.hyperledger.fabric.sdkintegration.PrivateDataIT.lambda$1(PrivateDataIT.java:407)

```

Retrieve the idemix credential in private_data _chaincode 
```
// Invoke makes payment of X units from A to B
func (t *SimpleChaincode) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) pb.Response {
	logger.Info("########### private_data_cc Invoke ###########")

	function, args := stub.GetFunctionAndParameters()
	
	// Getting attributes from an idemix credential
	ou, found, err := cid.GetAttributeValue(stub, "ou");
	
	logger.Info("ou is *******************************: " + ou)
	if !strings.HasSuffix(ou, "department1") {
		return shim.Error(fmt.Sprintf("Incorrect 'ou' returned, got '%s' expecting to end with 'department1'", ou))
	}

@vtech I still assert that the Identity Mixer attributes have nothing to do with private data chaincode, they are independent concepts. @skarim any ideas on how to set and retrieve Identity Mixer attributes when using CID?
</p>
<p><strong>skarim</strong> (Wed, 13 Feb 2019 21:05:00 GMT):<br/>
@vtech I would look at the bit of code here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/master/src/test/fixture/sdkintegration/gocc/sampleIdemix/src/github.com/example_cc/example_cc.go#L87

Also, currently only attributes can be retrieved from an idemix credential. They are 'ou' and 'role', currently there is not support for custom attributes in idemix credentials.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=89qo64nhkbHPFepL8) @vtech Are you using the java SDK, and can you confirm that you are transacting using an idemix credential? Perhaps something in the log that refers your idemixMSP id. If you are indeed using an idemix credential, you should have been able to get the 'ou' attribute using the chaincode library.

Hello Experts, I want to query on the basis of months in Hyperledger fabric. for example I need data about all the records whose date of purchase comes under last 6 months.  i.e. I want to fetch record on the basis of date of purchase for last six moths. Can anyone help me out? I'm stuck on this from couple of weeks.

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:38:21 GMT):<br/>
you mean GetQueryResultWithPagination @bandreghetti  ?

I thought GetQueryResult gave me full access to CouchDB query strings so I was trying to paginate using `limit` and `size` instead of GetQueryResultWithPagination, since the latter enforces sequential access which is not appropriate for my use case

I take your point too... you were doing `limit` through the `GetQueryResult`. My worry was now there are two "limits" in consideration (one at the CC level and the other at tge DB level)

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:27:55 GMT):<br/>
@bandreghetti @muralisr I've made a few clarifications in Fabric CouchDB docs to clarify:

https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-docs-build-x86_64/1334/html/couchdb_as_state_database.html#couchdb-pagination
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:29:06 GMT):<br/>
Since Fabric uses `limit` internally to manage paging between chaincode container, peer, and CouchDB, it is not supported to be set by callers, you must use the pagination APIs 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:29:58 GMT):<br/>
@bandreghetti What use case are you trying to achieve?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:33:49 GMT):<br/>
If you only want to iterate through the top N records within chaincode, you can do that without using the pagination queries.  The results will implicitly be paged between chaincode, peer, and couchdb as you iterate through them, so you need not be concerned about large result sets.
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:38:08 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=Bzwrb3WegQTPuoWRo) @dave.enyeart I wanted to use pagination with random page access, something such as "give me page 7 with 10 elements per page", which would mean elements 61~70

With bookmarks I would have to call `GetQueryResultWithPagination` 6 times just to get the correct bookmark for the 7th page, which doesn't seem to be very efficient
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:39:02 GMT):<br/>
You can `GetQueryResultWithPagination` with pageSize 70 and iterate down to the 61st record.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:39:45 GMT):<br/>
random page access is not efficient, and therefore not encouraged in the APIs

random page access is not efficient (even when going directly to CouchDB), and therefore not encouraged in the APIs

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=W8fW8DvWJgA3n4JkH) @dave.enyeart You mean iterate from 1st to 60th ignoring the results just to get to the 61st? Is it better than iterating using bookmarks? Does it work if instead of 61st to 70th I want 60001st to 60010th?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:49:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  Agreed it is not efficient.  Even if you did this directly in CouchDB with skip/limit it does the same iterating through all the records and is not efficient. That is why random page access as a pattern is discouraged.  But if you can restrict it in chaincode to say random access to the first 1000 records only, then it wouldn't be too bad.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:59:03 GMT):<br/>
Sorry no, for aggregates including COUNT, we suggest the pattern of a side database built by listening to block events.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 20:00:07 GMT):<br/>
To the original question...there are many posts on the internet about why random page access is not a good idea... here's one quote:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 20:00:12 GMT):<br/>
```I never ever ever want to jump to page 317 right from the beginning. There’s absolutely no use case out there, where I search for something, and then I say, hey, I believe my search result will be item #3175 in the current sort order. Exactly. Instead, I will do any of these:

    Refine the search
    Sort the result

In both cases, I will get a result where the record that I’m looking for is much more likely to appear on page #1 or perhaps #2.```

Hey, could anyone help me out understanding if I make a putState() and just after that try to get that element, there's no result. I get that the block takes time to commit but still I miss some points. Could someone help me figuring out the whole commit process of a transaction and when does it take effect in the ledger. 
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 20:12:12 GMT):<br/>
In my use-case there are chances that someone might hit the chaincode just after sending the transaction(putState()) to fetch the result.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=8WXP9Xown6iwH7c2r) @dave.enyeart Other that this, is there any way we could make indexes from inside the chaincode. Don't you think one would require this too.   
Because to make indexed on the fly we're left with only one way to hit a curl request to our CouchDB database. But due to our infrastructure I wanted to avoid keeping any credentials at the end SDK is called.

Very specifically suppose I have these functions in my chaincode ```  async singleEntry(stub, args) {

            await stub.putState('DCAR' + ind ,  Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(obj)));
     }

    async checkEntry(stub, args){

Hi Team, I have one query regarding private Data, As per Block to Live in a collection, private data will get purge after that many block got created. But i can see still the trace of log in file 000001.log in /var/hyperledger/production/ledgersData/pvtdataStore folder inside Peer container. Kindly help me understand why there is trace of log of purged private data in this log file.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 16 Feb 2019 14:05:21 GMT):<br/>
@shyam 40 blockToLive purge removes the data from private state and private data storage so that user chaincode and peer process have no access to it.  The file you reference is a historical log file for the underlying database that user chaincode and peer do not have access to.  The data in the historical log file will eventually be overwritten.

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 16 Feb 2019 14:40:05 GMT):<br/>
Not possible, since peers may be at different heights and they require a deterministic blockToLive when processing blocks
</p>
<p><strong>Shyam_Pratap_Singh</strong> (Sat, 16 Feb 2019 16:49:12 GMT):<br/>
what about upgradation of policy from one to another for eg. in marbles Policy { Org1.MSP} later upgrade the same collection with {Org2.MSP, Org3.MSP} . is this possible in private data?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 16 Feb 2019 19:57:46 GMT):<br/>
Yes, collections can be defined at chaincode instantiation time and updated at chaincode upgrade time. See https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/private-data-arch.html#upgrading-a-collection-definition
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 17 Feb 2019 13:02:04 GMT):<br/>
Can somebody put some light on the below test case I am working with:

I have 3 orgs Org1, Org2 and Org3 - At various process flows I need some private data to be shared with ORG1 and ORG2 and in some cases between ORG1 and ORG3 and in some other cases between Org2 and Org3. Private data seems to be the way for Release 1.4 but that enforces me to predefine the parties in the policy (config policy).

Is there a way to make this dynamic at the time of saving to the ORG1 that I specify that this private data is visible/accessible to Only ORG2 and not ORG3.

Right now all my test cases have be declaratively defined in a config file (not dynamic). 
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Sun, 17 Feb 2019 13:06:24 GMT):<br/>
Write now If I define the policy as Org1 or Org2 or Org3 - all orgs can see the private data (not private anymore).
Else  I have to define the properties as follows:

```[
 {
    "name": "collection1",
    "policy": "OR('Org1MSP.member', 'Org2MSP.member')",
    "requiredPeerCount": 0,
    "maxPeerCount": 3,
    "blockToLive":1000000,
    "memberOnlyRead": true
 },{
    "name": "collection2",
    "policy": "OR('Org1MSP.member', 'Org3MSP.member')",
    "requiredPeerCount": 0,
    "maxPeerCount": 3,
    "blockToLive":1000000,
    "memberOnlyRead": true
 },
 {
    "name": "collection3",
    "policy": "OR('Org3MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')",
    "requiredPeerCount": 0,
    "maxPeerCount": 3,

]```

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sun, 17 Feb 2019 13:38:52 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 04:39:16 GMT):<br/>
@shyam 40 Looks pretty good... Note that the sequence diagram is not quite correct... Anchor Peers should not be there.  Anchor peers are only used to bootstrap the gossip network.  At transaction time, private data flows directly from endorsing peers to (authorized) committing peers, and blocks flow directly from ordering service to (all) committing peers.

Hi Can someone please help me with endorsement policy.

I have set it as OR(ORG1Msp.admin, Org2MSP.admin)

when I invoke chaincode, it fails with endorsement policy failure error. and peer log shows identity is not an admin

Endorsement is done by the Peers, so you might want (Org1MSP.peer, Org2MSP.peer)

If I have multiple organizations, each with multiple peers, sharing the same kind of data back and forth -- but in certain cases i want one of the fields in the data being shared to not be shown to the peers while everything else is still shared -- is this possible with Fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 21:44:51 GMT):<br/>
say Peer1 from Org1 submits a transaction to register a "Marble" which has some sensitive information, they're on a channel with Peer2 from Org2. If Peer1 executes transaction "showSensitiveInfo" for example, Peer2 should be able to query the ledger and get full details about the "Marble", but if that hasnt been done, Peer2 can query the ledger and fetch some info but not the sensitive information about the "Marble"

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=cxHSgqAP87uJosHQ5) @shyam 40 The peer admin can potentially know everything the peer has ever known (e.g. by copying off the underlying data at intervals). When private data is purged it means that it is purged from the network and not accessible to user chaincode, and not accessible to other peers that are trying to pull the private data. The rate that leveldb overwrites historical logs is not configurable.  Note that even if files are deleted, the peer admin could use disk utilities to find deleted files. There is implicit trust in the peer admin and an implicit requirement that the peer is secured from others.

Hi all. I'm playing a bit around and came up with the following question: I have two structs - car and a car-sub-component (e.g Door). The car has an unique ID and also the Door has an unique ID. How is it possible to concatenate these structs, so I can query later to get all of the cars sub-components? Right now I can't get the logic for putting the state and adding the sub-component to the car. Unfortunately I did not find any example. Anybody with a good approach on that? Thanks in advance!

So I will install 2 chaincodes on 2 different channels let's say mycc1 & mycc2.

So just wanted to know if it is possible to acheive this functionality here as Org2 is member of both the channels.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=HgrQsATjGTbx6fZmH) @JonasM You can create a composite key of carid~subcomponentid and then query for everything in carid~*.  See related example at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.4/chaincode/marbles02/go/marbles_chaincode.go#L223 and query at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.4/chaincode/marbles02/go/marbles_chaincode.go#L458

Hi experts. After the Fabric Developer Community call, I read the commercial-paper in fabric-samples.
In the commercial paper, Chaincode uses classes “state” and “statelist” to put/get states. They generate composite keys, serialize/deserialize state, and call ChaincodeShim.
These classes seem useful for many use cases because developers can focus on the business logic. Is there any plan to add these classes to fabric-contract-api?

you have access to the proposal credentials in the chaincode. That could  be the basis for cert based ACLs (role, attributes) etc.  I'd checkout the GO chaincode helper `cid` library https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.4/core/chaincode/lib/cid ... the same ideas would carry out to other languages as well

Is it necessary to store all the aruguments in different array variable. Like color = arg[1], owner = arg[2]. Can't we store in one single variable. And if we can store in one variable, can we apply query on it. 
func (t *SimpleChaincode) initMarble(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) pb.Response {
var err error

// 0 1 2 3
// "asdf", "blue", "35", "bob"
if len(args) != 4 {
return shim.Error("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 4")
}


marbleName := args[0]
color := strings.ToLower(args[1])
owner := strings.ToLower(args[3])
size, err := strconv.Atoi(args[2])
if err != nil {
return shim.Error("3rd argument must be a numeric string")
}

Is there a refactor of the chain code build/run process planned for the 2.0 release of Hyperledger?  My team is planning the best way to integrate with Hyperledger and we have been having some discussions around how the current system works.  Presently I have a fork with a Kubernetes Controller integrated with the docker controller that bypasses all of the peer compile steps by always returning true that the image exists and scheduling the container as a pod in kubernetes pulled from our internal docker repositories instead.  We would like to have something that integrates with Hyperledger a little more completely so that our work could be contributed back to the project as something that works for more than just our unique use cases.

At the moment our internal discussions have focused on using the peer command in our admin-cli container to build source code into containers that are published into a local repository for the peers within the org to pull from when scheduling...  We have more than 10 separate orgs in different google and AWS kubernetes clusters managed by different companies in our consortium. A solution that uses raw source code from a central Artifactory/Nexus repository and builds within in each org would be useful for the review step of chaincode by members within our consortium.

Is this the right place for this discussion?  Perhaps one of the maintainers would like to discuss this withe me or others on my team further?

@iramiller there is ongoing work on  `Peer and Chaincode cloud native deployment support ` (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13582 ) which is relevant to the above. The core idea is to separate chaincode management from Peer and leave it to the organizations. This will make native k8s support more inline with traditional cloud management (and has other signficant benefits as well).

Our patch for kubernetes controller achieves much of that ticket ...
</p>

</p>

yes

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:16:06 GMT):<br/>
in addition there's a fundamnenta change in client/server orientation that'll add other benefits as well
</p>

Lots to unpack in that ticket ... definitely a good direction though.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:19:19 GMT):<br/>
`Looks like the direction of Hyperledger is away from raw source files` - that has to be answered a bit more carefully (than the deleted, hasty "yes" :-) )
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:21:14 GMT):<br/>
For audibility of chaincode source into what is actually executing ... and the separate organizations who by installing the chaincode would be endorsing it ... 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:21:32 GMT):<br/>
in general, the direction is to recognize there is much to be gained at different levels (usability, flexibility, capabilities, modeling etc)  in relaxing the requirement that we need the source files and everyine should have the same source files. That is not to say there isn't benefit in having the same source files either
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:21:34 GMT):<br/>
and ensuring consistency across the entire consortium ...
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:21:38 GMT):<br/>
well
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:22:22 GMT):<br/>
that's some thing that cannot be enforced even today easily (case in point, look at fork you did to cut off the image generation completely)
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:22:26 GMT):<br/>
I am fine with an answer of "implement a process outside of Hyperledger"
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:22:34 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:24:09 GMT):<br/>
that approach does not detract any of the values of the current processes/features in fabric
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:25:55 GMT):<br/>
certainly this is something I need to watch close ... some what unrelated but impacted by this is that our chaincode containers run with a special validating security context that generates encryption keys ... the public keys are flowed into a central KMS and we have privacy protections based on encrypting everything.  Eventually if TEEs become a reasonable choice that our approach is positioned for that purpose.  Having the ability to control the chaincode containers fully is a requirement for our approaches.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:26:21 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:27:02 GMT):<br/>
converting the chaincode container to a server complicates things somewhat given the formal methods used for communicating with a TEE

(reviewing now)
</p>

it can still be a docker container (and likely will be)

to avoid confusion, what is the context for that observation ... ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:37:20 GMT):<br/>
(as you kniw there's the current notion of "version" that will be blurred)
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:37:46 GMT):<br/>
we want to determine that the source code which was audited and built in a controlled process is the only version that is allowed to run regardless of which image repository it is sourced from
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:39:54 GMT):<br/>
by using chaincodename with a specific hash b602f265313c9e4b3e4892505f7652c46540d926 for example in the channel config then distributed organizations with their own internal docker repositories can be sure they have an identical and unmodified version of the code running
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:40:27 GMT):<br/>
without sourcing the images from one central repository (if for example that is not desired for private network reasons)
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:42:05 GMT):<br/>
an image of `postgres@sha256:bf87ee22821e1bc5cedd5da2def1700685a9e3828605b31162d8f04e16c06385` is more strongly controlled then `postgres:9.6.6-alpine`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:42:27 GMT):<br/>
each org can have its own notion of what the correct chaincode is.... in other words that process could be internal to the org
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:45:05 GMT):<br/>
especially with the ability to reach outside of the chaincode via network access the approach described in this document along with more flexible versioning seems to open up a very real possibility of transactions that can not be repeated and verified with only the contents of what is on chain... is the idea then that those consistency decisions are an "exercise for the reader" so to speak versus something the platform strives to ensure are hard requirements?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:46:30 GMT):<br/>
... actually at this point I think I need to discuss things further with my team ... what is the most appropriate way to provide any additional feedback to the team... through comments on the JIRA? or just bring up further points in this (or another) channel?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:49:56 GMT):<br/>
comments in the JIRA is good ... or if its more appropriate to comment on the doc if that has more context, that;s good as well
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:03:02 GMT):<br/>
The last important comment I have about why tightly controlling the exact executable that is run for a chaincode is that it is a critical aspect of the distributed trust problem a blockchain is solving.  If I am working with a remote partner(s) and I have sensitive proprietary data ... an important factor in that trust relationship is that all of the partners can certify that the data is handled only by the exact version of the chaincode intended.  As a member I do not want a remote peer to be able to invoke chaincode with my data unless it is run with code as agreed.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:12:50 GMT):<br/>
right, however the moment you send a request to the remote peer with the sensitive data, there's already a level of trust, never mind what the chaincode is doing with it.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:22:44 GMT):<br/>
Certainly ... and an organization is not likely to be part of a private blockchain consortium without some sort of legal arrangement being in place.  That doesn't mean that we would want to abandon the idea of using strong guarantees on what software is running at this level, especially given we already have it at every other level in the stack and this last area is actually the one most prone to churn.  The idea of allowing strong version requirements wouldn't be an overly adverse impact so long as other approaches like `latest` tags or simple version numbers were also allowed for those with flexible use cases.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:33:12 GMT):<br/>
`especially given we already have it at every other level in the stack ` - as in organizations sign off on the version requirements on the entire stack ? Perhaps I'm missing something...butOrgs can even choose their own vendor to host fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:46:34 GMT):<br/>
auditing the exact version of containers running in an environment is a pretty trivial task ... drawing up a legal agreement that requires a specific set of versions is also pretty straight forward to do for company legal along with the associated compliance checking ... there are plenty of tools on that side for organizations to work with on a private blockchain network.  As an example we have an agent running in each environment that is doing many of these auditing and consistency checks on a continuous basis and reporting those details into a consolidated location for compliance checking.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 22:14:39 GMT):<br/>
injecting a chaincode version check based on hash to this process should be  fairly straightforward then
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 23:37:10 GMT):<br/>
This seems very important ... as a concrete example if I have chaincode calculating fees I need to have the ability to get it deployed everywhere before instantiating it on the channel ... with a larger multiple member consortium that is going to take time.  With the chaincode as a service approach there would need to be multiple services or multiple versions within the chaincode service ... or some other solution (of which no obvious ones are apparent).  With the current setup we are using the peers all know which version they need from channel config and they request that kubernetes schedules that specific version be instantiated.  It would be especially important to have these strict versions available, ideally even more than one version available at once for replaying and validating historical data if so required.

This is a complex issue and I look forward to seeing what the HLF team comes up with.  I forwarded the google doc and the Jira issue around so we can keep an eye on it and provide any comments or insights that we might have which could prove useful.  Admittedly our large financial securitization system is a pretty unique case with members spanning the 3 major public cloud providers on a full private network but I believe our use case might still provide an interesting set of constraints to consider.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 23:58:55 GMT):<br/>
One solution to the versioning issue would be to go full on service mesh routing ... we have considered something like Istio or Linkerd which would also help make some of the TLS certificate pain go away ... these solutions do add a non-trivial amount of complexity to the architecture though.

hello guys, I would really appreciate your opinion on this one :-)
For chaincode development in Go, sometimes using using sub interface feels like the code written is too low level - routing logic, marshal unmarshal to json, error handling, validations, etc.
With this regards, https://github.com/s7techlab/cckit this library helped to write more abstract but business application friendly code (with fewer lines of code)
The only place where this library lacks is ability to keep up with new features of fabric like private data, pagination, etc... so we fall back to stub interface.
Do you think supporting this library for Go chaincode or similar measures in say Node or other langs when writing chaincode will help.
Of course we could write our own wrapper libs (like this an opinionated one).. but something that comes from community and supported by more contributors will always be preferred, your thoughts?

`CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME="marbles02:v0" CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer:7052 node marbles_chaincode.js`
(This command assumes you are running the chaincode in some sort of cli docker container and the name "peer" is the docker name for the peer container.)

Hello I am developing a Wallet type application in Java chaincode with basically 2 models, Wallet and MoneyTransfer. MoneyTransfer has properties for the from Wallet and target Wallet ids. I have not found examples of how to code in the chaincode a query method to fetch, for example, all MoneyTransfer's for a specific wallet. Any URL for doc or help on how to do this? (Samples I have found just fetch models by Id from ChaincodeStub) Thanks.

Can we rollback any transaction using it's transaction ID. I know data is immutable so probably a way by which we could send in another transaction. But my main motive is to reverse the transaction.

You could do a function in your chaincode for that @Rajatsharma but the history will prevail

I'm trying to delete some records using querying some records by `GetQueryResult()` and then removing them. 
I had implemented update in batches by using `skip` keyword in mango-queries. I was able to perform update as suppose I perform update on 10 records and skip them, then I'll get the next 10 records but with delete as the records get deleted I'm left with the dilema that I can't fire the other query because if the block gets committed then I'll lose those 10 records. And if I wait for the block to commit. The overall for my application that would require a lot of time. Could anyone suggest me any work-around.

At present, there is a need to design an Org, and specify the Org peer to implement a special endorsement function, such as the deduction in the billing function in the process of endorsement, and the deduction information need to be on the chain. I know that the fabric supports the plugin way to modify the endorsement smart contract. Can fabric support and achieve such a function?

@dave.enyeart In fact, we want to implement a similar Ethereum, which consumes a certain amount of gas for each transaction, so we must design two smart contracts, one to complete the business transaction and one to complete the gas billing function. So you need a smart contract to invoke a smart contract. At the same time, vscc cannot support concurrent execution. So we picture that design the gas billing in the endorsement contract（escc）.

To ensure deterministic behavior across peers, your channel needs to support at least V1_3 application capabilities, for more information see https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/upgrading_your_network_tutorial.html#overview and an example config at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.3/first-network/configtx.yaml#L156

Hey all, this is regarding Fabric1.4 Private Data
Let's say I have 5 Orgs, (Org1, Org2, Org3, Org4, Org5) and each of them wants to do some transactions where only TWO Orgs are involved and they wanna keep them Private. I wanna use only 1 Channel
1. How many collections would network need?
2. If a new Org has to be added (Org6), how will existing Organisations gonna know about new Collections to interact with Org6?
</p>
<p><strong>GaneshGhag</strong> (Mon, 04 Mar 2019 11:05:47 GMT):<br/>
Some simple code which will simulate a ctx.stub when you want to run and test chaincode on local node setup


class Stub {
    constructor(){
        this.dataInMemory = {};
    }
    async putState(key, value){
        this.dataInMemory[key] = value;
    }

    async getState(key){
        return this.dataInMemory[key];
    }
}


class InMemoryContext {
    
    constructor(){
        this.stub = new Stub();
    }
}


Having above code in your local setup, you can execute you smart contract locally and test it to reasonable extent before deploying it onto a network
console.log('starting out....');
let mod1 = new ReverseBid();  //your smart contract(SC)
let ctx = new InMemoryContext();
await mod1.initLedger(ctx);  //your init code for SC
await mod1.addAssetForBid(ctx,'key2','asset 2 desc','Mandy2','99999');  //your business method for SC

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=Fkd2QbNDihkfi572q) @Mahesh-Raj You will need a collection for every pair of orgs. You can add a collection by updating the chaincode with a new collection definition, see https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/private-data-arch.html#updating-a-collection-definition. Note that there is a feature on the roadmap for the client to choose the recipients rather than encode the collection in the chaincode to support use cases where all permutations are needed without having to define each one explicitly.

@harshitrajan sounds like your CA server docker container isn't running :-) you can check your Fabric's status with `docker ps `

@harshitrajan `127.0.0.1:7054` is a "local" host address (assumes - in your case - CA is running on the same machine as SDK). I'd verify to make sure you are using the IP for the CA

Hello guys.
I'm facing an issue related to starting the chaincode on the peers, because the command included in the `package.json` is `fabric-chaincode-node start`.
This fails on the server because it issues the command `fabric-chaincode-node start "--peer.address" "peer0.org1.example.com:7052"`.
However, my port for the peer it is not 7052, but 17052 (yes, I'm using VSCode Extension).
Do you know how can we solve this?
Thanks.
</p>

<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 09:39:25 GMT):<br/>
@PMoura there's one (single) peer in that extension's config (you'll see in the docker-compose.yml the mapped setting is ${PEER_CHAINCODE_PORT}:7052 and `netstat -an` would confirm that. I suggest to do a teardown and start Fabric in the tool. Also check you meet the requirements per the tool.

I am storing the timestamp in one field which will later be stored in the state database (I am doing this stuff in chaincode). So, now my question is that field with a timestamp will have different values for both peers so my transaction is getting failed with an error of `failure of endorsement policy`. How can I deal with this situation?

@PMoura - your chaincode is already running - why are you connecting to the chaincode container and running this command?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=mB6Na6kAz2j7ghZEE) @HoneyShah dont use timestamp in chaincode level,, when chaincode executed at different peer it creates different timestamp and that is causing error of endorsment policy bcoz both peer would have diffrenet read-write set ,,pass timestamp via any SDK

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 07 Mar 2019 12:07:31 GMT):<br/>
Right - Clients automatically put the system timestamp in the transaction proposal header. Endorsers can retrieve this timestamp in chaincode using chaincode api GetTxTimestamp(). This will be deterministic across endorsers. You can also pass a timestamp as an argument to the chaincode, just be sure you pass the same timestamp in each transaction proposal to all the endorsers.

You can encode timestamp as an integer, e.g. using epoch seconds, and then sort on this field..

In fabcar example I'd like to do a field field validation. So for example color can only be blue or red. I thought it may be possible by using SetStateValidationParameter. hey...

<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Thu, 07 Mar 2019 14:24:06 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=sn9TzsiNaLc9GrZAn) @Hezaveh - `setStateValidationParameter` is for State Based Endorsement - setting an endorsement policy for a particular key in the State database.  
You will need to write code to validate fields.  Using typescript would help a little or you could try some external 'model' solution.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=cwzatah7jR9w9Hojv) @mcoblenz - yes you can define multiple Smart Contracts into one chaincode package.  All the functions in all Smart Contracts will be callable/accessible by name - unless there are duplicate names.  In the event of duplicate function names, the one from the first contract will become the default and will be used. (I think 'first' is determined alphabetically.)
But rather than rely on defaults, best practise is to namespace each contract as per the Commercial Paper Sample:
```
constructor() {
    super('org.papernet.commercialpaper');
}
```

@mcoblenz "Smart Contract" could take different meaning based on the application definition (sometimes the chaincode itself is referred to as a "smart contract"). (It seems in ur case the chaincode is a "container" for "Smart Contracts" perhaps ?) ... in any case "addressibility" is basically at chaincode level.

Hi all
I am new to fabric. I have created an application which is running some transactions on my local machine. When I run ./stopFabric, all the data in the transaction history is lost. Is there a way I can save that data and run from this point again after sometime ?
</p>
<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 09:24:02 GMT):<br/>
@varadhbhatnagar see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43330569/hyperledger-fabric-with-docker-not-storing-data-after-restart use (1st answer) - Basically you need locate your docker-compose.yaml file(s) and (from the directory or providing the path using the appropriate command below) preserve them using:
`docker-compose stop` to stop the Fabric Containers
`docker-compose start` to restart where you left off previously (don't use `up` / `down`)

Suppose i have Bank1, Bank2, and Bank3 peer organizations. I want to design a system where they each store Client information (where client is a bank account holder). Typically, I wouldn't want Bank2 to have acess to Bank1's clients -- but if the client invokes a certain function call somehow, bank2 should be able to fetch that client's information over from bank1 (given all banks share a channel)

Hello team, I'm facing problem while creating composite key using a float64 and a string field.                                                                                        
    //  ==== Index the marble to enable color-based range queries, e.g. return all blue marbles ====
	//  An 'index' is a normal key/value entry in state.
	//  The key is a composite key, with the elements that you want to range query on listed first.
	//  In our case, the composite key is based on indexName~color~name.
	//  This will enable very efficient state range queries based on composite keys matching indexName~color~*

	indexName := "cust_amt~cust_name"
	custamtIndexKey, err := stub.CreateCompositeKey(indexName, []string{customer.Cust_amt, customer.Cust_name})
	//custamtIndexKey, err := stub.CreateCompositeKey(indexName, float64, {customer.Cust_amt})
	if err != nil {
		return shim.Error(err.Error())
	}
	//  Save index entry to state. Only the key name is needed, no need to store a duplicate copy of the marble.
	//  Note - passing a 'nil' value will effectively delete the key from state, therefore we pass null character as value
	value := []byte{0x00}
	stub.PutState(custamtIndexKey, value)                                                                                                                                                                     Here ''cust_amt" is a float64 valuePlease help me out as composite function have take only string fields as arguments.

or "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid"? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:42:57 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=ygJ9XtoZ2rrfXDbAE) @braduf The Client Identity Object can be used in Chaincode to determine the certificate and certificate properties of the ID that invoked the transaction.  If attributes are present in the Certificate then these can form the basis of Attribute Based Access Control (abac). 
I think that the cid object is now included in the context when using the fabric-contract api so you don't have to create it.

<p><strong>mcoblenz</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 18:11:49 GMT):<br/>
Is it the case that all endorsers must read the same set of keys when executing a transaction? i.e. it does not suffice for them to only have the same write set, but they must also have the same read set?

ultimately AAA is driven by the usecase and how the business represents identity
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 13:25:21 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr yep. we use `cid` lib heavily. 
in terms of business identity is represented by it's unique name that is also used to register this identity on CA, hence it's a `cn` in the certificate of this identity.
but I'm wondering what will happen if I join another org to a channel that also has an identity with the same enrollment id (cn in certificate)?
if I identify an identity by it's cn, then the identity with the same cn may have access to the data that is related to the identity from the first org

If based upon chaincode functions I want to make calls to external APIs and perform some business logic, should I include that directly in the chaincode or the client app??

transaction ID is accessible in the  call to chaicnode. This same TX ID will be in block at commit time. So the reference is there at a later point (also note that at the time of call, the call to piutState is not associated with a block yet - at "endorsement" time. That association happens later and avalilable at commit time)

Hey, when using Private Data (according to https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/private_data_tutorial.html) is there any way for the collection definition be for individual marbles? Rather than the whole group of marbles?
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Wed, 13 Mar 2019 23:56:13 GMT):<br/>
For eg `price` is visible only to `Org1` if you follow the tutorial, say I have 2 marbles in the ledger, is there any way `Org1` can make `marble1` `price` visible to `Org2` but keep `marble2` data to itself?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 02:38:06 GMT):<br/>

@haardikkk any interim solution would require pre-defining many collections. You can vote for 'local collections' here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7593 . The more votes, the more likely it will be prioritized for later in 2019.

because i developed chaincode using java.but when i  start reading commercial-paper tutorial . i found different classes in node js which are not in java . i am not sure about this but is this true? please any one worked around this please help me . 
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 08:15:31 GMT):<br/>
@RohanKandalkar the work on the Java chaincode to update to the node.js level is underway! The same features will be available - if you checkout that the last community calls you'll some of the demos and here discussion around them.  @mahoney1 think I'm correct in saying are recordings available?
</p>
<p><strong>RohanKandalkar</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 10:03:41 GMT):<br/>
can you suggest best (most used) language for chain-code development ? or mature language whose support i can get easily.  or whose library is very rich.please suggest .
</p>
<p><strong>RohanKandalkar</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 10:05:24 GMT):<br/>
and  in client application's java sdk  also work in progress . because classes related to network  are present in node js but not available in java.

The link here: [https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim/ext/cid][1] shows the golang chaincode functions that can be used to implement ACL at the application level. Using calls like `cid.GetAttributeValue(APIstub, "role")`, I can get the `role` of the person who has initiated the transaction and accordingly I can perform checks using the `role` value. 

But I am not able to figure out how to test these scenarios while using the `MockStub` (https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#MockStub). Can someone please point me to / show an example of how to pass attributes with every transaction which can be then accessed using `cid`.

@RohanKandalkar a few points (1) the SDK can be in different language than chaincode ..if you like to develop chaincode in Java you can do so without worrying about somethings not being there in java SDK (2) typically the GO chaincode have all the core functionality (but some feature related to higher programming model constructs may target node first (but I think the GO chaincode support is in the plan, true @mbwhite @mahoney1 ?) (3) if you are most familiar with java it is probably a good idea to start with java chaincode (assuming you are starting with fabric, better minimize learning curve)

You could use the ClientIdentity class methods https://fabric-shim.github.io/master/fabric-shim.ClientIdentity.html eg. in 1.4 ``` let cid = ctx.clientIdentity;
        if (cid.assertAttributeValue("groupName", "sales")) {
            throw new Error("Not a valid user of this function");
        }``` where `groupName` was added as a custom attribute for the registered user

<p><strong>PradeepJaligama</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 13:38:10 GMT):<br/>
 InvokeChaincode locally calls the specified chaincode `Invoke` using the
     same transaction context; that is, chaincode calling chaincode doesn't
     create a new transaction message.
     If the called chaincode is on the same channel, it simply adds the called
     chaincode read set and write set to the calling transaction.
     If the called chaincode is on a different channel,
     only the Response is returned to the calling chaincode; any PutState calls
     from the called chaincode will not have any effect on the ledger; that is,
     the called chaincode on a different channel will not have its read set
     and write set applied to the transaction. Only the calling chaincode's
     read set and write set will be applied to the transaction. Effectively
     the called chaincode on a different channel is a `Query`, which does not
     participate in state validation checks in subsequent commit phase.
     If `channel` is empty, the caller's channel is assumed.

Hello. I am confused by javascript buffers. When I invoke another chaincode, the return is the following: `<Buffer 08 06 1a 8c 01 08 c8 01 1a 86 01 7b 22 63 6f 6d 70 61 6e 79 22 3a 22 69 62 6d 22 2c 22 65 6d 61 69 6c 22 3a 22 61 40 69 62 6d 2e 63 6f 6d 22 2c 22 66 ... >`
But I can't find a way to convert this in JSON and use it. Could someone help me? (tried JSON.parse, gives error, tried toString(), gives basically the same)
The function in the queried chaincode returns its data as bytes (no transformation done)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=DB7CgKP5KCBJC5avC) @mahoney1 Tried it. But it returns me : `SyntaxError: Unexpected token . in JSON at position 0`
My queried cc returns the following: `return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(stringQueryResult));`
The cc querying is doing this: `console.log("L55 " + JSON.parse(basicReturn.toString()));`
If I just `.toString` the return, it gives me` .protos.response`
</p>
<p><strong>florianc</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 10:59:54 GMT):<br/>
The most troubling stuff is that if I just query the cc with the nodejs SDK (channel.queryByChaincode(request);) I can read the content just with a `.toString()`

florianc, since you're using javascript, haven't you considered using Convector? https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/convector
the idea is to let you still write your custom javascript code, but with all this base problems solved for you already, you just need to focus on what you actually need instead of being solving buffer conversions, check it out ;)

Hi all, I am implementing a chaincode with golang and I would like to know what is the best way to register an asset safely on someones identity, is it best to use GetID() from the cid .go library, or is it better to use the cid library to extract the public key from the certificate and register the asset on this?

Hi everyone, Is there a way to sort the results in golang chaincode against couchdb?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 25 Mar 2019 10:35:30 GMT):<br/>
@rohitkhatri  You can include a `sort` in the couchdb query string, see syntax here: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/find.html. Note that you will also need an index that includes the filter and sort fields. See instructions for queries and index creation in the tutorial: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/couchdb_tutorial.html

Thanks for reply @dave.enyeart, below is the query that already includes `sort` parameter, but It's not working and I have also declared index on couchdb

```
{
    "selector": {
        "status": "pending"
    },
    "sort": [
        {"created_at": "desc"}
    ]
}
```

It works when executed directly in couchdb, but not in chaincode. In chaincode, It gives random results.

- And on receiving the event, there still has to be checked if the transaction was valid on the peer? Receiving an event does not mean that the tx was comitted to the world state, right?

@braduf the best description of how the event is received and type of the fields in the event is shown here -> https://fabric-shim.github.io/master/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html#setEvent__anchor . SetEvent saves the event to be sent when a transaction is made part of a block and for that it needs to be committed. The payload can be generated for example from stringified JSON as shown in this 1.4 example [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54981807/hyperledger-fabric-1-4-how-to-emit-events-from-the-smart-contract-chaincode-u)

                //results.push(JSON.parse(res.value.value.toString('utf-8')));
            }
            

            if (res.done) {
                try {
                    resultIterator.close();

I've tryed to modify ACL and Writers Policies in the configtx but then, even `peer chaincode query` command starts to fail. Endoresemnt policy also does not helps me, on chaincode_example02. Maybe I need somehow to perform check in cheincode itself, like who was creator of the transactions?

High level ideas and design can be obtained following https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11144 and the design doc there. A new "token" CLI command is available for easy construction of transactions (haven't cehcked SDK support). Not sure how much of doc is current or ready.  @adc may I bug you to correct and fill in details pretty please :-) ?

Hi! I'm using private data in my chaincode and I'm getting the error bellow:

The same function is running with public data query. Is there any differecen between return objects of `getQueryResult` and `getPrivateDataQueryResult`?

        let resultsIterator = await cto.stub.getPrivateDataQueryResult(collection, queryString);
        let results = await this.getAllResults(resultsIterator);

        return results;

```
to:

Hi all,
GetState does not consider data which has been modified by PutState (in the same transaction). I understand why that is. What is the best way to get the modified state?
Is there a chaincode interface available? My approach would be to introduce a data caching layer between my chaincode and the GetState Function to keep track of changes that are not yet committed.

Did any of you face this issue before? What are your ideas about that?

@anjalinaik many factors to consider (eg, same channel, different channel?)

</p>
<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 09:15:59 GMT):<br/>
@Rajatsharma its invoked by your app client that uses the SDK - an identity is registered/issues for the user and uses that to interact with the smart contract (packaged and installed as chaincode) - suggest to read https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/tutorial/commercial_paper.html#application-structure and the accompanying sample app client for this smart contract is here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.4/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=hHqXaeqN3iwLct9oL) @mahoney1 Actually, my query was a bit different 
You know there are two methods to invoke a chaincode : 

1) We invoke our chaincode directly using cli or SDK
2) Or we could call the chaincode inside another chaincode using `stub.InvokeCHaincode()`.

In my use case I want to find a way so that I can differentiate between these two(inside the chaincode).   
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 11:03:54 GMT):<br/>
I can get the identity of the registering user using `cid` package. But I want a way that I know that my chaincode is being called from another chaincode.

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 13:29:22 GMT):<br/>
@Rajatsharma there is no direct way to get that information... however, you can infer it as follows - get the name of called chaincode from the proposal (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L332), get the called chaincode in the proposal (this is the original proposal received by the peer). If that's different from your chaincode name, then it is called from another chaincode.

Finally I had to get the key by:
```
let proposal = stub.getSignedProposal()
console.log("Signature Header buffer",proposal.proposal.header.signature_header.creator.id_bytes.buffer.toString())

And finally in this buffer I got the name of the chaincode which probably I'll have to parse and get that. Is there any better way to do this ?

I managed to debug chaincode in dev mode (without spawning any docker containers) via unit tests. I use fabric-node-sdk to create the chaincode. It did successfully debug the chaincode much faster than installing and instantiating it directly within docker containers. However, when I try to put some state i.e. stub.putState, it simply cannot. The state cannot be persisted somewhere within the unit test environment. Is there any proper example of Hyperledger Fabric node-sdk unit tests, specifically for the fabcar example?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 13:25:35 GMT):<br/>
@Rajatsharma the information is not in the header but in the payload (cast to ChaincodeProposalPayload). I haven't done this myslef in nodejs but going by your notation above, would be something like `proposal.proposal.payload.input.chaincode_spec.chaincode_id.name` ... apologize if that doesn;'t translate correctly, but the idea is you have to follow the `proposal.proposal.payload` path instead of `proposal.proposal.header`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 13:30:57 GMT):<br/>

@akshay.lawange likely the original proposal timed out and quit. The chaincode interaction failed subsequently due to the timeout. Increasin the timeout https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L527 or via peer's env var CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMEOUT will lilkely fix your issue

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=vmnJBjFDT2qfSMChu) @SaphiraBjartskular For Go and Java use MockStub API to mock the chaincode transactions. For node, you have to be comfortable with chai and sinon library.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=qAkhLCRJwiHAKRZcz) @muralisr Currently when I console using:

'''
let proposal = stub.getSignedProposal()
let input = proposal.proposal.payload.input
console.log("input",input)
'''

I get:
```
input ByteBuffer {

  offset: 964,
  markedOffset: -1,
  limit: 1001,
  littleEndian: true,
  noAssert: false }
``` 
And I've even tried `JSON.parse(input.buffer.toString())`, even that throws an error. I'm trying in Node but actually even I want to implement this in GO. SO If you know a method in even Go that would be useful. Otherwise, we'll have to parse the string converted buffer and work on that.

@Rajatsharma The input buffer is a protobuf bytearray. The node fabric-shim doesn't decode it. Don't know if the Go Shim decodes it or not either as I don't know if it's guaranteed to be the same type of protobuf for every request @muralisr might now. Your only option would be to decode the protobuf bytearray yourself

Hi, why my query method doent work?

private Response query(ChaincodeStub stub, List<String> params) {
try{
String key = params.get(0);
String state = stub.getStringState(key);
if(state==null) {
return newErrorResponse("Id doesnt exit");
}
_logger.info("STATE--> "+state);
return newSuccessResponse(state);
}catch (Throwable e) {
return newErrorResponse(e);
}
}


When i look "logger.info" i find the spected result, but return statment is always blank
peer chaincode query..... doesnt return nothing

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=AG5CRvroaJ9bibjwq) @florianc Thanks but actually my work was a bit different. I don't need to work on `stub.invokeChaincode()` rather I'm working on `stub.getSignedProposal()` and returned structure is different in both the cases. And I tried the way you've proceeded it's not working for me.

If I am not mistaken, the result you want is after the "mychannel*stuffstuffstuff" part. I still think you have to play with the offset/limit/buffer length to get it right.

@Rajatsharma The contents are input are a google protobuf format. You cannot easily decipher it. You must decode it using the correct protobuf declaration

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=CQhLG5PRRwKc28iEW) I just need the name of the chiancode that is being invoked
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 14:00:52 GMT):<br/>
@Rajatsharma If you look at the following code
```
            let ccpp;
            try {
                ccpp = _proposalProto.ChaincodeProposalPayload.decode(this.proposal.payload);
                decodedSP.proposal.payload = ccpp;
            } catch (err) {
                throw new Error(util.format('Decoding ChaincodeProposalPayload failed: %s', err));
            }
```
What you see if is part of the information being decoded through the protobuf capability that the fabric-shim exploits. This results in the structure that you see with the `input` variable. however the input variable now itself is a bytebuffer of some defined protobuf. If you know the type of protobuf being contained in this field then you can decode it and that would result in an object with a sets with data based on that protobuf. The definition for this protobuf is as follows
```
type ChaincodeProposalPayload struct {
	// Input contains the arguments for this invocation. If this invocation
	// deploys a new chaincode, ESCC/VSCC are part of this field.
	// This is usually a marshaled ChaincodeInvocationSpec
	Input []byte `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=input,proto3" json:"input,omitempty"`
	// TransientMap contains data (e.g. cryptographic material) that might be used
	// to implement some form of application-level confidentiality. The contents
	// of this field are supposed to always be omitted from the transaction and
	// excluded from the ledger.
	TransientMap         map[string][]byte `protobuf:"bytes,2,rep,name=TransientMap,proto3" json:"TransientMap,omitempty" protobuf_key:"bytes,1,opt,name=key,proto3" protobuf_val:"bytes,2,opt,name=value,proto3"`
	XXX_NoUnkeyedLiteral struct{}          `json:"-"`
	XXX_unrecognized     []byte            `json:"-"`
	XXX_sizecache        int32             `json:"-"`
}
```
And as you see it says the input field is `likely` to be a ChaincodeInvocationSpec, so you need to decode it using that definition. The problem is that in your chaincode you would have to scaffold all the required capability to be able to decode this bytebuffer correctly in the same way that the shim code does it.

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 14:03:32 GMT):<br/>
The fabric-shim probably doesn't decode the input for you because based on the comment you cannot assume it will always be a ChaincodeInvocationSpec
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 14:06:36 GMT):<br/>
I got your point. Thanks for helping me out. The only point I'm doing all this is because there's no way we can differentiate if a call to a chaincode is coming directly or using `stub.invokeChaincode()` from another chaincode.

I would suggest you look at writing it in Go. The Go shim may do a comprehensive job of decoding this more for you

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 14:07:59 GMT):<br/>
Or you could raise a Jira on fabric-shim to decode the signed proposal more but I don't know when someone might look into implementing that
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 14:09:17 GMT):<br/>
I'll write in go only. I'll convert the proposal to String and retrieve my chaincode name. That seems pretty easy and will work fine for me. And I've raised a JIRA already but there's no response on that. So i'll proceed like this only.
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 14:09:30 GMT):<br/>
Thanks anyways, buddy !!!
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 14:11:44 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if the Go shim does provide any extra decoding or whether you still would have to decode it yourself however
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 14:12:32 GMT):<br/>
It does give me the capability to normally have my proposal as a string. I'll use that only.
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 14:12:59 GMT):<br/>
It's just that I was trying to find a better way of doing that.

Makes me think about a " problem" I got back then, where I saw that querying from nodejs sdk returned in a given format, but invoking the same query from chaincode did not return it with the same format. Kind of weird.
</p>
<p><strong>SaphiraBjartskular</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 17:59:44 GMT):<br/>
OK, I am having a very weird issue with my chaincode. When I install new version of chaincode it is not being run, some old cached version is being run even though the new container has the correct version number.  Inside the chaincode docker container how can I see exactly what chaincode is being run?

<p><strong>SaphiraBjartskular</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 22:02:48 GMT):<br/>
Even after stopping and removing network containers, removing the shared volumes, I cannot reuse the same chaincodeID and version. There must be a cache somewhere I am not clearing- any ideas?

@SaphiraBjartskular I think you are running into stale docker image (not container) ...did you try removing the image with `docker rmi ...` ?

Hi, I have a peer deployed on AWS, the peer has successfully joined a channel and installed a chaincode. Now when I try to instantiate the chaincode, I get the following error as a response in the cli:
`Error: could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg chaincode registration failed: container exited with 0`

If I check the logs of the endorsing peer of the transaction I see the following logs:

hi everyone, I am writing chaincode in nodejs using fabric-contract-api. I want to know how to pass values to constructor while instantiating ?

@muralisr  How do we resolve the cauthsdl dependency in chaincode when implementing the key based endorsement policy?

Can you elaborarte @ranjan008  ?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 12:36:26 GMT):<br/>
@itg1996 You can't pass arguments to the constructor. Also when the constructor is run there is no transaction context so no interaction with state can be done. You will have to have an initialisation function. As you say anyone could run that initialisation function so you would need to put some protection in to stop that from happening. For example you could use attribute based access control to restrict who can run it or read the world state and see if the system has already been initialised and just return without doing anything
</p>
<p><strong>ranjan008</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 12:47:06 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr  I am trying to set key level endorsement policy in my chaincode and since it take byte array for the policy I am getting policy as string and converting it into bytes for which I needed cauthsdl library from the fabric but when I try to install and instantiate the chaincode image doesn't gets created because of dependencies.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=KdrK6A7YnCexhYTof) @muralisr The thing that solved the problem was using the public IP in the CORE_PEER_CHAINCODEADDRESS instead of the container name or 0.0.0.0. Can you explain why exactly? Because both the chaincode container and peer container are run on the same host, so why is the public ip needed there? Thanks a lot!

stub.createCompositeKey() creates an object not a string... the documentation claims the method returns a string that is usable as in input parameter to putState() but this has not been the case for me. Anyone else seen this issue?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=EE7XrpbyRu9cJYkmJ) @davidkel let keysarray = [farmAsset.farmID, farmAsset.pID];
let compKey = stub.createCompositeKey(FARMASSETTYPE, keysarray);

where farmID and pID are both strings.... i did add the .toString() method and it fixed the problem so the function does work properly, I guess what I thought were strings were objects? 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Sat, 13 Apr 2019 08:22:08 GMT):<br/>
@SaphiraBjartskular Ok, but unfortunately from your example there isn't enough info to try to recreate. But even if I pass objects in I still get  a string back that looks like `[object Object][object Object][object Object]` so still cannot see how you get an object back but if you have a soln now that great.

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 14:47:37 GMT):<br/>
@Rajatsharma treating the propoal as a string or byte array to look for information is error prone (to say the least). The byte array correponds to a protobuf structure. So the right approach would be to to deserialize the byte array to that protobuf struct and access any fields you like.  There are many examples (could be some in samples but haven't checked).  Essentially "unmarshal" in GO like this -  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/protos/utils/proputils.go#L193

Hi Guys.
I'm getting an error during a query:

Is there any incompatibility for naming fields with "`$`" or with the word "`$class`"?

https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions
Restrictions on Field Names
Field names can contain dots (i.e. .) and dollar signs (i.e. $). However, only nested field names may start with a dollar sign. For example, attempting to insert { "a" : { "$b": 1 } } will succeed but attempting to insert {"$a": 1} results in error.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=SRwNDXTzirpoCoeMS) @muralisr Thanks Now It has worked !!! I had tried this as a demo but it's working perfectly fine. 
```
    proposal, _ := stub.GetSignedProposal()
    propBytes := proposal.GetProposalBytes()
    prop := &pb.Proposal{}
    proto.Unmarshal(propBytes, prop)
    propPayload := &pb.ChaincodeProposalPayload{}
    proto.Unmarshal(prop.Payload, propPayload)
    fmt.Println("payload", propPayload.Input)
    cis := &pb.ChaincodeInvocationSpec{}
    proto.Unmarshal(propPayload.Input, cis)
    fmt.Println(cis.ChaincodeSpec.ChaincodeId.Name)

```

anytime!

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 13:14:55 GMT):<br/>
(the above is probably a quick/dirty test to check ... but you'll kikely add error check for Unmarshal ? ...while its unlikely to get an error, which would indicate something seriously wrong in the shim flow, its good to catch that than assume it'll always give you right result)

There is no value attribute on the StateQueryIterator object according to my print statement- there is a response attr with a results array though..

Hey everyone, I'm trying to set up events using the nodejs sdk. The events are getting recognized properly, but they have no payload, although I can see in the chaincode container logs the event was emitted with a payload. Is there any special config on client to request the event payload?
</p>
<p><strong>diestrin</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 03:18:21 GMT):<br/>
So the solution was (in case someone has the same problem) passing `true` or `{full_block:true}` in the EventHub.connect method

<p><strong>zacpl</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 09:03:57 GMT):<br/>
Hi all - I'm trying to develop tests for a GO chaincode that uses Private Data Collections & found that they fail because mocking isn't supported for (for example) GetPrivateDataByPartialCompositeKey.

Then I found this issue on jira that seems like it would sort me out: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6717

But the issue was abandoned last June.

Does anyone know why?
</p>
<p><strong>zacpl</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 09:17:14 GMT):<br/>
Just to clarify: of the mocks in the issue GetPrivateData & PutPrivateData work well - but GetPDByPartialCompositeKey fails.

Wondering if anyone has had a similar issue & whether anything related was flagged during development.

Hi,

I'm creating a chaincode in golang where my transaction need to read a file in order to  complete. But when i try to read the file i get following error message:
"no such file or directory". That path is added to the docker volumes.

So anybody can please help why I'm getting this error even though the path is  correct or do i need to add something in yaml file.

Thanks

Hi could someone help me understand stub.invokeChaincode()? I would like to query channel1 from channel2. When the chaincode on channel2 is  invoked, it does succesfully call chaincode from channel1 however a shim.error is still returned... 
calling chaincode Invoke() returned error response [Err: Error: INVOKE_CHAINCODE failed: transaction ID: 665167f6a938d84060ca7e7678e1d36e7e638beee1a359e1ae315f00e315364c: Failed to get policy manager for channel [channel1]]. Sending ERROR message back to peer

Hey everyone,

Is there a way to access transaction name while fetching history of particular key using `GetHisotryForKey`, It returns the payload but doesn't return `func` name.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=AttLtG9ZCFb4W4pNY) @rohitkhatri These are the functions available https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult#KeyModification with `GetHistoryForKey`. So you can fetch the transactionID and that key's value for that transaction. And history associated to that key.
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Thu, 25 Apr 2019 09:50:11 GMT):<br/>
Is there anyway we could get a iterator from current value instead of starting value while using `GetHistoryForKey`. Because for my use case I just want the value just before the current value but even for that I'll need to run a lot of iterations. That does not seem okay to me, normal logic-wise. Maybe I'm not aware about golang. Could anyone help me out.
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Thu, 25 Apr 2019 09:52:28 GMT):<br/>
The thing is I'm writing a function to revert a key to it's previous version like a rollback. But using this function I have to run a lot of iterations which are of no use. moreover the number of iterations will increase as the writes on that key will increase. So this does not seem a feasible solution.

@muralisr can you please help me on the Private Data Reconciliation?
</p>
<p><strong>sgaddam</strong> (Thu, 25 Apr 2019 11:49:24 GMT):<br/>
Hi,

*I am able to fetch the Private data in the initial setup 2Orgs 2 peers. However in the newly added peer i am unable to fetch the reconciled private data.*
 
I will eloborate my work in Private Data Reconciliation. Please suggest me if i am doing wrong in my process.

I have a blockchain network with 2 Orgs each with 2 Peers along with 1 Orderer.
I have a channel for 2 Orgs. I tried like below..
	- Initially the Org1Peer0 and Org2Peer0 have joined the Channel. After that, installed, instantiated, Invoked and Queried Private Data. Its working fine.
	- Later, the new peer Org1Peer1 joined to the channel. And also configured with the below options in the .bashrc file for Org1Peer0. But not added the below options in Peer0's of 2 Orgs.
			- export CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_PVTDATA_RECONCILIATIONENABLED=true
			- export CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_PVTDATA_RECONCILESLEEPINTERVAL=1m
	- After that i tried to query the reconciled private data. But i end up with errors.
	- To make simplify the process, i take only 1 Org with 2 peers to test the Privated Data Reconciliation.
			- I stopped Org1 Peer1 but Org1 Peer0 is already in running mode. I added the Reconciliation options in both the peers in a .bashrc file.
			- I installed new chaincode in Org1Peer0 and then instantiated, invoked couple of private data and then queryied the data. The private data is returning properly.
			- Now i started Org1Peer1 and installed the new chaincode in this node. Then i tried querying the reconciled data. But i end up with the same errors provided you earlier.

Below is the collection config which i used for the 1 Org scenario.
[
 {
	 "name": "collectionPurchaseOrders",
	 "policy": "OR('Org1MSP.member')",
	 "requiredPeerCount": 0,
	 "maxPeerCount": 3,
	 "blockToLive":1000000,
	 "memberOnlyRead": true
},
 {
	 "name": "collectionPrivatePurchaseOrders",
	 "policy": "OR('Org1MSP.member')",
	 "requiredPeerCount": 0,
	 "maxPeerCount": 3,
	 "blockToLive":0,
	 "memberOnlyRead": true
 }
]

			
Can you please suggest me if i have anything wrong in the above steps or configurations?

Hi, quick question. I have a network with 4 organizations (A, B, C and D) each one of them own one peer connected to the same channel CH1. A transaction normally involves two organizations, my question is: Given my network architecture is there a way to only distribute a transaction to the participant peer nodes? Say for example B creates a transaction involving B and C so the transaction should only be distributed to peerB and peerC, peerA and peerD shouldn't have a copy of that transaction in their ledgers.

Is there a way to do this without creating a second channel CH2 and joining peerB and peerC to it? I don't want to do this because it would become a mess creating and managing multiple channels for each organization combination (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD) and so on each time a new organization joins the network.

Thanks!

You could use channels @armandolf or you could use private data that is created specifically for that need! Here's an example: https://hackernoon.com/understanding-blockchain-private-data-a-hands-on-example-eacc3efe4ad6

what's the difference between this two?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 04 May 2019 20:58:24 GMT):<br/>
one has to do with endorsement needed for the "commit" phase and the other for the endorsement of the instantiation
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 04 May 2019 20:58:56 GMT):<br/>
the former was not there in the old model and the later defaulted to admin
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 04 May 2019 21:01:50 GMT):<br/>
in a sense this policy definition is core to the new LC model and the fact that we now can specifcy endorsement policy for instantiating the CC (just as we used to be able to do for invokes should give you the "aha" needed for understanding the new LC)

Hi friends, I am thinking about calling an executable binary from my chaincode. I have searched widely and only found several similar discussions. But it seems fabric officially does not support the integration of pre-compiled executable in chaincode. Can you please providing some hints what I can do? The purpose is to protect the property right of a part of the chaincode. Thanks!

@Smithereens  `client certificate` needs to be qualified. If that;s an application level identity that's passed to chaincode via arguments then upto you to validate. I assume though you are referring to the the identity associated with the proposal sender. This context is available in each proposal call (Invoke) in the chaincode. golang chaincode provides a library to help with this. See `Chaincode access control` in https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/chaincode4ade.html

<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Sun, 05 May 2019 20:38:42 GMT):<br/>
Could anyone explain what do we mean when we say that we register a user and enroll a user, in terms of fabric. 
I get the point that at registration the user is registered at Fabric-CA and we get the secret in return.
And when we enroll we use that secret to process the request and we get the certificate in return. 

The thing is I wanted to get a bit more clear on this, because I'm getting a lots of questions. When are the certificates actually generated, and when we essentially follow up registration with enrollment, why are these 2 steps separate. So please if anyone could explain this to me a bit more, or help me gain clarity in this. 
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Sun, 05 May 2019 20:46:55 GMT):<br/>
The thing is I'm appending certain attributes with the user while registration, which I need when using the chaincode. But even after the user is registered and enrolled I want to add certain attributes, which I'll again use in my chaincode. I'm not able to do that as even when I use:
```
const caClient = fabricClient.getCertificateAuthority();
const identityService = await caClient.newIdentityService();
const identityService = await caClient.newIdentityService();
const adminUser = await fabricClient.getUserContext('admin', true);
const reqObject = {attrs: [{"name": "Key", "value": userAttributes}]};
identityService.update(username, reqObject, adminUser);
```
The attributes get appended in the Fabric CA when I go and list them in that server. But when I use that user to call the chaincode these attributes don't appear. Probably there's some issue with the context. So if anyone could help me anywhere. Thanks !
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=5zzAzXWSSq7fSJAGW) even mgmt is imported into chaincode, the creator.validate can't work because chaincoded can not  access ledger directly and must through peers. However, the peers have no such interface to understand them. That is, it is imossible to use other api except stub api

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=cnhxSgzA69Ga9TEgF) @Rajatsharma There are 2 possible problems you have:
1. After you update an identity, you need to enroll again to get the new certificate containing the new attributes.
2. You need to make sure that your attributes are included in the certificate.  So in your code you need to include ecert: true e.g.
`{name: "location",value: "London",ecert: true}`

Hi, I'm creating my own chaincode written in GOLANG.
My network is in 1.3v and I use couchdb.
The problem is this: when I do an invoke of chaincode it returns a Status 200 (all correct) and it is reflected in the block (since it increases in 1 its depth) but when I make a query it tells me that the saved data does not exist
</p>

How the chaincode container marked idle and resumed. As i see if there is no chaincode interaction request, chaincode container got disappeared from `docker ps`.

Hi All, I just want to know that how ordering service verify that transaction proposal response (R,W Set )sent by client is same as proposal response sent by endorsement peer to client.
Is there any possibility that client can modify R, W set in tx proposal response? 
It would be great to hear your view.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 16:46:44 GMT):<br/>
@shyam 40 Each endorsing peer signs the proposal response. This ensures that the data was not tampered. Additionally, the proposal response must match across all N endorsing peers as specified in the endorsement policy. Note that these validations are performed by all peers at block validation/commit time (ordering service is only responsible for ordering transactions into blocks).

@govindamble  have you checked the status of your CA server (:7054 above) using `docker ps` to see if its down?  Otherwise - if its up, you might want to see what IP its listening on by checking the logs using `docker logs <ca container id>` etc.

Hi there,
I am having a mind-boggling issue with a simple fabric deployment setup.
I have a fully dockerized deployment setup that does not behave in a similar fashion on different computers, which I do not understand. It works fine on one machine but fails on another. More specifically, it fails when instancing the chaincode. I could get a quick look at the logs in the half second that my dev-peer.. is up and the problem is with the chaincode itself apparently. I see that one of the js module is not loaded and is causing the entire thing to fail. 
I do not understand why it works on one computer and yet will not load that one specific file from the chaincode folder on another computer... Any idea whatsoever is very welcome

Let me clarify:

- on the same channel, chaincode calling chaincode can both query and invoke
- across channels, chaincode can only query chaincode

So in your scenario, if you are within a single channel things will work

Hey so I know when add a new smart contract to a channel, only one peer needs to call `instantiate()` on it. When adding peers to a channel, do all peers need to call `initialize()` or only 1 peer can do so
</p>
<p><strong>varunagarwal</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:07:05 GMT):<br/>
you can use `ClientIdentity` api to get info on the peer who signed the transaction, their x509 certificate and their mspId
</p>
<p><strong>varunagarwal</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:07:38 GMT):<br/>
it is part of the `fabric-client` API and can be accessed directly from it.
</p>
<p><strong>florianc</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:08:26 GMT):<br/>
He is asking inside the chaincode, not on the client side :S
</p>
<p><strong>varunagarwal</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:09:39 GMT):<br/>
yes inside the chaincode. Refer to this https://github.com/IBM/decentralized-energy-fabric-on-IBP20/blob/master/contract/lib/my-contract.js#L72-L85
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>florianc</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:12:46 GMT):<br/>
I think this is not what he is looking for. He whishes to know what is the current peer on which the chaincode is ran. Not who is the transaction sender. (unless I misunderstood)
</p>
<p><strong>varunagarwal</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:13:24 GMT):<br/>
ya I am a bit confused on that as well
</p>
<p><strong>varunagarwal</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:17:16 GMT):<br/>
@florianc Do you know about channels? I understood how to define and add them, but do all peers need to call initialize on them? Or can one peer call it and then the rest just join.
</p>
<p><strong>florianc</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:20:47 GMT):<br/>
If you talk about your previous question, I did not answer because I am not 100% sure, but from my understanding:
When you install a chaincode on a peer and then instantiate it, all peers currently in the channel get the chaincode (well, not directly, it's a bit more complex than that, but to make it clear, lets say it like this).
When you join a peer, the peer catches up with the channel state (basically, get all blocks from other peers, including configuration blocks), so you do not need (FROM MY UNDERSTANDING, I MAY BE WRONG) to init your chaincode again. (It would not make sens, as the init transaction is already somewhere in previous transactions)
</p>
<p><strong>varunagarwal</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:22:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes that is correct. But I am talking about when a channel is being created before adding chaincode. As per the `Channel` APIs over https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.4/Channel.html I can't find a function called initialize(), but in https://github.com/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/web/www/blockchain/utils.js#L107 they are calling the function....
</p>
<p><strong>varunagarwal</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:23:14 GMT):<br/>
nvm sorry
</p>
<p><strong>florianc</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:24:16 GMT):<br/>
You found it?
</p>
<p><strong>varunagarwal</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:25:22 GMT):<br/>
Its this https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.4/Channel.html#initialize__anchor
but cant find info on whether all peers have to call it or not. In the example I posted IBM is calling it by all peers, but when I commented out the code and used only peer to call it, the app works
</p>
<p><strong>florianc</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:27:06 GMT):<br/>
Well, can't help you on that unfortunately, I don't know either :(
</p>
<p><strong>varunagarwal</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 12:27:38 GMT):<br/>
because for the chaincode they have used only one peer to call it, Which is as per the documentation. Well I will keep searching and testing it out.

    var crypto_store = Fabric_Client.newCryptoKeyStore({path: store_path});
    crypto_suite.setCryptoKeyStore(crypto_store);
    fabric_client.setCryptoSuite(crypto_suite);

    // get the enrolled user from persistence, this user will sign all requests

    // get a transaction id object based on the current user assigned to fabric client
    tx_id = fabric_client.newTransactionID();

You need this:
  ` event_hub.connect(true);`
Pass true if you want unfiltered events, it is false by default (and then you won't get much info)

Hi All, is is it possible to call a function within the same chaincode?
in javascript you can just do `this.otherFunction()` but for some reason I get undefined error back
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:15:22 GMT):<br/>
Yes you can... but check what context .. this might be undefined if you've not got a class for example..
</p>
<p><strong>zwartesokken</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:16:20 GMT):<br/>
I have a Chaincode class. Do you have an example. I'm not sure what you mean with context. 
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:16:58 GMT):<br/>
Javascript context is what the `this`  resolves to.
</p>
<p><strong>zwartesokken</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:18:51 GMT):<br/>
Ah you mean javascript context.
in a 'normal es6 class' I can do this

```
class Whatever() {
 async func1() {}

async func2(){
  this.func1()
}
}

```
But this doesnt work with chaincode. It tells me the function is undefined
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:20:15 GMT):<br/>
yes; I know this works with the contract-api approach... are you using the init/invoke api?
</p>
<p><strong>zwartesokken</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:20:46 GMT):<br/>
yes, the init/invoke approach 
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:21:52 GMT):<br/>
would have expected that to work really... what shim version have you got?
</p>
<p><strong>zwartesokken</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:22:32 GMT):<br/>
`1.4.0`
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:23:17 GMT):<br/>
I'd suggest doing a `util.inspect(this)` and see exactly what you get;
</p>
<p><strong>zwartesokken</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:43:48 GMT):<br/>
I did `console.log(util.inspect(this, { depth: null }));`
and I get `undefined`, which is weird but also not unsurprising I guess.
I think something else is going wrong
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:44:05 GMT):<br/>
indeed.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:45:49 GMT):<br/>
you've got `shim.start(new Chaincode());` somewhere?
</p>
<p><strong>zwartesokken</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:46:55 GMT):<br/>
yes. I think i'm not passing the context or something
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:51:33 GMT):<br/>
not sure what's up I'm afraid without getting logs or trying to recreate..

I had a running fabric network which was producing a lot of data from very long, but suddenly today I started encountering this error, in my orderer:
```

The peer is giving Service unavailable. And Kafka is giving this error:

Hi, guys. It it possible to use Java Frameworks (i.e. Spring) inside (!) Fabric 1.4 Java Chaincode? I want to use Spring State Machine to handle state transitions inside my contract, and it plays extremely well with Spring Framework for IoC and DI.
Is there any examples how to integrate Spring IoC with HLF CC?
Thanks in advance!

Hi, I am working on a Voting app PoC on HLF 1.4. This is my first implementation. Can someone help with user registration approach? I know I could have used Composer to model the participants. But with HLF, how do I enroll candidates? Does users/participants need to be added explicitly as an entities in DB?
</p>
<p><strong>tommparekh</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 12:16:35 GMT):<br/>
also, how do I issue these users an identity to interact with the network?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 13:23:16 GMT):<br/>
@DVasin I haven't worked with Java CC recently but the goal of the chaincode model in general is to allow dev freedom at various levels...so I'd assume this is possible. In any case, I'll copy your question to #fabric-java-chaincode 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 13:43:25 GMT):<br/>
@tommparekh re voting app.. basic consideration is based on the fact that fabric operates as a permissioned network with identities of the transactors (users sending proposals and transactions) known to the fabric as part of channel. If you consider a "vote" as a transaction on a channel, the user sending the tx has to be known to the network. Two main cases and everything stemming from that. (1) voters are members of the organization registered on the channel (2) voters are "outside of the organization" whose identities are not directly known to fabric and the registered orgnaization serves those external voters by acting as their proxy voter. In (1) you could use the fabric-ca to create and enroll candidates and have their identities known to fabric. In (2) the organization would manage the identities of the voters using traditional approaches outside of fabric and could pass it on as application (chaincode) level artifact to be saverd on the ledger (in this case you can also obscure the identities to preserve some degree of anonymithy but do so in a provable manner to maintain the integrity of blockchain - in this case, integrity of voting).  As an aside I'd also look at fabric's idemix features and usecases and see if that offers more possibilities.  Also I'd check in #fabric-crypto for guidance

@muralisr, thanks for your response. very helpful in clearing my doubt. Yes, my use case uses 2nd option ie voters are part of the org registered and have a node on a fabric network. Based on your suggestion I understood that voters can be managed by the respective orgs using their identity solution and blockchain only records 'reference identity' to ensure no duplicate voting and to trace if the voting was done by a user. With this approach, all the transaction would come from only 1 (org) user though right?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 16:21:59 GMT):<br/>
@tommparekh yes, in that approach the transaction woukld be initiated by the members of the org (the 1 user if you have configured it that way) 
</p>

Suggestions on design - voting window will be usually a specific start and end date/time (say time to make it simple). Should open/close of voting window managed by blockchain layer or external application? Does HLF have any timer function to track certain events (like voter has not voted by mid of the window and hence an event can be generated)
</p>
<p><strong>tommparekh</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 23:42:40 GMT):<br/>
not sure if this (timer) question is a good fit into blockchain but just curious about ways to handle the use case

And I can trace from the chaincode that it throws an error "ERROR [lib/handler.js] Calling chaincode Invoke() returned error response [Error:xxx]. Sending ERROR message back to peer". However, from node sdk, the proposal response gives me "{"status":500,"payload":{"type":"Buffer","data":[]},"isProposalResponse":true}".

When you're in a production environment, is it vitally important to keep all of the previous versions of your chaincode which have been used to build the current worldstate?
</p>
<p><strong>florianc</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 06:22:57 GMT):<br/>
From my understanding, now. The world state is built based on the transactions in the ledger, they contain read/write set. The chaincode is used only for endorsement purpose.

In Hyperledger Fabric Version 1.4.1 demonstrate the 'paper network' application tutorial development.
In chiancode development, It use "Node.JS" language to develop chaincode. And it extends 'Contract class' (fabric-contract-api). 

My question is if I would like to develop chaincode with 'Golang', where can i refer 'Contract' api like 'fabric-contract-api' in node.js ?
I refereed 'https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#Chaincode' and it does not have 'Contract' class.

In fabric document says 'Go' tutorial will be release later the sample. 

But I would like to know about current 'Go' api support the 'contract' or not. ??

With regards,

@PyiTheinKyaw AFAIK, not yet. Java SDK work to match Node SDK is also in-progress (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FGJ-1). There should be a ticket for Go implementation in the Fabric Jira, but I could not locate one with a quick search.

Hello; when we did the Node.js implementation, we also prototyped a golang version (https://github.com/awjh-ibm/fabric-go-developer-api).  This is usable and there if you wish to try, but it is a prototype. Currently Java support is in progress.  We certainly want to do golang - just a case of getting to it.

Hi All, anyone know if is possible (and how) a Channel / Peers REQUERIES that the chaincode Must be signed before install/instantiate ?

There is a new Chaincode Lifecycle for Fabric 2.0 (in Alpha testing at the moment) it is described here:
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode.html
and here:
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4noah.html
It covers how chaincodes are agreed and committed.

Hi all, I have set an event in Chaincode by using SetEvent() function after putstate, now is there a way to check whether the even has been created or not.
</p>
<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 09:16:37 GMT):<br/>
yes, there's an example of listening for chaincode events (see Chaincode event listener) in the docs -> https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-channel-events.html

Allow me to ask some information which related with 'Private Data Collection'.

While creating the 'PDCDefination.json' configuration file in 'Private Data Collection', there are a lot of valid attribute like 'name, policy, requiredPeerCount, maxPeerCount, blockToLive, memberOnlyRead' attribute.
I refered 'https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/private_data_tutorial.html#pd-read-write-private-data'

In those, i confuse about 'blockToLive'. My Question is - 
If the time set up in 'blockToLive' is out, that private block data will be removed permentally or not.

May be I misunderstanding upon this document.
Please make me correct if was wrong.

Best Regards,
PTK

Once the 'blockToLive' number of blocks have passed, the private data of a transaction will be removed from the private state database and will no long be accessible via chaincode on the peer. The hash of the private data is what is on the main blockchain, and this will remain forever as evidence that the private data existed, but it is not be possible to reconstruct the private data from the hash.

I am getting the below error while installing the chaincode in the multinode network. 
Earlier it was working fine with the other chaincodes. Suddenly it stopped installing the chaincode and getting the below error.

Your help will be greatly appreciated.

Hi Team, 
I am facing one strange issue with chaincode. I have one function in smart contract which gets asset record value from ledger based on asset key and based on the result, it create the asset record if it is not there and doesn't create the record if its already there and we have sub asset records for every asset record. The asset record data is coming from legacy systems one by one to blockchain ledger through invokation. What i found is that sometimes subsequent sub asset record is not getting stored for the asset record for which there is already at least one sub asset record for the same asset record stored on ledger in previous invokation request.

Hi experts. In the fabric-samples/commercial-paper, Chaincode uses classes “state” and “statelist” to put/get states. They generate composite keys, serialize/deserialize state, and call ChaincodeShim.
These classes seem useful for many use cases because developers can focus on the business logic. I found some projects using the same classes in Github.
Is there any plan to add these classes as a common library to fabric-contract-api?

How do I install a nodejs chaincode using the peer install command inside a docker container? The documentation says for go we use $GOPATH but for node we provide the absolute path. The chaincode is outside in my root directory of my repo. 
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 09:01:36 GMT):<br/>
If you are running your containers locally with Docker Compose, then the easiest way is to map the folder of the source chaincode into the container.

I'm using `GetQueryResultWithPagination()` function and I'm sending query `{"fields":[],,"selector":{"doc_type":"record","record_field":{"age":{"$eq":1}}}}` while this runs comfortably on couchdb mango query this is not running through the function `GetQueryResultWithPagination()`. As peer appends `"_id","~version","_id","~version"` in `field`. And I don't get ideally the data I should get from couchDB. I don't think this should be the expected behavior of this function.

I was using `GetQueryResultWithPagination()` of the shim, and I had passed a query, `{"fields":[],,"selector":{"doc_type":"record","record_field":{"age":{"$eq":1}}}}`. While this query runs on the couchDB without any issues it's not running using `GetQueryResultWithPagination()`, as fabric appends `"_id","~version","_id","~version"` to the field attribute. Ideally I should get all the data displayed when I use that query but currently I'm getting empty JSON. This should not be the ideal behavior of this function.

Question: If during the chaincode execution you write a key, value pair with putState, and later, during the same execution you read it with getState, did the state change or it doesn't change until the transaction is validated and commited?
</p>
<p><strong>jlcs</strong> (Mon, 03 Jun 2019 15:22:12 GMT):<br/>
I think it is changed because of this test: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/eca1b14b7e3453a5d32296af79cc7bad10c7673b/core/chaincode/shim/mockstub_test.go#L242

@jlcs chaincode operations do not allow "read your writes" in the same proposal call. So if the mock suggests that, I'd ignore it

<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 09:24:06 GMT):<br/>
If you have the exact same Key - then your plate will overwrite your marble when you putState() - the answer for you may be to use *Composite Keys* 
There are methods createCompositeKey(), splitCompositeKey() and getStateByPartialCompositeKey() - described here: https://fabric-shim.github.io/release-1.4/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html
</p>
<p><strong>alokkv</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 09:33:40 GMT):<br/>
thank you for the replay.so this doctype will not put my two assets in different layers?can you explain me what is this doctype
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 10:16:49 GMT):<br/>
With the Marbles Sample - the Doctype is just an attribute the same as Owner so it does not form part of the key.
Having just checked the Marbles sample does use Composite Keys already:
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.4/chaincode/marbles02/node/marbles_chaincode.js#L109
You could include the Doctype in the composite key to allow both "types" (plate and marble) to be stored with the same duplicate colour, name, index number.
The Commercial Paper sample has a method of storing multiple types by using a namespace (although I think it only stores 1 type!) . - this section of the Developing Applications document explains how it works: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developapps/architecture.html#

Hi people!
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 10:50:06 GMT):<br/>
Anyone knows why I'm getting this error when I try to upgrade my chaincode? `could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg cannot get package for chaincode (Contract:0.2.0)`
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 10:51:52 GMT):<br/>
If I check if the chaincode is installed in the peer, it exists:
```
root@a36d3d12190f:/opt/gopath/src# peer chaincode list --installed
Name: Contract, Version: 0.1.0, Path: github.com/chaincode, Id: ab278462f184623ec4d21572376c49c22870a7e2b83d32f91ce7ec84be9f0971
```
I'm executing this command to uprgade the chaincode: `peer chaincode upgrade -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C mychannel -n Contract -v 0.2.0 -c '{"Args":[]}' -p github.com/chaincode/`. Thanks in advance!

For two reason: first, it manages a value, so it can increase/decrease it, while I have a struct, so I fill the key and the value. And second, I have a lot of insert, not so many update

well afaik if it is inserts and not updates to differet keys then it shouldnt be an issue. Given fabric tx/s it will take some time to process that much. Better wait for someone more experienced though.

` Failed to handle GET_STATE. error: no ledger context`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:26:29 GMT):<br/>
that typically means the proposal you sent timed out and removed context while the chaincode was still working on stuff
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:26:49 GMT):<br/>
increasing the timeout would likely take care of it
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:28:40 GMT):<br/>
try setting `CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMOUT=<largeseconds>s` (default is 30s)

Where I set it?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:34:31 GMT):<br/>
its an enviroment variable on the peer
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:34:50 GMT):<br/>
or you can directly modify core.yaml (look for "executetimeout")
</p>
<p><strong>root10</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:35:40 GMT):<br/>
Ah ok, I'll try it

<p><strong>root10</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:35:55 GMT):<br/>
Do you suggest me to change something else in core.yaml?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:36:04 GMT):<br/>
not really
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:36:17 GMT):<br/>
how are you running your peer ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:36:42 GMT):<br/>
from docker/docker-composes/k8s ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:36:47 GMT):<br/>
or directly from command line
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:37:12 GMT):<br/>
in general easier to add as env var
</p>
<p><strong>root10</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:38:15 GMT):<br/>
docker-compose, 2 peers, 1 org
</p>
<p><strong>root10</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:38:45 GMT):<br/>
I've wrote a backend in go, so I'm using fabric-sdk-go
</p>
<p><strong>root10</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:40:40 GMT):<br/>
Or in general, have I to set up the network in some way to manage this amount of data?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 14:27:49 GMT):<br/>
ok. so setting CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMOUT env on peer containers in the docker-compose would be the simplest
</p>
<p><strong>root10</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 14:30:13 GMT):<br/>
Time suggested?
</p>
<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 14:36:28 GMT):<br/>
@root10 try 120s ? see example here -> https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/dockerenv/docker-compose.yaml#L114 the variable is `CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMEOUT` fyi
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 14:47:56 GMT):<br/>
you can make it as large as uyou like @root10 ... its an upper limit for waiting for completion,
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 14:48:52 GMT):<br/>
once you get a feel for actual time taken can reduce it appropriately so yiu don;'t wait long for a misbehaving execution

<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 12:19:59 GMT):<br/>
yes you can, quite normal use case, to add a channel to an existing blockchain network. Depending on the context of what you're wanting to achieve (eg. a new org joined the network, but will need to do some smart contract execution on a separate channel, eg with other org(s) etc etc), you should read the docs here -> https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/network/network.html?highlight=channel#adding-a-new-channel for more insights and context.

Thanks in advance
</p>
<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 12:47:08 GMT):<br/>
no, not 'normal' per se, but it could be your batch timeout setting (see https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/config_update.html 'Batch Timeout' for more info). And how many peers are endorsing? I suggest to raise a [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hyperledger-fabric) with details of your  environment/setup, code, architecture brief (where your spring app using the sdk is in relation to peer on the n/work etc), what version of Fabric, OS, memory, CPU spec etc.), you could also examine latency in your env,  using tools like lagscope etc.
</p>

In my running network suddenly orderer has stopped delivering blocks to peer, my transactions are getting processed from SDK externally as it's getting commited from the orderer. The peer syncs all the blocks when I restart the container. There's probably a very small issue. Could anyone please help me out with this ?

Hello.
Is there a way to query all states stored in the world state? If getStateByRange is the only solution, what should be the start and the end key? (and basically, how does this work internally?)
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 08:45:06 GMT):<br/>
Not sure about the internal working, but you can pass empty string for start and end keys which implies  unbounded range query on start or end. You can refer this for more details : https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L107

Hi all. Is there any way to run `dev-*` docker containres manually? I have a network with 2 orgs and each org have 2 peers. When I install/instantiate my chaincodes, it finishes sucessfully. But `dev-*` peers runs only for Org1 and when I am trying to invoke a chaincode, I get `ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE` error because endorsing peer is not running for Org2. Also I tried to instantiate chaincodes for Org2 too, but got an error saying `Error: could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg version already exists for chaincode with name 'mycc'`. Btw, sometime everything goes well and `dev` peers start successfully for both orgs, but it happens very rarely

Hello all, can any one suggest a way to convert "chaincodeInterface" chaincode in .cds format? OR is it necessary the chaincode must be in "contractInterface" created and packaged by ibm blockchain vs code extension? Because to install chaincode on IBM Blockchain Service 2.0 it must be in .cds format? 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 14:45:51 GMT):<br/>
The IBM Blockchain extension for vscode can package any chaincode type into a .cds file, so you shouldn't have to do anything to your chaincode implementation

 I am using private data collection for private transactions. But for any new collection creation i am forced to create and instantiate chaincode with the configuration of the new collection. This is completely contradicting the privacy because now every org need to accept the new collection configuration change and which is private and accessible only between some orgs!!!. Is there anyway to creation new collection as part of the chaincode dynamically and get instantiated only for certain orgs

Hi @davidkel , can you please help to open CouchDB web interface (Fauxton)  like "http://localhost:5984/_utils" in ibm blockchain 2.0 because i want to create indexes in db. i had tried "my-network-address:5984/_utils" but page did not open. i have looked in peer pod's .yaml file where address of couchdb is written as localhost:5984

Indexes should be deployed as part of your chaincode see https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/couchdb_tutorial.html#cdb-add-index

chaincode in IBP 2.0  is installed through console so , how to include indexes in chaincode? Do we have to add same folder structure and file name to added to couchdb or anything else ? 
Secondly, if i have already installed chaincode, is upgrading chaincode and re installing make indexes?

Your indexes are in the directory structure described in the link. These files are included with your chaincode package so would be stored within the .cds file. An example of my project is shown above

Hello. I have a contract with two functions: A and B. B performs a rich query on the world state (getQueryResult(selector)) and I would like to invoke it from A. But I am not able to do it.
`var resByNamesAsArray = JSON.parse(await this.richQuery(stub, nameQuery).toString());`
Fails.
This is with fabric shim 1.2.0 in nodejs.

<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 00:52:23 GMT):<br/>
can I use the CA for authentication in some way? If we have 2 different object types representing users on the chain, namely `Client` and `Agent` -- is it possible to issue them x509 certificates when they're registered and verify they are who they are when calling functions on the API which uses the Fabric SDK Go to talk to the blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 00:53:06 GMT):<br/>
Also, `Client`s and `Agent`s are not techies, how can I have them manage their certificates and somehow add a process to recover their identity if they lose their cert? Im thinking something like the Bitcoin/Ethereum mnemonics for private keys, but im not sure how
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 02:42:33 GMT):<br/>
==========================+
Second question:
If I create a composite key for `Client` for one of their fields, let's say `City`, if the object is updated later using a function in the chaincode which may change the City, do I need to recreate the composite keys or will they still work?
</p>
<p><strong>florianc</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 05:53:04 GMT):<br/>
Having clients managing their keys is never, according to me, a good idea, for the issues you provided above, and because they may not understand their importance and thus transfer it to someone else. Can't you just make it that it that they just see a password, but internally you use it for certificates/others (if that's possible)?

I'm trying to understand re-enroll function in fabric. It's majorly used when certificate of an entity expires and we want new certificates. 
But even then old certificates hold valid. I don't get the point, then what's the point of having a max_enrollment when I could actually reenroll a user multiple times and use all it's certificates. And all it's certificates will be valid.

What exactly happens on "chaincode install"? Why to I have to provide a path here? Is this the parse according to the calling container or according to the called container?

What happens in the background?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:53:27 GMT):<br/>
@mlohr chaincode's original implementation was just golang and fabric was involved in assembiling the chaincode package from GOPATH (which was the original "path"). The "path" became reused for other languages.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:53:27 GMT):<br/>
@mlohr chaincode's original implementation was just golang and fabric was involved in assembiling the chaincode package from GOPATH (which was the original "path"). The "path" became reused for other languages.  ` Is this the parse according to the calling container or according to the called container?` --- the fully assembled package with all requisites is used to construct the binary to be used in the container running the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:54:49 GMT):<br/>
So... fabric is doing the compiling?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:55:42 GMT):<br/>
yes, using the assemebed package
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:56:08 GMT):<br/>
assembled package = compiled go executable or is there "more"?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:56:55 GMT):<br/>
note that the CLI's "install" command has an option to take a fully assembed package (so fabric does not need to package) from user ... this would not require the path option
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:57:26 GMT):<br/>
assembled package == go files with all depencies (in the case of GO chaincode)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:57:42 GMT):<br/>
ie, install does not construct the binary
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:58:12 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=xHMTXMWEjq6mxaj7x) But it's still source code?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:58:18 GMT):<br/>
it is
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:59:36 GMT):<br/>
Ah! So let me try to explain what I understood: peer chaincode install packs my source directory and sends it somehow to the defined peer. The defined peer will try to start a new docker container for the chaincode, puts the package there, compiles and starts it?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:59:52 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:00:12 GMT):<br/>
`The defined peer will try to start a new docker container for the chaincode, puts the package there, compiles and starts it?` -- will happen when there's a need to access the chaincode 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:00:25 GMT):<br/>
(if not already started)

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:01:16 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:01:49 GMT):<br/>
also in other cases ... say chaincode dies or you restart the peer. 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:02:00 GMT):<br/>
chaincode is not restarted automatically
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:02:21 GMT):<br/>
but when an invoke for the chaincode comes in it will start the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:02:27 GMT):<br/>
ie, on demand
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:03:45 GMT):<br/>
do take a look at the `peer chaincode package` and `peer chaincode install <just the package from the package command>` as well which gives you a bit more flexibility on assembling package
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:04:45 GMT):<br/>
Ok, obviously, there's something not working as I thought it might work. I just did a "peer chaincode install" with not errors (without doing peer chaincode package previously). I understood, that this command will "copy" the chaincode to the peer, right?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:04:59 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:05:35 GMT):<br/>
My chaincode directory ($GOPATH) has a certain size, ~250MB. But /var/hyperledger/production on peers side only 1,6M... 
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:05:49 GMT):<br/>
What did I get wrong here?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:05:51 GMT):<br/>
I assume you did something like `peer chaincode install -p <gopath to chaincode> -n <name of chaincode> -v <chaincodeversion>` ?
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:05:56 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:05:59 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:06:37 GMT):<br/>
the install will only copy the go files ... perhaps you have other files ?
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:07:06 GMT):<br/>
My other files are typical go dependencies
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:10:11 GMT):<br/>
i don't want to mislead not knowing what you have completely... if instantiate succeeds you probably have what you need in the package
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:10:41 GMT):<br/>
if it fails the peer log will indicate why (typically you may have to vendor dependencies to help the packaging)
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:10:48 GMT):<br/>
Didn't succeed yet, but currently it is doing "something".. propably compiling

Other possibilities, how you could understand it (without any previous knowledge of fabric): "They use docker containers. How do I put my chaincode into a docker container?", "peer chaincode install only copies the compiled binary", "The peer needs the volume mounted where the chaincode files reside, how else could it access them" and so on... my misleading thoughts :D
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:17:49 GMT):<br/>
got it
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:18:20 GMT):<br/>
quite reasonable .. actually I'm surprised such basics are missing...I wonder if they are just scattered
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:20:10 GMT):<br/>

So, if you still have time, I have the next question: Now, I have the "production" environment with chaincode in docker containers. Now let's talk about the dev mode. If I understood correctly, at the end, I can just start the chaincode binary from my developer pc. There is this command line setting "--peer-chaincodedev=true" and also the chaincode.mode setting in core.yml. How to they correlate to each other?
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:20:55 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=csxFzNmZ7aYxY83Bg) Sure! Will check
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:21:06 GMT):<br/>
`. If I understood correctly, at the end, I can just start the chaincode binary from my developer pc. ` -- that's correct
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:21:23 GMT):<br/>
but note that this is purely for dev convenience
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:21:48 GMT):<br/>
install, invoke, debug is timeconsuming
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:22:23 GMT):<br/>
so this is to help just with turnround (still thinking "debugging") during dev
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:22:36 GMT):<br/>
this has nothhing to do with "production"
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:23:09 GMT):<br/>
non-intutilvely, you'll still have to do "install" once just so the system knows about the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:24:12 GMT):<br/>
but once that's done, you can just set `--peer-chaincodedev=true` and start the chaincode as you would any other go binary (basically do the `go build`)
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:25:37 GMT):<br/>
So far, that's understood (in theory, will try out after I have the full picture - ie you stop writing :D)

Mh. Even in dev mode: peer always starts a container when I try to access the chaincode....
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:55:58 GMT):<br/>
yeah, that's what i've observed too
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:56:06 GMT):<br/>
peer node starts the chaincode node
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:56:57 GMT):<br/>
Any idea how to solve that?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:57:48 GMT):<br/>
nothing to solve, i believe that is the desired behavior
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:59:23 GMT):<br/>
But where is the actual call executed?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 16:00:00 GMT):<br/>
well the chaincode executes in the chaincode container, then the peer delivers results back to the client, as i understand it
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 16:01:13 GMT):<br/>
yeah, but when I'm in dev mode, I want my manually started chaincode file execute things
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 16:01:16 GMT):<br/>
not the container
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 16:02:17 GMT):<br/>
afaik hlf runs in docker containers only not natively on the host system
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 16:15:13 GMT):<br/>
Read the message from @muralisr ~1h ago... for dev purposes it's possible
</p>
<p><strong>mlohr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 16:15:25 GMT):<br/>
At least... that's what I understood
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 17:47:45 GMT):<br/>
yeah, i havent actually used that dev mode for developing chaincode but perhaps in that mode it doesnt use docker at all
</p>

@mlohr with `--peer-chaincodedev=true` peer should not try to spin up chaincode at all

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 21:04:25 GMT):<br/>
(I;m assuming you have created / joined channel etc)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 21:05:48 GMT):<br/>
the instantiate shoukd flow to the chaincode in window 2
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 21:19:53 GMT):<br/>
to find ipaddress 7052 is running on the peer, do `netstat -an | grep 7052 | grep LISTEN`

Are there any docs on how to run Java chaincode in devmode? 

I'm using java and maven. 

I've created the peer container and the chaincode container, however if I try to build using maven then it just says maven isn't installed in the container. Maybe it's just a matter of pulling all the tools i need in, however I'm wondering if anything like this is documented somewhere?
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 12:51:26 GMT):<br/>
I think it works using VS Code and the IBM Blockchain Platform extension - not tried devmode outside VS Code with Java.

Hi everyone, I am struggling with dependency management in go...

I try to use the queryresult package, but there is always a mistmatch between the package I vendored and the one hyperledger uses, e.g.

cannot use *keyMod (type "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult".KeyModification) as type "mycc/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult".KeyModification in append

How can I deal with this?

I'm running a Fabric 1.4.1 network with one peer and one orderer. I'm using Prometheus to monitor them. The targets are up and Prometheus is able to scrape the metrics. But I think I'm not getting all the metrics that are listed on https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metrics_reference.html
Plus many of the metrics names look different than the ones mentioned in the list. This probably could be because the documentation is of version 1.4 and I'm running a network of 1.4.1. Just want to confirm if this is the sole reason or if there could be any other reason as well.

Hello Friends

<p><strong>Rchauhan</strong> (Sat, 29 Jun 2019 11:52:53 GMT):<br/>
Need a small help please, I am doing some changes in my chaincode and deploying it with same version v0, after complete network restart  but its not picking my new method which I have added in chaincode file of node js. for this I am changing chaincode version number and deploying it with version v1 and its working fine, but after multiple changes when I am deploying my chaincode with v3 its throwing some error as below.

{"success":false,"message":"Failed to instantiate the chaincode. cause:instantiate proposal resulted in an error :: Error: chaincode registration failed: container exited with 1"}
</p>
<p><strong>Aniket.1</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 05:26:58 GMT):<br/>
@Rchauhan Seems there is some problem with chaincode. Also you cannot deploy two chaincode with same name and same version. For this error, check the peer logs and also ensure that code in your init function is perfect

Can someone explain to me what a bookmark is? Is it an offset parameter? I cannot set a bookmark as a number or key. What should be in this parameter?
```
func (stub *ChaincodeStub) GetQueryResultWithPagination(query string, pageSize int32,

``` 
</p>
<p><strong>florianc</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 14:15:07 GMT):<br/>
I unfortunately don't have the answer to your question. Here are some links that talk about it, hopefully it can help you:
https://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.2.0/api/database/find.html#db-find (check the bookmark param)
https://fabric-shim.github.io/release-1.4/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html#getQueryResultWithPagination__anchor The equivalent function in nodejs. It ight have more information about it that the go one.

I guess the only thing else to check would be to make sure that the cds file contains only what is required and isn't including stuff you don't need. 
</p>
<p><strong>RodrigoAcosta</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 22:35:08 GMT):<br/>
but do we have control of what goes into the cds file? file went from 2.9 Mb to 11Mb and now it is at 137 Mb.

I have added some new functions to the chaincode, but not that much to have a cds package sooo big
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 22:38:08 GMT):<br/>
what language ?

node js

Make sure you aren't including the node_modules directory. You control what is packaged using the .npm_ignore file so if you don't have one you need to create it in the same dir as your package.json file

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 02:54:22 GMT):<br/>
that's interesting as it should exclude node_modules by default. Is there anything else in your project directory that shouldn't be packaged but is because it isn't listed in the .npmignore file ?  eg log files, or even old .cds files for example ?

<p><strong>RodrigoAcosta</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 03:51:18 GMT):<br/>
yes it is. I was saving each package on a release folder. so for example, one packager of 19 Mb was been included in all new packages I was doing.

Then also some smaller files like connection profiles and allocation files for transient and private data handling.

I included those directories and managed to reduce it a bit.

However, the size is still big, but reduced a lot.

There is a very well hidden feature of the extension. When you package your chaincode it will output a list of files that have been packaged. You need to look in the `Output` tab in the view section of the ide. (you can get to it if you select Output from the view dropdown menu). Then there is a downdown selection menu and you can select `Blockchain` from that menu. That window should have output into it the list of files that have been packaged.

You should be able to test that against the local fabric in vs-code. You definitely won't be wanting anything in the `.git` directory or infact any directory starting with a `.`

This is likely because a parameter in your arguments list does not match accepted types.

Hi. Using invoke chaincode with the nodejs shim 1.4.1 fails with the following:
```
const badgeCreatorQuery = [
            'query',
            creatorId
        ];
 await ctx.stub.invokeChaincode('identity', badgeCreatorQuery, 'defaultchannel');
``` 

Error returned: `Error: transaction returned with failure: Error: TypeError: First argument must be a string, Buffer, ArrayBuffer, Array, or array-like object`

I can't figure out what's wrong with my code. Any idea?

<p><strong>Raumo0</strong> (Fri, 05 Jul 2019 16:20:24 GMT):<br/>
Can someone explain me the parameters of calling contracts? I added a contract to my project for this example: https://github.com/grepruby/ERC20-Token-On-Hyperledger
When I do instantiate (via the IBM Blockchain Platform extention on VSCode), I specify the function to be called: "init", and the arguments: `["{\"name\":\"Simple Token\",\"symbol\":\"SMT\"}"]`.
When I start, I get the error: `Error instantiating smart contract: chaincode registration failed: container exited with 1`. Is this error related to my wrong arguments or not? I look at the logs, but did not figure it out.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 Jul 2019 21:33:06 GMT):<br/>
@Raumo0 suggest looking at the chaincode container log and the peer log to debug. ... the arguments are interpreted by the chaincode and not by fabric (I see some instruction in the above github link on looking at logs..)

The problem is that it only returns the last posted value.

Hi, How do i know, which Peer did the Transaction in Hyperledger Fabric Go?

<p><strong>deenario</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 05:02:09 GMT):<br/>
@DeeptimanPattnaik  If you are using the invoke.js file for Fabric node SDK, then open the invoke.js and you will see the peer name and port there. 

Or the other way is to do "docker ps" and then docker logs [CONTAINER ID THAT IS RUNNING THE PEER]. 
</p>

Ok - Things are looking a bit different in v1.4 (Migrating my existing 1.0.3 Fabric Chaincodes to 1.4).

For logging - I'm currently using the shim.NewLogger function but when I'm trying ti instantiate the chaincode getting the following error from the logs of PEER.

` undefined: shim.NewLogger`

Ok - this item was due to the wrong hyperledger vendor folder. Once govendored it is fine now.

I have another minor stumbling block.
The transactions are getting committed:
but when I do a smart query it is not fetching the results

```{
"Query":"{\"selector\":{\"AccountNumber\":\"ACCT911\"}}"
}
```

Hi All, I like that in the 2.0 alpha the chaincode lifecycle is changing, however, the current way of installing a chaincode still requires the peer to communicate with the dockersock and this is a problem from a security perspective. Are there initiatives to address the way a chaincode container is started?

@donjohnny yes,   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/fabric/+/30990/ batch of CRs implement https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13582 and offer a radical alternative to current chaincode "launch" model where the fabric no longer manages the chaincode container launch.

Dear community, currently Fabric does not comply to security rules due to the way chaincode containers are created. There is a change to free the chaincode from the peer (see https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/fabric/+/30990/), would it be possible to add support for Java CC?

Hey everyone! I'm wondering how I would be able to recreate the private data hashes that are located in the "collection_hashed_rwset" that can be seen when a block is decoded to JSON. I know this is a hashed version of the private data read write set, but what does that set look like? Does anyone have a example of data written + hash stored in the block? In my case, I am using couchDB private collections and Fabric 1.4. Thanks all!
</p>
<p><strong>RyanOuyang</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 15:56:42 GMT):<br/>
there's the "hashed_rwset", as well as the "pvt_rwset_hash" - If anyone could explain the difference and/or how to recreate these let me know!

For instance, I want to have an argument based on a defined interface (at least it doesn't gives me error on the chaincode). If possible, how can I call the submit transaction on the client side, attending that they require `args `as ~string~?

are you using Fabric 1.4 docker images (per `docker ps`) or earlier  ? Also, would advise to use the supported Node/npm levels for H/L Fabric see https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/prereqs.html#node-js-runtime-and-npm and as a non-root user (npm advisory, see last 2 answers [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4938592/how-why-does-npm-recommend-not-running-as-root))

Hi everyone! how I can re-deploy a chaincode container after a peer restart? I'm trying to instantiate again, but it fails, maybe I need to update it instead of instantiate?
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:15:51 GMT):<br/>
should the chaincode container be re-deployed when a peer is restarted? for me, its the expected behavior 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:48:42 GMT):<br/>
When you send a proposal to that peer it will start the chaincode container if it's not already started.

@Javi  to add to @davidkel response, instantiate is a one time operation to get the chaincode registerd on the channel in question.  You cannot use that to "restart" the container... if that was the intent

<p><strong>florianc</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 14:09:18 GMT):<br/>
I asked this question once. If I remember well, it is because the peer might be using the previous version of the chaincode on another channel.

<p><strong>SatheeshNehru</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 07:59:04 GMT):<br/>
what is the purpose of chaincode container when chaincode is instantiated on peers?
</p>
<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 10:00:33 GMT):<br/>
generally speaking, the purpose of the chaincode container is to ensure isolation of the smart contract's execution from the peer itself, so that a smart contract (chaincode) cannot crash or even access the peer because of an error or malicious code (Chaincode runs in a secured container isolated from the endorsing peer process). An `instantiate` transaction invokes the lifecycle System Chaincode (LSCC) to create and initialize a chaincode on a channel. This is a chaincode-channel binding process: a chaincode may be bound to any number of channels and operate on each channel individually and independently.
</p>
<p><strong>akoenig</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 13:10:58 GMT):<br/>
Hi, is there a way to dynamicly change the endorsment of a chaincode? For example: We have 4 Orgs in one channel. One time we need the endorsment of company 1 AND 2 because they are doing something together. In the next time we want to get sure the endormsent is with company 3 and 4
</p>
<p><strong>akoenig</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 13:27:18 GMT):<br/>
Or do we have to create a new channel for each combination of the orgs?
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 13:43:55 GMT):<br/>
Using separate channels gives isolation to use a separate "chaincode-level endorsement policy", and if set up correctly it is also a security isolation. So this is appropriate for some use-cases.  The "Chaincode-level endorsement policy" can't be changed other than by upgrading the chaincode but there is a feature for "key-level endorsement" which may help you.
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endorsement-policies.html
(I don't think it is much used so check it out in detail before committing too many project resources to it)
</p>
<p><strong>akoenig</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 13:53:00 GMT):<br/>
Hm okay, this could be helpfull... I will have a look there
</p>
<p><strong>akoenig</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 13:53:00 GMT):<br/>
Hm okay, this could be helpfull... I will have a look there. It seems not so generic, but maybe it could do the thing. Because all combinations of orgs used in a different channel would be to much.
</p>
<p><strong>SatheeshNehru</strong> (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 05:20:31 GMT):<br/>
where will be the chaincode located in chaincode container?
</p>
<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 09:36:12 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 10:36:04 GMT):<br/>

Endorsement Policies policies apply to the whole Smart Contract (chaincode) - but also see this thread from a couple of days ago: https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=2KXcy8XnacYyy8PqP

</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 11:36:52 GMT):<br/>
how this is possible? I think that no endorsment policy is applied to the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 11:37:19 GMT):<br/>
and if no endorsment policy exists, then we can maipulate data, is this correct?
</p>
<p><strong>MatteoLinear</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 14:24:06 GMT):<br/>
For example in my case, i have a function that can be invoked only  by peer0 and another that can be invoked only by peer1(same organization for simplicity)

Following advise from @javapriyan , I am still having same problem. I am following instreuctions from https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.5/build_network.html and created a network with `.sh` file. But the manually installing and instantiating chaincode(remove installation and instantiation code from `./byfn.sh` file)

What is the problem with the path? Make sure that the path you are giving it lines up with the path of the chaincode inside the container.

HI @Tfabric ,

suggest to check out the `fabcar` sample https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.4/fabcar/startFabric.sh#L23 or check out the docs https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/chaincode4noah.html?highlight=peer%20chaincode%20install#installing-chaincode - another possibility is to use the [IBP VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform) to manage your chaincode installs / instantiation if you want it for a dev environment etc.
</p>
<p><strong>tballast</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 12:16:55 GMT):<br/>
@dijaa have you tried using the whole path, and not just a relative one? Also, make sure that the path is relevant to the container it's running in. Like, maybe on your filesystem it's in /home/proj... however, in the container it might be something like /opt/gopath/github.com...

@dijaa did you try to instantiate your chaincode WITHOUT the -l node parameter? It can be problem, you have an instantiated chaincode in go (by default) and it has't been reinstantiated in node even you set the -l node switch.

Hello, i'm trying to instantiate a NodeJS chaincode which use the `Contract` class of `fabric-contract-api`.
 It is installed correctly but at instantiation, i get this error:
```Error: transaction returned with failure: Error: You've asked to invoke a function that does not exist: init
```
I understand it tries to call an `Init` method on my contract but there isn't any. 
Shouldn't the `Contract` class of `fabric-contract-api` have an `Init` function, just like the `Chaincode` one ?
I suppose i'm exepected to implement one ? Or is there a way to not call anything at instantiate time ?

pass in an `fcn` of `null`

<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 10:06:27 GMT):<br/>
then nothing will get called at instantiate time
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 10:06:57 GMT):<br/>
if you want to call something at instantiate time, define a function with any name in your contract (e.g. `initLedger`), and pass in the name via `fcn`

@dijaa - at first glance it seems it can't resolve the CA node, suggest to raise a Stack Overflow posting there the output of  `docker ps`, `docker logs <_CA container id_>` - as well as your node/npm version, steps leading up to the point of error. In 1.4 FYI Fabcar now uses the BYFN `first-network`  and looks for the Org1 CA in the corresponding connection profile `connection-org1.json`

@rokoko if you want to call another transaction function then you would do something like
```

```
the getCars is a method on the contract object

<p><strong>Abrara</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 09:41:28 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 09:45:54 GMT):<br/>
There is a system function to retrieve all the functions - `org.hyperledger.fabric:GetMetadata` you can invoke it on the command line like this:
` peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C mychannel -c '{"Args":["org.hyperledger.fabric:GetMetadata"]}' -n fcnstest `
and it returns you a JSON structure that includes the transactions/functions

Assuming your chaincode uses the new model i.e. fabric-contract-api then there is a system function to retrieve all the functions - `org.hyperledger.fabric:GetMetadata` you can invoke it on the command line like this:

<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 13:48:40 GMT):<br/>
What change are you planning to make?  If you change the properties of an Identity in the CA, they are not reflected in any existing certificates.  (If you are adding attributes, they only appear in new certificates if you set ECert to true.)  BTW there is a specific #fabric-ca channel.
</p>
<p><strong>deepaks</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 14:03:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @rthatcher . I was just chnaging the bootstrap identity only. By default its admin : adminpw
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 14:08:02 GMT):<br/>
I don't think you can change the ID name (admin) of a running CA, but you can change the secret.
(You can change the parameters given to the CA when it is started for the first time through an environment variable)
</p>
<p><strong>deepaks</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 14:10:14 GMT):<br/>
Okay got your point. well explained.

One more thing, what difference would secret make in the new certificates? and  if the secret is compromised, how it would affect already generated certificates.
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 14:12:21 GMT):<br/>
The certificate does not contain the secret.  The secret is used to download the certificate only.
</p>
<p><strong>deepaks</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 14:14:02 GMT):<br/>
Okay, Thank you for helping me out.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 11:32:15 GMT):<br/>
Like all chaincode, it is built and launched either at instantiate time or the first time it invoked (assuming it has been instantiated on the channel already).  The peer launches the fabric-ccenv container, builds the chaincode image (at which time it runs `npm install --production`) and then launches the chaincode container.  All of the package commands/ APIs will filter out the `node_modules` folder
</p>
<p><strong>dan13</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 14:59:36 GMT):<br/>
Is there a commitment for the implementation of the new programming model for chaincode in Go? If so, is there a timeline (at least, proposed timeline) established in terms of chrono or release versions? Based on http://proterra.me.uk/nx01/programming/2019/07/31/201/ it seems that mix-and-match languages is supported, e.g., Java SDK client calling Go chaincode all with new programming model (once avail for both) -- can someone confirm?

<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 08:46:13 GMT):<br/>
any SDK language should be able to call any smart contract language, and old programming model SDK should be able to call new programming model smart contract (and vice versa)

@sstone1 thanks for answering! We are primarily a Java shop, but started with Go chaincode because it seemed like it might have some advantages. Trying to decide if switching to Java-Java makes the most sense (which I think it will if Go support for new model is too far in future). I googled for HLF 2.0 release date but did not find anything -- is that set yet?
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 18:35:43 GMT):<br/>
Fabric v2.0 should be released in 4Q this year.  If you’re a Java shop, then Java/Java makes a lot of sense to me. Out of interest, why did you think Go would have some advantages?

nope, the high level is built on top of the low level
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 15:07:54 GMT):<br/>
so you can use the low level SDK to call a high level smart contract (assuming you know what args to pass in), and the high level SDK to call a low level smart contract (Invoke will just get called)

Hi,

I have a HLF Network with 4 Orgs and each org has 2 peers in VM based environment.
Now, I have a business requirement that i need to add one more peer (3rd peer) for Org4. But it should be in a docker container in a separate windows machine.

I have done the setup with HLF in the docker container using docker-compose.yaml file.
But, when i try to install the chaincode in the docker container using Peer CLI, i am getting the below exception. By the way, i am using bccsp package in my chaincode.

Error: error getting chaincode code rcodso: error getting chaincode package bytes: Error obtaining dependencies for github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp: command <go list -f {{ join .Deps "\n"}} github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp>: failed with error: "exit status 1"

        /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp (from $GOPATH)
		

It clearly looking for bccsp package, but it was not there in the /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric directory.

Please help me in this regard to make it works.

Hi, I have an application which does batch updates to the chaincode. Right now, it process only one transaction, and ignores the other one. How does chaincode/sdkclient act to multiple transaction submitted at the sametime..Does it have code in place to handle concurrency..? Thank you!

@rallam "transaction" has a very specific meaning in fabric... I _think_ what you are saying is you are somehow allowing only one Invoke on the chaincode at any time ? `Does it have code in place to handle concurrency..?` -- chaincode can handle multiple Invokes concurrently ... ie, SDK can send all the requests it wants without serializing/filtering requests

Hi all, I'm running into this problem (again) where I'm getting `GET_STATE_BY_RANGE failed: ... Queries on pvt data is supported only in a read-only transaction`.  I get why that check is in there -- ostensibly from preventing chaincode developers from accidentally writing private data to the public ledger, but in this case I'm only operating on a single private collection.  In particular I'm trying to delete a table from my private collection, and the step that's triggering this error is just checking that the table has no rows before deleting the table metadata (from another private collection table that I've defined).  If I reverse the order of the operations, I get `DEL_STATE failed: ... Transaction has already performed queries on pvt data. Writes are not allowed`.  So basically I'm blocked either way -- I can't verify that a table is empty before deleting it.  How do I disable this check?  I've encountered it before, and it's been a total headache.
</p>
<p><strong>rallam</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:21:49 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr Yes, I mean invoking a chaincode method. So the problem that I have is, if sdkclient invokes multiple calls at the same time to the same method, it executes only first invoke and ignores the other one. I found this article : https://medium.com/wearetheledger/hyperledger-fabric-concurrency-really-eccd901e4040, and it says that fabric doesn't handle concurrency, and throws mvvc error for the second call. can you please clarify on this. Thank you!!

Hi all, New to chain code I have a rather trivial question but I can't figure it out. Where should I place my chaincode files on my local computer and where do I specify the path when I call peer chaincode install . As I understand it, the -path flag is where the chaincode is placed in the docker container? What am I missing or where can I read specifically about this?
</p>
<p><strong>anujhlf</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:02:19 GMT):<br/>
Copy your go code to 
/opt/gopath/src/github.com/app/app.go

When installing,
peer chaincode install -n app_name -p github.com/app -v v0

</p>
<p><strong>anujhlf</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:03:40 GMT):<br/>
I dont know if its conincidence or some script work, but if you have a folder named chaincode in your project root, it gets copied over automatically and can be checked by cding into the opt src directory inside the container
</p>

hello everyone, for the chaincode Invoke method is it necessary to return shim.success() or shim.error(), can i return something else like a custom response?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 21:29:26 GMT):<br/>
@rallam to the narrow question "can chaincode handle concurrent requests?" the answer is yes. To the question "would transactions created from chaincode responses to those concurrent requests cause MVCC collision errors?" the answer is depends upon the application. If two concurrent requests access the same state key "A" and both of them think they are modifying version "100" of state "A", when the transaction first request gets committed, it'll move the version to "101" making the second transaction's fail. Now if the two requests are accessing different  state keys "A" and "B" respectively, you will not get the MVCC error. So chaincode can handle concurrent request but the behavior of transactions from those requests is application dependent.

Hi, New to chaincode I have a rather question, but I can't figured out. I have a nodejs app, the same as invoke example in fabcar. When it creates the gateway and search for the chaincode it gives me a eror where it says that there is no chaincode with that name, but when i run from terminal with peer chaincode invoke etc it found the chaincode and execute well.

Hi, I would like to be able to assign assets not only to the certificate ID, but also to the public key and implement a function to rotate the key. I am not sure what is the best way to get the public key in the chaincode. With the cid library I know how to get the certificate and the certificate has a field ´RawSubjectPublicKeyInfo´, but I don't know how to decode this and get only the public key out of it. Or should I use the ´PublicKey´field, this is an empty interface type in the certificate struct, so I also don't really know what the content of it will be and if I should use it. Can someone give any suggestions, please? Thanks a lot!

might be an idea to test with a reduced pageSize first, to see if you get the returned bookmark, which might look something like `[{"ResponseMetadata":{"RecordsCount":"10",

How can I install and instantiate a typescript chaincode?
This is what I did so far to try to make it work:
1) Installed npm packages in local environment.
2) Compiled my typescript project to js.
Chaincode installed successfully but during instantiation I got the error `Error: could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg chaincode registration failed: container exited with 0`.

I then removed all my ts files and kept only js files and package.json in the folder. Again, the chaincode installed successfully but got the above-mentioned error again during instantiation.

The installation and instantiation of the chaincode is happening on the peer. But when from the tools container i am running the command
peer chaincode list –instantiated -C legaldescriptionchannel

the chaincode containers are exiting. 
i had installed thrice with different versions and upgraded using upgrade command but still the above issue lies.

This issue is resolved . Actually there was an issue in the configtx.yaml where the allignment of the key - Organization under Application section was not proper it was under the ACLs. 

Configtxgen tool generated the genesis file successfully, but that was the issue. So its a advice to everybody . Check the proper spacing and allignment in configtx.yaml before generating the artifacts

So 1000 records shouldn't be the issue here (and you presumably reduced the results set (above)) - what version of Fabric are you using? Not sure why your bookmark is empty in your env. Might be an idea to check out the marbles tutorial/sample with pagination (can do from CLI) at  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/couchdb_tutorial.html#query-the-couchdb-state-database-with-pagination

<p><strong>aymanmt</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 14:11:44 GMT):<br/>
well a question: does pagination only work with couchdb? because we are using oracle blockchain platform, and I think they use Berkeley db
</p>
<p><strong>aymanmt</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 14:11:53 GMT):<br/>
i started to suspect that's the reason
</p>
<p><strong>aymanmt</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 14:12:18 GMT):<br/>
the thing is that we tried to change core.yml in one of the peers to use couchdb

<p><strong>aymanmt</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 14:12:22 GMT):<br/>
but it didn't work

<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 14:16:12 GMT):<br/>
yes couchDB - need to read [the docs](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/couchdb_tutorial.html#query-the-couchdb-state-database-with-pagination) -> "Bookmarks are *uniquely generated by CouchDB *for each query and represent a placeholder in the result set. Pass the returned bookmark on the subsequent iteration of the query to retrieve the next set of results." -  should check the release notes too for support etc.
</p>
<p><strong>aymanmt</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 14:18:53 GMT):<br/>
well I read the docs, but it seems I didn't notice that note :)
</p>
<p><strong>mahoney1</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 14:19:21 GMT):<br/>
no worries :-)
</p>
<p><strong>aymanmt</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 14:19:40 GMT):<br/>

Still same error, checked the logs on peer0.org1 and this error shows up:

i think it might have something to do with channels, when i try to deploy my own chaincode logs on peer0 show this:

Failed to update ordering service endpoints, due to Channel with mychannel id was not found

while the same won't happen using the default chaincode

How can I do ctx.stub.invokeChaincode if I have the name chaincode, but I have several contracts in the container and I still need to specify one of them. I can’t figure out how to do this. Help me please.
Now I use the following option and it worked when I had each contract in a separate chaincode container.
ctx.stub.invokeChaincode (chaincodeName, args, '');
contractName?

@Raumo0 it seems like the name of the function invoked would be the only way to specify the correct contract. I imagine the invoke functions are called in some order, probably alphabetical by contract name, with the arguments passed to each invoke function. Just guessing here.

Note: My instructions are a benchmark for successfully running fabcar and will only work if you have not modified ANY fabcar code or shell scripts. If you have modified code or shell scripts then your code may be an additional problem. Implement my changes and then focus on your code and or shell modifications. Good luck.

hi *if* you're using NodeJS, use lower-case `g' ? eg `const resultsIterator = await ctx.stub.getHistoryForKey(ledgerkey);`

@medikent Everything turned out to be simpler. If I need to call a method from a contract that is in the current channel and in the current chaincode container, then I do not need to use INVOKE_CHAINCODE. I can just import the class and call its method.

<p><strong>Raumo0</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 17:02:39 GMT):<br/>
@medikent In my case, it was necessary to call a method from the current channel and the current chaincode, so I did not need to use invokeChaincode, but simply export the class. But when you really need to call methods from different channels, different chaincode and different contracts, this still causes problems.

Hi everyone, 

I'm trying to build a system chaincode, and now the code is very large so I was thinking of using `dep` for package management. 
So my Gopkg.toml is : https://hastebin.com/gahiqufana.cs
And Gopkg.lock: https://hastebin.com/imetetuxiz.cs

I'm building the plugin using:  
```
go build -buildmode=plugin -o myscc.so main.go
```

But when I run the peer I'm getting the error:
```

Hey, I am using fabric-go-sdk for my backend. I am trying to create a testing mode on my backend that can run queries directly on chaincode using mockshim. But importing both github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go and github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim into the same executable is leading to duplicate proto registrations which show up during runtime.

For example, 
/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/msp/msp_config.pb.go:695: proto.RegisterType((*FabricCryptoConfig)(nil), "msp.FabricCryptoConfig")
/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-protos-go/msp/msp_config.pb.go:706:      proto.RegisterType((*FabricCryptoConfig)(nil), "msp.FabricCryptoConfig")

Is there any way around this without editing vendor files to use the same import paths? What else can be done?

Hi, Can anyone please tell me how do I create two contract in one go chaincode and invoke them separately. 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 15:22:16 GMT):<br/>
@ShefaliMittal It really depends upon what you mean by "two contract" ... but giving the code is in one GO chaincode there are two possible approaches
Approach 1
-----------
(1) one GO chaincode installed on the peer and instantiated on a channel
(2) Two methods "Contract1Method(...)" and "Contract2Method(...)"
(3) The "invoke(args)"method would look at the first argunent in args and call either "Contract1Method(...)" or "Contract2Method(...)"

By channgin the args sent to the chaincode you'll be invoking two different "contracts" but they'll both be registered on the blocchain under one chainccode

Approach 2
------------
(1) one GO chaincode installed twice as two separate chaincodes with different names (to keep it simple, pre 2.0... more possibilies post 2.0) and both are instantiated on the channel
(2) Two methods "Contract1Method(...)" and "Contract2Method(...)"
(3) The "invoke(args)"method would look at the first argunent in args and call either "Contract1Method(...)" or "Contract2Method(...)"

By changing the args and the name of chaincode to invoke, you'll be invoking two different "contracts". These interactions will be registered under two chainccodes on the blockchain

@iramiller  the only way that is shown in the documentation is to use shim.success and shim.error but idk if it is possible to return something else
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 04:27:25 GMT):<br/>
@ItaloCarrasco I thought I had a nodejs example in our infrastructure but it looks like the one I was thinking of is actually in our Kotlin SDK (Java).  We return a custom 400 error from our chaincode which is handled correctly as an error when it hits the caller and we are still able to see the code as 400... so it is certainly possible to do although I don't have a helpful nodejs fragment for you...

Thank you for your response. I do see what you mean. My next question is when I follow first approach and create one chaincode then one couchdb table is created with chaincode name. So the two contracts data can have same id ?

Hi All,

I am trying to set up Private Data between two orgs.
So when i am installing the chaincode for private data communication and instantiating from one of the orgs - the chaincode shows as instantiated from both the orgs but i could see the docker container of chaincode created only in one org but when checked in another machine for the other org the chaincode container is not getting created. I am not sure why. Can anybody help on this

@ShefaliMittal first of all, I was just listing the possibilitie given the initial constraint of 1 go chaincode. Secondly, "contract" has no strict definition. At a high level if you want to differentiate two contracts you can do it in a variety of ways. In (1) we leave it to the chaincode to differentiate (say associate an ID for  each new "contract" and store it in the DB and use ACL mechanisms to control access) and in (2) fabric supplies the basic differentiation by storing the state under different table... going back to you couch db analogy basically two tables vs a table with an extra "ID" column

 What would it take to get a similar PR to this one brought into the main source code?
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5015

It looks like this PR was *Closed and marked as Won't do*

I assume  that it's because of the external library, but we would like to have a way to test our getQueryResults method "along with several other methods" and the implementation is needed to be able to have enough code coverage to be able to promote the project to a production environment.

Since we need this for our project we're willing to develop it, however I'd rather not implement it in a way that wouldn't be accepted as part of the project.

see the before and after transaction handlers (eg. `beforeTransaction` , `afterTransaction`) described in the docs https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/developapps/transactionhandler.html - depending on how you want to do it (ie what kind of checks) the 2nd answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55392184/how-can-put-a-permission-on-function-in-node-sdk-of-hyperledger-fabric) may also assist you

Resolved the issue . The chaincode folder structure should be exactly same in both the peers to get the same hash fingerprintID which will create chaincode conatiners for both the org peers

Hi all, what is the best practice to reference a state in an invoke function, for the moment I am passing a parameter like this since this is how it is stored in the state db: "\u0000iou\u00002bbe093fcbd46121fd80eeaa7eb62c68d0ea1147009cb22a1c3f27c36feed45a\u00001\u0000", but it is pretty ugly with the \u0000 parts. Is it better to just pass the parts that form the composite key as separate parameters or should I do something like "iou:2bbe093fcbd46121fd80eeaa7eb62c68d0ea1147009cb22a1c3f27c36feed45a:1" and then split it in the chaincode? Let me know your approaches please and we can get to a unified way to do it.

Hi, I am trying to implement a couch db query to use skip and limits for the pagination. When executing the same query against my local couch db instance, it returns a limited list and skips properly. But, after going through the getQueryResults of the chaincode, it's showing all the records ignoring the skip and limit. Does fabric support limit and skip for the pagination or is it just bookmark..?

<p><strong>Shubham-koli</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 12:48:25 GMT):<br/>
you can't create two separate contracts in one chaincode but you can create two functions in one chaincode which will do different  functionalities.
for example we can create calculator chaincode and it can have different  functionalities like add, multiply,divide,modulus.

Hey All, I'm working on testing the chaincode using `MockStub`. In chaincode, I have a method `CreateUser()` in which I'm fetching some details like
`cid.GetAttributeValue()`, `cid.GetID()` and `cid.GetMSPID()` . I have to test `CreateUser()` method using `MockStub` .  I tired to test it but ran into an error ``` Expecting a PEM-encoded X509 certificate; PEM block not found ``` . I think it is because I'm not providing any certificate. 
 So, Is there any functionality in `MockStub` to test these kind of things?

Hi Team, I am trying to fetch the blocks from my transactions in chaincode and noticed that block number starts from 4. 
Can anyone guide what all details gets stored in blocks from 0 till 3 and how to get those blocks in client app? 
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 04:39:54 GMT):<br/>
these blocks are genesis block and any update transaction on the channel like anchor peer update etc...you need to get block details by blockiD or there is tool like configtxlator tool to get JSON format data from genesis block

@SamYuan1990 we're migrating the repos from gerrit to github... 
Chaincode-node is already in github and I'm tuning the build as I type this... please go to github and raise a pr against the repo there... 
</p>
<p><strong>SamYuan1990</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 09:58:40 GMT):<br/>
@mbwhite ， so, pls correct me for any mistake, I just fork github, new branch, developing, and new pr?

General question to the channel - we've 'fabric-chaincode-dev' and 'fabric-java-chaincode' but three languages to write chaincode in.. nodejs, Java, Golang... nodejs and Java have the updated programming model, and golang on it's way... 

Do you think it would better to have 1 channel per language, or just one channel for all languages?

but there some error during test chaincode install and the test passed?
or say test:fv passed
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 16:26:49 GMT):<br/>
@SamYuan1990  can you give me some more info please?

Hi all, beginner here. I would like to ask what is the advantage when we are using peer in dev mode or net mode in docker on local machine? In both cases, when I am developing chaincode I have to install chaincode with higher version and then call `peer upgrade` method to work with updated chaincode version?

For a Node.js client see: https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.4/tutorial-listening-to-events.html
For a Java client see the `addContractListener` method at: https://fabric-gateway-java.github.io/org/hyperledger/fabric/gateway/Contract.html
These build on low-level Node.js and Java SDK capabilities so you can use the low level event listening APIs directly if you are developing with the low-level APIs but, where practical, I would encourage use of the higher level APIs for ease of use

Hi team,

i was trying to build the *cid.go* chaincode from the github link --> https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v1.4.3/core/chaincode/lib/cid/cid.go   (v1.4.3) and i was getting the below error 

```root@ubuntuVMServer1:/opt/gopath/src/cid# go build cid
# cid
./cid.go:33:17: undefined: ChaincodeStubInterface
./cid.go:43:21: undefined: ChaincodeStubInterface
./cid.go:52:30: undefined: ChaincodeStubInterface
./cid.go:61:32: undefined: ChaincodeStubInterface
./cid.go:71:30: undefined: ChaincodeStubInterface
./cid.go:81:8: undefined: ChaincodeStubInterface ```

but after adding the import statement - *"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim"* and instead of  ChaincodeStubInterface -- *modified *it to shim.ChaincodeStubInterface , then its working.

So is there any bug in the code or anything from my end i have to check ?

Are there any common patterns emerging with regards to ownership of chaincode installed on multiple organizations peers? I'm curious how often consortiums are doing joint development of common chaincode or if networks are seeing consulting firms acting as an intermediary for chaincode development.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 16 Nov 2019 15:13:22 GMT):<br/>
@rpocase in my experience its all of the above... when companies do collaborate in joint dev, there typically is a usage or interest pattern that makes one or two companies take the initiative (and are more involved) while others vet and use - as you'd expect in any common endeavor

I've defined in policy config file for three organizations
```{
    "name": "Org1_Org2_Org3",
    "policy": "OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member','Org3MSP.member')",
    "requiredPeerCount": 0,
    "maxPeerCount": 3,
    "blockToLive": 0,
    "memberOnlyRead": true
},```
I'am performing PutPrivateData function from Org1 with "Org1_Org2_Org3" policy name => excution of transaction is successfully
But while executing GetPrivateData function 
from Org1 => returns data successfully
from Org2 and Org3 it fails by throwing this error
```
GET_STATE failed: transaction ID: 0a98bd15527f37437ce1881739c6aa6f8985cb62ee8389be9bd098dae396ad06: private data matching public hash version is not available. Public hash version = {BlockNum: 26, TxNum: 0}, Private data version = <nil>\"

I have the following similar scenario. How to design this data structure in hyperledger composer.
Medical records have list of disorders, prescriptions and supplements. We can design this in the following way in relation database,

Disorders (pre-determined list of disorders. There will be maximum 10 disorders)
---------
id name

prescriptions
-------------
id     name

supplements
-----------
id name

medical records
---------------
id date disorder_id prescription_id supplement_id

Can we use the same design method in hyperledger composer model design or can we use like the following? which is the best practice?

medical_records
---------------
id
date
disorders: [disorder1, disorder2...etc]
prescriptions: [{name, start_date, end_date},{name, start_date, end_date},{name, start_date, end_date}....etc]
supplements: [supplement1, supplement2... etc]

Hello, I've found what I think is inconsistent typings in the node typescript shim interface. (Using fabric-contract-api 1.4.2 and fabric-shim 1.4.2).
```
ctx.stub.getTxTimestamp().toDate()
```
throw an Error:
```
TypeError: ctx.stub.getTxTimestamp(...).toDate is not a function
```
By logging the `ctx.stub.getTxTimestamp()` object, it looks like it is a plain javascript object: 
```
{"seconds":{"low":1575467985,"high":0,"unsigned":false},"nanos":842413402}
```
The `getTxTimestamp()` return type is supposed to be a `Timestamp` with `toDate` method on it.


Is this a known issue ?

@YashGupta1 full logs will be needed to confirm but this is likely because the timeout https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L542 is too small.

it depends on your use case... if changing the timeout fixes your problem you need to analyse why it needs a large timeout for your proposal

The peer command will be installed - but I wouldn't assume that the shim is there; there's a docker container that is used purely for building the image - it doesn't last long but often that's the place where the root error will show up.

Hi all, looking at the master branch, I see that the cid library is removed, or at least I can't find it anymore at "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid". Will there be a new library or a new way of getting the client identity in go chaincode? Can someone share information about the new approach, please?

You may need to vendor in the package, I also think it has moved from the fabric repo into fabric-chaincode-go (unsure on the versioning of that repo)
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 16 Dec 2019 16:46:48 GMT):<br/>
The go chaincode has been removed from fabric core in master and into its own repo - you can now find it here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/tree/master/pkg/cid

Hi All, 
Can we able to use npm modules other than fabric-shrim and fabric-contract-api in chaincode?
If so how the npm packages will install while instantiate?
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 09:02:25 GMT):<br/>
Yes certainly; the packages are installed when the docker container is build with a `npm install --production'
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 09:03:04 GMT):<br/>
You can use any module, but keep in mind that it has to be determinisitic - i.e. don't use anything whose results are random/unpredictable

Hi! I'm having troubles with the policies of chaincodes. When I instantiated it  i used this policie: 
`CHAINCODE_POLICY="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member','Org4MSP.member')" `

However, when I invoke the chaincode with a user form Org3MSP Fabric instantiates the chaincode in Org3 Peer and the invoket goes to the ledger withy the type: ENDORSER_TRANSACTION (it should be INVALID)

Hello Everyone,

Just a simple question
The implementation of fabric using Nodejs in Fabcar example and balance-transfer example is different. Both uses the fabric network and deploys a chaincode
Working is same but the coding implementation is different
What's the main difference in Nodejs Fabcar example and balance-transfer example
Can anyone explain it?

Thank you

<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 09:26:01 GMT):<br/>
@PremaGulp FabCar is using the programing model introduced in Fabric 1.4; this uses the concepets of contracts and  transaction functions; balance transfer uses the previous model of having init & invoke only - any chaincode written would need to do it's own functional routing.  Pretty much every implementation did that - and you know don't have to write that code yourself.  

Check out the CommercialPaper Tutorial in the docs for more info

Hello everyone. I have a question, can I install chaincode on a peer directly from a repository instead of providing its local path? If so, can it also be done using fabric-java-sdk? If anyone can share an example of it would be really helpful. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Fri, 20 Dec 2019 08:55:09 GMT):<br/>
@mbvivek no, the files would need to be local so a custom script would be required; the updated lifecycle in the beta shows how that the first step is now to package the chaincode/contracts.  This could be done as part of a CI pipline that is then stored; which can then be easily 'got' by the install pipeline

1. What if the peer we had mentioned for the discovery service goes down.
2. If we have 2 organizations then does discovery service only give data for one(requesting) organizations' peers.

hello everyone, i have a question about stub.getStateByPartialCompositeKey, if i store my objects with a composite key formed like this     

let ID = await stub.createCompositeKey('poll~user', [ID, user])

to get the state of a specific poll-user can i use stub.getStateByPartialCompositeKey('poll~user', [ID, user]) or should i create the compisite key and use stub.getstate(compositekey)

i am having problems with the first option because it returns an empty array, and not the data of the specific key combination

</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 16:17:02 GMT):<br/>
be careful with the return type as it's an iterator but you should get back what your need
</p>
<p><strong>icarrascol</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 17:31:27 GMT):<br/>
i know its an iterator, when i query for the first attribute it returns what its spected, but when i query for the full composite key it returns nothing
</p>
<p><strong>icarrascol</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 17:32:29 GMT):<br/>
i verified couchdb for the generated key and what i should be querying and my query has the same values as the key in couchdb

Hi guys, I'm trying to follow the documentation for the development of chaincode (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/chaincode4ade.html), however even the simple asset example is not working (I can't build) because the lack of the package github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim (in fact I can't find it).

How can I solve? Where can I find the missing libraries?

Before the peer had baked into it the files from github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim within its go path. Since the move to use github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/shim the shim package no longer exists by default in the go path. Vendoring is the process of adding those files to a vendor folder in your go project. You can do this by running `go mod vendor`if using go modules

That particular tutorial doesn't use the chaincode on the peer so you may not need to vendor it as you can build it on your own machine. You may find the master branch version of the tutorial more helpful as that has updated the import paths: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/chaincode4ade.html

I switched to master tutorial as suggested. https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/chaincode4ade.html#terminal-2-build-start-the-chaincode
The problem is when I arrive at the "Terminal 2" point I receive no feedback from the command line and can't proceed to "Terminal 3" section.
I don't understand this command:
`CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=mycc:0 CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=false ./sacc -peer.address peer:7052`
and when I use it the terminal just stay idle, no feedback, and when I try to follow with
`docker exec -it cli bash`
I receive
`Error response from daemon: Container e5173b8a35ca0d37a528231192facaf2db7f7f8a3c38ce1f96636ede8e0f907f is not running`
</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong> (Wed, 15 Jan 2020 15:47:32 GMT):<br/>
Moreover I don't understand the general flow of the *tutorial*: why does it show me how to write the chaincode and build it locally but then it seems that I have to do it in the container, and no explanation on how to make the transfer...?
If I want to edit something in the code am I suppose to burn down all of the 3 terminal, move the code, and build them up again?

I am trying to develop a chaincode and for my use case I need to get the updated version of the ledger's state after adding a new transaction. In other words I need to call stub.getState(key) after calling stub.putState(key) and get the updated state. I understand that the getState function always returns the state before the transaction started. Is there any way that I can get the updated state?
</p>

The only way to read that putState using getState is to have the getState called in another transaction e.g. invoke writeSomething then invoke readSomething. If you are trying to do this in the same transaction can you not just use the value you passed to the putState called e.g.

```
const myObj = {cool: "object"}

stub.putState('someKey', Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(object)))

// use myObj instance instead of calling getState
```

Hi Guys, I am trying to look for the default value for timeout in  the sendSignedProposal(request, timeout) function. I can not find it in the node sdk, and I tried looking at the core.yaml? Can anyone help me out or point where I can find it. Much appreciated.

Hello - we've released a v1.4.5 of the Java Chaincode and Contract libraries; the docker image is on dockerhub, but it seems that Maven central is delayed in updating the main repos.

This is called read your own write semantics. Hyperledger Fabric does not support this sort of capability at this time.

It is a question in fabric-chaincode-node, the transientMap got from `stub.getTransient()`. The value inside transientMap looks like this

Anyone has idea how to parse this compound value message?

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Sun, 19 Jan 2020 08:38:13 GMT):<br/>
getTransient should return a map of keys and buffer objects. Can you show the code you used to get this output ?

</p>
<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Sun, 19 Jan 2020 12:53:19 GMT):<br/>
yes, the returned object is a map in a format of protobuf map. but the problem is the value content, and value type is indeed buffer.
BTW the used version is 1.4.4 for both fabric-shim and entire network.

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Sun, 19 Jan 2020 12:55:03 GMT):<br/>
Can you post the code you used ?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Sun, 19 Jan 2020 12:58:46 GMT):<br/>
Previously I tried to get the readable content of the buffer via `toString()`, then I got the compound message type shown above


This is my current work around way: 


this.transient = {};
		for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(stub.getTransient().map)) {
			this.transient[key] = value.value.buffer.toString().split('\u0012\u0001')[1];
		}
</p>
<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Sun, 19 Jan 2020 13:00:29 GMT):<br/>
I guess you might know what I aim to do from this.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Sun, 19 Jan 2020 13:02:06 GMT):<br/>
Looking at some of the chaincode tests it looks like you should do something like
```
const tr = stub.getTransient();
const valBuf = tr.get('mykey');
const val = valBuf.getString('utf-8');
const valObj = JSON.parse(val);
```
In the above I would assume that a JSON string was put into the `mykey` key of the transient map.

Cool, I have never tried the `getString` function, this might help

Opps hang on it might be toString.... I quickly typed it now

Hi, Dave, I find it is my fault.

<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Sun, 19 Jan 2020 13:44:55 GMT):<br/>
`toString('utf8')` is the correct way instead of my previous `toString()`

I am getting the following error while installing chaincode in the peer:

fatal error: unexpected signal during runtime execution
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0xe5 pc=0x7f9658446638]

I tried installing chaincode given in the samples and it installed successfully. However, it fails for my chaincode. It fails on multiple peers. And if I try to hit this installation request consequently then it would succeed for once which is quite weird.

The samples work but your own custom chaincode doesn't? Then I'd recommend modifying the samples step by step until it does what your custom chaincode does.

Thank you very much for answering. The problem is at the same time that the transaction is changing a value, another transaction is also changing another value which I am trying to read. It seems like it is not possible. I am going to change my code to use a seperate invoke to read the state.

It sounds like you're just vendoring the dependencies which is simliar to `mvn install` for JVM and `go mod tidy` for Go. Sounds okay.
</p>
<p><strong>medikent</strong> (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:27:42 GMT):<br/>
My endorsement policy is much simpler and takes about 3.2 seconds to validate. 5 seconds definitely seems unnecessarily longer.

If you mean the duration between application sends request and receives response. It depends on the settings of your network especially how often does the order service create a new block.

Unfortunately, when starting the network I receive the following error: *plugin.Open("/var/path/plugin.so"): /var/path/plugin.so: invalid ELF header*

Hi, I am looking to encrypt and store some data encryption will be performed in chaincode. Is there is a specific reason to use bccsp and ext/entities as shown in example of encc_example instead of using crypto package provided by golang

Hi all, is there a way to dynamically obtain all organizations of the channel  from inside the chaincode? Or should we store MSP IDs in the ledger and update the chaincode when new participants enter?
Thanks in advance!

ahh
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:17:12 GMT):<br/>
well you could look at the channel config pb
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:17:30 GMT):<br/>
decode it to json, that should have a list of all the orgs participating in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:17:54 GMT):<br/>
although come to think of it not sure you can do that inside chaincode 
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:18:08 GMT):<br/>
yes, but does the chaincode stub has the channel config? I don't think so...
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:19:04 GMT):<br/>
It would be nice though to have that info in the chaincode stub and be able to use  it in the chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:19:45 GMT):<br/>
well you could always force the invocation to provide that information, but then it would just be based on the invocation and not ground truth
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:20:52 GMT):<br/>
although if you're building a custom client, the custom client could have that information cached and pass that information along to the chaincode along with the invocation
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:23:33 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, but that's just one client so it can not be trusted, this client could fool the transaction, in that case I think it is better to save the participants in the state or chaincode and update them.  The best would be if this is something the stub has access to, so every peer has to have the same list of participants to be able to fulfill endorsement policies.
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:23:33 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, but that's just one client so it can not be trusted, this client can say whatever it wants.

Hi guys! I wanted to ask if it's possible to invoke fabric-ca actions from within a chaincode? 🤔
</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 15:16:49 GMT):<br/>
The idea is that one identity can send tokens to the chaincode, and then the chaincode somehow issues a certificate with certain attributes. With this Certificate the identity can then access some abac encrypted data. 

It's like a pay to access use case.

With the contract model you don't need to provide a specific main method. Use the `contract router` as the main method. If you have a look at the Java chaincodes in fabric-samples or in the javachaincode git repo there are examples of setup

The way I mocked things in Kotlin was I used a test certificate I pulled from the chaincode log files from a System.out.println() call during transaction execution, saved the certificate as a string and byte array in my test, and returned it on my mock for ClientIdentity. I imagine you could do the same thing for the Go ClientIdentity.GetID() function.

Hi, I have a question about the new implicit private data collection feature.

Can a transaction with implicit private data for a certain organisation be endorsed by an organisation other than the private data receiver and the sender of the transaction?
Or can the maximum amount of endorsers only be those two orgs?

Thanks in advance!

Hey guys, I have created a network with one org(Org1) and two peers. and added a second org(Org2) to the existing network by following hyperledger documentation.
When I install a chaincode on peer0 and peer1 of Org1 install proposal was good. But when I install Chaincode on Org2 proposal was good only on peer0 but not on peer1.
I have recently started working on hyperledger fabric. Can anyone please explain me what to do to make my chaincode installation successful on any newly added organization.

Hello, I have a question relating to `fabric-chaincode-java`.  Regarding `org.hyperledger.fabric.contract.ContractRouter` in `fabric-chaincode-shim`, is it reasonable to extend this class and override its `init`/`invoke` methods to add custom logic?  The intent is to use `putState` to create/edit a configuration object at chaincode instantiatation/upgrade.  The methods would, of course, make a call to `super.init(stub)`/`super.invoke(stub)` respectively after the custom logic.  At a glance, this seems fine to do, but a second opinion would be appreciated.  See the following a link to the ContractRouter class: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-java/blob/master/fabric-chaincode-shim/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/contract/ContractRouter.java

What's interesting is the init method in ContractRouter is not being called on instantiate.

<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 14:05:56 GMT):<br/>
Right - with instantiate you can specify the function that you want to run, which again may help you.
</p>
<p><strong>letch2010</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 14:23:38 GMT):<br/>
Thank you very much!  I suppose making a @Transaction method in my contract, then calling that on instantiate is the way to go.  I'll have to add checks such that it cannot be called outside of chaincode instantiation/upgrade.

Hello, does anyone know something related to:

</p>
<p><strong>dan13</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 19:48:58 GMT):<br/>
The problem is the size of the key, or the size of the value (object)? Generally your keys should be smallish values and the value should not be too large (I don't know exact dividing line, but some KBs seems reasonable and more than that not).
</p>
<p><strong>eduardosanzb</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 22:29:15 GMT):<br/>
Is about the size of the object, I'm storing base64 images.  ( I now base64 is terrible, but I'd like to use the chryptographic history etc etc)
</p>
<p><strong>eduardosanzb</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 22:30:36 GMT):<br/>

Hello, 

I'm using a simple network (`chaincode-docker-devmode`, fabric 1.4) and trying to install a nodejs chaincode. 
I'm able to successfully create and join a channel using these commands:

```
peer channel create -c myc -f myc.tx -o orderer:7050
peer channel join -b myc.block
```

I am able to successfully install the chaincode using this command:

```
peer chaincode install     --lang node --name mycontract --version v0 --path /opt/gopath/src/chaincodedev/chaincode
```

I get an error when instantiating the chaincode with this command:
```
peer chaincode instantiate --lang node --name mycontract --version v0 --orderer orderer:7050 --channelID myc  -c '{"Args":["AccountContract:initLedger"]}'
```

I get the following error:
```
Error: could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg chaincode registration failed: container exited with 0
```

Any suggestions for how to debug/troubleshoot the instantiation of chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 09:43:51 GMT):<br/>
@jrasm91 when the chainocde is instantiated, there's a 'builder' docker container that will do 'npm install'.   it could be that this is failing for some reason;  it you can capture the output of that container, then it usually helps enormously... downside is that it doesn't last very long. Something like this would help to monitor all the docker containers  https://gist.github.com/mbwhite/a32abc57a0a45ecc466977ceef67df1f

I'd recommend looking at the VSCode plugin... it lets you debug into Smart Contracts and Chaincode... really useful.

It comes with a 1.4.4 fabric release test network built in.

<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 16:00:44 GMT):<br/>
When the initstantiate happens, the chaincode docker image is started; the code in the contract-api checks for what contracts are available and then the underlying code (shim or stub depending on what you callit!) talks back to the peer to register.

At this point the chaincode 'init' method is called with any args you've given; in the case of contracts the approroaite contract function will be executed.

I suppose it would be wise to just deserialize what I want from json, i.e., instead of having a List in my transaction method, i just take in a string that I deserialize into the List.

<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 05:12:44 GMT):<br/>
I would close it myself. It is removed for now.

Hello; could you share what your transaction function is please?
</p>
<p><strong>letch2010</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:03:36 GMT):<br/>
`	@Transaction
	public List<String> myFunc(Context ctx, List<String> stringList) {
		return stringList;
	}`
</p>
<p><strong>letch2010</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:12:37 GMT):<br/>
My solution was to change the `stringList` parameter into stringified JSON, then deserialize it into a List.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:14:05 GMT):<br/>
yep; the issue is that only objects that are marked with the `@Datatype` annotation can be returned or passed to the functions.  (as well as Strings and primitives)
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:15:57 GMT):<br/>

		return stringList;
	}

	@DataType
	public class myModel {
	
		@Property
		private List<String> stringList;
	
	}


```
</p>
<p><strong>letch2010</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:51:23 GMT):<br/>
My JSON is `'{"Args":["myFunc", "[\"str1\", \"str2\"]"]}'`
</p>
<p><strong>letch2010</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:52:06 GMT):<br/>
SchemaValidationException is returned on the List, despite the `@DataType` annotiation.
</p>
<p><strong>letch2010</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:53:17 GMT):<br/>
I'll try to find time to reproduce and post the stacktrace.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:54:14 GMT):<br/>
The problem is still the List I'm afraid... though the myModel could be passed; the current serializer doesn't know how to cope with List objects.. :-(
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 15:01:32 GMT):<br/>
Whilsts the serializer could use the list interface to create a JSON form; it would need some clue as to what to recate the list into.
</p>
<p><strong>letch2010</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 15:02:55 GMT):<br/>
Right, that's exactly what I encountered.  So yeah, I just deserialize the Json into a List in the transaction method.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 15:06:42 GMT):<br/>
it is possible to write your own serializer to handle such cases;
</p>
<p><strong>letch2010</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 16:48:56 GMT):<br/>
How could I register that serializer with my chaincode?  I'm not sure what they would look like.

<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 16:57:28 GMT):<br/>
I'll dig out an example of the exact syntax... but the principal is create a class that is tagged with the @Serializer annotation that implements the SerializerInterface.  Then in the Contract annotation provide the fully qualified name.

Say two organizations are participating in a network (org1 and org2). A channel is created between both the orgs. Say a chaincode is installed on org1. Can a transaction invoked on that chaincode be queried from org2 even thought the chaincode is only installed on org1? 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 00:59:41 GMT):<br/>
afaik chaincodes dont get installed on orgs, they get installed on channels
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 01:00:08 GMT):<br/>
so any peer org participating in the channel will receive the blockchain generated by the chaincode

In our chaincode, we implemented two different ways to serialize data to be added to the ledger: json and gzipped json. We can control whether or not to gzip assets using a global setting, which is essentially a constant; it doesn't change during the lifecycle of the chaincode. Is there a way to pass arbitrary settings to the chaincode - at install-time for instance? The `Init` method isn't a good fit because it is not run on every peer. The solution we have now is to hardcode the setting, but that isn't very elegant because the only way to modify the setting is to modify the chaincode source code. 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 19:06:57 GMT):<br/>
this is just a guess, but have you tried loading a file from the peer's filesystem? if that works you could just put it in a docker volume and read the file at runtime
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 23:07:43 GMT):<br/>
Why not write a flag to the world state at Init time ? Then all peers will use that flag

Thats's a good idea too, thank you! It does mix business logic and configuration, but it does solve the problem.

Hi All 

Extremely sorry to bother you but I have  HF related question, and spent a whole day debugging this issue and would love y’all perspective.  :)

I am facing an endorsement policy issue  for a specific chaincode in the test env,** BUT** the other chaincode in the test environment work fine using the same endorsement policy. The specific chaincode that is having the endorsement policy failure  works fine in the DEV environment. 

 Difference between test env and dev env. 

Dev Env: HF 1.4.2, have control of ORG1 and ORG2 certs and peers.  
Test Env: HF 1.4.0, only have control of ORG1 certs and peers.

In regards to trouble shooting, is there a method in which I can see the endorsement of the specific chaincode that is failing and has been instantiated in the channel. It should have the same endorsement policy as the other chaincode just want to confirm. 

Below is an example of the endorsement policy that is being used. 

``` shell
    -P "AND (OR(‘Org1MSP.peer', ‘Org1MSP.client’,’Org1MSP.member’,’Org1MSP.admin'), OR (‘Org2MSP.peer', ‘Org2MSP.client', ‘Org2MSP.member', ‘Org2MSP.admin'))"
````

Errors Faced: 
```shell
validateTx -> ERRO 42d1[0m VSCCValidateTx for transaction txId = returned error: VSCC error: endorsement policy failure, err: signature set did not satisfy policy
```
```shell
validateTx -> ERRO 42d1[0m VSCCValidateTx for transaction txId = returned error: VSCC error: endorsement policy failure, err: signature set did not satisfy policy
```
In regards to trouble shooting, I have a few questions. 


1.)  Is there a method in which I can see the endorsement of the specific chaincode that is failing and has been instantiated in the channel. It should have the same endorsement policy as the other chaincode just want to confirm. 
2.) Is is possible that changes in ORG2 peers and certs can cause endorsement policy in a specific chaincode and not the other chaincode. 
3.) Can the difference between HF versions cause endorsement policy error for one of the chain-code and not the rest?
3.) Any thoughts or hints that can set me in the right direction?

Probably I'm instantiating the SmartContracts in a wrong way. Could you guys help me on this issue? 

It follows the steps that a followed and the two smart contracts structure. 

PS.: If you guys prefer, I can send the code.

*INSTALL STEP*
`peer chaincode install -n ${CHAINCODE_NAME} -v 1.0 -l node -p /opt/gopath/src/github.com/chaincode/${CHAINCODE_NAME}/node/`

*INSTANTIATE STEP*
```
peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.${CONFIG_DOMAIN}:7050 --tls $CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED --cafile $ORDERER_CA -C $CHANNEL_NAME -n ${CHAINCODE_NAME} -l ${LANGUAGE} -v ${VERSION} -c '{"Args":["initLedger1"]}' -P "AND ('${CONFIG_ORG_1}MSP.peer','${CONFIG_ORG_2}MSP.peer')" >&log.txt
```

*SMART CONTRACT STRUCTURE*

*Contract 1 file: lib/contract1.js*

```
class Contract1 extends Contract {
  ...
  async initLedger1(ctx) {..}
  
  async queryAll1(ctx) {..}

  ...
}
module.exports = Contract1;
```


*Contract 2 file: lib/newcontract1.js*

```
class Contract2 extends Contract {
  ...
  async initLedger2(ctx) {..}

  async queryAll2(ctx) {..}

  ...
}
module.exports = Contract2;
```

*Index file: index.js*

```
'use strict';

const Contract1 = require('./lib/contract1');
const Contract2 = require('./lib/contract2');

module.exports.Contract1 = Contract1;
module.exports.Contract2 = Contract2;
module.exports.contracts = [ Contract2, Contract1 ];
```

Hi jrasm91 . Did you solve this problem? If yes, could you explain how you installed/instatiated two smart contracts on the same channel? I'm trying to do the same thing.

Hi,
I wanted to know how to check whether any records were retrieved or not when using the getQueryResult() method, which returns an object of the type QueryResultsIterator<KeyValue>.
</p>
<p><strong>Jelle.Diet</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 11:16:06 GMT):<br/>
something like this maybe?  Iterator<KeyValue> iterator = ctx.getStub().getQueryResult(query).iterator();
        if(!iterator.hasNext()) {
            // no results
        }
</p>
<p><strong>G596</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 05:24:06 GMT):<br/>
thanks! works like a charm :)

Hi all, i am using the new chaincode lifecycle and sometimes after installing, approving and commiting the chaincode, the database for the chaincode is not created in the couchDB. I do have the lifecycle databases, and in there I see the metadata and everything of my chaincode, but its own database doesn't show up.
When I then try to do some invokes, the transactions are rejected by the peer at commit time: `Transaction commit was rejected by peer ...`
If I then retry the invoke some times it suddenly creates the db and the transaction gets comitted succesfully. From that point everything works normal.

Is this a known bug or could it be something I am doing wrong?

Hi All,

I'm trying to send multiple events from my Go chaincode using SetEvent(). I use NodeJS' registerChaincodeEvent() to subscribe events.

I can receive an event from chaincode correctly if I emit just a single event. But, if I try to emit multiple events I will receive only the latest emitted event. This issue happens both when I emit events with the same event name or different names.

Can anyone shed some light on this?
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 09:20:01 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I believe you can only emit one event per transaction. Setting another event overrides the previously set one

Hi, I am getting the chaincode event payload as <Buffer 7B 7D> and when I convert it to string - its an empty json. . Any ideas ? I am connecting eventhub before registering so that should be ok & utilizing getchannelEventHubForOrgs()

<p><strong>PranavBhardwaja67</strong> (Fri, 20 Mar 2020 04:29:07 GMT):<br/>
Hey Thank you , well that worked . It was a different issue. But if I just have to register the event just once and not everytime , then what shall we do to listen to that event everytime ( Without getting into ..registerevent)
</p>
<p><strong>serial-coder</strong> (Fri, 20 Mar 2020 04:45:43 GMT):<br/>
I don't think I understand your question correctly but you have to register an event just once using one of the following: registerTxEvent(), registerBlockEvent() or registerBlockEvent(). With registerBlockEvent(), you can catch any event from any txs in any block without the need to register a chaincode event one by one.

Hi community,

How can I test my smartcontracts developed in nodejs using `fabric-contract-api`?

There is no available MockContract inside that library and if I try to use `fabric-shim`, I see errors saying that my chaincode does not implement `ChaincodeInterface` with methods `Init` and `Invoke` which it clearly doesn't.

What can you recommend?

<p><strong>yuriiuhlanov</strong> (Mon, 30 Mar 2020 11:46:50 GMT):<br/>
what I did, in my test file I created a class that extended my `Contract` class and implemented both `Init` and `Invoke` methods from `ChaincodeInterface`. Since I used custom `Context` implementation, I had to instantiate it and assign `stub: ChaincodeMockStub` that both methods accept to `stub` property of my context. Later on, I was able to obtain the function name and arguments and pass them to an appropriate smartcontract from `this`. Do not forget to return `shim.error` or `shim.success`. `mockStub` I created using @theledger/fabric-mock-stub where I passed an instance of my Contract extended with both aforementioned methods. Hope this helps someone else.

"If you commit the definition before a channel member has approved the chaincode, the organization will not be able to endorse transactions. As a result, it is recommended that all channel members approve a chaincode before committing the chaincode definition."

What about new organizations entering the consortium?
Should a chaincode update be done if the new organization also needs to use the chaincode?
And does this only counts if the new organisation needs to be able to endorse txs or can it also not query the chaincode?

Hi Fabric gurus. I'm trying out the new chaincode installation lifecycle using the CLI on a 4-org 4-peer network. I'm able to package my chaincode, install it on all 4 peers, and approve it from all 4 peers. But it finally fails at the commit step.

Before the commit step, I query for readiness using `peer lifecycle chaincode checkcommitreadiness`. I get a positive status for all 4 orgs as follows:
```
{
        "approvals": {
                "CarrierOrgMSP": true,
                "ExporterOrgMSP": true,
                "ImporterOrgMSP": true,
                "RegulatorOrgMSP": true
        }
}
```

But commitment fails with the following error: `Error: proposal failed with status: 500 - failed to invoke backing implementation of 'CommitChaincodeDefinition': chaincode definition not agreed to by this org (ExporterOrgMSP)`. The org name doesn't matter; I tried different permutations of orgs, and the commit failed each time with a similar error.

I also tried different chaincodes and chaincode types (Go and Java). Same error each time.

Any advice?

Hi guys, does anyone have the release notes for fabric/java-env for all versions of 1.4.x. I am trying to figure out what differences are there between 1.4.0 to 1.4.2 in regards to java sdk. I checked on https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java and see that it just says minor changes, I would like to know what changes.

Hello, Im reading the _hyperledger-fabricdocs pdf version 1.4_ and I am very confused by the `anchor` concept in *2.1.1. PROPOSE message format* : \footnotesize anchor contains read version dependencies, or more specifically, key-version pairs (i.e., anchor is a subset
of KxN), that binds or “anchors” the PROPOSE request to specified versions of keys in a KVS (see Section 1.2.).
If the client specifies the anchor argument, an endorser endorses a transaction only upon read version numbers
of corresponding keys in its local KVS match anchor (see Section 2.2. for more details).
\normalsize Are they some examples of usage of this type of argument ?

How do you guys setup the network and your chaincodes, are you building multiple chaincodes or trying to reduces to the maximum?
I build a very basic network with chaincodes, two orgs, one peer per each org, two raft orders all that in a single channel. With this setup I noticed a big decrease in performance (both my machine but primarily the network). When I'm deploying and instantiating the second chaincode I see the fall in performance. I can build the poc with only one chaincode deployed, but I was hoping for a more DDD approach, making each chaincode encapsulating the business domain.
Also, is the first-network example one that may have many configuration flaws? I based my setup on this example and as mentioned my machine gets it's ass beaten (I have a 16GB MacBookPro, so not the worst).

For anyone encountering this issue, it was fixed by editing the hyperledger/fabric-javaenv image.  You just need to make sure your credentials are in that image, since that is what hyperledger fabric uses to build/instantiate chaincodes.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 17:41:28 GMT):<br/>
You might want to raise an issue on jira against the Java Chaincode, there could be another way to provide credentials, if not then it sounds like using a private maven repo might be a useful thing other people may do so could be a feature enhancement

Hey, 
I was using CouchDB and I tried to spawn a network with more than 2 peers in an organization(I had 5 peers). It was very unusual data in all the CouchDB was not the same. I didn't get this if a peer belongs to an authorized organization, then ideally it should pull data from other peers. Can anyone help me with this?

In a Java chaincode, how would I go about implementing my own logging framework?  Currently, I am using Slf4j implemented by log4j2 configured with a log4j2.yaml file.  It runs correctly locally.  When I instantiate the chaincode, I check the chaincode container for the logs.  I do see some of my logging messages, but it seems the chaincode logging is not configured according to my configuration file.
</p>
<p><strong>letch2010</strong> (Tue, 14 Apr 2020 20:20:05 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>letch2010</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 15:21:54 GMT):<br/>
For anyone interested, I solved the above issue by adding this transformer, `com.github.edwgiz.mavenShadePlugin.log4j2CacheTransformer.PluginsCacheFileTransformer`, to my maven-shade-plugin.  Apparently, log4j2 does not play well with uberjars.  See the git project for how to add it to your project's dependency management file.

Hi there, is there a way to force a given serialization of an object when returning response from a java contract ?
I have java LocalDate type in my response dto and it's being serialized to an array of values, like `:\"year\":2020,\"month\":\"MARCH\",\"monthValue\":3,\"dayOfMonth\":31,\"leapYear\":true,"`. Any idea how to force a proper serialization or I need to do it manually ?
</p>
<p><strong>letch2010</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 23:50:54 GMT):<br/>
Use the jackson-datatype-jsr310 dependency.  You'll need to manage how it gets serialized.
</p>
<p><strong>Mms 11</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:38:26 GMT):<br/>
@letch2010 Thx, I already have it in my dependencies, but the shim uses some sort of a json serialization mechanism already, I had to force it with JsonSerializer. 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:45:15 GMT):<br/>
technically it's not the shim, this is a feature of the contract api

Hello, I'm trying to upgrade to the new chaincode lifecycle in Fabric 2.0. I'm having trouble committing the chaincode to the channel - I think it has something to do with the peers communicating with each other (`--peerAddresses` and `tlsRootCertFiles`).

This is what I wrote:
`peer lifecycle chaincode commit -o orderer0.orgorderer1:7050 --tls true --cafile /data/orgorderer1-ca-chain.pem --clientauth true --keyfile /data/tls/org1-cli-client.key --certfile /data/tls/org1-cli-client.crt --channelID mychannel --name trade_cc1 --version 1.0 --init-required --sequence 1  --peerAddresses peer0.org1:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles /data/org1-ca-chain.pem --peerAddresses peer0.org2:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles /data/org2-ca-chain.pem`

Here's the error message that was returned:

...
`Error: failed to retrieve endorser client for commit: endorser client failed to connect to peer0.org2:7051: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded`

There does exist an interface for this JsonTransactionSerializer.  It seems feasible to replace it with your own serializer.  To be frank, I find the HLF serializer lacking.  They use org.json, which is a bunk library.

I managed to make a workaround by using the @JsonSerialization annotation with a custom serializer. Until that will work I'm fine :) 
Thx guys !
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 17:15:20 GMT):<br/>
that would look like TransactionContextInterface.GetStub().getQueryResult(query string)

You an test your queries no data that you have on the peer by going to : http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/#/_all_dbs
change the port to the peers coach db you are interested.

@Mms 11 
My question is that what is the best way to take inputs from the rest api?
If i want to save an owner. for eg in array like [01,'abcd',24,'xyz@abcd.com'] or in a single index with json as string like ['{id:01,name:"abcd"}']
</p>

<p><strong>Mms 11</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 20:10:03 GMT):<br/>
I think there is non, if you will see the Chaincode implementation -> ChaincodeBase  handles the invoke call it handles arrays of Strings. So it depends on your case. It's the same way with traditional facade development, if you have more than 5 params you would traditionally package it into a dto anyways. 
</p>
<p><strong>Rachit-gaur</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 20:11:42 GMT):<br/>
I do have 10 inputs.
Shall i use nodejs api to receive the data from the UI and then parse it into array to send to blockchain? or as it is as an obj
 But how will i validate them?
</p>
<p><strong>Mms 11</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 20:13:24 GMT):<br/>
I would pass these 10 inputs in a json object (json represented String) and serialize it to an object back in the chaincode and then do any validation you need to do. 
</p>
<p><strong>Rachit-gaur</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 20:14:54 GMT):<br/>
Won't that increase the processing time?
</p>
<p><strong>Mms 11</strong> (Fri, 17 Apr 2020 20:15:40 GMT):<br/>
no, it shouldn't

I'm running a fabric 1.4.2 network. I created one channel using this profile 

```
    OneOrgChannel:
        Consortium: SampleConsortium
        Application:
            <<: *ApplicationDefaults
            Organizations:
                - *Org1
            Capabilities:
                <<: *ApplicationCapabilities


```
I have a 2 org setup. To my astonishment peers of org2 could also join this channel. Could someone help me understand this.

Hi! I'm using the high level fabric-contract-api-go but I'm receiving this error every time I try to invoke a function other than "Init": `Error: endorsement failure during invoke. response: status:500 message:"Function newTransaction not found in contract SmartContract`. 

I'm pretty sure I followed the format of fabcar closely. Are you supposed to initialize the functions somewhere (like the Invoke function in the low-level one)? :confused:

Hi guys,
I have a use case similar to marbles but on huge level
So, if i am transferring a number of marbles to another user, I would need to store all the ids inside the user struct for ex
User{
Name:"user1",
Marbles:["1","2","3"....]  
}
Now I was wondering what would be the impact in terms of storage, I would need to save thousands of marbles in a single user
</p>
<p><strong>Rachit-gaur</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 18:11:24 GMT):<br/>
Is this the correct implementation
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 22:08:01 GMT):<br/>
If I get your question correctly, I think that each marble should have the owner as the user. 
You will need to update the marle.owner with your user. Now, if you want to create an index or a separate structure for that ok. This follows the concept that each marble is an asset and someone owes them.

Hi Everyone,

I am currently knee-deep in developing a simple order book on Fabric. I would like to use `GetQueryResult` because I would like to query the orderbook and sort results based on price, age etc. However, I note in the docs it says that queries are not re-executed on peers when validating. So, given the following sequence of transactions...

1. The query runs on the peer during the 'invoke' and it might identify an order which has 5 units for sale.
2. The cc on this peer runs and 'buys' 1 unit from this order. Effectively, the code is just subtracting 1 from the balance of the order.

3. At the same time, on another peer the same order with 5 units is identified by the query
4. The cc on that peer runs an 'buys' 4 units from this order.

5. At the same time, on another peer the same order with 5 units is identified by the query
6. The cc on that peer runs an 'buys' 1 unit from this order.


Assuming there is no verification to see if the order balance goes below 0....

- Will the balance of the order would reduce to -1 (effectively a double spend)?

And, assuming this is the case, if the subtract function in the the cc guard against the balance going below zero, with something like:

```
sellOrder.balance -= buyOrder.units
if sellOrder.balance < 0 {
  return errors.New("Transaction failed, negative balance")
}
```

- Will the double spend still happen? i.e. is the chaincode logic re-evaluated at validation time?

Or, will only one of the transactions happen anyway because of the key versioning?

Thanks!

Hi @ChrisSargent , to be safe you should use the GetStateByPartialCompositeKey. You can store all orderers in the book with the same objectType/docType and then use GetStateByPartialCompositeKey(objectType, []string {}) with that objectType and an empty array for the key parts. You can then sort the results returned and don't worry about phantom reads.
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 18:33:43 GMT):<br/>
Because you are not sure in which order the queries are done on the peer and in which order they are included in a block later... So even though you check the balance, you can get wrong results I think. I am also not 100% sure about this, I should think about it some longer. So if you can get someone else to confirm, that would be great.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 18:35:23 GMT):<br/>
Hi @braduf , yes, this is how we're doing it right now, before we started to deal with price limits.

To 'sort' the results, would we have to loop through the iterator, putting each result in to an array and then sort the array?

yeah, I'm also not 100% sure on it - and quite difficult to test.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 18:36:21 GMT):<br/>
I'm also thinking of creating an index of the orders, based on their pricing, then using GetStateByRange to find all orders above the current asking price for example.
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 18:37:36 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that could be another way, if price doesn't change, it can be part of the composite key and you can use GetStateByRange
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 18:38:10 GMT):<br/>
The prices of the orders don't change, no. They would have to be cancelled and recreated.
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 18:38:53 GMT):<br/>
Yes, then you could use the StateByRange
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 18:54:50 GMT):<br/>
yeah, been trying that. It's kind of strange because if you try to use a key made with `createCompositeKey` it doesn't work (gives the null key error) but if you just concatenate a string for the key it seems to work fine.

Hi, can a function in chaincode (golang) return 3 arguments? It seems to generate an error everytime I try to return 3 values, but it works perfectly well when I reduce the number of arguments to 2.
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Wed, 22 Apr 2020 07:41:19 GMT):<br/>
Functions of contracts may only return zero, one or two values

   * If the function is defined to return zero values then a success response will be returned for all calls to that contract function
   * If the function is defined to return one value then that value may be any of the allowable types listed for parameters (except interface{}) or error.
   * If the function is defined to return two values then the first may be any of the allowable types listed for parameters (except interface{}) and the second must be error

Hi i have a question, is levelDB functionalities good enough to support the general range of applications? or that there are some application design that requires couchDB.
For example, a `fx trading platform`
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 07:27:43 GMT):<br/>
if you need complex queries then you need couchdb
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 07:32:38 GMT):<br/>
ok thank you, so in other words. its possible to use levelDB for general applications development?
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 08:01:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes, given that for each query you can use only the key to retrieve the current state of the asset.  If you want to search by fields of this asset then you need couchdb. Depends on your use case really, but you can have something running initially with leveldb and decide from there if you need more than that. 
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 08:02:31 GMT):<br/>
for a fx trading platform you will not be satisfied with searching only by a key.

I'm working on something with orders and orderbooks and I'm using key maps extensively. Could use queries but you can't rely on them during execution on peers because they are not re-executed.

For any dashboard-like queries it seems its not recommended to use chaincode queries either, see: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/couchdb_as_state_database.html#good-practices-for-queries

@ChrisSargent key maps extensively => meaning you're using levelDB?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 12:24:38 GMT):<br/>
no, I mean I use a kind of lookup table (just a ledger object) which holds the IDs of orders against a particular price. So when someone wants to buy, it's easy to find all the orders that are above or below that price, without searching or looping through the whole ledger. And avoids running a db query by price for example.

```go
type OrderBookRow struct {
	OrderIDs []string
	RowTotal int
}

type OrderBook struct {
	FundID string
	Side   OrderSide
	Rows   map[string]OrderBookRow
}
```
</p>

	RowTotal int
}

type OrderBook struct {
	OrderbookID string
	Side   string
	Rows   map[string]OrderBookRow
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:42:14 GMT):<br/>
this starts to make better sense, so you're querying OrderBookRow to retrieve the set of IDS then retrieving them from the OrderBook?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:42:23 GMT):<br/>
Then the orderbook has some methods on for adding new orders and deleting orders - and if a row becomes 'empty' it is deleted.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:42:38 GMT):<br/>
Exactly
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:43:01 GMT):<br/>
so when a new order is created, it creates/update 2 row of data?

- OrderBookRow
- OrderBook
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:43:14 GMT):<br/>
Also, because the ids are in a slice, they are maintained in the order they're appended - i.e. sorted by creation date.
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:43:46 GMT):<br/>
if you want to add additional filters, you just create a separate row?
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:45:23 GMT):<br/>
i have another question, this may sound really lame. But how do you create these unique orderBookID? 

Using conventional sql or mongodb, the ids are automatically created. But when i look at the examples on fabric docs. Apparently you have to create them individually.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:46:43 GMT):<br/>
We use the `stub.GetTxID()` and then use a key like `OrderTxID` using `stub.CreateCompositeKey()`
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:47:30 GMT):<br/>
About additional filters - I'm not 100% sure. I would think that to filter on another field, you'd probably need another 'book'.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:48:46 GMT):<br/>
In my case I had to be able to quickly add up the total parts for sale above or below a certain price, so you probably wouldn't need that 'column' if you didn't have that need.
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:49:52 GMT):<br/>
TIL
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:50:23 GMT):<br/>
This is really helpful @ChrisSargent, i am going to experiment around with what you just shared to have a better understanding on how to design the flow
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:50:28 GMT):<br/>
Thank you very much!
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:52:48 GMT):<br/>
No worries - just note that one problem is that whenever an order happens, the orderbook would need to be updated, which means if you're expecting many transactions per second from different peers, you'd likely get some failed transactions - because they're trying to update an item with the same key (the orderbook) at the same time, even if the transactions are not 'related'.

Right now, I haven't thought of a way around that!
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:53:13 GMT):<br/>
That is a really good point
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:54:07 GMT):<br/>
what is your opinion on using a local database along side the ledger, from the hyperledger doc link you shared previously
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:54:39 GMT):<br/>
actually, you could possible keep each 'row' with its own key on the ledger - that would mean it would only clash if an order is happening at the same price.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:55:47 GMT):<br/>
Re: DB - I think for doing write transactions, you'd run in to the same problems as running queries in CouchDB. But I'm not sure.
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:56:33 GMT):<br/>
need some hands on before coming onto conclusion
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:56:38 GMT):<br/>
right.

</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:57:48 GMT):<br/>
go.
</p>
<p><strong>ThomasRalee</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:58:19 GMT):<br/>
ermmm ok, do you think the language of the chaincode affects the performance of the transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:59:37 GMT):<br/>
I can't answer that, sorry. Other than that I don't think the performance of the system should be the main factor in choosing the language :-)

From my understanding, server creates PKI and sends public key with some basic server details to certificate authority (CA). CA verifies server details and include those details and public key in the certificate and signs and issues certificate of the server.
If this is true, while registering user  we have to follow same thing. But I can not see creating PKI of a user in this code
        const secret = await ca.register({ affiliation: 'org1.department1', enrollmentID: 'user1', role: 'client' }, adminIdentity);
        const enrollment = await ca.enroll({ enrollmentID: 'user1', enrollmentSecret: secret });
        const userIdentity = X509WalletMixin.createIdentity('Org1MSP', enrollment.certificate, enrollment.key.toBytes());
        await wallet.import('user1', userIdentity);
        console.log('Successfully registered and enrolled admin user "user1" and imported it into the wallet');
Can you please explain what I misunderstood here.

How can we deploy the chaincode with indexes for a java chaincode ?
I have my index.json file in resource (META-INF/statedb/couchdb/indexes) but when I ran the chaincode installer the index does not get installed.  I'm using the shadowJar gradle plugin to package the project, is there something that I need to add when deploying the cc, like when we set collections ?

<p><strong>pritam_01</strong> (Sat, 09 May 2020 06:56:57 GMT):<br/>
because peer container has to start the chaincode container by its own for that peer container need to give command to the host docker demon to start the chaincode container.
by mounting the docker.sock , peer container is able to give command to the host docker demon.

<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Sun, 10 May 2020 09:06:04 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking about this some more and using query results in transactions. As far as I can tell and referencing this link: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/readwrite.html, the reason is because the query doesn't add anything to the read-set in a transaction.

So, something like this could result in phantom reads (because there is no read set)

- GetQueryResult
- Loop QueryResult.Items
- Do something to QueryResult.Item
- Put QueryResult Item

But something like this, should be okay because we explicitly create a read set for the items we're interested in from the query

- GetQueryResult
- Loop QueryResult.Items
- GetStateByKey(QueryResult.Item.ID)
- Do something to QueryResult.Item
- Put QueryResult.Item

Does anyone have any thoughts on this or can shed some light on whether this would work?

Hi there, could I please ask someone for help with my performance problem inside chaincode (java chaincode)
I have created and almost copy-pasted the existing FabCar java chain code, I only changed it to fit my logic. I'm not able to go to times of execution of the getQueryResult that is for a FabCar.
The data are of similar volume: 125- 126 records.

Bellow you have my repo with two chaincodes and client apps to test the two:
https://github.com/Marek00Malik/fabric-samples/tree/chaincode-performance-test
Besides the FabCar java chaincode there is a poc-services chaincode, and also a poc-services client app.
You will start the network and deploy both chaincodes by running  ./startFabric.sh fabcar from the poc-services folder (the client app)

The results are 3.5 seconds for the FabCar and around 31 seconds for my chaincode.
Can someone review and help me with this one ?

Hello guys!
I know it's possible to use multiple contracts in one chaincode. But is it possible to specify a contract with the peer cli (peer chaincode query) ? 
The closest option is -n to specify the name of the chaincode. My 2 contracts are contained in the chaincode but the peer always send the command to the first contract
</p>
<p><strong>mvanmeerbeck</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 16:29:05 GMT):<br/>
In the Java SDK, it's possible to specify the chaincode and the contract:
```network.getContract(chaincodeId, contractName)```
</p>

Hi, I am trying to setup HLF in K8s, when I run instantiation command, its starting the chaincode container successfully. But the instantiation step is exiting with EOF. When I perform any query execution I am getting the following error:
```
Error: endorsement failure during query. response: status:500 message:"make sure the chaincode test_cc has been successfully instantiated and try again: chaincode test_cc not found"
```

What do you mean by Contract ? The ContractInterface implementation (I guess you are running a java chaincode, right) ?
If yes, the as far as I know you should have only one Contract implementation per container that you ran. Either merge the two Contract implementations together or make separate jar files that will be deployed separately, these will need to have chaincode names\chaincodeId that differ. 
</p>
<p><strong>icarrascol</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 21:41:30 GMT):<br/>
i know this isnt java but it is related as chaincode in js on version 2.1 allows to have multiple smart contracts in one chaincode package, and they can be accessed using the sdk, but the problem is that it isnt explained how to access them from the cli :S
</p>
<p><strong>c0deh0use</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 07:21:00 GMT):<br/>
so if you have one package that gets deployed you need to name it when installing on the peer. 
That name is used in the invoke command: 
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.1/commands/peerchaincode.html#peer-chaincode-invoke

 ```
peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.example.com:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --tls $CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED --cafile $ORDERER_CA -C ${CHANNEL_NAME} -n ${CHAINCODE_NAME} $PEER_CONN_PARMS -c '{"Args":["chaincode-method-name", "arg1", "arg2", "..." ]}' 
```

The first question I would ask is what goal are you trying to achieve having 2 contracts in a single chaincode as opposed to having contracts in their own individual chaincode package. For example contracts in the same chaincode have direct access to each other's data whereas if you deploy them in separate chaincodes then they don't but are still stored on the same ledger

</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 07:51:18 GMT):<br/>
If you still want to have 2 contracts in the same chaincode then the first contract you declare is the default contract and you don't have to qualify the method names with the contract namespace, the second contract requires that you invoke it's methods by prefixing it with that contract's namespace. An example can be seen here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/blob/eb579589906fe8f05e3a6302fcc900a5a590ece9/test/e2e/scenario.js#L40 where the test is invoking a contract built in contract whose namespace is `org.hyperledger.fabric` and the method name is `GetMetadata`. I would suggest raising a Jira on https://jira.hyperledger.org if you couldn't find any documentation about it

I'm running a go chaincode with 2 contracts (ContractInterface indeed). But i want them in the same chaincode which is possible in the SDK js and Java as icarrascol said.

The fabric-contract-api-go contract api is available for fabric 2.0 and later and should support multiple contracts in the same chaincode

The fabric-contract-api-go contract api is available for fabric 2.0 and later and should support multiple contracts in the same chaincode, but I am not an expert on this, I've never delved much into the go version of the contract api
</p>
<p><strong>mvanmeerbeck</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 09:49:38 GMT):<br/>
Thank you all! @davidkel  you nailed it, you have to prefix the method name with the name of the contract. With the peer cli:
```peer chaincode query -c {"Args":["name.of.the.contract:Method"]} (...)```
</p>
<p><strong>mvanmeerbeck</strong> (Wed, 20 May 2020 09:53:39 GMT):<br/>
fabric-contract-api-go does support multiple contracts, i'm using it but i only had trouble with the peer cli

Hi everyone, I have a workflow that I'm attempting to implement as chaincode using the node sdk. I'm trying to figure out the best way to restrict my chaincode so that certain functions are only permitted for use by certain organisations.
- This seems to be the way to do it https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-chaincode-node/release-2.1/api/fabric-shim.ClientIdentity.html - does anyone have any examples of chaincode where the ClientIdentity features have been implemented?
- Is installing different chaincode on different organisations' nodes a good solution? If not, why?

yes thank u both, and you were right there isnt any documentation about this topic ... and about having a chaincode with multiple contracts i dont know if it is not recommended but what would you do with a chaincode that gets really big as in lines of code?, i think multiple contracts allow me to split the chaincode in assets that are related and need to communicate

I am new to fabric.                I was trying to upgrade my network from 1.4 to 2.0 but when i am upgrading it, peer and orderer container upgraded to 2.0 but chaincode containers stopped. What we have to change in our chaincode before doing this? Please explain in detail. Please also mention the respective commands and steps to do it.

Hi i was trying perform cross chaincode invokation, i installed two chaincodes on fresh balance tranfder example and using docker images 1.4.3 for peer and orderer and using fabric SDK version 1.4.0 
`func invokeOther(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) pb.Response {
	str := []string{"invoke", "createconsolidated", "key", "indexRefKey"}
	chainCodeArgs := getArgsForCrossChaincode(str)
	response := stub.InvokeChaincode("chaincode2", chainCodeArgs, "channelName")
	if response.Status != shim.OK {
		return shim.Error(response.Message)
	}
	return shim.Success(nil)
}

`

Does anyone have examples of using the QSCC from chaincode?  I want to be able to get the details of a key's history using the getHistoryForKey, but from within chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>SuneetBendre</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 18:55:16 GMT):<br/>
You can call api from Shim lib.
Can you elaborate how are you doing now ?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 19:03:44 GMT):<br/>
That will get me an iterator over KeyModifications, but those only contain the txId.  I want to get the details of those transactions.

Hello, guys. I want to send events from commit transaction listener  to some message brokers like rabbitmq or apache kafka, my intention is notify others systems to do some action. I found something similar using compose in hyperledger 1.X but how can I achive this using HF 2?

Can I ask if anyone has a link or reference for chaincode testing for fabric-api-contract 2.1.2? Most of the sample unit test codes are still based on fabric-shim. Basically, the problem I have is getting an empty Context and ClientIdentity. ```class TestContext extends Context {
    constructor() {
        super()
        this.stub = sinon.createStubInstance(ChaincodeStub)
        this.clientIdentity = sinon.createStubInstance(ClientIdentity, {
           getIDBytes: identity
        })
        this.logger = {
            getLogger: sinon.stub().returns(sinon.createStubInstance(winston.createLogger().constructor)),
            setLevel: sinon.stub(),
        };
    }
}
```
and then having something like ```
    const contract = new MyChaincode()
    const ctx = new TestContext()

    it('CHAINCODE: Query', async () => {
        const response = await contract.query(ctx)
        expect(response).to.equal(ChaincodeStub.RESPONSE_CODE.OK)
    })```
With the chaincode something```
export class MyChaincode extends Contract {}```

Slow!  It creates a new Docker image which requires pulling all the required packages, building the chaincode, building the image, starting the image...

Enabling history on the state database feels like cheating from an audit perspective - anyone got any implementation tips for chaincode that queries the history of assets on the blockchain directly?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 19:24:55 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean enabling history on the state database?
</p>
<p><strong>SpecialAgentCooper</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 10:59:44 GMT):<br/>

<br/><a href="./assets/buDtq6DJ6csKXAXT3-getHistoryForKey chaincode stub docs">getHistoryForKey chaincode stub docs</a>
</p>
<p><strong>SpecialAgentCooper</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 11:02:10 GMT):<br/>
Whenever you run a chaincode query, it hits the state database and not the blockchain. This means that to look at an assets history, you need to have recorded that history in the database. This is a more efficient query, but to an auditor I can't see how it's any better than just having an encrypted database - I'd like to directly verify that this history matches the one on the actual blockchain. Does anyone know of a way to directly query the blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 15:14:36 GMT):<br/>
The various SDKs provide APIs to query the actual ledger, i.e., get a block or tx.
</p>
<p><strong>SpecialAgentCooper</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 15:18:03 GMT):<br/>
If you can point me to the part of the node sdk that does that for v2.1 I'll be very surprised. It was there in 1.4 but unfortunately I'm using 2.1 and those methods aren't there. I'm currently investigating the use of query system chaincode from within the node sdk.

Hello I have hopefully a quick questions on node.js APIs. Is there an API I can use in node.js that filters on "partial keys" and returns the iterator. For example if I have a key "PERSON_AGE_" that would return all age records, but I also want to return an iterator of keys containing "PERSON_HEIGHT_" and possibly "PERSON_". Using partials keys to filter the collect the partial matched

so it's signed by any peers specified in the channel policy + the private transaction endorser(s) [may be more than one depending on the private tx]?
</p>
<p><strong>theblockstalk</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:40:38 GMT):<br/>
thanks SunnetBendre
</p>
<p><strong>theblockstalk</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:41:38 GMT):<br/>
this tx only contains of a hash of the private tx (run on a chaincode in the data collection). the tx on the channel with the hash also must run in a channel chaincode right?
</p>
<p><strong>theblockstalk</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:41:49 GMT):<br/>
which stores the hashes in order...
</p>
<p><strong>SuneetBendre</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:42:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes.. peer who is validating ( per policy )+ endoser.
So this helps and varified at the time of transaction commit
</p>
<p><strong>theblockstalk</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:42:51 GMT):<br/>
is this put in the system contract?
</p>
<p><strong>SuneetBendre</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:44:21 GMT):<br/>
Yes.
Orderer will decide the sequence and committer will put in the ledger.
Orderer also keep each block in their ledger
</p>
<p><strong>theblockstalk</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:45:16 GMT):<br/>
does the system contract keep track of which hashes are for which data collection?
</p>
<p><strong>theblockstalk</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:45:43 GMT):<br/>
do all peers in the channel get the system contract chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>SuneetBendre</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:50:08 GMT):<br/>
Track of trnx, yes system chaincode, you also refer merkel tree.
No all peer get it. It depends on their roles
Committer will get chaincode to validate and update ledger

@SpecialAgentCooper  this is caused by the Winston issue; it's broken quite a considerable number of systems. We're running PRs are the moment to lock our dependency onto an older version of Winston

In the 1.4 fabric-sdk-node library there is  a method `channel.queryTransaction(txId)` to lookup a transaction by id. In the 2.1.1 version of the library this method no longer exists. Has it been moved, or does anyone know why it was removed? If it is no longer available, what's the recommended way to query the blockchain by transaction id from a client?

I've tried fabcar chaincode and got the same result, although when I login into ccenv based container, mount into it my chaincode and run `go build` everything works, all dependencies are fetched and chaincode is built. Can anyone explain how are chaincodes being built and why it doesn't fetch all needed dependencies?

</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 09:10:34 GMT):<br/>
The contract-api works by checking to see if a value returned is an error type and then forwards the value of that straight to shim.Error
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 09:11:31 GMT):<br/>
There is no way to customise what comes back bar the message in the error

<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 09:13:51 GMT):<br/>
You would have to use the lower level fabric-chaincode-go implementing your own invoke and init to return custom pb.response values

Hi guys, I am trying to implement a modified version of hash based time locks. I need to use last block number in the chaincode. Is it possible to get ledger height in the chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>SpecialAgentCooper</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:08:42 GMT):<br/>
Use Query System Chaincode - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/smartcontract/smartcontract.html?highlight=system%20chaincode#system-chaincode
You can load it the same way you get any contract from a channel (`const qsccContract = await network.getContract('qscc'); `) 
There's a list of the functions you can invoke here: https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/scc/qscc#pkg-constants
I'm using this to query blocks directly in my app, hope it helps
</p>
<p><strong>SpecialAgentCooper</strong> (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:18:31 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure but I don't think so, not without passing it in - transactions are first simulated by your endorsing peers, then ordered into blocks and then finally committed to the ledger by the committing peers. For this to succeed, the same results must be generated by the endorsers and the committers, but since time passes between the two evaluations the block height may have changed: the committers would produce a different result so the transaction would be rejected. 

It may be the case that hash based time locks are not possible with fabric because of the separation of ordering and evaluating transactions. Maybe you could achieve it by modifying the transaction context to hold a timestamped record of the block height at the time the transaction was submitted. Good luck!
</p>

ok, I found my fail. I must install the same chaincode package for all endorsing peers of the same org, instead of rebuilding the package for each peer.

Hello Guys, Hope you are doing well.
I need your help and guidance in Hyperledger Fabric.
Can you please suggest me good resources on how to generate crypto materials (manualy) using fabric ca in hyperledger?
Also the answers of few questions

My questions are:
1) which testing framework to use for fabric contract api chaincode (node.js) testing?
2) How to handle crypto certificates in production projects? How to generate certificates ? Where & how to store certificates ?

I'll be waiting for your all your response and suggestions.

Thanks & regards,
Abhishek

As per the document statement to update the collection policy
```
If a collection configuration is specified when updating the chaincode definition, a definition for each of the existing collections must be included.
``` 
But the problem is that I don't know what were the existing collections.

Hi, I am writing a  chaincode in go and when an error occurs (through shim.Error("test") for example) the client (for example curl) does not get a reply and times out. In the logs for the chaincode itself nothing appears, and in the peer I get "simulateProposal() resulted in chaincode name:"mycc"  response status 500 for txid: XXX" without a message. How/where do I see the error message and how do I prevent the timeout?

Hi .. How can I use multiple objects in a Contract ... for example If I need to create 2 objects like items and customers. How would that work ? because while query in fabcar it just calls everything. How would I query each object separately?
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 20 Jul 2020 08:37:07 GMT):<br/>
When storing your objects use a composite key with a different objectType value for each object. You can create this by calling the createCompositeKey method of the stub and using that as the key in your write. You can then get all of a specific type by using getByPartialCompositeKey supplying only the object type

@awjh how about using namespace in fabric-contract-api-go (for fabric v 2.x)  instead of fabric-chaincode-go ?

Hello, I'm trying to approve chaincode definition from endorsers with default LifecycleEndorsement "majority" policy and I used two endorsers out of four to endorsed the definition and both endorsers are successfully able to fetch private data but other peers are not able to do so.

1. To my knowledge, approving chaincode definition should give me an error if I don't provide enough endorsements but In my case, it's not giving me any error even if definition endorsed by 1 out of 4 peers.

2. I don't seem to understand why other peers are not able to fetch private data if they don't take part in definition endorsement. Is this the normal behavior?
</p>
<p><strong>andrikur</strong> (Mon, 20 Jul 2020 19:01:47 GMT):<br/>
I'll try to answer you question as I know it. I'm still learning HF too

1. approveformyorg doesn't give you error. it simply say you have approved chaincode definition in your org as an admin orgs. when you try to commit chaincode "peer lifecycle chaincode commit", it will give you an error when majority of the other org doesn't approve chaincode yet

2. I'm not clearly understand the question. however the private data in chaincode, you should declare it in json file. private data collection json file define collection name and read/write access in org. you could read in more detail in https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/private_data_tutorial.html.

that's my 2 cents answers

The namespace in fabric-contract-api-go is for different sub-contracts within a chaincode rather than different objects. Although objectType in the composite key can practically be thought of as key namespacing

Hi all
I have developed a custom chaincode for my application in nodejs, I need to perform unit test to validate the functionality using any frameworks such as jest mocha chai, etc. I did did find Hyperledger fabric mock stub testing but it doesnt support fabric-contract-api as far as my knowledge. I also read about some truffle method but did not try. Is there any way to test chaincode in nodejs.
</p>
<p><strong>ItaloCarrasco</strong> (Tue, 21 Jul 2020 20:24:47 GMT):<br/>
hello i am using the new contract interface to write chaincodes using node, i have a doubt about the chaincode responses, in the old way we used shim.success and shim.error when the transaction finished, on the sdk we got the same object with a status and our payload, what is the recomended way to handle this using the new contract interface?, can i still use shim or is there another way to answer with a status code and get it on the node sdk
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:57:39 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @andrikur for the reply, you're correct but I'm also not getting any error when committing definition using one endorser.

I have specified the collection config where declared the signature policy as any of two organization can persist the private data but they're still unable to fetch private data while giving me error.

```
[[36m2018-12-21 17:54:24.932 KST [gossip/discovery] periodicalSendAlive -> DEBU 2a96[[0m Sleeping 5s

```

But I was able to resolve that issue by providing the endorsement of all four peers at the time of chaincode definition endorsement.

Hello, I'm trying to fetch peers from discover CLI but result giving me only target peer information. Is this the default behavior or should I expect all four peers information?

Hi everyone, has somebody been able to implement unit testing in golang based chaincodes with the new contractapi definition? Looking from the docs (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-contract-api-go/contractapi?tab=doc#TransactionContextInterface), there is no MockStub defined as in the old shim definition (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim?tab=doc#MockStub). A little guidance would be extremely appreciated! Thanks!

I have only done unit tests in the old version. From what I understand, you should write your own mocks... See here: https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric/topic/39649948 (this is Node but I think principals are the same)

In the chaincode that I've written, I've been able to see their logs. You can use this environment variable (set on the peer)
```CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=info```

Is this what you are talking about?

Hello everyone, I am from a public Blockchain (Ethereum) background. I want to create Blockchain accounts for my users. In Etherum, I need to generate public/private key for users to make a blockchain account. For Hyperledger Fabric what is the best way to do so? (I found two options)
option 1: 
Is using shim API  'clientIdentity' (https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-chaincode-node/release-2.2/api/fabric-shim.ClientIdentity.html) is it a good option? Or it wouldn't matter because I am deploying my network on a single instance.
option 2:
Is to save users data as assets make their email as ID and encrypt their passwords and save them. Is that could be a better solution?

This is a pretty confusing thing for many. This might be easy while using the Node SDK for the client applications to select a specific contract inside a chaincode while using the getContract() function

If you are using the contract-api (https://www.npmjs.com/package/fabric-contract-api) the name you pass to `super("MyContract")` can be used as a prefix.

<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Tue, 04 Aug 2020 15:40:26 GMT):<br/>
I believe if the peer response is not a success with a 200 status code, the proposal is rejected, hence none of the putstates are recorded on the ledger. Couldn't find exact documentation on it, but did see this: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABN-1214

If you leave the contract name out, it uses the first (default) contract

@Rachit-gaur That all depends on what your client application does. The client application decides whether to send to the orderer or not. The gateway apis in node/java/go will not submit to the orderer and responses from peers that return an error status for example.

I've seen that ShimTest is deprecated from the fabric-chaincode-go package and will be removed (see: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/blob/master/shimtest/mockstub.go) this is kind of worrying me...

I see this Jira issue too: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-15367

The mockstub is a pretty extensive file, it seems crazy to me that it's expected that it's expected that this is re-implemented in its entirety by developers using fabric??

Does anyone have knowledge around the rationale for this?
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 11:44:53 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSargent  the problem with that specific 'mockstub' is that it's more like a 'fake server' .. i.e. a pretend fabric, with matching function; 
Experience has shown that whilst this is seemingly attractive it causes problems later on.  A Fake Server is never going to have 100% Fidelity with the real thing, plus as time goes on with new features etc, it has a high maintenance cost. 

Personally I can cite several instances where developers have (unintentionally) relied on the behaviour of a fake server, and then hit issues when moving into production.
Yes it's a trade-off, and yes it would be great to some half way house.  Tools such as the VSCode extension are there to try and make development and debug simpler.

The advice is that for your given use case, if you need to get putState to throw and error use a mocking library specific for your language. and do FV tests against a real fabric. (We do this in the SDK and Chaincode repos for example)
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 12:13:49 GMT):<br/>
Hey @mbwhite  - thanks for that. Okay, I understand the need for maintenance and not letting the mockstub get out of sync with the real thing. But, for example, I have a bunch of integration tests that run multiple getstate, putstate, getstatebypartial etc etc. and several test rely on multiple previous operations too - i.e. tests rely on ledger state being maintained during the test (as well as changing creators before invoking different functions etc.)

I basically rely on those unit/integration tests to avoid having to deploy new code every time I make a change and then run the integration tests...

It would be useful if there was some documentation on how to write this or some examples - maybe you could provide a link to something in the chaincode repo please?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 12:14:31 GMT):<br/>
At the moment, I'm just not sure where to even start creating my own mocks vs using those provided by shimtest.

Has anyone tried using the common/flogging package in user chaincode. We had written a system chaincode and a part of that was shifter to a user chaincode, now we're facing issues with logging. Can anyone suggest me a way to make common/flogging package work in go user chaincode ??
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Sat, 08 Aug 2020 17:04:31 GMT):<br/>
I've tried adding log  in v1.4.2 using 
```
var logger = flogging.MustGetLogger("my_pvt")
   logger.Debug("This is Debug Message !!")
      logger.Info("This is Ienfo Message !!")
      logger.Critical("This is Critical Message !!")
      logger.Error("This is Error Message !!")
      logger.Warning("This is Warning Message !!")
 
```
I got the output as - 
```
2020-08-07 17:55:56.880 UTC [my_pvt] Init -> INFO 001 This is Ienfo Message !!
2020-08-07 17:55:56.880 UTC [my_pvt] Init -> ERRO 002 This is Critical Message !!
2020-08-07 17:55:56.880 UTC [my_pvt] Init -> ERRO 003 This is Error Message !!
2020-08-07 17:55:56.880 UTC [my_pvt] Init -> WARN 004 This is Warning Message !!
```
Is there anyway to get the debug message too. I've tried using "CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG", but that's not working for me.

<p><strong>SpecialAgentCooper</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 14:27:11 GMT):<br/>
Anyone with any experience with custom chaincode builders? I'm setting the `CORE_CHAINCODE_BUILDER` environment variable on my peers to my custom chaincode builder image (which exists on my machine locally):
```
/ # env | grep BUILDER
CORE_CHAINCODE_BUILDER=max/fabric-nodeenv:latest
```
but when it comes time to install chaincode, the `hyperledger/fabric-nodeenv:2.2` image is used instead of the one referenced. Is this a bug or are there more settings I need?

<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:30 GMT):<br/>
Hello all. I appreciate help in this matter. I have the latest images (2.2.0,  CA 1.4.8), but I'm getting the error:  `failed to invoke chaincode lifecycle, error: timeout expired while executing transaction`
I couldn't find an answer to this anywhere. Can someone provide guidance?
</p>
<p><strong>SpecialAgentCooper</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:34:10 GMT):<br/>
I'd look into the logs of your containers, see what was going on in the nodes at the time that happened. It can be that part of the network has not finished initialising, or it could be that the nodes are not connected properly (or it could be something else entirely!)
</p>
<p><strong>SpecialAgentCooper</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:34:59 GMT):<br/>
Just to update, I can't get chaincode to install with any node but `hyperledger/fabric-nodeenv:2.2`, regardless of what `CORE_CHAINCODE_BUILDER` is set to. Is this a bug?

Yeah, I thought so. Thanks for the feedback. I thought it was related to timeouts and therefore I'm trying to increase it

Hi Rajat - do you mean you're trying to get access to logs output from your custom chaincode (application)?

<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:53:13 GMT):<br/>
It turns out that increasing the timeout with CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMEOUT=80s was useless
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:53:13 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:12:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes, 
I've tried adding log in v1.4.2 using:
```
var logger = flogging.MustGetLogger("my_pvt")
logger.Debug("This is Debug Message !!")logger.Info("This is Ienfo Message !!")
logger.Critical("This is Critical Message !!")
logger.Error("This is Error Message !!")
logger.Warning("This is Warning Message !!")
```
I got the output as -
```

2020-08-07 17:55:56.880 UTC [my_pvt] Init -> ERRO 002 This is Critical Message !!

Is there anyway to get the debug message too. I've tried using "CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG", but that's not working for me.

<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:13:18 GMT):<br/>
I was using flogging package in system chaincode and wanted to use some code in user chaincode so that's why I was thinking of opting this solution.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:29:50 GMT):<br/>
ah right, sorry you're on 1.4. I was going to say that it's not recommended to use Flogger but that's only from 2.0: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/logging-control.html#chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:31:09 GMT):<br/>
In the case of 1.4, it seems it should be set in core.yaml - see: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/logging-control.html, towards the end.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:32:11 GMT):<br/>
or, as you suggested via env vars.
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:32:21 GMT):<br/>
I have done that it's still not working.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:32:25 GMT):<br/>
But sorry, I can't help anymore.
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:32:31 GMT):<br/>
Oh Okay
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:33:13 GMT):<br/>
sorry.
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:34:01 GMT):<br/>
No issues. I couldn't find anything anywhere.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:34:35 GMT):<br/>
did you set the env var before everything was started (like in a Docker config) or trying to set it via cmd line?
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:35:30 GMT):<br/>
I've tried both the methods, I'll still check again. It should work maybe I'm missing something.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:36:56 GMT):<br/>
and maybe if you plan to move to 2.0, implement your own logger too. Relatively straight forward to use zap logger or similar. Good luck!
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:38:42 GMT):<br/>
Oh But this won't work in system chaincode ? 
I was trying to use some modules common in user and system chaincode ?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:47:05 GMT):<br/>
Not 100% sure - I haven't used 'system' chaincode. I just know that in 2.0 you are encouraged to use your own logging mechanism from application (user) chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:57:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes. I'll move the logger in 2.0.0. But need to find a solution for now.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:58:29 GMT):<br/>
are you in Go?
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:58:36 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:59:08 GMT):<br/>
did you try using the `logger.SetLevel` too?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:01:02 GMT):<br/>
there's few 'gotchas' that might be relevant for you here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/a282f7132565d509d3ba6d502cd9c07cc5e567f0/release_notes/v1.4.0.txt
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:01:41 GMT):<br/>
I had used this `chaincode.logging.level`.
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:01:57 GMT):<br/>
I'll go over this.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:02:35 GMT):<br/>
maybe check this:  "Requests to GET /logspec on the
operations endpoint will return with a JSON payload that contains the active

might give you some clue?
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:09:36 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:12:13 GMT):<br/>
hmm, not sure then. Maybe set the log level explicity for your logger (I think you can use some colon syntax to target the named logger?)
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:13:17 GMT):<br/>

Have you tried to increase the values (eg 600) in your docker-compose file? The main exported peer variable/setting is CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMEOUT=600s but if that doesn't help, try CORE_CHAINCODE_STARTUPTIMEOUT=600s and CORE_CHAINCODE_DEPLOYTIMEOUT=600s
</p>
<p><strong>RafaelAPB</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 09:00:48 GMT):<br/>

Hello all!

I noticed that when I initiate a chaincode contract the 'init invocation' adds an item to the ledger. Namely,
```
[
  {
    "Key": "\u0000􏿿initialized",
    "Record": 1
  }
]
```

Anyone has any idea what this is?

Thanks in advance

<p><strong>SpecialAgentCooper</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 15:42:19 GMT):<br/>
Following on from the community call, could someone give a use case for State-Based Endorsement (see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/asset-transfer-sbe )? I'm struggling to think of a reason to enforce this at the endorsement level rather than just checking the MSP of the transaction proposer from within the chaincode itself.
</p>
<p><strong>SpecialAgentCooper</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 15:46:04 GMT):<br/>
Further to this, what was the motivation to move to more abstract samples? Personally, I liked the 'real world' use cases of the old samples. Perhaps it's just a failure of imagination, but I'm struggling to think of contexts where I would actually want to use some of the features showcased by the new samples.

Does no one want to discuss this? @bestbeforetoday any thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 09:18:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm not an expert in this area so hopefully somebody with better knowledge will reply too
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 09:18:52 GMT):<br/>
The docs suggest that state-based (or key-based) endorsement policies can be less restrictive than the chaincode or collection-based endorsement policy, which I guess is something you could not achieve with programmatic enforcement in chaincode implementation, since transactions would still need to meet those default endorsement policies: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/endorsement-policies.html#validation
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 09:20:49 GMT):<br/>
I guess the policy changes will be recorded on the ledger so are retained historically even if chaincode implementations and their programmatic enforcement are updated over time
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 09:28:42 GMT):<br/>
And perhaps it avoids any concerns over different chaincode implementations providing consistent enforcement?
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 09:29:27 GMT):<br/>

I'm trying to instantiate a node chaincode behind a proxy. I understand I have to set the npm proxy env variables inside the chaincode container, but how to do that before the container is instantiated?

Do we have the "        - CORE_CHAINCODE_NODE_RUNTIME" variable that can be set at the docker file to parametrize the runtime environment (with a custom image)?

Hi everyone, does anyone have experience testing Typescript chaincode? My Fabric 2.2 chaincode uses a custom transaction context by overriding the `createContext()` method of `Contract` class. However, during test, I want to use a test context instead of the one created by `createContext()`, because the testContext is able to act as different test users and load test states. Currently I tried to stub `createContext() using `sinon.stub(contract, 'createContext').returns(testCtx);`. But from the log I can still see the original `createContext()` being called. How can I substitute the custom context with a test context? Any help would be much appreciated!

hello everyone, i have some doubts about the chaincode, to commit and invoke it from the cli some tls certs of the peers that will endorse the transaction need to be passed on to the command, the point is when the network is distributed in multiple hosts each org has its own cli, those cli need access to these files, this allows anyone with access to the cli to invoke the chaincode with its own data, isnt this like super insecure?

Good morning everyone, I hope all are healthy and safe. I am sharing our post from the Hyperledger telegram channel. Please comment, ask questions, we are a small team presently and will do best to reply as soon as possible 		 We are releasing the first 2 videos of our eXtensible Blockchain Object Model (XBOM) running on Hyperledger Fabric.

The first video is a Functional Overview of XBOM, a first class object model architecture, running on Hyperledger and loading new class object dynamically on a functioning Hyperledger Fabric network.

These are technical videos and geared to the #developer #engineer community. I would ask all of my business side contacts that are involved in projects that utilize #blockchain #hyperledger #smartcontracts to request your technical teams to review and comment on the technology.

Please comment, ask questions, we are a small team presently and will do best to reply as soon as possible.

Hi Guys. I hope someone can point me in the correct direction.
In Particular... is there a limit on how large a history (number of entries) of a key can get? I am kind of irritated of a "magic" number (100k entries in history).. I am somehow stuck on where to look for or in what kind of limitation I am running into?
stub.GetHistoryForKey will only return 100k of entries within the iterator.. Am I doing something wrong or am I hitting any sort of limit that I am not aware of?
Btw. I am on Hyperledger 1.3

@BrettLogan Thanks for the hint. Do you also know if you can query the history in reverse order. Basically stating give me the last 100k entries and not "from the beginning of time" Or make it a sort of sliding window?

Hi. Is there any possibility to query the history with pagination to overcome the totalQueryLimit? How to extract a History that is above the totalQueryLimit? Is there any other way? Because raising the limit will only postpone the problem not solve it?

I have a quick question i am new to hyper ledger fabric , I started learning hyper ledger fabric 2 weeks before and i have learned a little bit my question is I am using the asset-transfer-baic module provided by the hyper ledger fabric and I am following the docs provided by the hyper ledger fabric.org and I was able to query all the aasests (which are written in assest-transfer-basic module)from the ledger and transfer the ownership of the assests but my question is whether this operations and update of this ledger will be recorded in the blockchain?  my second question is can we write some data into the block chain using hyper ledger fabric and check whether that data is in the blockchain?

<p><strong>dbeberman</strong> (Sat, 12 Sep 2020 18:35:06 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox We are in the middle of doing a first PoC for implementing an object-oriented, on-chain system that uses Golang.  This is known as a first-class object model, using a class manager infrastructure.  The classes are written in Golang and are compiled as plugin shared libraries. The plugins are then dynamically loaded as needed by each peer. The class objects and ordinary objects state are all stored on the blockchain. This uses late dynamic binding.  When you send a message to an object either from a client or from other class code, message to method resolution using the class inheritance tree determines which method is run.  You can send any message to any object, although the object's class and ancestor classes may not handle the message, which just results in a not implemented error return.

<p><strong>dbeberman</strong> (Sat, 12 Sep 2020 18:35:36 GMT):<br/>

There is a function in the the *asset-transfer-private-data* chaincode which checks whether clientMSP matches peerMSP, and returns and error response if there is no match
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/asset-transfer-private-data/chaincode-go/chaincode/asset_transfer.go#L561 

I had a endorsment policy of Org1 AND Org2 MSP for this, which failed when the check happened ( I was sending the transaction from an Org1 client). But when I removed this check from the chaincode, it passed. memberOnlyRead & memberOnlyRead for the corresponding PDC was set to `true` 

Can someone tell how this function is different from what memberOnlyRead/memberOnlyWrite property in collections config does?

Update: Think I answered this myself => memberOnlyWrite allows anyone from collection to write PDC data, whereas the check in the CC enforces that only THAT specific org's member is allowed to invoke that chaincode on that org.

Hello, I'm just looking at the wasm chaincode tech preview. I'm interested to see if I can compile Solidity to wasm chaincode using my Solang project, see https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
My first observation is that wapc is quite a complex protocol for fairly simple functions (like get state and put state). Plain wasm functions get_state and put_state would make it much easier to implement for Solang.

Hello, thanks for taking look at the preview... 

We went with waPC as the import export functions from host-wasm could only pass integers, anything more complex would need some data handling and data marshalling.  

We could have written this ourself, but decided to go with a solution already written. 

It's true there are plans for additions to Wasm, that would help here in the future..

More than happy to discuss further
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 07:29:02 GMT):<br/>
My first question would be - how does solang cross the boundary between wasm and the host?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 07:48:52 GMT):<br/>
solang is a compiler which can target different chains, so it can do whatever is required. Currently it works with ewasm, sawtooth, and substrate. These chains use their own data marshalling, call "abi encoded" for ethereum or SCALE codec for Substrate.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 07:52:10 GMT):<br/>
where's the best place to look to get an idea how this works and how it could be fitted in ?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 08:05:55 GMT):<br/>

Hi to the team . I would like to ask a question . I currently developing a go smart contract couch db . How is it possible to sort with a specific column ? For example i have a document with id, date, sum. I would like to make a sorting with date . Is that possible ?
</p>
<p><strong>pkirkinezis</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 12:48:28 GMT):<br/>
When i user "sort":[{"creationDate":"desc"}]} is says that "error handling CouchDB request. Error:no_usable_index,  Status Code:400,  Reason:No index exists for this sort, try indexing by the sort fields."
</p>
<p><strong>pkirkinezis</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 12:50:31 GMT):<br/>
My total query is "{"selector":{"_id": {"$gt":null},"docType":{"$eq":"receivable"},"BuyerVAT":{"$eq":"11234234"}},"sort":[{"date":"desc"}]}"
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:21:20 GMT):<br/>
As the error says, you need an index before you can sort fields.
This page in the fabric documentation should help you
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/couchdb_tutorial.html?highlight=rich%20query%20index#create-an-index
</p>
<p><strong>pkirkinezis</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 14:00:18 GMT):<br/>
So i have to create indexes and place them to metadata folder ?
</p>
<p><strong>pkirkinezis</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 14:01:21 GMT):<br/>
Fo the folder META-INF/statedb/couchdb/indexes I have to manually create it ?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 15:14:20 GMT):<br/>
yep you will need to understand couchdb indexes, implement them, place them in the right directory location and ensure you package them into your chaincode package (I assume they are still part of the chaincode package for 2.2. But I'm not familiar yet with 2.2 chaincode packaging and life-cycle)
</p>
<p><strong>pkirkinezis</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 18:01:21 GMT):<br/>
I will try to package it with chaincode

Hi, has anyone tried out the Wasm tech preview by writing a Rust contract from scratch at all? I'm interested in feedback about returning `Result<String, ContractError>` from transaction functions. Specifically I'm wondering if the custom `ContractError` type is the right thing to do here. It seems like it could make handling errors in the transaction function more awkward but I'm still new to Rust so very interested to here whether there are better ways it could be done. Thanks! (Any other feedback about the tech preview is also very welcome!)

Hi all, I have always used the mocks in shimtest to unit test my chaincode in Go. But I just noticed the following comment in the package:
```
// Deprecated: ShimTest will be  removed in a future release.
// Future development should make use of the ChaincodeStub Interface
// for generating mocks
```

Does this mean the chaincode packages will not include any mocks anymore in the future?
And does anyone knows the reason or the problems with the mocks in shimtest because of which they will be deprecated? Just to not repeat the same in my own mocks of the ChaincodeStubInterface...

Thanks a lot!

hey all ... I'm using the `fabric-contract-api-go` SDK to implement a contract, but if I update the data model for the contract, when I attempt to query transactions that were previously committed using the old model, I get all kinds of `Additional property <property_name> is not allowed` and `<property_name>,omitempty is required` errors  ... is there a trick to disregard these schema errors for old transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:57:25 GMT):<br/>
hello!
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:57:59 GMT):<br/>
So what approach are you taking for structuring the data?  The errors you're getting - where are they coming from?
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:58:24 GMT):<br/>
hey hey! so I have a pretty basic contract object .. per instructions at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-contract-api-go/blob/master/tutorials/managing-objects.md#defining-an-object
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:58:57 GMT):<br/>
I also have `contract-metadata/metadata.json` which describes the schema for the object
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:59:38 GMT):<br/>
are these errors coming from when you get data out of the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:59:46 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:59:50 GMT):<br/>
when evaluating a transaction
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:59:53 GMT):<br/>
`[10/12/2020 10:52:19 AM] [ERROR] Error evaluating transaction: Error handling success response. Value did not match schema:`
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:01:31 GMT):<br/>
ok; admit that I'm not familiar with the JSON marshalling in Go, but I suspect that in this case it's not tolerant of the missing properties
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:01:54 GMT):<br/>
I know you can write your own to handle the data...
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:02:35 GMT):<br/>
accept that we do need to make some docs clearer on the limits of what can be done - and how to move from one model to the next...
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:02:46 GMT):<br/>
can be tricky to solve..
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:03:05 GMT):<br/>
yea ... that's what I'm trying to figure out ... how to override the default schema validation behavior, but to your point, it's not clear from the `fabric-contract-api-go` docs how to do that
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:04:49 GMT):<br/>
Better brush up on my go... unless @awjh  is around ?
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:14:22 GMT):<br/>
I am! So validation of the schema occurs during the serialization process. The standard serializer is the serializer.JSONSerializer which only validates when passed a non-nil paramMetadata value. I would suggest to bypass the validation create your own struct which meets the serializer.TransactionSerializer interface and have the methods of it return a call to the same method of JSONSerializer but passing nil instead of the paramMetadata value. 

To assign your custom serializer, after getting the value back from NewChaincode set the TransactionSerializer property of the returned value to be your custom serializer
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:18:36 GMT):<br/>
In the case of ToString on the JSONSerializer it is the returns that needs to be set to nil
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:18:36 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:21:53 GMT):<br/>
On an aside is it possible to use in your model the `metadata: ", optional" tag on the property in your struct?
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:22:11 GMT):<br/>
If you have specced your own schema maybe remove the property from the required field?
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:31:25 GMT):<br/>
this is very helpful thanks @awjh and @mbwhite! ...
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:32:33 GMT):<br/>
with that being said, I'm assuming that the general process by which schemas should be updated so as not to impact previously committed transactions is to create a custom Serializer/Deserializer?
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:34:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I would suggest that, you would then be able to write custom validation of the schema since you will be given it so you could possibly use flags in your data to change the schema validation to run for different versions of the data
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:36:41 GMT):<br/>
ok awesome ... let me give that a whirl
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:39:15 GMT):<br/>
also, if I have custom contract metadata, is there a way to allow nil values?
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:39:56 GMT):<br/>
so for example, my `metadata.json` allows for an array of `string` for a particular field ... but I still get `Invalid type. Expected: array, given: null` errors
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:40:56 GMT):<br/>
Hmm I am not sure around that actually, I guess it expects an empty array rather than null
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:41:10 GMT):<br/>
I'm sure I have seen someone mention this before but I'm not sure where
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:41:29 GMT):<br/>
gotcha ... yea I guess I'm trying to use `metadata.json` to potentially get around having to write a custom serializer
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:41:55 GMT):<br/>
if I can finagle the schema to support changes to the data model without impacting previously committed transactions
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:43:33 GMT):<br/>
Is the array field marked as optional in the metadata? I would say a required array cannot be null it must have a value and be the correct length, a slice could be null?
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:44:36 GMT):<br/>
```
{
            "name": "fieldNames",
            "required": false,
            "schema": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
                "type": "string"
              }
            }
          }
```
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:45:06 GMT):<br/>
Is the corresponding Go property a slice or an array?
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:45:28 GMT):<br/>
it's a slice ... `[]string`
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:46:15 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, I would expect that to be allowed to be null if not marked as optional. I wonder if the required part isn't being picked up
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:52:16 GMT):<br/>
If you run a getMetadata query is the returned JSON the same as your custom schema?
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:17:23 GMT):<br/>
so I'm still getting the same validation errors even if I set `paramMetadata` and `returns` to nil
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:17:40 GMT):<br/>
`<property_name>,omitempty is required`
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:17:53 GMT):<br/>
`<property_name> is not allowed`
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:19:09 GMT):<br/>
```
type CustomSerializer struct {
	*serializer.JSONSerializer
}

func (cs *CustomSerializer) FromString(param string, fieldType reflect.Type, paramMetadata *metadata.ParameterMetadata, components *metadata.ComponentMetadata) (reflect.Value, error) {
	return cs.JSONSerializer.FromString(param, fieldType, nil, components)
}

func (cs *CustomSerializer) ToString(result reflect.Value, resultType reflect.Type, returns *metadata.ReturnMetadata, components *metadata.ComponentMetadata) (string, error) {
	return cs.JSONSerializer.ToString(result, resultType, nil, components)
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:19:49 GMT):<br/>
```
chaincode, err := contractapi.NewChaincode(new(SmartContract))
	chaincode.TransactionSerializer = new(CustomSerializer)
```
</p>
<p><strong>anweiss</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 17:09:20 GMT):<br/>
ok so I got this to work by removing all `",omitempty"`'s and `metadata:",optional"`'s
</p>
<p><strong>sijo.c</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 20:41:26 GMT):<br/>
how can I find the chaincode metadata from a running peer? `peer chaincode list --instantiated` did not return anything. I need to see the exact SmartContract name & func names running on the peer
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 08:30:32 GMT):<br/>
the actual contract metadata is returned by invoking a transaction...

For example in the nodejs sdk 
```
	 let data = await contract.evaluateTransaction('org.hyperledger.fabric:GetMetadata');
	 console.log(data.toString());
```
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 11:59:44 GMT):<br/>
@mbwhite yesterdays wasm chaincode was very informative, thanks. Does a wasm contract have access to all the wasi host functions, including filesystem, time, and random?
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:01:43 GMT):<br/>
thanks... It should so yes; in the examples we've run wasi isn't there. but there's no reason it's limited.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:03:31 GMT):<br/>
That makes wasm smart contracts non-deterministic.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:03:45 GMT):<br/>
Is that a concern?
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:04:25 GMT):<br/>
the same exists today with any Fabric chaincode.. if you use random or call out to a rest endpoint say.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:05:21 GMT):<br/>
if the contracts have different results they won't be committed to the eldger.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:06:40 GMT):<br/>
With access to the filesystem, random sources, and network it is not secure either. I am not following what the design is. I thought the point of wasm was sandboxing? Why use wasm?
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:11:00 GMT):<br/>
today I don't think the wasi is there so they couldn't be accessed... 

To the point on secure, the trade-off fabric makes for using general purpose languages.  Fabric will get the contracts run all the peers of all the organizations that are required to endorse the transactions. 

Random behaviour will cause that to fail... Fabric typically would only be exposed to organizations as well.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:12:23 GMT):<br/>
as to why Wasm - well partly was could it be done? is it practical? would it extend the range of languages but without having lots of   libraries.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:15:32 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks. That makes some sense. I guess this depends on all parties trusting each other enough not to submit dodgy transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:16:46 GMT):<br/>
I did want to make the other point that protobuf is non-deterministic, but I guess that is not important.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:20:24 GMT):<br/>
but not trust each other enough to use a shared database :-)

The endorsement policies are essential - plus individual keys / states can have their own policies.

Non-deterministic serialization is a concern true - though in this particular case - this is only serialization over the network; Fabric works on the basis of read/write sets of the state changes.. this has to be deterministic.. otherwise you'll get failures in the same manner as if random numbers were used.

Thank you for explaining this. So, only key/states are synced on the network, not transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 13:45:41 GMT):<br/>
Some details of the TX are synced... https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readwrite.html has the major detail... not 100% confident I'll get it correct!

Hello to everyone, we have had our first review of XBOM on Hyperledger and I wanted to share the conversation from our Telegram Developer Group

Michael Holdmann prasaga.com/overview, [15.10.20 08:38]
Here are some snippets of a conversation between @DavidBeberman and our community member @kctam from the s.  KC has been doing a deep dive evaluation of our code, he is a amongst other things Hyperledger instructor.  

KC Tam, [13.10.20 23:36]
@DavidBeberman I have tested both AWS Linux and Ubuntu Linux. They work. Just one part: in v2.0.0 branch, either XBOMVERSION changed to v2.0.0 or skip the line 82-84 as I have already checked out v2.0.0.

KC Tam, [13.10.20 23:38]
I can also see the state updated in couchdb and InitBootstrap and Invoke ObjectSend work as expected.

David Beberman, [14.10.20 15:39]
Next up - some additional methods for the XBOMContainer class - it needs an iterator over children capability, Some updates to the ClassClassFileLoader — although for this stage, going to stay with local filesystem plugin loading, will add HTTPS URL support at a later date.  Would make sense to be able to pull from built plugins from locations like github.com in the future.  We are also doing a simplified example of a swap pool.

David Beberman, [14.10.20 17:19]
thanks.  had not used couchdb.  Will have to take a look at the results too.  Nice to know that worked.

KC Tam, [14.10.20 17:36]
I just double check the latest master branch. It works perfectly in Ubuntu. Now you can update the Readme to include Ubuntu as well.

David Beberman, [14.10.20 17:37]
thanks.  I will be working on a doc on how to write new classes as well.

KC Tam, [14.10.20 17:40]
👍

KC Tam, [15.10.20 08:06]
with @DavidBeberman help (yes, hands-on is always the most effective way to learn), and those videos in the site (which are very condensed and informative), I start appreciating what XBOM is doing for platform like fabric. Interesting approach.

Please do register at xbom.io and check out the videos and development environment, this completely changes Smart Contracts/Chaincode forever.

hello, i have  a question about chaincode installation and commit, on fabric v2 when you install the chaincode on the peers is there a verification that the chaincode being installed and commited is the same across al the peers?
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 16:01:21 GMT):<br/>
With the new chaincode lifecycle, different orgs could install different implementations of the same chaincode, so it may not be the same across all peers. https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/chaincode_lifecycle.html explains the new lifecycle.

WOW!! Great job by @kctam! Hyperledger instructor dove right into Prasaga #XBOM & writes his initial experiences

"With XBOM, developers build applications with object oriented programming model, and XBOM provides an infrastructure serving them. The infrastructure (named Class Manager Infrastructure) then interacts with the underlying infrastructure, which is a fabric network in this case. Theoretically the developer does not care about the blockchain, as it is well handled by the infrastructure. That is the reason XBOM is positioned as “Decentralized GlobalOS”, like an operating system on top of the blockchain."

Hi all, is there an option within fabric to configure if a chaincode event is only send once for example? So in the case that I have 2 peers for an organization, only 1 of the peers sends the chaincode event?

Hi there. I'd like to know whether it is possible to use the `./byfn.sh` script to deploy a hyperleger network in production mode.

If it is possible, how we can remove the `dev-` in the docker image names (e.g. `dev-peer1.org2.example.com-mycc-1.0` to `peer1.org2.example.com-mycc-1.0`)?

Hi Everyone,

So excited to join the group.

As Julian Gordon, VP APAC, Hyperledger at the Linux Foundation suggested, I thought of dropping you a note and letting you know about the Hyperledger Fabric Bootcamp which is on 19th November 2PM HKT for the Hong Kong Blockchain Week 2020. 

To open the event, Julian will be sharing with us the latest news and development for Hyperledger Fabric and beyond.

It is going to be a fun event with amazing learning. It will be great if you could share it with the group as we are trying to have a greater number of people coming in. 

We would love to see you there and work together to attempt to deploy the largest Hyperledger network to date.

Register now

I hope to see you at the event.

Best Wishes,

Hi People - 1 question. 
When I'm upgrading the chaincode using NODE SKD intantiateChaincode method (with UPGRADE flag set) - a new instance of the same chaincode is getting created rather than upgrading the existing one.

The following is my setup
FABRIC : 1.4
Docker Mode - base images for peer is amd64-1.4.2

Yes- this is possible; though I realize there aren't any examples.  I'd need to work it out.. but it can be done

As mentioned on the community call now - finishing the LedgerAPI was mentioned; we've a lot of work on this done already - but if anybody would like to contribute here to get this completion happy to mentor.

After some further researching I assume that it can be done through the stub accessible from the context, right?

ctx.stub.invokeChaincode() to be more  exact...?

hello, i am checking on fabric samples the asset transfer secured agreement, there is one thing i dont understand,  the documentation says implicit collections policies are generated from their organization, in the chaincode of this example they transfer an asset, in the same transaction they delete an asset from org1 collection and add an asset in org2 collection, endorsed by one pear of both orgs, how is this even possible if its supposed that only members of org2 have read/write access to they private data (same for org1), shouldnt this transaction fail because a user doesnt have access to both collections?

Hi, I'm running a peer (1.4.1) in kubernetes in a pod which consists of 2 containers, the fabric-peer container and the docker container. In the docker container the chaincode container is ran with docker. When instantiating this chaincode container the process pulls 2 images hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:1.4.4 and hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:amd64-0.4.15. However, due to the recent introduction of pull rate limits of the public docker hub this causes issues. Therefore we want to host these images in a private repo and pull from there. I've added the authentication file for docker in $HOME/.docker/config.json and I'm able to pull the images when I exec into the container. However, the instantiate still fails with this error: Failed to pull <private-registry>/hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:1.4.4: API error (500): Get https://<private-registry>/hyperledger/fabric-ccenv/manifests/1.4.4: unauthorized. How do I setup this authentication?

When using the getHistoryForKey stub function, how can I see more than just the current state? I am using the new iterator strategy from fabric-sdk-node v2.1, and it's just giving me back the latest data. What am I missing?

</p>
<p><strong>punkrokk</strong> (Wed, 16 Dec 2020 19:48:23 GMT):<br/>
So maybe I'm misunderstanding something. If I have a transaction that writes an object. And that object has an immutable key, then a set of other keys that can change. How can I search for the `history` of changes across the object, not just by keys?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:58:10 GMT):<br/>
Did you look at https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-chaincode-node/release-2.2/api/tutorial-using-iterators.html
getHistoryForKey should return an iterator (so long as you have enbabled the history database) of details about all the committed changes for the specific composite key provided
</p>
<p><strong>punkrokk</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 16:56:33 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel How can I confirm that the history database is enabled. I have added the `CORE_LEDGER_HISTORY_ENABLEHISTORYDATABASE=true` to my container
</p>
<p><strong>punkrokk</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 16:57:00 GMT):<br/>
so I think you just said they key thing, I need to have a composite key in order to index and search history?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 17:35:59 GMT):<br/>
When you do put_state/get_state etc you have to provide a composite key. getHistoryForKey get's you the history of that key
</p>
<p><strong>punkrokk</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 17:36:36 GMT):<br/>
I see, ok so I can use the `getHistoryForKey` with composite keys
</p>
<p><strong>punkrokk</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 17:36:40 GMT):<br/>
that was what threw me off
</p>
<p><strong>punkrokk</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 17:37:21 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking I could have one key, and view the changes on other keys history
</p>

hello, 
When looking at many of the fabric samples transfer of ownership of private data seems to require both organizations to be able to write/read into each others private collection for example https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/asset-transfer-secured-agreement -- The transfer function is able to both put/delete from two separate organizations. doesnt this give any one org too much power and the ability to delete from other orgs?
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 13:39:20 GMT):<br/>
Keep in mind the endorsement policies - this means that the organization involved will be running the chaincode code.  

Other orgs can write my private data, but can't read from it
</p>

Hi all, I am writing Chaincode in Go and in my chaincode I use a private package (private git repo). I have set up my git token and configured my local git settings so go modules can get the private module. Also packaging this chaincode works without problems.
It is only when trying to install it, that I get an error that the build failed:
```
Error: chaincode install failed with status: 500 - failed to invoke backing implementation of 'InstallChaincode': could not build chaincode: docker build failed: docker image build failed: docker build failed: Error returned from build: 1 "go: github.com/peikiuar/fabric-chaincode-go-helpers@v0.0.0-20201208001631-9a1324c82e0b: reading https://proxy.golang.org/github.com/peikiuar/fabric-chaincode-go-helpers/@v/v0.0.0-20201208001631-9a1324c82e0b.mod: 410 Gone

```

Is this because the build is done in the peer container, where my git user and token is not configured and so it can't access the private repo? Or is this another familiar problem?
Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks in advance.

While looking in to a Java chaincode issue (FABCJ-300) I've started to think that it might be a good idea to deprecate the ability to use chaincode source packages and defer the build to deploy time. There are several problems with building late, e.g. differences between tested/deployed chaincode, network access requirements, difficulty debugging, etc. It's already possible to package Java chaincode as a prebuilt fat jar (which I would recommend!) however I'm not sure whether many people use that option.

Anyway, what do you think about deprecating chaincode source packages and in the future only supporting prebuilt chaincode packages?
</p>
<p><strong>Roger</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 07:25:54 GMT):<br/>
Based on previous project experience,it is helpful to write chaincode earlier. After the chaincode is written, due to the business logic processing, it needs multi-party consensus to deploy. Only the input and output of the smart contract need to be made in advance, loosely coupled with the system, and not affected by the network and deployment.
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Thu, 07 Jan 2021 10:16:26 GMT):<br/>
So the change I'm proposing is at the start of that, when you've written your business logic. Instead of packaging the source code to install on Fabric peers, you would build the chaincode and package the build output, e.g. jar files instead of the Java source code.
</p>
<p><strong>Roger</strong> (Fri, 08 Jan 2021 06:54:27 GMT):<br/>
I quite agree with your opinion.

Hi and happy new year . I am currently trying to debug an issue i have to my implemention . One of my create  functions I have on my chaincode written in go returns  the error " The proposal responses have 2 inconsistent groups with 0 that are invalid. Expected all to be consistent and none to be invalid."  every time i try to call it throuth java dateway api. I've check the logs I had put on my chaincode throuth out the function and seems it runs as expected. Where do you suggest to search for because all other functios following the same logic to create works without any errors.

In the chaincode, I need to use a third-party node module with which I communicate with an external API.

The issue is that, that external API utilizes TLS for its communications; Thus, my chaincode can't communicate with it without the appropriate certificates - it is being rejected.

So, do I need to enroll the chaincode with the rootCA as well? Or is there a simpler way to achieve TLS communication with external entities, through some chaincode that is installed under a peer that, already, has all the appropriate certificates?

Just a quick question, in case that you're aware of the answer!

Don't the
- CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE
- CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE
- CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE

get derived from the peer in order to be passed to the chaincode? I know that these values are used by the chaincode init, but I don't know in what way.

Are they "just passed" to the chaincode, or are they "used by" the chaincode in order for it to generate the appropriate certificates that it will use to communicate with the peer?

Because I tried to check what's inside them and they are totally different from the certificates that the peer has.

I've been thinking about doing a Hyperledger Mentorship 2021 for running Solidity using Solang (my labs project) on wasm chaincode api: https://github.com/hyperledgendary/fabric-contract-api-rust

However this has not seen a commit since september laster.

Hi Sean; other business pressures meant we needed to look at other items.. the code is still there and useable... and as a tech preview is still usable.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 10:13:02 GMT):<br/>
Ok but is it worth investing significant effort in?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 10:14:02 GMT):<br/>
I appreciate you might not be able to answer this awkward question :)

<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 10:17:32 GMT):<br/>
let's just say that it's an open source project.  I'm still (personally) interested in it, and with the external builder model of Fabric it can continue to be used and worked. 

Is there a demand from enterprise customers today? Not such much - though with the ability to run Solidity I (personally) think this is attractive.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 10:19:58 GMT):<br/>
I'd be happy to support and help anybody using that code, and make sure that it still worked with the lastest Fabric versions..
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 10:20:21 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 14:58:16 GMT):<br/>
hi all, I'm using Java to develop my chaincode and I want to return a list with a custom object type, but I'm unable to make it work because seems that the serialization process is not working.... if I change my function to return a string instead a `List<Custom>` then it works without any problem. There is something that I have to add to my chaincode to make the serialization work or is a feature that is not implemented?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 20:00:09 GMT):<br/>
Did you implement the serializable interface on your customer object type?
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 08:35:15 GMT):<br/>
no, it is needed?? I will try it
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 16:27:58 GMT):<br/>
The standard serialization mechanism in Java won't help you here - unless you want to take full control yourself.  I.e. use it to create a binary blob and then return that as a byte array. 

What you can do is use the @DataType Annotation.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 16:28:01 GMT):<br/>
see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-java/blob/master/examples/ledger-api/src/main/java/org/example/MyAsset.java
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 16:52:56 GMT):<br/>
yes @mbwhite I'm using this annotation in my custom object `Customer`, but if I want to return a ``List<Customer>` then the serialization raises an exception
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:21:27 GMT):<br/>
Yes; there is a way around this by providing a custom serialization format. but I'd need to dig into the code to remind myself of details.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:21:59 GMT):<br/>
there is also an issue outstanding for improvements in this area.. (shameless plug for contributors :;-) )
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:25:47 GMT):<br/>
ok @mbwhite I'm looking in the jira but I'm unable to find it,  can you guide me??
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:27:06 GMT):<br/>
I'll need to go find it myself... :-) might be tomorrow now
</p>
<p><strong>Javi</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:31:17 GMT):<br/>
perfect! I will wait, I'm interested to improve this

HI, I’m trying to run a node.js chaincode in fabric 2.2 with a peer in devmode. Is there any documentation out there? 

If the devmode is running with a golang chaincode but not with a node.js chaincode (fabric-contract-api) the dev mode is working, but not with node.js. Any infos regarding running node.js chaincode in dev-mode would be very nice.

For those interested in our @prasagaofficial progress on the tech side we presented to Hyperledger NYC and Denver Meetups.  Please watch the recording of the premier of ClassFungibleAsset and subclass ClassSmartAsset for enablement of Fungible and Non-Fungible Assets in our GlobalOS, XBOM a First Class Object mode on Hyperledger.  

This is a command line demo which clearly shows how blockchain advances without any smart contracts using DataGrid Token ($DGT) and wrapped ETH ($WETH) as examples.  

Again, everything works as advertised, this release is for our XBOM dev environment and enterprise TestNet for PoC.  The use cases for enterprise, the assets would be pharmaceuticals, spark pugs, bolts, coal, etc in a supply chain.

Pay Attention to the enablement of a Globally UniqueID for every account and every object.

Hello. It's possible to listen events (block or transaction) emitted by a chaincode  in another chaincode? For example: chaincode A send a transaction to the block -> commit -> chaincode B listen the commit and make something...

In the documentation I found the listener in a client side way using SDK but I want to implement the listener in a chaincode.

Thanks.

Hello!

I need to implement a "linked-list" scenario. What I need to achieve is to be able and import some information and, then, based on their type, "link" this information with other similar info, through a "linked-list" implementation; Thus, I need to connect past blocks with the block that this information was imported to (I'll store the index of the past block inside the new block). But, I have two issues:
1. Is this appropriate? Am I going to have any issue? (With blocks and the indexes that I keep)
2. How can I get the number of a block through the chaincode and access its stored information?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:56:55 GMT):<br/>
Those fields are auto-generated. Indexes are part of your chaincode package and need to be passed in through a file in your chaincode: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/couchdb_tutorial.html#cdb-create-index

Nope, you can delete them. If chaincode containers are ever needed again, the peer will automatically recreate them

Hello,

I need to run a transaction based on majority consent. A user with a special attribute (say, role=User-Special), should be able to run/invoke a function only if:
- he, indeed, has the attribute User-Special
- has the (majority) consent of other users with the same attribute (User-Special) that exist in other orgs.

I know about the existence of "setStateBasedEndorsementNOutOf", but this only applies to future updates of the key. Any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Mon, 08 Mar 2021 11:02:04 GMT):<br/>
I want the same thing that this user asked here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52994169/multi-signature-transaction-in-hyper-ledger-fabric
but every key has a distinct name (I use composite keys).

Maybe an idea would be to first create the (composite) key and apply the "setStateBasedEndorsementNOutOf" and then again run the appropriate function where the user will save the actual information to the blockchain and wait for validation by the other orgs. But again, what about the "User-Special" role? How can I only approve the transaction if it has the majority consent of these special users?

I have 2 chaincodes. The first chaincode invokes a function of the second one. The invoked function needs to ask the CA to sign a challenge in order to prove that it accepts a function in the first chaincode to be called.
For example
Invoke function (in chaincode 1) ---> Chaincode 1 calls function in Chaincode 2 ---> The called function in Chaincode 2 asks the CA to sign a message that approves the user that initiated all this to call another function ---> Chaincode 2 returns the approval to Chaincode 1 ---> User can continue with what he wants.

Invoke function (in chaincode 1) ---> Chaincode 1 calls function in Chaincode 2 ---> The called function in Chaincode 2 *sends an event * and asks the CA Admin to sign a message that approves the user that initiated all this to call another function (*while all this happens, both functions in Chaincode 1 and 2 wait for an answer from the CA Admin)* ---> Chaincode 2 returns the approval to Chaincode 1 ---> User can continue with what he wants.

Edit: No, events won't work.
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 19:09:22 GMT):<br/>
Are you looking for manual intervention from the CA Admin to approve the request?
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 19:10:58 GMT):<br/>
Hello @BrettLogan 

For my issue, manual intervention, would be a more "logical solution", but if that can't be implemented, then an automated action (automated signing) is okay. Thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 19:12:46 GMT):<br/>
For example, if, somehow, the chaincode can "wait" for the CAs Admins to sign the request, then okay! It sounds good.
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 19:50:15 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking of emitting Events and, somehow, make the chaincode, wait, but, no way, right?

how to solve this issue while upgrading chiancode version?

<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 20:09:59 GMT):<br/>
For some unknown reason, when I invoke some chaincode from another chaincode, it returns me a buffer that I can not "use". Of course I first JSON.stringify, Buffer.from(the_stringified_object) and then return it to the first chaincode. However, I receive something like: 
`
type: 'Buffer',
  data: [
     ...........
  ]
`
Any ideas? I try to fetch the data with `result.payload.toString('utf8')`

Okay, new issue :D

I need to invoke some chaincode. Let's say that exist 2 chaincodes, CCA and CCB.

CCA invokes a function from CCB.
CCB needs from inside the invoked function to call a function of CCA to provide some info from its state.

Can this happen?
Of course I get an error of `txid: ....(channel) exists` when I try to invoke another function from CCA.

I need to call a chaincode 2 times, simultaneously. 
The first call will start a "countdown", the second call (which will happen many times, from many orgs), will update a value.
When the countdown ends, the "first call" will need to check all the appended new values (that were created by the second calls, from the other orgs).

So,
I make the first call - the function countdowns for, say, 5 minutes.
I make a second call and add some data. The issue is that the data does not get endorsed - It awaits for the first invoke to finish the countdown, and of course I get a nice 'PHANTOM_READ_CONFLICT' error, because the data has not been appended.

Any ideas? I tried to implement a second chaincode to use it as a "database", but it didnt work, as I had the same exact issue.
I know that this is done for concurrency, but I need to find a way to achieve this. Any ideas? Thanks!

In HLF 1.4 I can get transaction id after successful invoke operation. But In HLF 2.x I am not getting txid. I can see the data which I submitted to hlf in state database (couch db). Then why I am not getting txid. Here is last line in chaincode,

return shim.Success(nil)
submit transaction using node sdk.

result = await contract.submitTransaction(fcn, args);
console.log("Result:", result.toString())

Hello!
I have 2 blockchains and I need to forward a transaction from, say, Blockchain 1 to Blockchain 2. The "easiest/more logical" way would be for the peer to forward the transaction after the endorsement (and somehow check that the invoker is some chaincode from Blockchain 1). However, this is not feasible; Thus, right now I have a NodeJS listener that forwards these transactions to Blockchain 2. However, I need to check that the transaction is indeed coming from "Blockchain 1" and has not been tampered (e.g., someone could send a fake transaction to Blockchain 2, that was not endorsed on Blockchain 1).

I can get the Public Certificate of the transaction creator and the signature, from the transaction's response, under:
`event.getTransactionEvent().transactionData.actions[0].payload.action.endorsements[0].endorser.id_bytes.toString()`
and
`event.getTransactionEvent().transactionData.actions[0].payload.action.endorsements[0].signature.toString()`
respectively.
However, I do not know how to check the signature on the smart contract on Blockchain 2. Both blockchains are being run by the same peers, so, I could easily verify with, say, peer0 that signed the transaction on Blockchain 1, the transaction's signature on Blockchain 2. But, how can I recreate the transaction signature on the chaincode on Blockchain 2 if I can't get the private key of peer0? Would just checking the certificate enough? :thinking: 
Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 12:26:00 GMT):<br/>
Another way would be to produce a key pair for each Peer and send it to them over transient data (and then sign some message with it in order for Blockchain 2 to easily check the message with the same key later), but I do not really like this solution.
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:28:26 GMT):<br/>
TL-DR; I need to somehow verify on Blockchain-2 that a transaction really happened on Blockchain-1, while both these Blockchains are being operated by the "same peers" (meaning, the same certificates are used on both).

Hi
I had a running fabric network in my local ubuntu in kubernetes , I have migrated the network to the Azure Kubernetes with the same files and bring up all the pods using the kubectl command and it is the only method I can interact with AKS there is no SSH access to the cluster or the worker nodes in AKS. I am stuck with running the fabricSDK in AKS, Anyone suggest me the method to run the fabricSDK in Azure kubernetes .

Hi! Fabric Chaincode beginner here. How does Fabric support attribute relationship between States? How does it compare to a RDBMS functionally speaking? Say if I have an Object attribute that is represented in a different State class extension, how do we make that association?

it seems the problem is IBM pluging for VS Code can't create index. I haves tested on my Fabric network and is deployed correctly
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 11:04:25 GMT):<br/>
Which version of vscode extension are you using and specifically which version of microfab that is used to provide the fabric environment ? Ideally if you could raise an issue here https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension with details of the problem that would be good
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 12:26:36 GMT):<br/>
Looking at the message, it actually says the index was not valid for the query. that kind of suggests the index was installed ok
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 17:18:02 GMT):<br/>
I've just tested 2.0.2 of the extension with microfab 0.0.11 and I was able to show that my index works by first not creating an index and getting the warning in the log output, then I added an index and then didn't get the warning. The META-INF directory was at the top level directory of my project and the chaincode was written in node
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 17:18:43 GMT):<br/>
You can launch a couchdb fauxton interface from the extension where you can check the indexes that have been installed
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 17:18:43 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 11:45:04 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, I'm trying to create a private data collection in a chaincode, but while approving the cc definition, I get `failed to invoke backing implementation of 'ApproveChaincodeDefinitionForMyOrg': error validating chaincode definition: collection-name: MyDataPrivate -- collection member 'Org1MSP' is not part of the channel`. the channel has 3 Orgs in it, Org1 is one of them and the PDC should only be accessible by Org1. In the collections_config.json I defined the policy `OR('Org1MSP.member')`. There isn't very much help available online about creating PDCs or how to troubleshoot them. Can anyone point me in a directions about what might be going wrong here or how I can debug that?
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 08:07:06 GMT):<br/>
how to overcome this error ?
error TS2504: Type 'Promise<HistoryQueryIterator>' must have a '[Symbol.asyncIterator]()' method that returns an async iterator.
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 08:09:49 GMT):<br/>
what is PDC ?

</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 09:05:53 GMT):<br/>
@severus-sn4pe  Can you please share sample code, I think some steps missed like collection config file misconfiguration
</p>
<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 09:12:47 GMT):<br/>
This is the collection config file I use: 
```
[
  {
    "name": "MyDataPrivate",
    "policy": "OR('Org1MSP.member')",
    "requiredPeerCount": 0,
    "maxPeerCount": 1,
    "blockToLive": 0,
    "memberOnlyRead": true,
    "memberOnlyWrite": false,
    "endorsementPolicy": {
      "signaturePolicy": "OR('Org1MSP.member')"
    }
  }
]
```
In this channel are total 3 organisations (Org1, Org2 and Org3). The PDC should only be accessible by Org1, so I used Org1MSP.member in policy and endorsementPolicy.signaturePolicy.
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 09:14:27 GMT):<br/>
this looks correct to me. Your previous message showing that ORg1 is not part of channel , can you check if ORG1 joined channel succesfully
</p>
<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 09:15:27 GMT):<br/>
and when I approve the chaincode after package and install, I simply added the param `--collections-config ./path-to-contract/collections_config.json` to `peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg`, and then I get the error from above (collection member 'Org1MSP' is not part of the channel)
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 09:18:09 GMT):<br/>
hmm. Org1MSP is MSP id of Org1?
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 09:18:19 GMT):<br/>
To use the previous lifecycle process to deploy a private data collection, use the --collections-config flag when instantiating your chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 09:20:16 GMT):<br/>
when I run `peer lifecycle chaincode install`? or what do you mean with instantiating?
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 09:20:28 GMT):<br/>
Can you follow this one https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/private_data_tutorial.html
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 09:20:40 GMT):<br/>
lets see if you face any issue
</p>
<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 09:25:26 GMT):<br/>
that's exactly the tutorial I followed, instead of multiple collections, I just used one. I'm stuck at the part of deploying the contract to the channel.

Hello.
Quick question. I have a blockchain, deployed on kubernetes. On one of the chaincodes, I need to query an API that run on another POD. However, the chaincode cant see the API address: 
```
Error: RequestError: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN some-external-api
```

I suspect that the issue is caused from the chaincode running on an "external" docker instance. Any ideas? Thanks!

async iterators are only available in the 2.2 node shim, make sure you are using the latest 2.2 version with node 12 and fabric 2.2
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Fri, 28 May 2021 20:21:27 GMT):<br/>
Okay. As I suspected it. I need to transform my CCs to external services :/ Is there any tutorial on how to do this with nodejs? Okay, I have read the documentation and found some tutorials, but I'm not really sure that I understand the procedure.
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 02:41:02 GMT):<br/>
I am using fabric 2.2 and node 12.9.1. The error happens when using  getHistoryForKey in typescript.  Is  getHistoryForKey *not* supported in typescript ?
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 03:02:09 GMT):<br/>
Is your questions about chaincode querying external API? I think you can use a client app to querying external API, then send the result to chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 03:02:47 GMT):<br/>
If you really want to use chaincode as external service, there is a guide:
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cc_service.html
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 06:42:44 GMT):<br/>
It's defined here
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/blob/689d31b2ee15fa482f70786c0040811f4cc66929/libraries/fabric-shim/types/index.d.ts#L116
with the implementation here
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/blob/689d31b2ee15fa482f70786c0040811f4cc66929/libraries/fabric-shim/lib/stub.js#L692

so it should work. If not I suggest raising a jira with a sample

You've made a mistake. remove the await from the getHistoryForKey call

If it's a runtime error then you should 
1. check that you definitely are using fabric-shim 2.2
2. compile to a different target (try es2019 for node 12) to remove any polyfills
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 07:36:30 GMT):<br/>
yes,  is it    "fabric-shim": "2.2.0"  in package.json
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 07:36:55 GMT):<br/>
are you deploying to fabric or running unit tests ?
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 07:37:41 GMT):<br/>
It's not exactly "external". The API that I want to talk to from the CC is inside a k8s pod. The peers are also into pods. The only issue is that, as of right now, the CCs are deployed the "usual way" as docker instances and not under pods.
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 07:38:20 GMT):<br/>
unit tests
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 07:41:51 GMT):<br/>
so I would check my node_modules/fabric-shim/package.json to make sure it's 2.2
If it's still a problem then compile to a different target (in your tsconfig.json)
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 07:42:04 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Could you deploy the chaincode to pods ?
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 07:43:26 GMT):<br/>
it is 2.2
```
  "_from": "fabric-shim@2.2.0",
  "_id": "fabric-shim@2.2.0",
```
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 07:48:08 GMT):<br/>
If you are using K8s then you should stop using the internal Docker builder and move to external builders because K8s has deprecated it's use of docker as it's container runtime (and although you could use DinD to do so requires you to run it with escalated privileges. I'm sure there must be examples out there of a K8s based external builder for fabric but fabric doesn't have a sample as far as I know

The problem is with the mock, it doesn't have support for async iterators

<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 08:15:58 GMT):<br/>
This thing '@theledger/fabric-mock-stub';    cannot support async iterators ?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 08:21:08 GMT):<br/>
The support would have to be added to it, however the project has been archived by the looks of it.
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 08:24:15 GMT):<br/>
'@theledger/fabric-mock-stub' supports up to fabric 1.4.x . And the getHistoryForKey was added in fabric 2.0 .
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 08:24:26 GMT):<br/>
thank you again.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 08:25:06 GMT):<br/>
getHistoryForKey was in 1.4, async iterators were added around the 2.1 version of the shim because it came in node 10 (I think) and fabric 1.4 only used node 8
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 08:30:15 GMT):<br/>
actually getHistoryForKey was present in fabric 1.4.x

<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 10:34:56 GMT):<br/>
So, I'm creating the orderer/peers like the example here: https://github.com/happilymarrieddad/hyperledger-fabric-kubernetes/blob/master/k8s/production/orgs/org1/peer0-deployment.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 10:36:01 GMT):<br/>
Is this the appropriate way to create them? If yes, so my only issue is the chain codes that they should be implemented as external services, right? If no, how should I create them? Thanks!

<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 10:36:37 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, I got confused. Uh.
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 12:40:55 GMT):<br/>
The example that you follow, is using fabric 1.4.3.  
Which version of fabric do you want to use ?
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 12:42:37 GMT):<br/>
Yep yep. Sorry about this. I was on mobile and tried to find an example similar to the code that Im using.
I'm using HL 2.3.

Btw, I'm trying to implement the BC through Helm, based on this repo: https://github.com/hyfen-nl/PIVT
</p>
<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 29 May 2021 13:01:27 GMT):<br/>

If i disable the TLS from the "deploy chaincode" script, I can initialize the chaincode - thus the server does not use TLS. Any ideas?

If i disable the TLS from the "deploy chaincode" script, I can initialize the chaincode Any ideas?

I'm using the example, as the server:
```
const shim = require('fabric-shim');

class SimpleChaincode extends shim.ChaincodeInterface {
        async Init(stub) {
                // ... Init code
        }
        async Invoke(stub) {
                // ... Invoke code
        }
}

const server = shim.server(new SimpleChaincode(), {
        ccid: "mycc:fcbf8724572d42e859a7dd9a7cd8e2efb84058292017df6e3d89178b64e6c831",

<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 12:13:41 GMT):<br/>
Okay, last question (for now :P)
How can I avoid the `"chaincode" argument must implement Init() and Invoke() methods`? I already have my methods ready, and I just need the server to pass the ctx/arguments to the methods. In the external-chaincode example here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/1cd71fd26a867efcb0577e02fa42a48a3203ec51/asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-external/assetTransfer.go the chaincode does not implement any Init() or Invoke() methods and does what I just want. However, I can not find any way to accomplish the same on NodeJS.
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 12:16:27 GMT):<br/>
I already extend my contract's class `class Chaincode extends Contract {}`, however, it still wants the Init() and Invoke() methods.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 12:20:44 GMT):<br/>
If the chaincode server can work with chaincode that implements the Contract api then that would be a bug in the chaincode as a server implementation in node, because the implementation of Init and Invoke are not part of the Contract class
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 13:03:20 GMT):<br/>
Or maybe this functionality is not implemented for node?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 16:06:54 GMT):<br/>
there might be a different approach when using a contract
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 16:09:53 GMT):<br/>
looks like if you have a contract use
```
fabric-chaincode-node server ...
```
If you have a standard chaincode then use 
```node mychaincode```
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 16:11:39 GMT):<br/>
But if i do this, I'm going to have the same problem again, with the error :/
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 16:12:19 GMT):<br/>
I think that I found a way: 
```
    async Invoke(stub) {
        let ret = stub.getFunctionAndParameters();
        let params = ret.params;
        let fn = ret.fcn;

        if (contract[fn]) {
            const response = await contract[fn](stub, ...params);
            return response;
        } else {
            return shim.error('Unknown functionality');
        }
    }
```
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 16:12:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 16:17:28 GMT):<br/>
If you have a contract then looking at the code you launch it using `fabric-chaincode-node` server and it will generate a chaincode from that and then start it in server mode, ie you wouldn't use shim.server

Hi Everyone.
I am trying to create a fabric application using node. And so from the /fabric-samples/test-network directory, when I run the command - ./network.sh up. It starts the network and then the orderer is running on port 7053.

Now, when I run the command - ./network.sh createChannel -c channel1 -ca It outputs,

Error: Post "https://localhost:7053/participation/v1/channels": read tcp 127.0.0.1:60864->127.0.0.1:7053: read: connection reset by peer Channel creation failed

Why is it occuring and how can it be resolved?
I researched about this on github/stackoverflow. But could not get any answers.

Hi all. I have the problem that `ctx.stub.getPrivateDataByPartialCompositeKey` does not return a `StateQueryIterator`, but an object with attribute `iterator`, that contains the StateQueryIterator. Does anybody experience the same? (running a typescript chaincode on Fabric 2.2.2)
</p>
<p><strong>severus-sn4pe</strong> (Thu, 10 Jun 2021 13:34:25 GMT):<br/>
here are two console logs from the chaincode, first I called `getStateByPartialCompositeKey`, that returns a StateQueryIterator correctly (marked in red outline). Then I call `getPrivateDataByPartialCompositeKey` that should return the same objec type, but I get an Object with an interator attribute (marked in green outline):

<p><strong>victoryeo</strong> (Sat, 12 Jun 2021 03:15:29 GMT):<br/>
I want to see the chaincode container debug output in fabric peer node. But I could not find docker command in peer node. 
To do a quick test, i run 
"docker run -v core.yaml:/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/core.yaml -it hyperledger/fabric-peer:2.2 /bin/sh"
Confirm, there isn't docker command in the fabric peer node.

</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 13:40:38 GMT):<br/>
I think that I have an issue with my chaincodes. When a chaincode invokes a function of another chaincode, then I can only "get" the response of the invoked function through:
```
            const chaincodeResp = JSON.parse(await ctx.stub.invokeChaincode(chaincodeName, args, channel));
            if (chaincodeResp.status !== 200) {
                // throw some error
            }
            const chaincodeBuffer = Buffer.from(chaincodeResp.payload, 'base64');
            const chaincodeResponse = HelperClass.jsonParser(chaincodeBuffer.toString('utf8'));

            if (chaincodeResponse.status !== 200) {
                // throw some error
            }

            // The actual payload
            const buffer = Buffer.from(chaincodeResponse.payload, 'base64');
            const actualResponse = JSON.parse(buffer.toString('utf8'));
            return actualResponse;
```
As you can see, I have two "buffers" with two "payloads". Is this issue created because the invoked chaincode sends the response with `Shim.success(Buffer.from(...))`? So, it wraps the actual response?
</p>

the two chaincodes  and users  are deployed on same channel. I do not think it is possible to limit chaincode to be called only by chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Fri, 18 Jun 2021 08:29:11 GMT):<br/>
Maybe an idea would be to disallow access to clients/admins etc?

Like:

if (cid.assertAttributeValue('role', 'admin')) {
            return Shim.error(Buffer.from(`Access forbidden`));
        }
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Fri, 18 Jun 2021 08:29:37 GMT):<br/>
Oh wait. Then the chaincode won't be called because the invoker is actually the user.

<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Fri, 18 Jun 2021 08:35:57 GMT):<br/>
Uh, the other way would be to maybe sign something (e.g. a JWT) with a key that only the chaincodes can have and this way I could "authenticate" the request.

One last question. Right now I'm deploying a different pod that runs the chaincode, for every organization (!). Is it appropriate to only deploy one pod and all the orgs to call this one pod? I am not sure about the instantiation of the chaincode, but I think that if I give a custom name to the chaincode (through the `--name` arg) it will be okay.

If we want to read the data at 10,001 location, is there a way to skip the first 10,000 data ?
Something like this:
getQueryResultWithPagination(query, 10000, "1")

Is it possible to support this feature when using couchDB
In couchDB, there are limit and skip that can be passed to query iterator.

Limit and Skip can't be used unfortunately, so you can't do what you want, you need to design your data model and queries to provide a way to query only the data you are interested in

Can anyone point to an example of how to correctly decorate Properties and Parameters to be an Array type? I tend to have issues any time I'm trying to receive an array as a parameter, or put an array on an Object.

`[MissingRefError: can't resolve reference Type2 from id Type1#] {` <- in this case Type2 is an Array<Type2> on Type1, and the class definition for Type2 is decorated with @Object()

Hi Team,

Need help regarding https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABCG-23
Issue: Unable to get Transaction Details with GetTransactionByID qscc call from another chaincode
Description: 
We recently upgraded our Fabric version from 1.4 to 2.3. In our Chaincode we have business logic to verify a txnId is present in ledger or not. With Fabric 2.3 upgrade we are getting below error. If this is a limitation from added in 2.x to avoid deadlock situation, can you let us know the approaches to get transaction details for a given transaction ID from a chaincode?

Code:
chainCodeArgs := toChaincodeArgs("GetTransactionByID", stub.GetChannelID(), tid)
response := stub.InvokeChaincode("qscc", chainCodeArgs, stub.GetChannelID())
Error:
Rejecting invoke of QSCC from another chaincode because of potential for deadlocks, original invocation for 'testcc'

GetTransactionByID function written chaincode? You can directly call this function from sdk as this from qscc chaincode. https://www.systutorials.com/how-to-query-transaction-by-id-in-hyperledger-fabric-2-0/

<p><strong>KameshPalani</strong> (Tue, 29 Jun 2021 14:31:39 GMT):<br/>
Hi Knaware9, 

Thanks for the reply, GetTRansactionByID is standard QSCC method. Actually, post getting the Transaction data we are verifying whether the MSP submitted is matching with the latest request for the asset. So, we are looking for options at Chaincode rather than client to call qscc and pass the txn details.
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Wed, 30 Jun 2021 08:38:23 GMT):<br/>
yes, I remember before 2.0 we could call QSCC from chaincode but i think its removed 2.0 onwards

Hi, the chaincode still communicates with the peer using a grpc connection to access data in the same way for external chaincode. The difference is that for chaincode as a server the communication is started by the peer instead of the chaincode, which is usually the case.

Hi all. After refactoring my previously working node-app, I get the following error when I try to create a new gateway to my chaincode: `Unable to connect to the discovered orderer orderer.example.com:7050 due to TypeError: Channel credentials must be a ChannelCredentials object`. After the error, the gateway is open - I can query Chaincode data, but no endorsers are linked in the gateway, and thus all write-operations (submitTransactions) fail. Has anyone faced the same issue and might know, what the problem is? I cannot find any obvious differences to the code that was previously working.

When returning a response with the Shim API to the user (shim.success()/shim.error()), should we put the response payload in a buffer? I have seen some examples where the API was used like this: Shim.error('Some error') and others that used a Buffer: Shim.error(Buffer.from('Some error')). Which one is the most "appropriate" and acceptable? Does the API wraps the data inside a Buffer by itself? (So a second Buffer.from is redundant)
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Thu, 22 Jul 2021 13:15:35 GMT):<br/>

I have a chaincode that has an `AND` policy, e.g. `AND(Org1.member, Org2.member)`
This chaincode has also some private collections.

The issue is that, while I have a collection endorsement policy that "excludes" the second org (Org2) from the endorsement, the invocation of the chaincode still needs to have the private data endorsed by the second Org as well. If I don't endorse the private data, I get an `ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE` error.

```
{
        "name": "Organization0MSPPrivateCollection",
        "policy": "OR('Org0MSP.member')",
        "requiredPeerCount": 0,
        "maxPeerCount": 1,
        "blockToLive": 0,
        "memberOnlyRead": true,

        "endorsementPolicy": {
            "signaturePolicy": "OR('Org0MSP.member')"
        }
    },
```

Any ideas on this?
Also, I'd like to exclude the "private data" from the transient field of the organizations that I don't want them to endorse them. Is this possible?
Right now, I do ".setTransient(priv_data)". What I'd like to do would be something like ".setTransientForOrgMSP(priv_data)"

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 09:00:47 GMT):<br/>
If you don't want a particular organisation to receive the private data then you need to use org or peer targetting. For example in the node-sdk you have https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-2.2/module-fabric-network.Transaction.html#setEndorsingOrganizations__anchor
and https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-2.2/module-fabric-network.Transaction.html#setEndorsingPeers__anchor
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 09:03:45 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure but I would say that endorsement policies don't override each other bit instead a peer validates an endorsement against all policies that exist and are applicable so you overall chaincode policy still has to be satisfied. (Your experience certainly suggests that). You might need to consider state based endorsement as an option

<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:40:36 GMT):<br/>
Hey David. Wish you are well! =)
I am aware of both Org/Peer targeting and State Based endorsement. However, the issue is that I have a function that, when invoked, makes two changes to the BC State.

1. It updates a key that has an AND Policy (this is crucial - it is a key that keeps a "log" of transactions, so all the peers should endorse)
2. Add the private data.

The only way to achieve what I want is to have two different function calls. One to put the private data into the state and a second one to update the "log" key. Of course, this is not acceptable in any way. I need to do this concurrently. So, this is why I need to send the private data to only one peer.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:00:29 GMT):<br/>
As this is a client side requirement you could try asking on #fabric-sdk-node and maybe also raising a jira issue for the node-sdk. You probably should also consider contributing that change to the node-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:53:48 GMT):<br/>
Thank you David! I will investigate furthermore and Ill see what I'll do about it!
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 16:52:29 GMT):<br/>
Thinking about it more, it might not work because the R/W sets would be different from endorsers that didn't receive the transient data for storing in private data vs those that did

Hi. We were using clientIdentity.getX509Certificate() api in fabric-contract-api v1.4. Now as we upgrade the api version to 2.x we are not getting getX509Certificate() api within clientIdentity. Although in fabric latest document https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developapps/transactioncontext.html link they have mentioned about getX509Certificate() api but in the Class:clientIdentity link it is not there. Is it they have removed this library and to get certificate details we have to take from raw idbytes and then parse it with x509 parser.Or is there any other way to get invoker's identity.

Use the _evaluate_ calls in the client SDK instead of the _submit_ calls. It just gets the transaction proposal endorsed by a peer (which executes the chaincode and gives you a result), but doesn't then submit the endorsed transaction to the orderer (which updates the ledger)

Hey, looking for some more ideas with my issue.

At the API that connects with the Fabric network, I open a new GRPC connection for every query that a user makes. This, of course, has a very big drawback; I can evaluate/endorse at most 30-50 TXs before the orderers/peers start to fail.

This API has also a user (per organization) that has an (always) open connection with the gateway. So, I can reuse this gateway with the clients (per organization, again). Already achieved this.
However, there are times that, in my chaincodes, I create a `new ClientIdentity(ctx.stub)` in order to:
1. Check if the user has the appropriate rights to invoke the function (`cid.assertAttributeValue()`)
2. To store data that utilize the `cid.getID()` as a key

One way that, I think, would resolve my issue, is if I could create a new `Stub` that would carry the client's information and not the information that came with the generic user of the organization that owns the gateway. I could, for example (along with any other information) send the certificate of the client to the chaincode and create a new Stub. But I don't think that this is possible.

Another way would be to also send the certificate of the client and create custom functions that would read the certificate, check for the available attributes etc. However, I don't really like this way.

Do you have any other suggestion that may have not crossed my mind?

So, I created a custom "Identity" class which has nearly the same functions (getID(), getAttributeValue(), assertAttributeValue() etc.). However, again, there is one (minor?) drawback. I need to send the certificate of the user that invokes the function on every invocation. It is not something big (because, this way, the biggest and most difficult issue of having the real invoker's identity is solved and the TPS is extremely higher), however, it's still an issue. If anyone has any suggestion, I'd be more than glad to hear it.

So, I created a custom "Identity" class which has nearly the same functions (getID(), getAttributeValue(), assertAttributeValue() etc.). However, again, there is one (minor?) drawback. I need to send the certificate of the user that invokes the function on every invocation. It is not a big deal (because, this way, the biggest and most difficult issue of having the real invoker's identity is solved and the TPS is extremely higher), however, it's still an issue. If anyone has any suggestion, I'd be more than glad to hear it.

If you have a manageable sized pool of user identities transacting at a given time, you might be able to cache Gateway instances you've created in the client for each identity, so if that client identity wants to send a second transaction it uses the same Gateway instance (and associated gRPC connections) as the first transaction
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 08:17:38 GMT):<br/>
Another alternative might be to use off-line signing, where you explicitly sign the transaction proposal with the appropriate client identity's private key. But this would require using low-level client APIs, which are not at all friendly: https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-2.2/tutorial-sign-transaction-offline.html
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 08:19:14 GMT):<br/>
Your idea of embedding the client certificate within the transaction arguments (or transient data) is actually not so different since the certificate for the client signing identity is embedded within all transaction proposals anyway, so that might be a good compromise approach

Good news is that in the future things should be much easier with the the _fabric-gateway_ client API currently in development, which solves this issue by allowing gRPC connections to be shared between client Gateway instances: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-gateway

It also exposes an easy to use off-line signing mechanism directly in the high-level flow, but that really is just for scenarios where you don't have direct access to the client signing keys within the your Gateway client application
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 08:24:01 GMT):<br/>
The bad news is the _fabric-gateway_ API is not yet at release level

Hey @bestbeforetoday 

Thank you for your time and extremely detailed post!

In the past days I struggled to make the API that connects with the HF to manage concurrent GRPC connections.

As I said in a previous message, without reusing the GRPC connection, I can only endorse ~30-50 TXs (I'm not really sure of the number when just evaluating, but it wasn't high as well).

When I first tested to run some invocations with a shared GRPC, I was surprised by the number I could achieve (It was ~3.000 concurrent evaluations).

So, I tried to make the API reuse the GRPC connection and create new GRPC connections when needed. i.g. I set an upper-bound of simultaneous connections to every open GRPC connection (e.g. 1000 concurrent users that evaluate) and when that number is reached, a new GRPC connection is created in order to serve for clients (there is of course a limit of the active connections, that is they're also bounded).

I also "sift" every request that comes from a client. If the request is just an evaluation, I give it more "freedom" to join the queue, while if it is a .submit, it is a bit more restricted. i.g. every GRPC connection has a ~2/1 ratio of EVALUATIONS/SUBMITS
(1000 concurrent requests => 700 of them will be evaluations, 300 submits).

However,
1. Do you think that I'm doing good that I create new GRPC connections? Or should I have, say, 1 GRPC connection of 2.000 users instead of 1.000 and don't create a second connection?

2. As I said, when I first tested the HF with a shared GRPC , I reached ~3.000 concurrent evaluations (if I'm not mistaken). However now, even if I have just one active GRPC that is bounded to, say, 1.000 concurrent users, if the connection is active for some time and the queue is always refilled, that is, there is always a new request for the HF to process , I get timeout errors ([Endorser]: sendProposal[org] - org timed out after: 30000). Any ideas on this? Should I have a lower bound of concurrent users?

Thanks!

All in all, with, say, 1 orderer (I know that is not enough, but suppose that is 1 for now) and 4 peers, what is the expected number of concurrent requests? That is, how many requests should I feed HF with? (Approximately, of course)

<p><strong>GeorgePals</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 10:19:00 GMT):<br/>
Fixed the issue with the timeout errors. Or somehow, it fixed itself, haha.

Now I can make calls to the BC with ~60/70 invokes/second and ~400 active connections. When a request is completed, a new request is added to the queue of the active connections. The only issue is when submitting, which is a much more computational expensive action.

Hey,

I'm trying to implement offline signing.
I can send the proposal to the endorsers, however I have a couple of questions.

1. endorsement.send() just sends the proposal to the endorsers, right? It is like the .evaluate()
2. Say that I have successfully defined the proposal bytes, signed the proposal and got it endorsed. How can I commit it? If I'm correct, endorsement.send() just ask the endorsers to endorse and does not send the endorsed proposal to the Orderer.
3. When we use endorsement.send(), we can target distinct endorsers. If, for example, I target an endorser that does not exist in the CCs policy, what will happen? E.g., we have a CC with an endorsement policy (Org0 AND org1) and at endorsement.send() we specify the targets as: endorsement.send(targets: ['Org0', 'Org1', 'Org2']). Will Org2 return an error and fail the endorsement?
4. When I do `endorsed = endorsement.send()`, I get back an `Object: {errors: ServiceError[], responses: EndorsementResponse[], queryResults: Buffer[]}`
While `endorsed.responses` is okay (I can see the response of every endorser), `queryResults` returns `undefined`. Any ideas why?

Thanks!

Edit: One more question:
As I can see, if we want to commit, we need to construct a new Commit() `const commit = new Commit(contract, channel, endorsement)`, create a new proposal (?) with `commit.build(idx, build_options)` and then sign again (again?) the built object. Is this correct? So, the user needs to (offline) sign a proposal twice? Maybe I'm losing something here.

BTW, I've tried to commit but I get this error: `"this.channel.getTargetCommitters is not a function"` when I `await commit.send({ targets: channel.getCommitters() });`

Hi, I am unsure if this is a right place to post a question regarding Fabric Node Docker image so please redirect me to another channel if necessary. I am planning to compile all HLF Docker images on Raspberry Pi (ARM64) and I am already successful with base Docker images (peer, orderer, baseos, fabric-ca etc.). However, I now would like to build a Docker image for javascript chaincodes (i.e. fabric-nodeenv images used during chaincode instantiation). I looked for relevant Dockerfiles for Javascript in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node but I could not find instructions or Dockerfile or Makefile files which are usually present in both fabric and fabric-ca repos. I would greatly appreciate if you could redirect me to a right place to help me in the task described above. Thanks!

<p><strong>maciejjedrzejczyk</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 18:11:25 GMT):<br/>

Hey,

I need to use the `getStateByPartialCompositeKeyWithPagination` stub. Everything works as expected, however I need to fetch the, e.g., 20 *latest* records.
For example, if there are 1.000 records (for simplicity, suppose that its record has an i.g. index, `1, 2 ... 1000`). If we add 20 new records, the index is now `1, 2, ... 1020`.
What I need to achieve is to call the aforementioned stub and fetch the *last* 20 records (from index 1001 to 1020). What HF does is to bring me index `1 to 20` then `21 to 40` etc. Thus, for a key with *a lot* of records, this is a very big issue.

I'm trying to solve the aforementioned issue by using queries. I have created the appropriate `index` file and tried to pass it at build time. However, I get this error:
```
2021-10-19 18:26:35.695 UTC c817 DEBU [lifecycle] Work -> skipping build of chaincode 'chaincode_name.......' as it is already in progress
```
Thus, I can not pass the `META-INF` folder to the `BUILD` folder. I've also tried it to a fresh HF installation.
I'm using HF 2.4 (Beta).

Any opinion/idea etc. will be much appreciated.

Is there a way to cancel the current transaction without throwing an error? I want to return a custom response type on error, but it seems Fabric will only cancel the transaction if an error is thrown directly.

Hi all !!!

I am facing some issue while updating couchdb indexes in chaincode 
I am using this buildpack https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/v2.2.3/asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-external/sampleBuilder/bin

My folder structure for chaincode package is like this 
- First archived connection.json and metadata folder with indexes in code.tar.gz
- then archived code.tar.gz and metadata.json in chaincode.tgz 

External Chaincode is working perfect after committing chaincode definition but couchdb indexes are not being created

Do you mean the sequence number? you update that yourself when installing the chaincode

Hi, I am using vscode and  [IBM Blockchain Platform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform) develop&debug chaincode. Since the dockerdesktop APP will not be free for company user after 2022.1.31. I wonder that if IBM Blockchain Platform extension could work based on other container management tools such as podman? Or I need to buy a license of dockerdesktop?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 23 Dec 2021 10:19:51 GMT):<br/>
The extension isn't going to work with podman. Are you a windows or a mac user ?

Shame, then all I can suggest as an alternative is to install a hypervisor such as virtualbox and use linux where you can install vscode and the docker cli (which shouldn't require a license)
</p>
<p><strong>roclee</strong> (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 05:47:49 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, running vscode in linux is a good solution. Maybe I should move my development environment to linux server and remotely access to it. Something like vscode remote ssh or (coder)[https://coder.com/] may solve my problem.
