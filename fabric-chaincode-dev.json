{"msg":"Adding another thread here from the fabric sdk channel: \n\nweeds 3:29 PM\nGot this quick question today highlighted here---> https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2625\nIs there a way to include a request that is sent in state in the emitted event, because this team who opened request is using uses a router for chaincode API and rules and so access to intermediate data is difficult at best. Ideally, they want to be able to use SetEvent as done today, but to add more information by calling a new GetEvent function on the shim and then putting it back. Any recommendations on approach here? @kletkeman added her given this is where question originated from\n\nkletkeman 3:50 PM   \nThanks @weeds, we can set only one payload for the emitted event -- in our case a marshalled JSON object -- and so we need to be able to incrementally add to this event. I would much prefer to not have to built it up as a separate passed context, since the shim is already a useful context object for working with the ledger. Instead, the addition of a getter for the intermediate event payload would allow us to put the latest payload and then get it and update it along the way. Note that this would suffer a bit from poor performance, since it has to be serialised and thus marshalled each time we exit from a function.\n\nPerhaps we could instead get an actual context object that could be used by complex chaincode to build context up for other purposes and to build up the payload, which can then be set in the shim at the end. This would actually be even more useful. Something like *map[string]interface{} would be incredibly high performing and yet flexible. With or without getter and setter. Anyway, I wonder how others feel about this? (Note also that the shim might even be able to pass this context to all participating chaincodes in a deeply complex chain.)","username":"kletkeman","ts":"2017-03-03T20:53:41.641Z"}

{"msg":"@suvpatil Here is the problem with calling out from chaincode -- chaincode must be 100% deterministic, and any call to an external system is not guaranteed to work. Moreover, any call that results in information being recorded externally is going to be missing from the read/write set and thus not rolled back if the transaction does not end up committed. Thus, you are immediately out of sync between world state and the external system. Note also that any call made out to the real world is made from every copy of the chaincode on every peer involved in the transaction.\n\nSo you can call out for read-only, but your peers must all be able to reach the same URL and thus you introduce a major impediment to determinism. Carefully handled, it could be reasonably reliable. But expect transactions to fail more often unless your implementation is bullet proof.\n\nAnd writing externally is unlikely to stay perfectly synced up to world state, so designing that in is simply asking for earth shattering issues.\n\nThere is an exception that I was shown and agree with. If you want the chaincode to certify an external file's authenticity (for example you want the master copy of the latest Star Wars film to be certified as the original on some IP protection ledger), then you could have the chaincode create the hash of the film (which is much better than passing it in with the \"trust me\" property set) and store the signature of the film and the exact location. For performance reasons, I suspect that you would need a separate channel per film and you would need the film to be accessible locally on a fast network shared with the peer. Further, each peer would need the same access using the same URL, which implies a distributed file system with appropriate routing. Yet this is all still fine if the endorsers all agree, because the URL and the signatures match and that is all you need.\n\nI have not heard of any other scenario where external access is safe and effective, but I really like this one.","username":"kletkeman","ts":"2017-03-08T15:12:26.041Z"}

Also, there is the transient area in which to pass keys should you be doing obfuscation / anonymization and so on. The chaincode will want to enforce ACLs based on ID or ORG, but otherwise I don't se why the chaincode would be involved in the mechanics of auth in any way.","username":"kletkeman","ts":"2017-03-13T16:28:19.530Z"}

{"msg":"@RishabhSoni It helps to think of the smart contract as more or less equivalent to a web application with an API. Meaning that you design a datamodel to reflect what you want to be able to do, then a sensible API to reflect how you would like the data to flow in and out, and finally you codify it in whatever language you are working with (JavaScript in web apps, Go in smart contracts, or a sort of hybrid of custom datamodel plus Javascript event model for transactions in composer). There are many details to deal with, especially in v1, but the basics are always the same. Note: if you want privacy etc, things get a lot more complicated, but to simply reflect your scenario into chaincode is quite straightforward. Note that I have always stored everything as JSON objects, which is where fabric has evolved with v1 as well. This makes it pretty easy to understand how your asset states will have to change as events are received. You just do a lot of GetState and PutState to the asset identifiers.","username":"kletkeman","ts":"2017-03-24T13:00:48.832Z"}

I'm not sure if a remote database is supported, but it can probably be incorporated, in which case you do not need to artificially scale your chaincodes for data scaling alone. On the other hand, the concept of channels offers the opportunity to scale, since they can be processed in parallel. I.e. you must flow control any conflicting writes on the same channel, as you cannot have transactions touch the same keys inside one block. But if you manage to separate the data by channels, you can process the writes in parallel with impunity. And of course you have instantiated the chaincode on each channel separately, so you are in effect using chaincodes to partition data (although the channel is what effects the partitioning).

{"msg":"@PushpalathaHiremath \n1. The chaincode is installed onto a peer and instantiated on each channel on which you want to run the chaincode. And that is theoretically all you have to do to upgrade, although I would imagine that you would primarily need to upversion the chaincode under the same moniker. If my understanding of the solution to the \"take over the database\" problem that I reported several times on v0.6 is correct, the world state partition is organized by channel/chaincode moniker, and the chaincode respects the versioning.\n\n2. Should not be needed, and would not work on any but the most trivial databases -- I have a v0.6 Bluemix fabric that has 4.8M blocks and an estimated 20M+ transactions, and there is no way that all peers could be paused while they deal with the upgrade time under such a scenario. Under v0.6, we pondered such things, but v1 has obsoleted the need.\n\n3. No. V1 versions chaincode and the ID is set when it is installed / instantiated (one of those two), so the ID does not change.\n\n4. This is something I have pondered, but it really is not necessary any more. Chaincode to chaincode calls are also container to container gRPC calls in user space, and so the performance hit would not be pleasant.\n\nThe best option is to read the v1 docs on chaincode and note the ID and version that you assign. Then make a backwards compatible change and redeploy. You should be able to carry on.","username":"kletkeman","ts":"2017-06-06T14:04:10.401Z"}

There are many examples of how this can be done our there, but none are all that satisfying. The one that looks really promising is the CLI example for the Go SDK.

{"msg":"@nhrishi  - A couple of things:\n\n1) If you don't want the chaincode to run on certain peers within a channel, don't install it on those peers\n2) You only need to instantiate chaincode once per channel (i.e. instantiate is not run on a per peer basis)\n\nThe default instantiation policy is that the admin of any org in a channel can instantiate chaincode.  So you need only run one instantiate transaction.  Once you get the response back from a peer for instantiate and then send that to the orderer, all of of the other peers in the channel will get the instantiate transaction.  If they have the chaincode installed, then they will spin it up.  If a peer on the channel does not have the chaincode installed, then it simply saves the lifecycle information but will not spin up the chaincode","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-08-12T17:49:53.693Z"}

If they have the chaincode installed, then they will spin it up.\n\nHi Gari, unless something has changed post v1.0.0, my experience has been that the chaincode images and container are spun up only on the peer that is the target of the chaincode instantiate request.  Other peers that had the chaincode installed do not get the image or container built at that time.    I am only referring to using the *peer chaincode instantiate* cli command, so maybe you're referring to what happens when using one of the SDKs?","username":"silliman","ts":"2017-08-12T18:59:22.327Z"}

{"msg":"Hi everyone. I have a question regarding Chaincode development. From the examples I can see the difference of the chaincode logic between fabric 0.6 and 1.0. I mean the way how transactions are stored in the ledger. For instance, marbels example in v0.6: transactions were recorded under the particular index, that way by querying that index name we could get all transactions saved on it. Right now, in ver1.0 we don't have index, but there is a CompositeKey, which is a good way to retrieve data, but still without rich queries I think there is not much flexibility to read information. Are those indexes used in earlier versions of fabric chaincode discarded and not recommended? ","username":"GiorgiBlockchain","ts":"2017-10-23T06:43:40.382Z"}

Part of the validation is to make sure that the transaction meets the endorsement policy.  As part of this check, the peer makes sure that enough signatures were collected over the SAME response.\n\nSo let's say the endorsement policy required 2 out of Org1,Org2,Org3.

{"msg":"Hello experts. I have a question about API of `Chaincode shim`. Is there any plan or discussion to add APIs to put/get/delete key-values per data object?\n\nWhen a Chaincode has multiple data objects, it is common to use composite keys. Composite keys have the name of an object as a prefix.\nLet’s say we have `Marble` as an object. `Marble` is used as a prefix. The key-values in `Marble` looks like: ` Marble_key1-value1` `Marble_key2-value2` and `Marble_key3-value3`.\nWhen getting/putting a key-value, we call `stub.CreateCompositeKey(objectType, keys)` to generate a composite key.\nIn case getting all key-values in `Marble`, we call `stub.getStateByPartialCompositeKey(objectType, []string{})` to get key-values which has `Marble` as a partial key.\n\nI know that table API in v0.6 was abandoned. However, it may be useful to add APIs like the below because we often implement these functions in Chaincode.\n`GetObjectData(objectType, key)`: return a key-value which has a composite key consisting of `objectType_key`.\n`GetAllByObjectType(objectType)`: return a list of key-values in an object (or return an iterator).\n`DelAllByObjectType(objectType)`: delete all key-values in an object.","username":"yuki-kon","ts":"2018-05-02T21:15:01.482Z"}

Which means though err is null, ok is false.\n\nThe following code snippet works as expected, i.e logger prints \"enroll ID\" as Roger.

{"msg":"Hey everyone, I've been facing an error while using the `InstantiateCC` method provided by the `fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/resmgmt` package (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/55ab46a8c2a69288dda370dd335a85a300d15aa5/pkg/client/resmgmt/resmgmt.go#L121:6) and am hoping to get some help. I have two orgs (Org0, Org1), each with two peers (peer0, peer1) who have joined a common channel and I've installed the same cc onto all 4 peers. The description for `InstantiateCC` states that instantiation will happen for *all* peers in the channel. In reality, instantiation only happens for the peers belonging to the org whose context is calling `InstantiateCC`. The dev containers for those 2 peers are launched fine and I'm able to invoke methods through any peer on that one org. I then try to instantiate through the client context for the other org, but the peers believe the chaincode has already been launched on the channel (which is has, but not for the peers of this org), so an error is thrown (`Chaincode status Code: (500) UNKNOWN. Description: chaincode with name 'exchangeCC' already exists`). Has anyone successfully made a similar scenario happen or have any ideas how to solve this?","username":"sarah","ts":"2018-08-02T18:33:06.788Z"}

{"msg":"Fabric uses an endorsement policy where peers from different orgs must return the same results for transactions to be validated.   If ledger state data had been altered or corrupted (in CouchDB or LevelDB file system) on a peer, then the transaction results would be inconsistent across endorsing peers, the 'bad’ peer/org will be found out, and the application client can throw out the results from the bad peer/org before submitting the transaction for ordering/commit. If client application tries to submit a transaction with inconsistent endorsement regardless, this will be detected on all the peers at validation time and the transaction will be invalidated.\n  \nIf you are doing read-only queries rather than update transactions, then you can similarly query multiple endorsing peers and verify the results from each are consistent.\nIf there is doubt about state database integrity, the state database can be dropped and it will automatically get regenerated from the chain source of truth upon peer restart.  If there is doubt about the chain integrity itself, you can run a verification utility to scan the ledger to check its hashes and overall integrity, one such utility can be found here: https://github.com/C0rWin/ledgerfsck.\n\nIf you find the peer has been corrupted or tampered during the verification check, then the peer itself will need to be rebuilt and the chain will be the transferred from another peer upon re-joining the channel.","username":"dave.enyeart","ts":"2018-08-24T10:54:52.767Z"}

{"msg":"@Andres3741 there are two aspects to the question....(1) `Instantiate` command targets the instantiate proposal at the peer it is directed to. But the Commit of the instantiate transaction happens on all the peers in the channel. In other words, all the peers in the channel will see the instantitate TX and the states due to that TX after commit (2) to do the Instnatiate proposal itself on multiple peers, the proposal has to be sent to all the peers. Typically the SDKs take care of this. Based on the context of the question,  `how can I instantiate chain code automatically in a new peer` - given (1), a new peer joining will sync up and get the instantiation TX. In addition, if the chaincode itself is installed on the new peer and it satisfies the endorsement policy, you can direct invokes and queries to the chaincode.","username":"muralisr","ts":"2018-09-30T12:53:24.027Z"}

{"msg":"Hi,\n\nI am working on a simple asset tokenization chaincode on v1.3. I am using first-network setup from fabric-samples where I have 2 orgs – Org1 and Org2. I have defined one collection per organization for 2 different users. \nUser Alice belongs to Org1 and has collection with name “Alice”. User Bob belongs to Org2 and has collection with name “Bob”. I have configured a collection_json with respective organization accordingly.  \n\nI have a very simple chaincode where it issues an asset/token with asset name, qty, owner. I can issue an asset for Alice and Bob and query them. \n\nFor asset transfer between Alice and Bob, I am written a transfer Function. Let’s say Alice (Org1) is transferring her asset to Bob (Org2). \nIn function, I retrieve a Alice asset using GetPrivateData and “Allice” collection and change owner to Bob and PutPrivateData using “Bob” collection. I also do DelPrivateData on “Alice” collection. \nThe transaction proposal is invoked by Alice using Org1 peer0. In this case, transfer doesn’t work and Alice’s asset remains with Alice.\n\nI think the reason is because Org1 doesn’t have an access to Bob’s collection from Org2. Is this correct? If yes, what is the solution for such a usecase. \nDo we always need third-party Org3 which is part of both “Alice” and “Bob” collections and that invokes this transfer transaction from its own node?\n\nCan someone pls help me clarify this.

{"msg":"Hi all, sorry to bother you. I've read the documentation on read-write sets but still had a couple of questions I was hoping someone could help me with? Thanks in advance!\n\n1) Double Read - Is there protection built into Fabric against a world-state key being updated during a chaincode endorsement?\nAs I understand it, if you were to perform a GetState on the same key twice within a single transaction, the peer could potentially have received a block and committed an update to that key in the interim. In this scenario would the peer return the latest known value each time, and what would be stored within the read-set? The documentation indicates the read-set is a unique set of keys, so would the latest version take precedent? Or would both versions be stored (resulting in it failing at commit stage).\n\n2) Confirmation that empty reads included in the ReadSet\nI understand (nil, nil) is returned if you GetState on a key that doesn't exist, I'm just checking that it is also added to the ReadSet in this case. In other-words if two separate transactions read and write to a previously non-existent key, is there a versioning conflict at commit stage, or would both transactions be committed.","username":"RyanGriffiths","ts":"2019-01-29T15:13:08.713Z"}

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=AuY9Bm7GTQsw2QJ3n) @Antimttr The \"Commercial Paper\" sample uses the \"New Programming Model\" from Fabric 1.4, using the `fabric-contract-api` in the Smart Contract, and using the `Gateway` class in the Client SDK program.  This new programming model is sometimes called the high level programming model.\nThe \"Balance Transfer\" sample does not use the New Programming Model, it uses the \"traditional\" model.\nThe new model refers to Smart Contracts and the traditional model refers to chaincode - they are essentially the same thing, but the Smart Contracts have some additional constructs that make it a little easier.\nThe New Programming Model is intended to be easier to use to allow developers to focus on business logic, but the low-level traditional api allows additional flexibility.\nIf you wish to compare the 2 different models, the Fabcar sample has a 2 examples - \"javascript\" for the new model, and \"javascript-low-level\" for the traditional model.","username":"rthatcher","ts":"2019-02-05T10:04:05.172Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=AuY9Bm7GTQsw2QJ3n","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-chaincode-dev?msg=AuY9Bm7GTQsw2QJ3n","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

You could look at Typescript as opposed to Javascript for developing both your client and chaincode applications.

In other words, you want read committed isolation level as opposed to the serializable isolation level (hlf's model). Ideally, we could allow a transaction submitter to specify the isolation level per transaction and evaluate the validity/invalidity of the transaction per that option. However, this option is not there yet...\nIn the absense of this you can do following... \ninstead of \"I am reading some value from query result\", you can pass the info in the chaincode parameter about what exactly you want to read and perform a pointed reads for those instead of performing a range query.

We have more than 10 separate orgs in different google and AWS kubernetes clusters managed by different companies in our consortium. A solution that uses raw source code from a central Artifactory/Nexus repository and builds within in each org would be useful for the review step of chaincode by members within our consortium.\n\nIs this the right place for this discussion?

It would be especially important to have these strict versions available, ideally even more than one version available at once for replaying and validating historical data if so required.\n\nThis is a complex issue and I look forward to seeing what the HLF team comes up with.  I forwarded the google doc and the Jira issue around so we can keep an eye on it and provide any comments or insights that we might have which could prove useful.  Admittedly our large financial securitization system is a pretty unique case with members spanning the 3 major public cloud providers on a full private network but I believe our use case might still provide an interesting set of constraints to consider.","username":"iramiller","ts":"2019-02-25T23:37:10.165Z"}

{"msg":"Hi all, I'm running into this problem (again) where I'm getting `GET_STATE_BY_RANGE failed: ... Queries on pvt data is supported only in a read-only transaction`.  I get why that check is in there -- ostensibly from preventing chaincode developers from accidentally writing private data to the public ledger, but in this case I'm only operating on a single private collection.  In particular I'm trying to delete a table from my private collection, and the step that's triggering this error is just checking that the table has no rows before deleting the table metadata (from another private collection table that I've defined).  If I reverse the order of the operations, I get `DEL_STATE failed: ... Transaction has already performed queries on pvt data. Writes are not allowed`.  So basically I'm blocked either way -- I can't verify that a table is empty before deleting it.  How do I disable this check?

{"msg":"@rallam to the narrow question \"can chaincode handle concurrent requests?\" the answer is yes. To the question \"would transactions created from chaincode responses to those concurrent requests cause MVCC collision errors?\" the answer is depends upon the application. If two concurrent requests access the same state key \"A\" and both of them think they are modifying version \"100\" of state \"A\", when the transaction first request gets committed, it'll move the version to \"101\" making the second transaction's fail. Now if the two requests are accessing different  state keys \"A\" and \"B\" respectively, you will not get the MVCC error. So chaincode can handle concurrent request but the behavior of transactions from those requests is application dependent. ","username":"muralisr","ts":"2019-09-11T21:29:26.633Z"}

The specific chaincode that is having the endorsement policy failure  works fine in the DEV environment. \n\n Difference between test env and dev env. \n\nDev Env: HF 1.4.2, have control of ORG1 and ORG2 certs and peers.  \nTest Env: HF 1.4.0, only have control of ORG1 certs and peers.\n\nIn regards to trouble shooting, is there a method in which I can see the endorsement of the specific chaincode that is failing and has been instantiated in the channel. It should have the same endorsement policy as the other chaincode just want to confirm. \n\nBelow is an example of the endorsement policy that is being used. \n\n``` shell\n    -P \"AND (OR(‘Org1MSP.peer', ‘Org1MSP.client’,’Org1MSP.member’,’Org1MSP.admin'), OR (‘Org2MSP.peer', ‘Org2MSP.client', ‘Org2MSP.member', ‘Org2MSP.admin'))\"\n````\n\nErrors Faced: \n```shell\nvalidateTx -> ERRO 42d1\u001b[0m VSCCValidateTx for transaction txId = returned error: VSCC error: endorsement policy failure, err: signature set did not satisfy policy\n```\n```shell\nvalidateTx -> ERRO 42d1\u001b[0m VSCCValidateTx for transaction txId = returned error: VSCC error: endorsement policy failure, err: signature set did not satisfy policy\n```\nIn regards to trouble shooting, I have a few questions. \n\n\n1.)  Is there a method in which I can see the endorsement of the specific chaincode that is failing and has been instantiated in the channel. It should have the same endorsement policy as the other chaincode just want to confirm. \n2.) Is is possible that changes in ORG2 peers and certs can cause endorsement policy in a specific chaincode and not the other chaincode. \n3.) Can the difference between HF versions cause endorsement policy error for one of the chain-code and not the rest?\n3.)

I would like to use `GetQueryResult` because I would like to query the orderbook and sort results based on price, age etc. However, I note in the docs it says that queries are not re-executed on peers when validating.

Tools such as the VSCode extension are there to try and make development and debug simpler.\n\nThe advice is that for your given use case, if you need to get putState to throw and error use a mocking library specific for your language. and do FV tests against a real fabric.

{"msg":"@ascatox We are in the middle of doing a first PoC for implementing an object-oriented, on-chain system that uses Golang.  This is known as a first-class object model, using a class manager infrastructure.  The classes are written in Golang and are compiled as plugin shared libraries. The plugins are then dynamically loaded as needed by each peer. The class objects and ordinary objects state are all stored on the blockchain. This uses late dynamic binding.  When you send a message to an object either from a client or from other class code, message to method resolution using the class inheritance tree determines which method is run.  You can send any message to any object, although the object's class and ancestor classes may not handle the message, which just results in a not implemented error return.","username":"dbeberman","ts":"2020-09-12T18:35:06.878Z"}

{"msg":"Hello!\nI have 2 blockchains and I need to forward a transaction from, say, Blockchain 1 to Blockchain 2. The \"easiest/more logical\" way would be for the peer to forward the transaction after the endorsement (and somehow check that the invoker is some chaincode from Blockchain 1). However, this is not feasible; Thus, right now I have a NodeJS listener that forwards these transactions to Blockchain 2. However, I need to check that the transaction is indeed coming from \"Blockchain 1\" and has not been tampered (e.g., someone could send a fake transaction to Blockchain 2, that was not endorsed on Blockchain 1).\n\nI can get the Public Certificate of the transaction creator and the signature, from the transaction's response, under:\n`event.getTransactionEvent().transactionData.actions[0].payload.action.endorsements[0].endorser.id_bytes.toString()`\nand\n`event.getTransactionEvent().transactionData.actions[0].payload.action.endorsements[0].signature.toString()`\nrespectively.\nHowever, I do not know how to check the signature on the smart contract on Blockchain 2. Both blockchains are being run by the same peers, so, I could easily verify with, say, peer0 that signed the transaction on Blockchain 1, the transaction's signature on Blockchain 2.

I set an upper-bound of simultaneous connections to every open GRPC connection (e.g. 1000 concurrent users that evaluate) and when that number is reached, a new GRPC connection is created in order to serve for clients (there is of course a limit of the active connections, that is they're also bounded).\n\nI also \"sift\" every request that comes from a client. If the request is just an evaluation, I give it more \"freedom\" to join the queue, while if it is a .submit, it is a bit more restricted. i.g. every GRPC connection has a ~2/1 ratio of EVALUATIONS/SUBMITS\n(1000 concurrent requests => 700 of them will be evaluations, 300 submits).\n\nHowever,\n1.
