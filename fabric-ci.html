</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 21:55:45 GMT):<br/>
@aso there is still no known reason that depends on ci infra that causes that particular build to fail.

<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 21:56:20 GMT):<br/>
fair enough - thx, I'll dig deeper

@aso looking here at the sea of red: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/ I would guess master is broken

Hi, anyone can help look at this ci build? Seems some container cannot start, but do not show any reason. Thanks https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/6350/console
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 03:04:18 GMT):<br/>
The patchset is at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5701
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 04:17:53 GMT):<br/>
@baohua It looks like the peer container failed to start possibly due to your environment variable change. 
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 04:19:54 GMT):<br/>
`make unit-test` issues a docker-compose up command that starts a fabric-peer container and a test-env container.
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 04:20:33 GMT):<br/>
So if either container cannot be started the `make unit-test` command will fail
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 05:49:49 GMT):<br/>
@harrijk Thanks. Could u point out why it's failed? Do not see any clue. And it passed in my local server :(
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 05:56:03 GMT):<br/>
aha, know what happens, will fix it, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 08:18:49 GMT):<br/>
any news @baohua ?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 08:19:45 GMT):<br/>
about the ci error? @aso 
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 08:20:18 GMT):<br/>
yup
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 08:33:14 GMT):<br/>
Has fixed with rebasing to latest code :)
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 08:55:06 GMT):<br/>
not for me...
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 12:10:14 GMT):<br/>
so, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but... I've rebased https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5715/ on the latest ,master and it still won't build
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 12:45:50 GMT):<br/>
yes, maybe try to build locally to see if can find more clues. Sometimes, the given log has limited info.

@greg.haskins @rjones : @cbf and @mastersingh24 agreed to publish hackfest v1.0 images to hyperledger dockerhub tagged as v1.0.0-preview.

<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:52:33 GMT):<br/>
im not sure what that means, but if it involves pushing image out manually verses going through the release pipeline, I would discourage it
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:55:08 GMT):<br/>
We have release jobs to publish images based on tag but not on a specific commit.. 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:55:19 GMT):<br/>
i understand
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:55:30 GMT):<br/>
you wouldnt want to release on a commit anyway
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:55:41 GMT):<br/>
ive covered this before, but if you want to do this right:
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:55:58 GMT):<br/>
cut a branch at the commit you want, push a release CR on that branch, tag it, done
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:56:07 GMT):<br/>
thats the right way, and the way I would advise
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:56:52 GMT):<br/>
also note that the branch name should reflect that its a stream, not a tag
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:57:19 GMT):<br/>
agree.. @cbf and @mastersingh24 inputs please?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:57:38 GMT):<br/>
e.g. branch names like v1.0.0-preview and tags like v1.0.0-preview-1, v1.0.0-preview-2, etc
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:57:56 GMT):<br/>
long story short, branch name should not == tag name...tags are a subset
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:59:07 GMT):<br/>
but that said, I would also discourage releasing from that older release, much progress has been made
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:59:18 GMT):<br/>
theres a little wiggle room given "preview" name though
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:59:40 GMT):<br/>
but, for instance, I would like to see the FAB-678 support be included
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:59:52 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, those artifacts will not be that interesting to many use cases
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:01:16 GMT):<br/>
im more flexible on that, but pls do not put adhoc images out there
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:01:20 GMT):<br/>
thats really bad
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:39:13 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins may need to wait til I get settled with wifi but this image is already 'out there' just not in hyperledger org. We had to do some things to get it bootstrapped which is not in the codebase. The point is to get something in dev hands rather than waiting for 2-3 weeks.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:39:36 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 ^^
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:40:13 GMT):<br/>
i just think there is a difference between something that is "out there" and something that is available under hyperledger/fabric
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:40:47 GMT):<br/>
ideally, anything that is there can be repeatably built from source and referred back to, etc
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:41:20 GMT):<br/>
the sane way to do that is a matching tag created from a release pipeline
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:42:24 GMT):<br/>
I dont think it will be hard to produce a release from the referenced commits that @rameshthoomu is referring to
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:42:37 GMT):<br/>
so, that is how I would advise we proceed
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:50:41 GMT):<br/>
another argument would be w.r.t. $arch support, etc
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:51:07 GMT):<br/>
pushing it through the pipeline will result in a repeatable process and a full suite of images for all architectures, etc
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:51:31 GMT):<br/>
I dont think this will be hard, we have all the plumbing already in place
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:54:13 GMT):<br/>
basically, we need a list of the commits from each repo we want to release from @rameshthoomu, the agreement of what the branch/tag name should be from all of us, the creation of said branches at the commit by @rjones: and then minimally pushing the release-related CRs and tags by me
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:54:30 GMT):<br/>
(or anyone, but I am willing to drive it)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:04:37 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins : here are the commits for `fabric# c7b3fe0` and `fabric-ca# 6294c57` (commits used in hackfest images)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:05:10 GMT):<br/>
ok, phase 1 complete: phase 2 (names)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:05:25 GMT):<br/>
v1.0.0-preview branch, v1.0.0-preview-1 release tag?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:07:27 GMT):<br/>
looks good to me.. but others inputs?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:07:53 GMT):<br/>
I am working on creating ca job to publish ca images.. 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:08:34 GMT):<br/>
ok, but going forward, we should make the CI integration just be something like "make docker-release"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:08:54 GMT):<br/>
and let the local build decide what that constitutes
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:09:50 GMT):<br/>
sure I will work on that later
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:11:24 GMT):<br/>
@rjones could you please create a new repository for fabric-ca image in docker hub.. `hyperledger/fabric-ca`
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:11:27 GMT):<br/>
ok...we can make that universal across the repos
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:11:42 GMT):<br/>
yes.. 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:12:26 GMT):<br/>
but this is a good highlight why the process I mention above should be followed
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:12:43 GMT):<br/>
if fabric-ca.git needs a mod to support pushing to dockerhub, we can do it as a CR in that branch
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 18:14:18 GMT):<br/>
IOW, its very rare that a random commit-id would make a suitable release...you usually minimally need to update the version numbers, etc

also I have updated `sfhackfest` folder referring to hyperledger docker images..PS https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5617/ (WIP). Once images are published to docker hub will request for merge..

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:51:28 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu ok, we just need to agree on the branch name, have @rjones create them, and then we can start the CR process
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:51:49 GMT):<br/>
did we decide on "v1.0.0-preview"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:52:12 GMT):<br/>
(I assume only @rjones can create them)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:52:15 GMT):<br/>
maybe that is not the case
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:52:20 GMT):<br/>
any committer may create them
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:52:26 GMT):<br/>
ah, ok, my bad, sorry
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:52:42 GMT):<br/>
still need consensus on the name, though
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:52:50 GMT):<br/>
no apology required! it's confusing
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:52:59 GMT):<br/>
yeah, i might need guidance on how
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:53:10 GMT):<br/>
can I just say "refs/for/foo" to create "foo" ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:54:49 GMT):<br/>
not sure, try it in lf-sandbox? anyway, I usually do it in the UI (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/fabric-chaintool,branches for instance)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:55:05 GMT):<br/>
if you're logged in, do you see a "create branch" button?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:55:36 GMT):<br/>
I'm about 75% certain if you, as a committer, created and pushed a branch, it would show up.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:56:36 GMT):<br/>
ah, yes I do
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:56:53 GMT):<br/>
I see the button for sure...i can use that worst case
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:57:03 GMT):<br/>
ill try the refs/for method too when the time comes, just to see
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:57:12 GMT):<br/>
actually i guess I can try it against sandbox
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:58:52 GMT):<br/>
```Greg:lf-sandbox ghaskins$ git push origin HEAD:refs/for/branch-test

error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://greg.haskins@gerrit.hyperledger.org:29418/lf-sandbox'```
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:58:58 GMT):<br/>
nope, but this is actually a good thing
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:59:18 GMT):<br/>
would be easy to do something like "refs/for/mister" by accident
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 19:00:36 GMT):<br/>
but since we have a few acks for "v1.0.0-preview" and no nacks, i can just go ahead and put them through
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 19:00:44 GMT):<br/>
not like we can delete the branch later 
</p>

Discussion of fabric* repo CI
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:26:07 GMT):<br/>
hi @rjones @rameshthoomu  can we install SoftHSM lib on the fabric-sdk-node CI servers so that the pkcs11 test cases can run?
```
// To run this test case, install SoftHSM2 library at this link:
// https://wiki.opendnssec.org/display/SoftHSMDOCS/SoftHSM+Documentation+v2
// After installing the library, you need to initialize at least one token
// which will be used below. For the 'pin' property in the configuration
// object below, use the 'user PIN' value (not SO PIN) and please set it to
// '1234' so the code below can run successfully
```
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:34:20 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix what, explicitly, do I need to do to install them?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:39:18 GMT):<br/>
I don't have the exact steps documented, was following the steps here https://wiki.opendnssec.org/display/SoftHSMDOCS/SoftHSM+Documentation+v2 and i used a pre-built download rather than building from source. other than that it's pretty following the "Installing" steps verbatim with all defaults

Hi All, does someone understand why this is failing: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/6943/console ? Please, help needed.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:41:31 GMT):<br/>
Hey @adc - I really don't know what causes that error - it seems to crop up every now and then for no reason related to the actual change.  Hopefully someone on this channel can help with it
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:42:00 GMT):<br/>
let's see, thanks for the reply
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:48:28 GMT):<br/>
from tests I made, this "cannot attach to non running container" error is only a symptom and not a cause.
The real cause is that the process in the container immediately upon startup
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:49:18 GMT):<br/>
unit-tests/docker-compose.yaml : `    - CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true` toggles this from what I know
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:53:17 GMT):<br/>
I think I found the problem: I was able to isolate the following case. In that change-set I modify shim/chaincode.go to import "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/utils"
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:53:28 GMT):<br/>
if I remove that import and the calls associated 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:53:38 GMT):<br/>
the error disappears 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:53:43 GMT):<br/>
aha! 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:53:49 GMT):<br/>
if I put back in then the error appears again
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:53:55 GMT):<br/>
it is systematic. 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:54:09 GMT):<br/>
but still I don't know why that import causes the problem
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:54:11 GMT):<br/>
can you run the unit tests locally though?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:54:18 GMT):<br/>
I'm doing that 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:54:19 GMT):<br/>
maybe you have an import cycle?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:54:26 GMT):<br/>
I found that corner case locally
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:54:43 GMT):<br/>
I don't know, golang should report import cycles
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:56:25 GMT):<br/>
I think @muralisr can help here

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=JvyMRmWAwxxHLTDDe) @yacovm That is helpful for debugging chaincode problems...in this case, the problem is in the peer container
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 20:34:19 GMT):<br/>
in cases where you get that "vp_1" error in the unit tests, this is the culprit for being too quiet: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/923bf3a8e774249344b09c535b726799aec865bd/unit-test/docker-compose.yml#L3
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 20:34:35 GMT):<br/>
simply remove that line, and the peer log will present itself
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 20:34:57 GMT):<br/>
we need a JIRA to make that go to some file rather than /dev/null

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 19:34:33 GMT):<br/>
and this works when I run the UTs locally but not on jenkins

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:37:21 GMT):<br/>
something isnt happy within the jenkins environment
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:37:24 GMT):<br/>
still trying to figure it out
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:37:25 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:37:29 GMT):<br/>
it works fine locally
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:37:34 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:37:47 GMT):<br/>
heres what I dont get
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:38:11 GMT):<br/>
I use the cutils.NewDockerClient() to get a handle to dockerd, just like all our other code in dockercontroller.go
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:38:24 GMT):<br/>
(that should handle the vm.endpoint, etc, etc, correctly)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:38:45 GMT):<br/>
and on top of that, it seems like the client.CreateContainer() worked prior to the upload failure
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:39:25 GMT):<br/>
but for whatever reason, and only on jenkins, the dockerd seems to puke when I make that second call
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:40:15 GMT):<br/>
The logic is here on L153: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6167/1/core/chaincode/platforms/util/utils.go
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:40:51 GMT):<br/>
what I dont understand is I would think L137 would have failed too if it were some kind of bad connection to dockerd
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:41:37 GMT):<br/>
ill probably need help from @rjones to sort this out
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:47:32 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:54:12 GMT):<br/>
that is interesting
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:54:35 GMT):<br/>
I had seen those types of errors during development, but I fixed it with this: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6167/1/images/ccenv/Dockerfile.in
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:55:03 GMT):<br/>
Im not sure why they are still complaining after the Dockerfile was fixed, however
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:55:41 GMT):<br/>
might have to turn up the dockercontroller to DEBUG
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:59:37 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins is two hours too late - or Monday better for you?

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 21:03:12 GMT):<br/>
@rjones no problem
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 21:10:47 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr its very strange, you can see the "mkdir -p /chaincode/input" succeed
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 21:38:15 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins so tonight or Monday?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 21:38:29 GMT):<br/>
sure, works for me

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 17:52:32 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Looks like it doesnt even get to the chaincode tests, or am i missing something? ```15:51:25 ERROR: for unit-tests  Cannot start service unit-tests: Cannot link to a non running container: /unittest_vp_1 AS /unittest_unit-tests_1/vp_1```

yeah in the link- greg talks about this

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 17:53:19 GMT):<br/>
I think the best option for you now is to reverify
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 17:53:26 GMT):<br/>
did that multiple times
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 17:53:29 GMT):<br/>
but I was trying to explain the reason it happens... 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 17:53:31 GMT):<br/>
and same problem on local
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 17:53:38 GMT):<br/>
oh on local too?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 17:53:42 GMT):<br/>
so do what greg proposed then
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 17:55:07 GMT):<br/>
i thought the container wasnt even starting... what does CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true do for us?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 17:55:27 GMT):<br/>
no that was my bad, you can try to remove the log driver in his link
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 17:55:56 GMT):<br/>
@ruslan.kryukov has been troubleshooting most... do you have any specific questions Ruslan?

<p><strong>ruslan.kryukov</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 17:56:55 GMT):<br/>
No, Now I'm trying to find a reason why unit-test fails

good, okay 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 18:00:32 GMT):<br/>
@ruslan.kryukov  take a look at Greg's message in https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=wyB6WuxDeBrCSDeFh
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 18:00:48 GMT):<br/>
try it out, it perhaps will show you the cause of the peer's downfall
</p>
<p><strong>ruslan.kryukov</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 18:03:25 GMT):<br/>
nothing changed :(

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 18:04:40 GMT):<br/>
@ruslan.kryukov I got the same error when I run your patch but after remove all the existing containers it's working for me.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 18:05:22 GMT):<br/>
can you try make unit-test after removing `vp` and `unit-test` containers 
</p>
<p><strong>ruslan.kryukov</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 18:15:39 GMT):<br/>
I've found failed test

                                                   grep -v /bddtests/ | \
```

just change the sed command to skip the first to whatever passed last and it will resume.. (though.. it would be great to learn that there is a better way)

CI on Z is failing again on https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6335/
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-z/3036/ : FAILURE

It has been very unreliable.
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:25:24 GMT):<br/>
@bihn I will ask the providers of the z machines to provide me with dedicated cpus... what has been happening is that when the previous build is being deleted, the steal time for the z Linux machine increasing dramatically which elongates the delete operation and thus causes timeouts on the Jenkins end.

@rameshthoomu An idea I had.. a number of times I have found it very difficult to track down the build failure messages in the jenkins log.. could we insert some eyecatches in the build script after the make finished running? 
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 16:31:15 GMT):<br/>
something easy, say add 20 '\n'
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 16:32:35 GMT):<br/>
i.e. the error you were just helping me with.. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-ca-verify-ppc64le/241/console.. the actual error is burried in the text:

```
07:10:13 vendor/github.com/miekg/pkcs11/pkcs11.go:29:18: fatal error: ltdl.h: No such file or directory
07:10:13 compilation terminated.

```
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 16:33:41 GMT):<br/>
(while we are at it.. I find it 'impressive' that nobody taught jenkins to render VT100 3-bit color scheme!! would be nice to have logs in color :( )

@binhn I am working with the LinuxONE cloud folks to resolve the CPU resource shortage issue.  For now let's go to a non-voting mode for fabric z jobs.
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 14:27:14 GMT):<br/>
When the CPU resource shortage is resolved, we'll go back to having z vote for the fabric jobs.

It is essential to have z as a voting member.  There have been countless CRs that have broken z.

@rameshthoomu only hyperledger is mapped to go path- Evidently someone fixed that in vagrant to include local dev- but not visible in CLI container..it's a barrier that really needs to gotten rid of I think- do we think this is obsoleted by chaincode builder that Greg Built? the issue is #2587

user has to mount his chaincode path to CLI container so that it chaincode will be available for executing in CLI.. @greg.haskins any inputs?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 18:03:50 GMT):<br/>
personally, i would not encourage running the CLI from within docker
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 18:04:06 GMT):<br/>
I think its awkward for our users
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 18:04:48 GMT):<br/>
but, if I were going to, I would perhaps use something like "-v`pwd`:/mnt -w /mnt" so I had local code available
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 18:05:33 GMT):<br/>
this is probably compounded by GOPATH requirements and CLI-in-docker awkwardness and GOLANG chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 18:05:43 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest using native CLI and chaintool ;)

I think the best option is to add -o option to `peer node start`
well I should say "another option"
and use it only with testchainid
@C0rWin what do you think ?

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 21:56:38 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin what do you think ?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 21:58:07 GMT):<br/>
Well, from the error message it looks like this has nothing to do with ordering service endpoints?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:00:37 GMT):<br/>
There is no obvious error on the peer side https://jpst.it/UH4G
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:02:48 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin the problem I think is that peer is started to use testchainID and the config block tries to reach orderer in 127.0.0.1:7050

<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:05:08 GMT):<br/>

Which brings things back to the original question I posed: I've created a new foo.configtx file but I'm not sure what needs to be done on the config block side of things. I can generate it without a problem but it's unclear what to do so the javasdk tests use it.
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:19:24 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=pD6rGZyyBTPirWJmM) @rickr this won't help, the problem here is opposite, the peer cannot reach the ordering service
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:19:35 GMT):<br/>
and least this is a working hypothesis right now
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:20:23 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=u9jxsoJ9y4Kz8T7BD) @wlahti have you tried to ask this on #fabric-sdk-java ?
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:21:14 GMT):<br/>
It was suggested by the group to discuss that here. 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:22:15 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:22:25 GMT):<br/>
but need someone familiar w/ java sdk, no?
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:22:59 GMT):<br/>
Right, that would be @rickr or @tuand 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:23:17 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti I don't think we are getting that far with the very latest build ...  currently we don't install chain code at all and we don't use configtx file
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:23:33 GMT):<br/>
at that point
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:24:07 GMT):<br/>
you are using `testchainid`, right?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:24:15 GMT):<br/>
y
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:24:20 GMT):<br/>
got it
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:24:28 GMT):<br/>
need to look on it
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:24:51 GMT):<br/>
not sure the problem is w/ ordering service endpoint configuration 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:25:12 GMT):<br/>
I can add an option to override it for testchainid
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:26:32 GMT):<br/>
the scenario is this we use testchained to install chaincode. Then we instantiate invoke and query all on the testchain .. Then we go another pass where we create a chain `foo`  instantiate invoke and query on that chain   
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:26:58 GMT):<br/>
so... just uh, a thought- is this testchainid going to be deprecated at some point?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:28:16 GMT):<br/>
hope so
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:28:32 GMT):<br/>
my guess it's here only to support SDK part
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:28:46 GMT):<br/>
once SDK will be able to work with configuration block it will be out of use

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:45:09 GMT):<br/>
I wouldn't expect "No ordering service endpoint..."
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:45:30 GMT):<br/>
maybe I'm not reading the code right...
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:50:11 GMT):<br/>
```		chainID := util.GetTestChainID()

		// add readers, writers and admin policies for the default chain
		policyTemplate := configtx.NewSimpleTemplate(
			policies.TemplateImplicitMetaAnyPolicy([]string{application.GroupKey}, msp.ReadersPolicyKey),
			policies.TemplateImplicitMetaAnyPolicy([]string{application.GroupKey}, msp.WritersPolicyKey),
			policies.TemplateImplicitMetaMajorityPolicy([]string{application.GroupKey}, msp.AdminsPolicyKey),
		)

		// We create a genesis block for the test
		// chain with its MSP so that we can transact
		block, err := genesis.NewFactoryImpl(
			configtx.NewCompositeTemplate(
				test.ApplicationOrgTemplate(),
				policyTemplate)).Block(chainID)
		if nil != err {

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:50:31 GMT):<br/>
no one configures here endpoints as far as I can see from the code

unless it's done in other place

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 23:20:33 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin so we need to add "-o" option ?

just got back to this... CLI also fails with latest when using `peer node start` ... (for some reason I thought it worked) so @C0rWin it does appear we need to add the "-o" option ... till we remove testchainid...

FYI So I changed my end2end test to use two created chains .. not the test chain.  The e2e test just interacts with one orderer and peer.  I start this in vagrant naively (no docker)  runs to completion no issues.   Now when I submit to gerrit the verify job fails.  There is a timeout on sending the instantiate proposal .. two min timeout is set .

is that what I mentioned with how the genesis block is created with 127.0.0.1 addresses 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Sat, 04 Mar 2017 13:51:29 GMT):<br/>
Our config has not changed verify build was working.  The addresses were reachable for installing and send the initiate proposoal . The timeout occured waiting for the eventhub to send us the block with the transaction id as completed 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Sat, 04 Mar 2017 13:53:22 GMT):<br/>
FYI need to be away for couple of hours ..  This is either the issue above with genesis block having 127.. addresses or another bug server side issue 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Sat, 04 Mar 2017 13:55:13 GMT):<br/>
There was also no connection error for sending the transaction to the Orderer

a quick status update - (1) end to end tests with channel create/join works (2) using testchainid (ie, starting without `--peer-defaultchainid` as in `peer node start` works in non-docker (for example, vagrant) environments where orderer is reachable on 127.0.0.1 (3) using testchainid in docker needs a orderer-endpoint info to be supplied and is being worked under https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6821/

<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Sat, 04 Mar 2017 22:24:25 GMT):<br/>
Not sure how we want to proceed but moved off soon deprecated `testchaiId`  and once I fixed configtx block as I pointed to as not being right java sdk is creating and joining peers 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 04 Mar 2017 22:25:29 GMT):<br/>
I think using channel bar is a better test than using `testchainid`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 04 Mar 2017 22:26:31 GMT):<br/>
the fact we ran into trouble with the later was not due to a bug but just that it was tailored for dev envs than docker/CI

@rameshthoomu, @weeds - Do we have docker-composer file which uses couch-db as state-ledger for the latest build (4th March). SF Hackfest images were supported with couch-db and since our work is centric with couch-db, we would like to have it.

<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Sun, 05 Mar 2017 21:12:29 GMT):<br/>
is it related to certificate inside channel configuration?

Not really sure why PEER is expecting MSP ID as DEFAULT that is wrong . some thing went wrong in the process

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 05 Mar 2017 21:14:32 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde what changes you have made to the existing setup with the new images?
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Sun, 05 Mar 2017 21:16:34 GMT):<br/>
1. I am using https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/examples/e2e_cli
2. Next changed the image tag in docker-composer.yaml to use 4th March fabric-images for orderer, peer and cli.
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Sun, 05 Mar 2017 21:18:03 GMT):<br/>
do u want me to print env from any container?

<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Sun, 05 Mar 2017 21:25:27 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde Can you share your docker-compose file ? 
If you haven't modified any thing else it should work , I am curious to know if it is any thing to do with docker-compose 
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Sun, 05 Mar 2017 21:26:47 GMT):<br/>

Could you check why the `image: rameshthoomu/fabric-peer-x86_64:x86_64-0.7.0-snapshot-509d8ed` is misising in your base file
</p>

If this doesn't work probably we would need add corresponding cli image as well to match with the TAG

not exactly the same .. but with some tweaks

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 05 Mar 2017 21:36:16 GMT):<br/>
ok try this in docker-compose

Any suggestion Jim?

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 06 Mar 2017 03:45:30 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu the library initialization needs to be done before the test could run, so it needs to be part of the CI job build step. The failure above was from the fix that @jjjjibm Uploaded which apparently achieved its purpose of finding the right libpath for the CI environment but failed at the next step of trying to login using the lib
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 06 Mar 2017 03:48:55 GMT):<br/>
@ManjeetGambhir The error is caused by the signing identity using the wrong msp id (has been using the value "DEFAULT"), I believe Rick is looking at this issue right now and we were just chatting about this today
</p>
<p><strong>ManjeetGambhir</strong> (Mon, 06 Mar 2017 03:49:14 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @jimthematrix

@rickr when do you think, fix will be available for above error?

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 06 Mar 2017 12:57:51 GMT):<br/>
Hi Manjeet, the test that we finally got to run over the weekend was the standard create initial configuration, isntall and instantiate chaincode, and exercise chaincode using the default MSP Id with fabric_CA, we have not gotten to the next step of looking at the CA that comes from a different vendor.  The other thing that still has to be done is a 2nd orderer has to come in.  Can we work with what we have today until Rick and Jim get the appropriate fixes in?

@weeds Sharon, Rahul has taken images provided by @rameshthoomu on Saturday and we are using all default setting and running fabric , fabric ca and all supporting images and getting above error by sdk
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 06 Mar 2017 13:27:47 GMT):<br/>
@ManjeetGambhir  From the error it appears the sdk is sending an MSPID of DEFAULT which is all we support at the moment.   AFAIK the setup we've run against the Fabric (Peer) has only ever expected "DEFAULT" .  Not sure why in your setup this is different. May help to get peer logs for this too 
</p>
<p><strong>ManjeetGambhir</strong> (Mon, 06 Mar 2017 13:32:03 GMT):<br/>
@rickr if you look ,same error @rahulhegde posted for cli, when tested the images inside environmet.and @rameshthoomu helped him.can you please check @rameshthoomu as well. I saw peer logs but no exception. Will post you the peer logs soon
</p>

@jimthematrix, I can't find the old joblog now, but when I read it Saturday, it seemed it could not find any library.  I just pushed some inspection rework into Gerrit so I will soon have a new joblog to look at.

3. Can I get the documentation for ` -P "OR('Org0MSP.member','Org1MSP.member')" ` sent as part of chaincode instantiate? 

Should the instantiation fails with -P AND (a replace for OR) option if the chaincode is not installed on one of the organization?

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 06 Mar 2017 22:32:40 GMT):<br/>
 docs / source / endorsement-policies.rst has documentation on endorsement policies
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 06 Mar 2017 22:33:17 GMT):<br/>
I'd expect to validation to fail if you required 2 signatures but sent TX with only one endorsement

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 06 Mar 2017 22:34:02 GMT):<br/>
-P on instantiate basically says "all invokes to this instantiated chaincode on this channel should use this policy"
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 06 Mar 2017 22:34:30 GMT):<br/>
(so there's no per-invoke  policy)

Q1: I will be good if I just use the docker-composer specifying the couch-db node/service addition (like couchdb0) (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6947/3/examples/e2e_cli/docker-compose.yaml) which is similar to SF-Hackfest Images docker-composer file?

Q2: I have the 4th March Fabric-CI Docker-Image; Do I need to update my Fabric-Images, is there any code dependency post-4th March. Can you please check/confirm with Dave?

Q3: You to mention about the security changes - what are these addition?

@rahulhegde Q1: yes, if, in the docker-compose file,  you add the couch containers and add the necessary environmentr variables  in peer, you should be good to go. In other words, you can uncomment all the comments from 6947 patchset docker-compose file and it should work. You will have to to `make couchdb` though as a part of prerequisite.

Oh I didn't see ` make couchdb ` - can I use the klaemo/couchdb which was used as part of SF Hackfest?
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:02:12 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde We recommend using the fabric-couchdb, its pretty similar to klaemo-couchDB with some extra configs for security and compatibility
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:18:23 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=9tmdwhGNdR4xPKoD9) @AdnanC - Not sure of the response - however we always wait on the fabric-CI channel to provide images. Looks like this might now take some more time, if Klaemo/couch image is not compatible.
May be if you can add a note on compatibility with klaemo/couch-db (1 more point to be discussed with Dave?). 

Let us know Dave' view on the compatibility with th March Fabric-CI image - Point 2.
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:26:46 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde I will talk with @rameshthoomu on means of providing the fabric-couchdb image. Fabric has been using the fabric-couchdb instead of klaemo-couchdb for unit-testing, and the fabric developer tools will also use fabric-couchdb moving forward (change waiting to get merged). And I will get reconfitmation from Dave.  
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:36:24 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde Latest updates should be compatible with March 4th (although we cant guarantee compatibility with prior images in general, in this case it looks ok)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:36:52 GMT):<br/>
You can use either klaemo-couchdb or fabric-couchdb, there is no significant difference
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 16:37:37 GMT):<br/>
some minor config differences, you should get slightly better performance on fabric-couchdb, but both are equally functinoal

Q: This should be couch-db question but if you can help - when we define a index, what's the use of sort field in it?  

1 thing - that came during my test - please check if this has to be recorded as defect - whenever a non-existance DesignDocument or IndexName is supplied to the Peer CLI query, the transaction time's out.

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 10:42:00 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Hi Gari- I know you were looking at the TLS stuff- Any chance you saw the problem on E2E CLi- or did that get fixed with the latest check in last night?  Just curious
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 10:42:18 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 10:43:28 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:09:34 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=NaiyKfsWc46bx2P3i) @mastersingh24 
GM Gari - Is there one who can assist in resolving this issue.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:17:07 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde  - I'm not sure how you are setting things up - but perhaps you are using a "block" generated with a prior version of tool to bootstrap the orderer?   
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:43:29 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin I would welcome another architecture
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:44:18 GMT):<br/>
the only real requirement from my perspective is that someone sponsor a set of workers for jenkins that are reliable/fast enough 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:44:44 GMT):<br/>
all of the base* images are built from fabric-baseimage.git
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:44:51 GMT):<br/>
just do "make docker" in that repo
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:49:32 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin do note that "make docker" tries to publish the resulting images to dockerhub...use "make docker-local" for a variant that does everything _except_ publish
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:50:26 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins  - one question - I was trying to figure out where you actually set the base bits for the images - I guess really I'm asking where is moby linux coming from?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:50:47 GMT):<br/>
moby?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:51:07 GMT):<br/>
in baseos?  I know the Docker for Mac uses it as the underlying VM
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:51:35 GMT):<br/>
when I `docker exec` into say fabric-peer I see root@moby
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:51:41 GMT):<br/>
not sure how moby factors in, but our baseimage is just based on ubuntu 16.04 (for x86, anyway)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:51:58 GMT):<br/>
i think the Z/P folks swapped that out for something else in the debian family
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:52:41 GMT):<br/>
actually - sorry - I think that was for the chaincode containers
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:52:49 GMT):<br/>
thats weird...the docker-for-mac environment must be setting PS1 or something
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:53:06 GMT):<br/>
yeah - that's what I am thinking
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:53:27 GMT):<br/>
I'll investigate in my copious spare time  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:53:29 GMT):<br/>
in any case, if you use an upstream build on x86, you are getting ubuntu 16.04 in the containers
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 12:53:47 GMT):<br/>
"baseos" is just a minimal install

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=HqrccY6iszrvuQYA8) @greg.haskins I guess my question is, what is the next steps once I've tested images for ARM locally?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:07:53 GMT):<br/>
basically, you need to work with the CI folks like @rjones @jwagantall @rameshthoomu to get ARM builders added to the jenkins worker cluster and also to add ARM to the ci-management JJBs
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:08:33 GMT):<br/>
also, if there ends up being changes that you need (for instance, to fabric-baseimage), you can just submit those as normal CRs and I can review them
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:09:33 GMT):<br/>
hopefully they are minimal but there are slight variances between X/P/Z so I wouldnt be surprised if ARM has slightly different requirements as well
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:11:19 GMT):<br/>
my general attitude is: I would encourage the platform author(s) to stay as close to the x86 base as possible, but ultimately I dont care as long as you are willing to support it and don't break x86 in the process.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:11:36 GMT):<br/>
one thing to keep in mind is that downstream users _will_ expect "apt-get" to work
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:11:59 GMT):<br/>
so you are best staying debian/ubuntu centric, else you will open up a whole different can of worms
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:13:45 GMT):<br/>
(honestly, we probably need to address the whole reliance on "apt-get" thing...but that is a whole different problem
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:14:22 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:14:47 GMT):<br/>
For now I've just changed the initial platform image w/o any additional changes and looks like I'm able to build it on my RPi device
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:15:01 GMT):<br/>
very cool
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:15:24 GMT):<br/>
looks like we need an RPi cluster for LF and we are good to go ;)
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:15:48 GMT):<br/>
>I know folks have expressed interest in making the distro choice configurable
^^^ Is there a way to specify platform for base image I'd like to build locally? with `make docker-local`?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:16:06 GMT):<br/>
its just standard dockerfile stuff
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:16:24 GMT):<br/>
theres not a parameter to the build though, no
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:18:13 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 17:03:53 GMT):<br/>
completely untested/WIP at the moment, I just wanted to get it out there since there is activity surrounding alternate docker repos
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 17:05:09 GMT):<br/>
the gist of it is, it would be possible to do something like "DOCKER_NS=myrepo:2343 make docker" and the entire build will be reconfigured to produce images/binaries that use that new namespace
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 17:05:35 GMT):<br/>
e.g. myrepo:2345/fabric-peer instead of hyperledger/fabric-peer
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 17:06:04 GMT):<br/>
i would guess this would be of use to QA/CI primarily

<p><strong>bmos299</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 17:15:09 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins @rameshthoomu @binhn @markparz @weeds I have created: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2764 for publishing images to the community when the CI passes the e2e test with and w/o tls. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 19:01:42 GMT):<br/>
@bmos299 and team - A lot of people have been asking how they can try CouchDB.  I'd like to get the CouchDB docker extensions to e2e in there prior to publish.  Please review: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7097/.   You'll see that the docker compose is extended with optional (commented out) CouchDB statements.  Initially we were going to have a 2nd docker compose for CouchDB enabled environments, but dual maintenance and keeping them in sync looked like it was going to be an issue, therefore we went with the optional/comments approach.  I'm open to ideas though.

These images are loaded on VM and VM does not have internet connection.
After starting all services. We deployed the chaincode on peer0 and ran following command in CLI container
CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peer/peer0/localMspConfig CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0:7051 CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org0MSP peer chaincode instantiate -o 172.21.0.2:7050 -C a2bcls -n example04 -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example04 -c '{"Args":["init","eventid","100"]}' -P "OR('Org0MSP.member','Org1MSP.member')"

But getting below error:-
Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = 2 desc = Error starting container: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)

Please advice.

Hi All,
I've been trying to locally build Fabric v1. The code I pulled from github mentions this in the makefile [BASE_VERSION = 0.7.0].
So, is there code that reflects the BASE_VERSION as 1.0.0 ? If yes, where/how do I download that?

Thanks!

@rameshthoomu Hello Ramesh, I really appreciate the messages you post in here with the docker tags, and the commit levels for the various repositories-  the last such message of which you posted on March 10.   I just went out to your repo on DockerHub and saw that there have been several more recent versions for each of these repos.  Am I safe to infer that since you have not published a similar message in here listing new commit levels, that these more recent versions have not passed whatever set of tests you or others have decided are necessary to pass before you put in an update here?   Generally speaking, when working with Fabric v1.0, I've settled into a groove of working at the commit levels that you've last posted in here.   
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 13:22:19 GMT):<br/>
@silliman I post images with commit levels in #fabric-ci channel only after successfully execute end-to-end tests. today if you see x86_64 CI job passed all tests and published images whereas s390x and power jobs are failed to execute node (e2e) job. Looking into these build failures now.. After successful e2e tests on all platforms will post images with commit levels.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 13:25:29 GMT):<br/>
Will post new set of images in sometime.. s390x and power jobs are in-progress. 
</p>
<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 13:29:31 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Thanks Ramesh, that's what I thought but wanted to make sure-  today was the first time I peeked at your repos up on DockerHub and when I saw the newer tags I wanted to make sure.  I typically just either *git clone* to a new environment or *git pull* to update an existing environment and then I'll *git checkout* to your most recently posted commit levels when stability is my goal. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 13:32:49 GMT):<br/>
sure that is right way to do.. But if you are working on x86 environment pls use latest images published today..

end2end (CLI), (NODE), (JAVA) tests are worked as expected on below commits:

`===> FABRIC# - fa3d88c ===> FABRIC CA# - b587a48 ===> FABRIC SDK NODE# - dfaba4f  ===> FABRIC SDK JAVA - 38516f0`

```
hyperledger/fabric-orderer:x86_64-1.0.0-alpha
hyperledger/fabric-peer:x86_64-1.0.0-alpha
hyperledger/fabric-javaenv:x86_64-1.0.0-alpha

@jtrayfield no.. You just have to add above tag to the existing image reference in docker-compose file..

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 18 Mar 2017 00:30:55 GMT):<br/>
@ZionTam so many new functionality added after sfhackfest and the commands and code is not compatible with alpha images.. to explore more on new functionality please see this https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/examples/e2e_cli

or consider moving already generated files `ordere.block` and `channel.tx` to directory `crypto/orderer`
 when you run manually you would need to do this manually. `network_setup.sh` will do all these things for you. Please look at the script for more details

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 19:19:46 GMT):<br/>
redundancy is the piece which makes it appear to never fail.  so from that perspective I'll agree

also - why do fabric jobs only run against x86?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 20:56:54 GMT):<br/>
ah there was a time when they ran against both
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 20:56:57 GMT):<br/>
but it got cancelled
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 20:57:26 GMT):<br/>
because we were very pressed to deliver everything for alpha ;)

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 20:58:16 GMT):<br/>
I assume it was a temporary thing, but you know how temporary changes tend to stay for a long time
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 21:02:24 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm also, IIRC, the z jobs used to fail dues to some file system permissions thing periodically
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 21:02:53 GMT):<br/>
I don't remember the reason but I remember that they did fail w.h.p 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 21:05:02 GMT):<br/>
Wait, actually maybe I'm wrong @muralisr ? I remember we removed *voting*, but did we really remove the Z jobs entirely? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 21:05:17 GMT):<br/>
@harrijk  do you remember anything?
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 21:06:19 GMT):<br/>
The z jobs are running in silent mode (no voting) for fabric
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 21:07:32 GMT):<br/>
the file system permissions issue hopefully has now been resolved after the merging of CR 6905

I've found that I can install different chaincodes on two peers in the same channel(same chaincode names) last week. 
</p>
<p><strong>fennelD7</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 00:42:19 GMT):<br/>
Then we found out that the chaincode container and image were not up really, invoke functions were able to issue, query functions returned no responses. 
</p>
<p><strong>fennelD7</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 01:22:34 GMT):<br/>
Well, in my test just now, Images/Containers were up, invoke functions are working well.
Instantiation is the key! botn chaincodes installed successfully, then all peers execute the instantiated one.
</p>
<p><strong>fennelD7</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 04:41:56 GMT):<br/>
In my new test, chaincode installed on peer0 always succeed. No matter what sequence they were installed and instantiated. I think this might be a bug. Started a jira with my logs in it, https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2888

Hi there - I'm interested in the performance of the consensus-algorithms used in hyperledger/fabric. I managed to set up 100 nodes on docker using the scripts from https://github.com/yeasy/docker-compose-files/tree/master/hyperledger/1.0, but now I'm stuck because I have to re-compile for other consensus-algorithms. Are there any pointers that I could use?

@vpaprots I ran "make all" passed fine and also the latest build passed. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-ca-verify-ppc64le/453/

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 20:34:48 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu can you update the node SDK CI's that runs the test/fixtures/docker-compose.yaml so that it does "make couchdb" in addition to "make docker" in fabric? I just uploaded https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7555/ that switches from "couchdb" image to "fabric-couchdb" image, but that image is not being produced by "make docker", must run "make couchdb"
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 21:00:03 GMT):<br/>
will submit that change now.. in node-sdk, we are building images using `make peer-docker` and `make order-docker`.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 21:00:30 GMT):<br/>
I will change this to `make docker` and it should build couchdb image aswell. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 21:16:31 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix I have submitted patch.. will re-test #7555 after merge CI patch.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 21:43:28 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 30 Mar 2017 14:13:21 GMT):<br/>
@crazybit only difference between dev and non-dev mode is who manages the chaincode startup ... in dev mode the user starts the chaincode and attaches to the peer while in non dev mode the peer launches the chaincode. All other flows remain same

Hi @greg.haskins ran into a strange issue, orderer binary wont start inside docker.. but the native one is just fine..
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Fri, 07 Apr 2017 16:52:52 GMT):<br/>
spent sone time tracking things down.. do you know who added this:

```
DOCKER_GO_LDFLAGS += -linkmode external -extldflags '-static -lpthread'
```
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 07 Apr 2017 16:53:09 GMT):<br/>

I've noticed that our Jira server does not pick up git commits from the fabric-sdk-java repository. This means that unless we manually add a link to the code review, there is no automatic link between the issue and the commit (which leads to the code review)

@sanchezl when I look here https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3064 , for instance, it looks like it is picking up git commits

@rjones @rameshthoomu the fabric-sdk-node verifying jobs have been behaving strangely in the last two weeks, in about half of the x84_64 builds we saw REQUEST_TIMEOUT on a synchronous request from the SDK to the endorser peers (the timeout is already set to 30s), often times the problem corrects itself after a reverify (or two)
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 23:16:57 GMT):<br/>
on top of that the s390 build has consistently demonstrated the REQUEST_TIMEOUT and has never been successful
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 23:18:29 GMT):<br/>
(actually I take it back, in the latest build #302 s390 actually succeeded, for the first time in a long time: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-s390x/)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 23:46:51 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix Node tests are failing past few days with this error https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3008
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 23:47:44 GMT):<br/>
this issue has been fixed today.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 23:50:59 GMT):<br/>
from now on if any failure related to REQUEST_Timeout will check.. Also, @harrijk worked on s390x build failures..
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 03:01:33 GMT):<br/>
Not see that with the java sdk 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 15:47:44 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I've noticed that the docker images you publish haven't been updated for a couple of days, but a change in the node-sdk that was published to npm today means that it doesn't work with the images on docker. Would it be possible to get them updated ? Also noticed that the most recent image isn't tagged 'latest'. As I have found these docker images invaluable for testing the continual change of the v1.0 release cycle.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 15:54:37 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel yes we are seeing node and java end-to-end tests are failing.. Looking into the test failures.. Will publish once all tests work as expected
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 15:55:38 GMT):<br/>
Release job trigger build push only after all tests (end-to-end tests) works as expected.. 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:02:40 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu thanks for the update. Is there a reason why latest tag points to images 16 days ago yet there are newer images on docker hub ?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:03:15 GMT):<br/>
which docker hub you are referring?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:31:37 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu about the request timeout errors I mentioned above, it's still happening unpredictably, in this CR https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7909/ the s390 was green but x86_64 experienced the timeout
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:36:35 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix @rameshthoomu given that successful jobs take no more than 20 minutes we should probably lower the timeout on https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-s390x/buildTimeTrend
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:37:18 GMT):<br/>
job 310 has been "finished" for almost 20 minutes
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:47:15 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I'm just wondering about that, https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-x86_64/841/console, it's been stuck in that state where the build is done but not returning for a long time
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:47:49 GMT):<br/>
I can kill both of them
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:47:54 GMT):<br/>
if you like
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:53:59 GMT):<br/>
would killing them cause them to fail? if not yes please
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:56:07 GMT):<br/>
they will fail but I can retrigger them
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:56:16 GMT):<br/>
I mean, they're going to fail eventually
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:57:16 GMT):<br/>
so I still don't understand why they are stuck like that even though the tests are complete?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:58:34 GMT):<br/>
my guess is the job was blocking on something else
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:59:05 GMT):<br/>
https://logs.hyperledger.org/jobbuilder/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-1/fabric-sdk-node-verify-s390x/310/console-timestamp.log.gz looks different than what I saw before, so killing the test caused a bunch of spew in the logs
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:00:17 GMT):<br/>
wrong log, this is the one I was looking at before: https://logs.hyperledger.org/jobbuilder/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-1/fabric-sdk-node-verify-x86_64/841/console-timestamp.log.gz
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:29:55 GMT):<br/>
in the latest build it's doing that again, seems like whatever the post-test steps are (guess it's collecting logs and publishing them somewhere?) they are taking longer than the build/test themselves: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-s390x/312/console
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:32:50 GMT):<br/>
log collecting only and publishing only takes about 90 seconds, usually
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:33:23 GMT):<br/>
and I don't think that's it, since when I cancel the build, it does the collection/publishing at that time
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:35:48 GMT):<br/>
mysterious...
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:40:33 GMT):<br/>

@rameshthoomu do you plan to mark them as latest as I was hoping to have a script that could always pull the latest version that you publish for testing
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 21:57:49 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel there really can't be a latest
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 21:58:35 GMT):<br/>
I see that is not the case
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 22:03:43 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel I publish images with snapshot tag but not with latest tag.. We have script to pull images from hyperledger docker hub and tag it as latest https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/download-dockerimages.sh
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 22:08:45 GMT):<br/>

23:26:18 Build timed out (after 120 minutes). Marking the build as failed.```
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 02:15:06 GMT):<br/>

@jimthematrix @rameshthoomu @jwagantall I am out for the next three days, but I will outline how I would debug this. I would publish this job directly to sandbox and make sure it repros. then, I would ask @harrijk to add your key to the machine in sandbox and ssh in to it. Check to see which processes are running _before_ a build, _during_ the build, and _once the build is hung_. I'm willing to bet there is a child process that is wedged. then look in to _why_ the child process gets spawned.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 11:07:13 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix @rameshthoomu @jwagantall since this is recent behavior, and all of the tests are local, to me it rules out anything at our hosting provider. That it is only happening to this one project leads me to think it is a recent change _in this project_ causing the issue.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 11:12:02 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix @rameshthoomu also, that the issue reproduces on the Z systems as well as X rules out hosting issues
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 11:59:44 GMT):<br/>
@rjones your analysis makes sense to me, I'm starting to think the same. will see if we can reproduce on local machines first
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 12:11:24 GMT):<br/>
OK
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 13:47:31 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix I have tested in power machine and able to reproduce this issue
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 13:47:50 GMT):<br/>
yes i can reproduce it locally as well
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 13:48:11 GMT):<br/>

I think this is more up to the card vendors to support Ubuntu. And then support various versions. I think they would have to, but often its RHEL for enterprise and the default tested platform for the vendors
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 16:50:00 GMT):<br/>
the issue is also that fabric itself now becomes 'based on an OS'
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 16:52:14 GMT):<br/>
hmm.. that said.. flipping my hats, speaking for IBM crypto card.. the pkcs11 opencryptoki library and the linux ap driver.. thats all open source
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 16:53:05 GMT):<br/>
RHEL packages opencryptoki from sourceforge into RPMs
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 16:54:52 GMT):<br/>
and it looks like ubuntu does too: http://packages.ubuntu.com/yakkety/opencryptoki

@rameshthoomu another topic, right now the SDK builds always build fabric images from scratch, which on average takes 30min or so, which the SDK tests themselves take only 3-5min. can this be streamlined such that the fabric merge builds publishes to a private docker registry and for the SDK builds to pull from there? it'll speed up the builds dramatically
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:47:59 GMT):<br/>
yes we can do that.. but I see few concerns.. 1) when we trigger node-sdk patch, it has to pull latest commit images from docker hub.. 2) will see how much time it will take to push and pull images from docker hub..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:48:43 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest create JIRA task and we can discuss and get input on this.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:48:44 GMT):<br/>
fabric-baseimage takes a while
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:48:48 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:49:26 GMT):<br/>
should actually have that and fabric-baseos built into the VM
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:49:31 GMT):<br/>
will create a JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:50:35 GMT):<br/>
ok will look into this.. 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:52:51 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 15:52:10 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I'll move the discussion to the fabric-ci channel.... many of the fabric CI Verifications are failing due to timeout in the last day. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 15:52:13 GMT):<br/>
Here's a good example of a timeout that just happened:
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/10069/console
```15:10:40 unit-tests_1  | ?   	github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/scc	[no test files]

15:13:07 unit-tests_1  | ok  	github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/scc/escc	0.163s	coverage: 84.6% of statements
15:14:34 unit-tests_1  | ok  	github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/scc/lscc	0.662s	coverage: 80.2% of statements

15:17:26 Build timed out (after 120 minutes). Marking the build as failed.```
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 17:31:05 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  looking into it.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 17:32:44 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix Is this change good for fixing the timeouts? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8319/ I believe we have some verification issues :(
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 17:37:05 GMT):<br/>
in general, more unit-tests have been introduced into the code and will continue the next few weeks, so we either increase the timeout or look to reduce the tests that take the most of time. Of course the better solution is to have faster build env 
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 17:38:30 GMT):<br/>
@simsc if we are looking to increase coverage, we need to fix the build env 
</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 17:53:51 GMT):<br/>
yes, just talking to ramesh, he can post an update
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 17:54:00 GMT):<br/>
@binhn will increase timeout to 180 or 240 mins as a temporary fix.. 
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 17:57:01 GMT):<br/>
yes, temporary fix.  Let's make sure that it doesn't stay permanent; otherwise, that'd only prolong the inevitable death of the process
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:14:01 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall yes this has to fix node sdk timeout issues.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:14:25 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=pSboEh4vAuxt78sLJ) @jwagantall yes this has to fix node-sdk build timeout issues.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:15:06 GMT):<br/>
now we are hitting build timeout issues while running fabric unit-tests.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:19:18 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @jimthematrix  can we revert https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7909 and merge it back once https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8319 is ready? 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:19:50 GMT):<br/>
that way we can at least fix sdk 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:46:35 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @harrijk Can we enable some of the offline nodes? hyp-z-linuxnode?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:47:47 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall If this is regarding build timeout errors I see z nodes are completing unit-tests average 48 mins.
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=FEAgYreeLCCv8BjXz) @jwagantall reverting 7909 won't fix the build breaks. 3 separate fixes are needed, i've submitted an update to https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8011/ that has all 3 fixes
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 19:10:35 GMT):<br/>
however we are currently blocked by @mastersingh24 updating https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8349
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 19:11:59 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @jimthematrix I see he was working on it today actively ..
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 20:21:33 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall My plan is to fully replace the offline set of z minions with the 10 z minions that are currently online.  There are stability issues with the z minions that are currently offline.  Eventually, I'd like the offline z minions removed/deleted from production (we'll keep -13) online to the sandbox.
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 20:27:20 GMT):<br/>
Since bringing the new z minions online, they have performed very well.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 20:31:06 GMT):<br/>
@harrijk @jwagantall move this discussion to #ci-pipeline 
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 20:46:03 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu will do.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 22:16:34 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu there are two urgent fixes to unit tests available:
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8399/
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8391/
But due to today's test infrastructure issues they aren't getting a CI job of their own.  Could you (or another CI power user) prioritize these so that they can get merged, which will improve overall CI health.

@rameshthoomu when I need to push an 1.0.0-alpha fix in node SDK, how does the CI job know what's the corresponding fabric and fabric-ca commit levels it should clone?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 28 Apr 2017 17:25:56 GMT):<br/>
```17:06:41 + git clone ssh://hyperledger-jobbuilder@gerrit.hyperledger.org:29418/fabric-ca /w/workspace/fabric-sdk-node-verify-x86_64/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 28 Apr 2017 17:26:23 GMT):<br/>
this is the output of @sstone1 fix for the alpha: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8727
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 28 Apr 2017 17:33:37 GMT):<br/>
got it: 
```git log -1
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 28 Apr 2017 17:34:12 GMT):<br/>
so it'll always get the master HEAD. this obviously won't work with alpha fixes
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 28 Apr 2017 17:34:57 GMT):<br/>
you could change the script to change branches, but this way madness lies

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 28 Apr 2017 18:43:46 GMT):<br/>
need to set a timeout on those builds
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 28 Apr 2017 18:43:54 GMT):<br/>
like, 30 minutes or something
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 28 Apr 2017 18:57:53 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu it's very likely a test code problem similar to the one I fixed earlier in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8011
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 28 Apr 2017 18:57:57 GMT):<br/>
i'll take a look

@rameshthoomu need to set a time limit on those builds of like 20 minutes, then cancel and mark failed
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 30 Apr 2017 19:22:05 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 30 Apr 2017 20:57:56 GMT):<br/>
unless you see jobs that ended in success that were over 20, it looked like the ones that worked all completed around 14 minutes
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 30 Apr 2017 20:58:38 GMT):<br/>
I guess there were a couple around 30: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-s390x/buildTimeTrend
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 30 Apr 2017 20:59:21 GMT):<br/>
these seem to succeed by 30 minutes, so a timeout of 45? https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-x86_64/buildTimeTrend
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 15:33:09 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 15:34:38 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I have submitted patch on build timeout https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8779/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 15:35:36 GMT):<br/>
I have provided build-timeout in each job based on the buildTimeTrend.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 15:53:42 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu  I thought we were going to correct this with Jim's patch.. :( i think is the most appropriated way .. 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 15:54:03 GMT):<br/>
Also,, did we said we needed to make a cleanup of tests we had? 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 15:54:44 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall I already merged it :( I can revert
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 15:56:37 GMT):<br/>
oh.. no biggie... if Jim's change still requires some work then Ramesh's change will definately help us in the meantime.. but we do need to see what @jimthematrix  says about his patch being able to fix this the better way 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 15:56:59 GMT):<br/>
and the cleanup of tests, which i dont remember if i dream we talk about it or we actually did
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 16:02:04 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall I parametrized builtimeout based on buildTimeTrend.. So this patch removed hardcoded 240 mins build timeout.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 17:26:43 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Can you check https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8645/.  Only two of three verifications ran.  Did the simple verify get turned off?  should i simply reverify?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 17:27:33 GMT):<br/>
checking.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 17:41:06 GMT):<br/>
no change in reverify functionality in CI..  `reverify` is triggering all three builds but in this patch I see only two builds are triggered.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 18:03:43 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu why only two in this case?  should i just reverify and hope for three next time?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 18:34:19 GMT):<br/>
yes.  pls do that for now.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 18:34:30 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I already did that.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 18:34:48 GMT):<br/>

@rameshthoomu @rjones Here's another strange one: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8541/ from @chris.elder . This time the simple verification ran and reported SUCCESS, but if you drill into the console report it shows a unit test failure. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/10943/consoleFull.

@rameshthoomu @jwagantall I've fixed all the issues in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8389/ and expect the hang to go away, the problem is though the build is taking longer than the timeout and is killed before it got a chance to run through
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:07:18 GMT):<br/>
I think a 60min timeout as a start would be prudent and it can take hints from the successful builds trend
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:09:35 GMT):<br/>
it failed in 14 seconds.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:10:19 GMT):<br/>
it failed because the workspace isn't clean, there's another process running, or something. @jimthematrix 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:11:10 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix looking here successful builds take 14-30 minutes: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-s390x/buildTimeTrend no need for a 60 minute timeout
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:11:39 GMT):<br/>
I was looking at the x86 build: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-x86_64/933/
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:13:19 GMT):<br/>
a typical build on x86 would be >40min
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:13:42 GMT):<br/>
sometimes just build fabric and fabric-ca docker images would take that long
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:36:20 GMT):<br/>
@rjones @rameshthoomu @jwagantall please set a longer timeout asap so I can restart the build
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:41:47 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix I see max 30-33 mins is build time on successful node-sdk builds.. I think it's okay to run with 40 mins 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:42:57 GMT):<br/>
I highly doubt the CI job VMs are consistently enough (are they on shared hardware right?) to work with a 3min margin
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:43:41 GMT):<br/>
I've seen too many builds taking longer than that, and if the VMs are on shared hosts then it's susceptible to the `noisy neighbor` problem right?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:46:13 GMT):<br/>
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-x86_64/933 for instance, was just able to start `npm install` when it got aborted by the timer
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:47:12 GMT):<br/>
to be honest I don't think using the trend is a good idea, the VMs don't have dedicated resources
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:48:23 GMT):<br/>
the timeout should be set to what's the maximum tolerable length before all VMs get committed and none were being released
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:48:57 GMT):<br/>
node SDK verify builds are not that highly demanded (relative lower rate of CRs compared to fabric)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:50:38 GMT):<br/>
yes I agree on build #933.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:51:44 GMT):<br/>
we've been struggling to get clean builds, I just don't want to introduce another factor that would add more failed builds
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 20:14:36 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @rjones @jwagantall has the timeout been updated yet?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 20:14:54 GMT):<br/>
yes.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 20:14:59 GMT):<br/>
just triggered another reverify
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 20:15:02 GMT):<br/>

@harrijk I see permissions issue while wiping out the work space. @https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-s390x/401/console.. any idea why the script is not deleting workspace?

</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 20:20:30 GMT):<br/>
Hi. I'll take a look... it could be a new file that I need to search for in the script.
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 20:21:17 GMT):<br/>
Yep. It's a new file.  Let change the script.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 20:30:21 GMT):<br/>
@harrijk why not just remove and recreate the build directory? `rm -rf workspace; mkdir workspace; chown jenkins.jenkins workspace` or whatever
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 20:31:24 GMT):<br/>
@rjones sure, i can give that a shot. thanks for the suggestion.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 20:32:00 GMT):<br/>
be careful - I sort of made that up on the fly, there may be more to it than that :)

@rameshthoomu @bmos299  Team- wanted you aware that Ramesh/Barry agreed to have a daily run in the morning EST time and post the results of the build/CI tests every day whether they fail/pass on the fabric-ci channel (typically they had only posted when they passed. When they are failures- they have been opening "highest" bugs). I think this should help everyone with a bit more clarity. Meanwhile. @Ratnakar is working to get us to a single set of compose scripts/docker image that we can utilize in the CI so our results are more consistent when we run all the tests- he's comparing what he's done with what Greg Haskins has done to see if he missed anything. Once that is done, @rameshthoomu will include in the daily run .  I posted this on the maintainer channel as well asking for input.

I see lots of these error msgs and my HF verification failed for my gerrit submission request. I made changes only to some test directories, which should not affect any existing code or tests.

Hi @rameshthoomu I never saw you post on the fabric-sdk-java jar release ( I also so 8939 but it does not looked like it was approved yet- wondering if you requested on the pr review channel)

@weeds fabric-sdk-java jar release still in progress.. last week we have published java snapshot release to https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/ but @jwagantall suggested not to publish to "snapshot" or "release" targets. She submitted WIP patch to publish jar to "staging" target. We will complete this by today after noon..

hi @rameshthoomu @tongli do you have a recommendation for java test coverage library? @rickr is looking into JCoCo (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JaCoCo+Plugin), i assume installing this in the CI VMs is not gonna be difficult? or should we stay with cobertura since that's already installed (and used by node SDK jobs)?

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:43:21 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix have not worked with java for quite some time. Can not really comment on the tools, installing packages at CI is not an issue. just need these tools to be fast and be able to choose selective packages to test.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:44:28 GMT):<br/>
we are looking to run only affected unit-test by a patch. and run full unit-test when patch set already got two +2s.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:45:05 GMT):<br/>
this is to make sure that we do not miss anything and at the same time have a fast turn around time.

@rjones ping.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:04:07 GMT):<br/>
@tongli yes?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:04:57 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, good afternoon, I was talking with ramesh earlier today. Would like to ask you a question about the events coming from Gerrit.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:05:13 GMT):<br/>
ask away
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:05:29 GMT):<br/>
we would like to know if the events coming from Gerrit can be passed to jobs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:05:53 GMT):<br/>
so that we know the change id of patch set. and possibly other information such as current +2 reviews.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:07:31 GMT):<br/>
looking here for instance: https://logs.hyperledger.org/jobbuilder/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-1/fabric-verify-x86_64/12453/console.log.gz

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:07:51 GMT):<br/>
search for `GERRIT_PATCHSET_REVISION`
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:08:24 GMT):<br/>
actually, look here: https://logs.hyperledger.org/jobbuilder/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-1/fabric-verify-x86_64/12453/_build-enviroment-variables.txt.gz
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:09:04 GMT):<br/>
`GERRIT_CHANGE_ID` shows the change ID
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:09:19 GMT):<br/>
ah, that is passed to the job as env variable?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:09:35 GMT):<br/>
everything in that file is, yes
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:10:10 GMT):<br/>
well, everything with the prefix `GERRIT_`
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:10:40 GMT):<br/>
at the time these particular jobs are triggered, there are no votes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:11:41 GMT):<br/>
great.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:12:23 GMT):<br/>
All these variables get passed to job scripts so that these script can use them, right? want to confirm this.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:12:55 GMT):<br/>
yes. what is your proposed use?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:14:15 GMT):<br/>
there will be jobs that exist without corresponding gerrit events, and I'm not sure if a re-triggered job will have every single one of those set, for instance
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:20:20 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, I would like to add some logic so that when jobs are run, if there are already two +2 reviews, we run full unit-tests, if less than two +2, we run patch set affected unit-test.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:20:49 GMT):<br/>
it will be just a bit script to see if a given patchset has how many +2 reviews.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:21:18 GMT):<br/>
that is how I would like these things to be used.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:21:59 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure we can pass that in
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:22:37 GMT):<br/>
gerrit does have a JSON API, so you could query it then parse the results
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:23:31 GMT):<br/>
@tongli this is the plugin we're using: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:23:58 GMT):<br/>
REVIEWS=`GET https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/changes/$GERRIT_CHANGE_ID/reviewers | grep '"Code-Review": "+2"' | wc -l`
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:24:27 GMT):<br/>
I think we will just do curl get.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:24:45 GMT):<br/>
use a bit of script for that.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:27:12 GMT):<br/>
could you work with @rameshthoomu to try that out in the sandbox?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:27:40 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if you'll have enough permissions to call that API in jenkins (but you might!)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:40:24 GMT):<br/>
sure, will test it out first.

@weeds Daily I run e2e jobs (node) (java) (cli) in sandbox and publish docker images and post the result back to #fabric-ci RC channel... Where as in daily Jenkins (community Jenkins), we run daily test suite (fabric/test/regression/daily) like chaincode tests.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:38:51 GMT):<br/>
Couple of the patches are in review. Once they are merged will integrate them in daily test suite and run in community Jenkins.. till then we fetch these open patches from gerrit test these patches from sandbox jenkins..

I think the confusion is that for the daily run that publishes the image there is *not a Jenkins dashboard* view.  If the test fails, Ramesh opens Jira Bugs.  If it passes, we publish images. Now, for the daily testsuite from the https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/test/regression/daily folder, this is run in the Jenkins sandbox and published to, https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/daily/test_results_analyzer/.  It is not run everyday and actually runs from @rameshthoomu private repo.   At this point it was more of a PoC for the community and needs to made production ready asap.

<p><strong>SriramaSharma</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:32:55 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @rjones power was disabled only for gating builds as it was taking long build time. We have been working on it in the background and are now seeing same build time for verify-fabric builds as seen for x86. Once we do some more tests for consistency in results, we will propose back to community to include power for verify-builds in a week's time. Until then request you continue to have e2e tests on sandbox as it ensures that we are fine without build issues on daily basis.

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 13:26:56 GMT):<br/>
@harsha I still see e2e tests are failing in power node.. Could you please test on another node or can you run this manually in sandbox power node..

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:41:02 GMT):<br/>
the fix should be available in .64 and .65 snapshot versions.. not sure why .65 version doesn't have the fix you are looking for. @jimthematrix could you please look into this..

Yes - I just came to know about fabric-tool images, @rameshthoomu, @Ratnakar informed me. We use a similar E2E CLI script for bootstrapping our network and it worked on 19th May Fabric Images . 

We don't have build system inside our org, so we won't be able to do it.

@rameshthoomu fabric-sdk-node CI on x86 finally gives good builds again, thanks! I'm very curious what did you have to do to fix it?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:43:50 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix perhaps this? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10355/1/jjb/fabric-sdk-node/include-raw-npm-publish.sh
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:48:13 GMT):<br/>
@rjones @jimthematrix I have updated the cleanup script.. now job clean  `tmp/hfc* /tmp/npm* and hfc-key-store` these from x86.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:48:43 GMT):<br/>
we have a cleanup script in z build nodes to do this.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:54:32 GMT):<br/>
strange - x86 nodes shouldn't have anything to clean up, since they're new each time, no?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:55:37 GMT):<br/>
yes that's the reason I didn't add this script earlier... But after I add this line in sandbox it worked and the same worked in production CI.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:56:13 GMT):<br/>
not sure if that is the fix.. observed most of the builds passed after applied this patch. 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:56:38 GMT):<br/>
interesting, I would have expected that clean up to make a difference, those tmp folder are not used any longer for a long time, now we are using $TMPDIR/hfc/* for all temp folders created during test run
</p>

@rameshthoomu how do I tell what keys signed http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/1.0.0-beta/ for instance? I see keys, but I don't see a file that says "this release signed by jwagantall@lf...."
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 21:31:05 GMT):<br/>
these are signed by `hyperledgerci` user
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 21:31:17 GMT):<br/>
checking.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 21:32:17 GMT):<br/>
what did we do all of this work for - the detached signatures and everything? where is the private key for `hyperledgerci`? is it published in a directory
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 21:47:32 GMT):<br/>
I am not sure on private key for hyerpledgerci.. all I did was followed steps mentioned here http://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html.
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 22:25:25 GMT):<br/>
Ramesh,,, that looks like the right commands... but how did it appeared as me? :(
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 22:25:35 GMT):<br/>
are those the newest ones?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 23:51:40 GMT):<br/>
No.. these are published using hyperledgerci user.. Will check and let you know about the singing process.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 02:28:19 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Could you take a look at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10333/ ? You can see that in the 4 times that CI has run, one of the targets has failed every time (though every target has succeeded at least once)
</p>

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 02:34:55 GMT):<br/>
My concern is that after 4 runs through CI, there have been 4 failures, (even though the CR seems to be error free).  It makes it very difficult to determine whether a CR's CI status is valid or not.

Same thing, I think the CI physical server are under load

the `bccsp/sw` tests are CPU-intensive and they take 5 min in CI now - doesn't make sense unless the physical CPU cores are under severe load. 
in a 2-core VM it takes under 40sec

Hi @jyellick  verified couple of build results and observed the same error.. It seems network glitch on x86_64 nodes. Will ask @rjones @jwagantall to look into this

@yacovm @rameshthoomu the name of the minion tells you the spec - the x86_64 minions are 4 core, 4 gig of ram
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 11 Jun 2017 22:00:35 GMT):<br/>
ah? how do you derive the cores and RAM?

isn't 64 - 64 bits?

Do we have the changeset information for fabric-beta release, I am not able to find your post. Thanks.  
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 16:42:26 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde I didn't publish beta images to rameshthoomu docker hub account.. But I see I have published images after beta is released and this is the fabric  commit# `88ea3ee`
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 16:43:11 GMT):<br/>
If you need beta images you can pull from hyperledger or if you need I will publish to my account..

@muralisr  @bmos299 

I am running on hyperledger beta fabric images and my chaincode instantiation fails, this used to pass on Alpha3 (19th May Images). Our chaincode refers to another package and seems there is something changed the way Peer CLI instantiates the chaincode.

```

Is this again related to ` govendor ` ==> I am running 2 command ` govendor init ` and ` govendor add external+ ` inside the chaincode folder ?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:09:19 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde so you guys use the peer CLI to install and instantiate chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:09:53 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6991/
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:09:55 GMT):<br/>
At this point of time - we are using CLI for bootstrapping the fabric network.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:10:12 GMT):<br/>
so that includes using the CLI to install the chaincode right?
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:10:36 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=eMgK8sfWSQNg562Nk) @jimthematrix 
Right.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:10:38 GMT):<br/>
see the CR above that changes how the CLI packages up the chaincode during install
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:11:42 GMT):<br/>
that's the change related to this area, but supposedly it should've discovered all the dependencies and include them in the chaincode package during install
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:12:01 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:12:25 GMT):<br/>
btw this would be better asked in the #fabric-peer-endorser-committer channel
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:14:25 GMT):<br/>
and you have re-built the CLI peer binary that does the install right?
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:15:28 GMT):<br/>
In our chaincode we use util package (homegrown) and than chaincode in a separate main package. We face the same above issue while instantiating the chaincode on Beta Images (previous Alpha-19th May worked!) 

I have just modified the chaincode (example02) so I show u the error w/o concealing the path/our information here. 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:15:44 GMT):<br/>
i wonder if this is the case where the external dependency only exists in your vendor folder, but not in the $GOPATH
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:15:58 GMT):<br/>
and as such it's missed by the peer CLI
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:17:30 GMT):<br/>
seems like @greg.haskins is offline at the moment, he should know for sure
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:18:23 GMT):<br/>
in the meanwhile, you can try this: move your external dependencies out of the vendor folder and put them in the system $GOPATH along with the chaincode itself
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:18:40 GMT):<br/>
and re-install the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:18:40 GMT):<br/>
and re-install the chaincode using the CLI
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:19:09 GMT):<br/>
I have volume mounted the package (util) to the Peer CLI but this didn't help.
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:26:48 GMT):<br/>
Like for the above example 

```
        - ../../../../shopspring/decimal/:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/shopspring/decimal/
        - ../chaincode/go/:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go
```

</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:59:14 GMT):<br/>
Instead of doing `reverify` and restarting all jobs, is there a way to just call for one specific build to run again?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:29:20 GMT):<br/>
@kostas I can help you on that.. 
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:29:43 GMT):<br/>
I mean is there a command that we can type as a comment in Gerrit to do that?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:29:57 GMT):<br/>
I don't want to be bugging Ramesh all the time.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:30:33 GMT):<br/>
No I don't see any such option to do that
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:30:54 GMT):<br/>
Would be nice to have, wouldn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:31:04 GMT):<br/>
(Not sure how easy it is though to implement.)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:34:03 GMT):<br/>
Yes it's nice to have.will check and let you knwo
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:36:56 GMT):<br/>
How about instead we simply say `reverify` only restarts failed jobs.  And allow a second target like `reverify_all` to retrigger the successful ones
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:37:28 GMT):<br/>
^^ I like this idea much better.

@cbf @rameshthoomu we are working on fixing that failure and installing those packages....the job should be just failing the logs part....but everything before that should be fine...

Newbie question: Am I supposed to remove "Hyperledger Jobbuilder" from the list of reviewers every time I upload a new patchset, or is there a way to permanently let them know that they're not welcome in this changeset?

Basic question: Am I supposed to remove "Hyperledger Jobbuilder" from the list of reviewers every time I upload a new patchset, or is there a way to permanently let them know that they're not welcome in this changeset?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 20:35:32 GMT):<br/>
@kostas they will add themselves every new patch. What is the issue you're trying to solve?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 20:35:52 GMT):<br/>
I'm revising a doc, CI is not needed.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 20:36:03 GMT):<br/>
So I have to remove it manually every time.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 20:36:07 GMT):<br/>
So ignore it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 20:36:23 GMT):<br/>
You don't have to do anything
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 20:36:41 GMT):<br/>
I guess I could do that as well, you're right.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 20:37:17 GMT):<br/>

wondering if anyone has thought for CI of chaincode, when you change chaincode, how do you know where to reinstall / reinstantiate the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 17:13:44 GMT):<br/>
@bobbiejc that sounds like an excellent idea! nobody I know of is working on that
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 17:14:14 GMT):<br/>
i was looking through this: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4noah.html
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 17:14:49 GMT):<br/>
it seems to start to address some of topics, but not for CI/CD
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 17:15:59 GMT):<br/>
@rjones can you point me to fabric devs who might shed insight into best practices?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 17:17:18 GMT):<br/>
@bobbiejc you might ask in #fabric ? you could also look at the ci-management repo /jjb/ to see how to add to the CI system if you really wanted
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 17:18:24 GMT):<br/>
so saw that, but this would be outside of standing up and developing fabric
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 17:18:38 GMT):<br/>
this is for a consumer of fabric, who may never touch the base...
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 17:55:34 GMT):<br/>
sure, what I'm saying is if you're trying to find fabric consumers, that might be the place to look? Another option would be to send mail to one of the mailing lists.

@rameshthoomu Some time ago, @kostas had asked you about the possibility of allowing reverify to specify a particular job to re-run (or better yet, automatically only re-run failed jobs) and you had said you would look into it.  Maybe I just missed the reply, but was wondering if you had had a chance to do this? [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=CDeSm7gFMdHMqDg9H)

@jyellick @rameshthoomu AFAIK there is no version of the Gerrit `recheck` plugin that does partial triggers
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 15:24:24 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick @rameshthoomu here is the plugin: https://plugins.jenkins.io/gerrit-trigger
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 15:33:15 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @rjones not sure if we think this is worth opening an enhancement request for? (or what the likelihood of someone implementing it would be).  Obviously the 'right' answer is to make our assorted jobs more stable, but especially as the number of jobs has grown, the false positive problem has gotten worse
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 15:34:34 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick no argument from me. I am personally of the opinion that flaky tests get disabled and a bug filed

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 19:35:29 GMT):<br/>
yes @greg.haskins.. We are using nexus to download fabric-binaries and jar jar files.. 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 19:35:30 GMT):<br/>
I need to make the "v1.0.0" release of chaintool..we have historically used GH releases (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaintool/releases)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 19:35:42 GMT):<br/>
but if nexus is available, we could use that going forward
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 19:36:20 GMT):<br/>
I would need your help coming up with the "-release" job for chaintool which could respond to the push of a new tag, build the artifact, and push it to nexus
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 19:37:07 GMT):<br/>

you can think of it as an opaque binary

@rameshthoomu take a look at the test results. look clean?

<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:11:36 GMT):<br/>
ok I've another issue. working on the PTE patch, @rameshthoomu.  I'm seeing this when I run the `make docker` step for setting up PTE locally:

@rjones, @jwagantall thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:15:07 GMT):<br/>
i wonder if that find is looking in the correct directory .. is that were is expected to be? is any env variable missing?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:17:10 GMT):<br/>
maybe not....
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:17:13 GMT):<br/>
it's there
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:17:21 GMT):<br/>
just not being picked up by the find....
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:17:23 GMT):<br/>
_checks_
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:23:37 GMT):<br/>
are you able to find it manually.. is this on your personal machine? or jenkins?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:23:46 GMT):<br/>
personal machine
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:23:53 GMT):<br/>
starting there
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:24:19 GMT):<br/>
the directory is there locally
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:24:34 GMT):<br/>
because jenkins has several env variables.. tha'ts what i think it might be missing.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:24:47 GMT):<br/>
did you defined WORKSPACE and those basic ones?

and test it on the sandbox.

@Ratnakar thank _you_ for pointing out I need to fix the plugin

@Ratnakar I made that change on 16-JUN and you're the first person to notice the error - tells me how much people use the logs :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:15:13 GMT):<br/>
@rjones for what it's worth I did notice there were broken links
</p>

@rjones for what it's worth I did notice there were borken links
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:15:33 GMT):<br/>
I assumed it was a known issue
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:15:45 GMT):<br/>
which I realize was the stupid assumption
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:15:45 GMT):<br/>
which I realize was a stupid assumption
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:15:59 GMT):<br/>
@lehors if you `s/jobbuilder/production/` in the url it works
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:16:09 GMT):<br/>
ok, good to know
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:17:21 GMT):<br/>
what is your position on log retention? my position is keep the logs forever, basically, but unless something is ingesting them for analysis it's probably a waste
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:18:11 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/ci-pipeline?msg=ceWTmCDbxTGG9CeDa) @cbf 's position
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:18:14 GMT):<br/>
for the logs, I've been using the link to the Console output which worked
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:18:40 GMT):<br/>
I would agree we don't need to keep them forever
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:19:35 GMT):<br/>
at the same time they are probably not the most expensive things to keep
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:19:47 GMT):<br/>
iirc the console output logs are only kept at most a week, once we moved to logshipping I cut retention down quite a bit. the next step (now that the links in gerrit work) is to set retention to a day
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:20:04 GMT):<br/>
you could mitigate this simply by having a long retention policy but delete eventually
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:20:22 GMT):<br/>
say a year or maybe 6 months, that would seem to be plenty
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:20:36 GMT):<br/>
space on the Jenkins server is at a premium, which is where the console logs are kept. Space on nexus, not so much
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:20:44 GMT):<br/>
I see
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:20:44 GMT):<br/>
I could see six months
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:20:49 GMT):<br/>
that makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:21:35 GMT):<br/>
there are design decisions in jenkins that make some operations fraught. Most operations are single threaded. For instance, multiple people having the web UI open slows the service down.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:22:11 GMT):<br/>
oh
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:23:21 GMT):<br/>
copying artifacts (logs) back to the server from a minion, or copying them from the server to a web view, is blocking
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:23:52 GMT):<br/>
what about having it open multiple times? :-/
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:24:19 GMT):<br/>
it takes a lot of people to drag the server down! I'm not saying don't do it, just that it isn't free
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:24:28 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:25:09 GMT):<br/>
as I told @jtclark the other day (yesterday?) there is room for optimization on the CI front
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:25:24 GMT):<br/>
yes very much so
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:25:38 GMT):<br/>
for one thing if I push a new patch-set and it starts a new build it should stop any previous builds running
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:25:53 GMT):<br/>
short of doing it automatically it would be nice to be able to stop it manually
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:26:40 GMT):<br/>
my simple use case is: I push a change, realize I screwed something up, I push a second change
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:26:51 GMT):<br/>
we end up with 2 builds running
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:27:01 GMT):<br/>
We could open up the ability to kill builds, but there isn't a knob that limits it to 'kill your builds'
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:28:20 GMT):<br/>
outside of periods of high use on the Z platform, our builds are limited to 35 or 40 x86 minions. are we running out a lot?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:28:21 GMT):<br/>
I feel bad because I screwed up and the fact that I'm wasting resources running a useless build only makes it worse :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:29:06 GMT):<br/>
I thought that's something you would tell me! :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:29:38 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:31:44 GMT):<br/>
I guess I treat CI as more fire-and-forget. I clearly have an impedance mismatch
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:35:05 GMT):<br/>
If you want to see something scary, when Jenkins is busy, look at this page in your browser's debugger: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/ with the `build executor status` window collapsed and open. look at the amount of JSON flying around to keep those build progress bars updated
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:37:56 GMT):<br/>
ok, I will check :)
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:27:03 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Could you check the health of CI? https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/ Looks to me like no build has run in a couple hours, and I have a few CRs which I've run "reveriify" on (such as https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/11501/ ) which are just sitting there
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:29:20 GMT):<br/>
yes.. Trigger events are not working. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:29:20 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:22:54 GMT):<br/>
@rjones @rameshthoomu Any updates on the trigger outage? Any place we can watch for status?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:23:36 GMT):<br/>
I need to restart Jenkins. There is a long-running job - it's been running for over 8 hours! - blocking the restart
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:24:03 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-daily-tests-x86_64/buildTimeTrend almost 9 hours
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:26:05 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu when the last `-verify` job completes, may I kill this `daily-tests` job and let it re-run Friday?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:26:19 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:26:41 GMT):<br/>
OK. I hope it finishes first, but if it doesn't, I'll kill it
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:28:48 GMT):<br/>
@rjones kill that job.. I will trigger it later or will let it run on friday.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:29:04 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I want to wait for the other job to complete.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:29:30 GMT):<br/>
(which it is doing now)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:29:33 GMT):<br/>
ok.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:31:18 GMT):<br/>
builds won't start right away. I need to test the trigger.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:34:07 GMT):<br/>
OK. Builds released. I just tested the trigger on @jyellick 's most recent change, and it worked
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:35:26 GMT):<br/>
I'll go back and retrigger anything that hasn't moved today
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:58:20 GMT):<br/>
OK. @rameshthoomu I've retriggered the very long running job
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 20:30:11 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick @rameshthoomu one more jenkins restart coming
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 16:42:53 GMT):<br/>
How are we looking on CI these days?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 16:43:12 GMT):<br/>
If still manually triggering, this guy could use some help:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12019/
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 16:46:15 GMT):<br/>
it shouldn't be manual, but I see that change didn't trigger a build.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 16:49:17 GMT):<br/>
I've manually triggered several builds.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 18:59:28 GMT):<br/>
please don't `reverify` anything right now.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Sat, 29 Jul 2017 16:46:21 GMT):<br/>
Any status updates on CI? Anywhere we can see what the current state is, if we should be submitting new patches, reverifies, etc.?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 29 Jul 2017 16:49:03 GMT):<br/>
we're taking a 90 minute outage in 14 minutes. you're welcome to submit patches to gerrit.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Sat, 29 Jul 2017 16:51:40 GMT):<br/>
Is there a status page like https://status.linuxfoundation.org/history but for our CI?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 29 Jul 2017 17:04:52 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick I now know I can't update that page directly, so I've asked for access to do so.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 29 Jul 2017 19:48:22 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick the outage is over. I'm keeping an eye on Jenkins waiting for the issue to repro. You're welcome to upload patches, etc, reverify
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 29 Jul 2017 19:48:43 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick if the gerrit plugin falls over again I'll have more to go on
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Sat, 29 Jul 2017 19:55:33 GMT):<br/>
Great, thanks for the update @rjones 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 30 Jul 2017 16:50:27 GMT):<br/>
Does not seem like the trigger is working?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 30 Jul 2017 18:27:28 GMT):<br/>
But the @rjones trigger seems to be.  sorry Ry
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 30 Jul 2017 18:27:46 GMT):<br/>
not your fault Jenkins is astable
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 11:02:52 GMT):<br/>
Good news is that builds are being triggered.  Bad news is that I'm seeing the same error as in this log:

https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/14758/console

(I have not tried submitting against master - these are all against the release branch in case that makes a difference)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 13:03:22 GMT):<br/>
@rjones @jwagantall seems plugin compatibility is causing this error..  java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.RevWalk.release
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 13:35:53 GMT):<br/>

@rjones, Ry, thanks for the comments for my patch set. can you tell me what white space checking tool we use at the gate? I would like to have the same thing installed to check the problems before I submit another patch set.

@rjones @jwagantall can I request for a new repository `fabric-shim-node` to be created? has been discussed with @cbf and @mastersingh24 in the context of https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2331, which I've sent an announce email for to the mailing list last week

@jimthematrix @rjones https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2331 has the requisite votes to proceed
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:58:52 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix is that the best name? Wouldn't it be fabric-javascript-cc?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:59:29 GMT):<br/>
I think "shim" should be part of the name, since that's essentially what's being peeled off
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:59:51 GMT):<br/>
I can help with this request . 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:59:52 GMT):<br/>
the rest is integration glue code is still in GO in fabric repo
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:00:09 GMT):<br/>
let me validate that with Luis
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:00:13 GMT):<br/>
ok - just re-examined what's under core/chaincode and yea
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:00:28 GMT):<br/>
likely the java one should be "fabric-shim-java"
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:00:33 GMT):<br/>
but is node the right language qualifier? 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:00:38 GMT):<br/>
or js
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:01:03 GMT):<br/>
should be more specific than JS since these are meant to run under the node.js engine
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:01:10 GMT):<br/>
could we possibly have a js shim that then supported various frameworks?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:01:19 GMT):<br/>
ok fair enough
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:01:27 GMT):<br/>
they are written as CommonJS modules that other engines like those in browsers won't understand
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:04:54 GMT):<br/>
discussed with Luiz, let's use the naming convention "fabric-chaincode-<lang>" instead of "fabric-shim-<lang>"
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:04:54 GMT):<br/>
discussed with @sanchezl , let's use the naming convention "fabric-chaincode-<lang>" instead of "fabric-shim-<lang>"
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:05:12 GMT):<br/>
for java and node chaincode support, at the moment it'll just be the shim to be peeled off
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:05:23 GMT):<br/>
but in the future there could be others like tools, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:05:57 GMT):<br/>
so "chaincode" is a better term and more generic to accommodate future expansion of the repo's intended content
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:06:08 GMT):<br/>
@cbf @jwagantall ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:06:49 GMT):<br/>
ok by me
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:07:08 GMT):<br/>
can we set up both node and java then?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:07:15 GMT):<br/>
might as well
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:08:04 GMT):<br/>
so .. 2 gerrit repos ... fabric-chaincode-node and fabric-chaincode-java ? will they be sharing the same group of committers?
</p>
<p><strong>sanchezl</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:12:15 GMT):<br/>
For fabric-chaincode-java, I suggest @muralisr & @sanchezl 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:14:28 GMT):<br/>
@sanchezl agreed, and I think you will need to provide emails each committer used for gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:14:28 GMT):<br/>
@sanchezl I think you will need to provide emails each committer used for gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>sanchezl</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:16:10 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:24:41 GMT):<br/>
Can we please add the final details in the jira too please? Including list of committers...  that way we can have a record
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 17:02:17 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall for fabric-chaincode-node: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5572, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 17:03:07 GMT):<br/>
Luis will create one for fabric-chaincode-java separately

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=2btp7Rsqd8Dg3e62j) @tongli it is in the build logs - I don't know off the top of my head
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 18:12:05 GMT):<br/>
@rjones,I will take a look at the log file. thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 18:24:13 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, looked at the project, it seems to me it uses tox.
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 19:07:54 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix @sanchezl   the repos are created now... do you guys need me to set them up in Jenkins and Nexus to push in future there? or not needed?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 20:12:46 GMT):<br/>
thanks Jessica, would need Jenkins integration for sure, for nexus fabric-chaincode-node for the moment does not publish binaries (it published directly to npm), but I'm pretty sure fabric-chaincode-java would need to
</p>

fabric ci performance on x86 in our infra is getting a lot of attention in #ci-pipeline if any interested party is not already watching.

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 18:53:33 GMT):<br/>
@rjones to my knowledge, crypto computations have a very big role in the system performance as a whole but I'm not sure how much they affect unit tests.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 19:11:29 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm the difference between AES passthrough and native floating point is an order of magnitude
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 19:15:23 GMT):<br/>
well yeah I understand but only a minority of UTs use crypto from what I know
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 19:17:12 GMT):<br/>
btw can you please retrigger https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/15046/console and the failed jobs in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12193/  ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 19:18:09 GMT):<br/>
Also I'll give you an example- there was 1 time where gossip UTs were very slow on PPC and they were fast on x86, and I disabled TLS and they were still slow...
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 19:23:12 GMT):<br/>
done
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 01:08:28 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm based on the profiling done in #ci-pipeline the call graph is dominated by crypto when not accelerated 
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 04:43:58 GMT):<br/>
Looks like there are a number of hung x86 builds https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 04:45:37 GMT):<br/>
if you look here it's pretty gross: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/buildTimeTrend

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 05:11:29 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 05:19:07 GMT):<br/>
I'm keeping my good eye on it, but I suspect it's a change in the merged code
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 05:35:38 GMT):<br/>
Any chance that the x86 machines are just running slow? I am seeing lots of x86 failures across the board, while Z seems to be quite happy with the same commit

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 12:49:22 GMT):<br/>
yes, CI has been very unreliable recently. 1.1 work items are blocked.  @rjones @rameshthoomu and all, appreciate if you could dedicate time to this today
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 12:49:55 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Also there have been intermittent gossip CI failures
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 12:50:03 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  @mastersingh24 I have created FAB https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5643
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 12:51:05 GMT):<br/>
I think this patch https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12141/ is causing longer builds
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 12:53:37 GMT):<br/>
Not sure how that is possible
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 12:53:50 GMT):<br/>
@scottz Also behave and end-to-end CI verifications are failing. Who could take a look at these?  Various examples of these failures in the reverifies for https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12177/ and https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12161/
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 12:54:18 GMT):<br/>
I'm pretty sure there's somthing wrong with the CI machines
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 13:14:56 GMT):<br/>
yes @mastersingh24 I have verified all x86 builds (behave, end-to-end and unit-tests) taking longer time.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 13:16:47 GMT):<br/>
all tests are failing (behave and java end-to-end) because x86_64 build nodes are processing requests with huge delay.. @rjones @jwagantall could you please check this
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 13:17:19 GMT):<br/>
observed same unit-tests are working as expected in `z` platform.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 16:14:15 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @rjones It looks like some verifications are succeeding now.  Did something change for the better?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 16:17:19 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart something changed, yes
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 16:17:43 GMT):<br/>
I don't mean to be opaque but I don't know exactly what was changed 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 16:18:36 GMT):<br/>
ok, did the environments get restarted or something?  i mean, if the problem resurfaces, what is the corrective action?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 16:21:05 GMT):<br/>
You're asking reasonable questions I can't answer yet
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 18:36:17 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart @mastersingh24 there was a bunch of discussion over the weekend on #ci-pipeline where (I presume) some of the LF infrastructure support team were examining the configuration and trying to debug the problems we've been seeing (slow builds etc). @rjones is basically telling us that he isn't aware of the specific things that they are tweaking in an effort to resolve our problems.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 18:36:37 GMT):<br/>
I am encouraged that there is some energy behind this
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 18:52:33 GMT):<br/>
@cbf: mnaser owns the service provider, mricon is one of the engineering leads for LF.

@rjones thanks

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 22:09:01 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @rjones Tonight we have the opposite CI problem... the x86 tests are all succeeding but the z tests are failing, happened twice in a row in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12163/
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 22:13:11 GMT):<br/>

Done/. It worked this time and published 1.0.1 npm modules successfully

@rameshthoomu I see your name attached to the commit which set this line:

```
1e9a087903 unit-test/run.sh       (rameshthoomu       2017-06-06 07:50:05 -0400 79) gocov test -ldflags "$GO_LDFLAGS" $PKGS -p 1 -timeout=20m | gocov-xml > report.xml
```

in the `unit-test/run.sh` file.  Whenever I am forced to run `make unit-test` locally, I am amazed at how slowly it runs, so almost always do `go test ./component/...` myself as it is usually multiple orders of magnitude faster.  I just did a quick check, replacing that line with:

```
go test -p 1 -ldflags "$GO_LDFLAGS" $PKGS -timeout=20m
```

The time for testing the same set of packages drops from 8 minutes, to 1.5 minutes.  So it appears that using `gocov` is occupying about 80% of the time when the unit tests are actually running.  Seems like we could significantly speed up CI if we could simply run the code coverage stats when needed.  Maybe only on packages with changed files? Or, maybe only in a once a week job or something?

Hi Guys, Needed your help.
As per new story FAB-5460, we are implementing new kind of chaincodes, i.e precompiled binary user chaincodes.
We pushed the changes just now but verification build "https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-behave-x86_64/9629/ " just failed due to failure in bddtests. 
Cause: There is a new target added to makefile called 'sample-binarycc-files', which has to be run before running bddtests just like existing make peer and make docker targets. 
Since this verification build is not using 'make behave' to run bddtests and we have limited access to jenkins job "https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-verify-behave-x86_64/", the verification build is failing.
Can anyone add   make sample-binarycc-files to below execute shell of this job only for this code push..
.
.
# Build Peer and images
make peer && make docker && make sample-binarycc-files
.
.
.
Here is the gerrit link for code push
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12435/
Any help would be appreciated
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 20:05:28 GMT):<br/>
This new target 'make sample-binarycc-files' generates sample binary chaincode files which will be used by bddtests.

I guess, changing jenkins job in advance for new target before this code is getting merged may fail the build for others who of course doesn't have this target.

I have a work around for time being where I can add this new target 'make sample-binarycc-files' as dependency for 'make peer'(which is already being used by this jenkins job), so that verification build will be successful. Once the code is merged then jenkins execute shell can be changed to include this new target and I will revert this work around later.Let me know what you think about this.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 20:15:39 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty checking this
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 20:30:25 GMT):<br/>
Thanks ramesh
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 21:18:40 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty I have tested your patch with `make sample-binarycc-files` and it worked as expected in jenkins sandbox

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 21:19:29 GMT):<br/>
But I can not add make target in CI till your patch is merged in fabric.. 
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 22:24:11 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Ramesh,  I will push it as a dependency on make peer as of now and Will create a JIRA to revert it back once my code is merged and you make changes in jenkins.
Does it took fine for you?
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 22:25:14 GMT):<br/>
or can we ignore this verification fail for this build
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 15 Aug 2017 13:12:47 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty it's better to ignore this verification result..  Once your patch is merged, will include new make target in CI script..

@rameshthoomu @greg.haskins I pushed a CR to fabric-baseimage, but the build is stuck due to the ppc64 build not triggering: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-baseimage-verify-docker-x86_64/97/
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 14:50:50 GMT):<br/>
do we need the ppc64 build for this?

Looks like this error is new, we are trying a build separately
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 18:18:10 GMT):<br/>
@bsmita OK, I guess we've taken a dependency on `virtualenv` somewhat recently?
</p>
<p><strong>bsmita</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 18:19:09 GMT):<br/>
We are running a build on our local VM, and looking at the error on the previous community build logs...
</p>
<p><strong>bsmita</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 18:19:59 GMT):<br/>
The code is going to fabric-baseimage, so that should be ok
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 18:55:31 GMT):<br/>
thanks @rjones for handling that, I'm ok with not having that for now. will discuss with the maintainers on how to push to docker hub (for which we might need the ppc64le build to have parity with previous versions)

Is it possible to trigger the same build in sandbox? on one node?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 18:56:53 GMT):<br/>
not and publish from sandbox, no
</p>
<p><strong>bsmita</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 18:58:02 GMT):<br/>
Not the publishing part but just the fabric-baseimage build
</p>
<p><strong>bsmita</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 19:53:50 GMT):<br/>
@rjones - 2 local VM builds and one sandbox node build on baseimage passed
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 20:00:50 GMT):<br/>
@bsmita OK, what do you want me to do? have you updated all of the VMs so they have the virtualenv (and whatever else) dependencies installed?
</p>
<p><strong>bsmita</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 20:02:08 GMT):<br/>
On the nodes we tried, it didn't need updates, so that's why I was checking to see if running a baseimage build in sandbox is an option

@rameshthoomu the code push we discussed eariler where verification build failed due to missing new target 'make sample-binarycc-files'  is not being reviewed by anyone due to failure in verification.



I have suggestion which will fix this verification build and also  it will not impact anyone else’s code push.

If you look at execute shell in  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-behave-x86_64/configure-readonly/

.
.
.
.

# Build Peer and images

make peer && make docker
docker images | grep hyperledger
cd bddtests
behave -k -D logs=force -D cache-deployment-spec
#behave -k -D cache-deployment-spec features/bootstrap.feature
# Deactivate vitrualenv after behave test
Deactivate
.
.
.
.

If you replace ‘make peer && make docker’ with already existing target  for running behave dependencies called ‘ make behave-deps’ which does the same job,  will fix my code push as well as it won’t impact others.

Thanks for any help.

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 11:15:56 GMT):<br/>
Given there's been a number of updates to the CI for fabric, just though I'd give you a heads up on these:  https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?jql=text%20~%20%2217.06%22  

(basically moving CI to Docker 17.06+)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 11:17:00 GMT):<br/>
I slated this for 1.2, but it won't hurt anything to have it as soon as possible.  I'm particularly interested in simplifying some of our builds by using the multi-stage build feature of 17.06
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 12:36:23 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24, Jim wants to test on fabric-sdk-node on different node versions (7.4.0 and 8.4.0).. 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 13:02:27 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 our official supported version for node SDK is >= 6.9 < 7.0.0, which is the current LTS. planning to upgrade to 8 once it enters LTS. so until that happens, we should have CIs run jobs under 6 and 8 at the same time
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 13:05:57 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I didn't know our CI has been running with node 7.4, please install the latest 6.9.x instead, so we'll have jobs covering the two LTS versions 6 (current) and 8 (next). node 7 is not LTS so we never planned to support that
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 13:16:42 GMT):<br/>
ok testing on 6.9.5 and 8.4.0.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 04:21:07 GMT):<br/>
I want to show you something. If you look here: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-merge-x86_64/buildTimeTrend you'll notice the builds on the ubuntu1604-x86_64-2c-8g (older, slower, but with dedicated resources) are more regular than the builds on type ubuntu1604-x86_64-4c-4g (newer CPUs).
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 04:22:01 GMT):<br/>
I've rolled this change out for a short while to several fabric build types. The downside is there will be a price differential if we decide to go with having some of these dedicated minion types around. The number for that is not known.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 12:41:56 GMT):<br/>

Hi, fabric-verify-z verification build is failing for  everyone due to error while doing

git fetch --tags --progress ssh://hyperledger-jobbuilder@gerrit.hyperledger.org:29418/fabric +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

with error,

15:39:17 hudson.plugins.git.GitException: Command "git fetch --tags --progress ssh://hyperledger-jobbuilder@gerrit.hyperledger.org:29418/fabric +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*" returned status code 128:

@sudeshrshetty I've asked @harrijk if there is a problem with the `z` nodes
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 17:40:46 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @rjones

<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 17:50:13 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty I'm checking the systems now.  I don't see anything that pops out as an issue, but I'll continue to look.
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 18:12:10 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty It appears to be a network issue on the s390x end.  I will work with our support team to resolve the issue.

@rjones @jwagantall Ry, Jessica, can I ask for a favor? when pushing the v1.0.2 tag for fabric-sdk-node, I accidentally created a v1.0.2 branch as a side effect. ```git push origin v1.0.2 HEAD:refs/heads/v1.0.2``` I've tried to removed them from gerrit and as far as I can tell they are gone, but the github mirror still displays the branch
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 06 Sep 2017 14:35:58 GMT):<br/>
can I ask you to help with deleting the branch v1.0.2 from github? thanks

@rameshthoomu  - When you get a chance, can you check to see why fabric-baseimage 0.4.0 was not published for Z and P?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 10 Sep 2017 15:36:33 GMT):<br/>
Yesterday we had issues with docker login on 17.06 version.. I have submitted fix as per ry and Greg.. Greg has to create new release tag to publish 0.4.1
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 10 Sep 2017 15:37:53 GMT):<br/>
Z and P build nodes are pointing to docker version 17.06.. 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 16:40:40 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu  - merged and tagged 0.4.1 - I see the x86_64 image pushed but still nothing for Z and P
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 16:44:48 GMT):<br/>
I see the same error on z and p (docker 17.06.02-ce version) and x86_64 on 17.05.0-ce.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 16:45:08 GMT):<br/>
checking why the script is still taking --email flag 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 16:47:45 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 this patch https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/13289/ was not rebased before merge.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 16:48:22 GMT):<br/>
I see --email flag is still exists in 0.4.1 tag.. 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 17:12:37 GMT):<br/>
OK - I fixed it  ;)

So unfortunately I missed this as part of the move to Go 1.9 for the master branch:   https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6191
Looks like the e2e and behave both use the version of Go installed on the host to build some of the binaries for testing.

Hello everyone, I have some issue while interacting with fabric. Not sure if it's the right chat to ask this question if not my apologize and ignore my message. So I'm testing the balance-transfer example on ubuntu machine. I docerized node.js API in order to interact with fabric from remote app. Then I have exposed port 4000 on node.js and made a bridge with outside port to access the server. Yesterday I could execute sample REST API requests (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/balance-transfer#sample-rest-apis-requests) locally from command line. For example I could register/enroll user in the network, create a channel, etc. However with the Postman tool I was getting errors like: Error: Enrollment failed; ECONNREFUSED localhost:8054, ECONNREFUSED localhost:7054, port number depends on what user token I was using for the request. "Error: This client instance must be assigned a user context." That is my first problem.

The second problem came today. Node.js uses JWS tokens for secure authentication and jwt token was expired after 10 hours and it is normal since it is configured that way (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/balance-transfer/config.json). But what I couldn't understand is that I even can not authenticate a new user from localhost with cli. For instance, this login request doesn't return anything, it's not executing: curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4000/users -H "content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d 'username=Jim&orgName=org1'

If any of you already faced the same issue please guide me. Thank you in advance!

@GiorgiBlockchain: This is not the right forum. Try #fabric-sdk-node ?

<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:49:48 GMT):<br/>
Does my memory serve me wrong, or did we use to have the Hyperledger Jobbuilder post links to the CI merge jobs on every changeset after it was merged?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 13:52:26 GMT):<br/>
On a related note, what's the quickest way to check the status of the CI merge tasks for a given changeset? (Browse manually via this page https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/ is how I do it, but I'm sure I'm missing a more obvious way to do this.)

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:48:00 GMT):<br/>
But if using the Go version installed on the CI hosts, therein lies the rub
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:48:02 GMT):<br/>
;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:48:26 GMT):<br/>
Although I think we can more easily deal with the GO SDK since I assume you no longer care about Go 1.7.5?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:48:36 GMT):<br/>
Whereas for Fabric 1.0.x we still need 1.7.5
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=3Lh48Sf5Muaxek7Hz) yup - don't care about 1.7.5

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:52:51 GMT):<br/>
ha.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:53:13 GMT):<br/>
OK - I think I can likely push an initial CR to CI that can help
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:53:27 GMT):<br/>
(My belief is that 1.7.x is old enough that it's not relevant for an SDK)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:53:52 GMT):<br/>
Fine by me
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:55:12 GMT):<br/>
Will probably have to write up some policy in the README about supporting current-X versions of Go...

@jyellick checking this
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 16:03:39 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick did you upload a new patch? that will abort in-progress jobs
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 16:04:41 GMT):<br/>
I did, but for instance `fabric-verify-two-staged-ci-check` is a job I have not seen before, maybe this was just added and I did not notice?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 16:05:05 GMT):<br/>
(And the other jobs are returning `SUCCESS` )
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 16:05:56 GMT):<br/>
it was just added. If your other jobs completed before the new patch, they will return SUCCESS and the ones in progress will (should) return ABORT
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 16:06:08 GMT):<br/>
(SUCCESS or FAIL as appropriate)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 16:08:10 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @jyellick I retriggered that specific job. Not sure why it aborted
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 16:09:13 GMT):<br/>
What is the new 'rebuild' command for this new CI job?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 16:11:56 GMT):<br/>
for e2e? there might not be one, I didn't add it
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 16:12:14 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick we are skipping the result of this new job.. I don't see an option to skip the abort failure.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 16:13:06 GMT):<br/>
we have other jobs without voting rights, I'd take a look at how they work. I know the -p verify jobs had no voting rights for a while, for instance

usually there would be something in here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-java that had a MAINTAINERS.md file, which people would then modify and have the other maintainers vote on
</p>

From DigitalOcean's [write-up on their monorepo structure](https://blog.digitalocean.com/cthulhu-organizing-go-code-in-a-scalable-repo/) yesterday, something to keep an eye out on in order to speed up our CI process:

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 20:57:56 GMT):<br/>
I only tested the sandbox one
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 20:57:57 GMT):<br/>
hmm. this looks familiar.  @rameshthoomu is this a new one?
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 20:58:06 GMT):<br/>
OK
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 20:58:29 GMT):<br/>
it looks like all the production `-z` minions are online
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 21:01:38 GMT):<br/>
Assuming this is the same issue, @rameshthoomu  added ...

```
rm -rf $NVM_DIR ~/.npm ~/.bower

```

to the job that had the failure.  I assume the line was placed just before the actual build/test began.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 21:09:40 GMT):<br/>
I guess that needs to be run on the node itself?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 21:09:47 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 21:12:59 GMT):<br/>
@harrijk `rm -rf $NVM_DIR ~/.npm ~/.bower` we run this command only in fabric-sdk-node builds..

@rjones what is the job that you're running?

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 14:12:00 GMT):<br/>
something in the `.bashrc` or whatever is emitting that error, so it probably needs the same cleanup you stated above but it needs to be run manually
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 14:12:30 GMT):<br/>
I see. So you're just running a command using ssh (as user jenkins)
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 14:12:48 GMT):<br/>
I'll take a look at .bashrc 
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 14:13:55 GMT):<br/>
```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"

@rameshthoomu What job needed the above statements to be added to jenkins' .bashrc?

<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 14:14:55 GMT):<br/>
For now, I'll comment out those statements to let @rjones perform his testing.

I need to be a bit less eager to jump on the `rebuild-foo` bandwagon, which means I need to understand CI logs a bit better. That said, let's have a look at this one: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/18150/consoleText
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 14:48:58 GMT):<br/>
Is the linter failure (on a file that wasn't touched in this changeset BTW) the reason for failure, or is it something else? Is this expected?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 14:50:20 GMT):<br/>
yes it's the linter failure

@jwagantall ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:01:02 GMT):<br/>
so you are working on providing a credential that will be able to provision against the cloud for up to 5 machines.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:01:08 GMT):<br/>
@tongli the jenkins server will create these new VMs and have access to them, yes
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:01:45 GMT):<br/>
it will be able to provision some number less than 45, which is the amount set aside for the CI silo entirely
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:01:54 GMT):<br/>
it will be my ansible script responsibility to provision the machines or you prefer these machines to be there already. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:02:57 GMT):<br/>
there is a new openstack that we aren't using yet, that will replace the current one, that will have up to 45 VMs.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:03:32 GMT):<br/>
previously, you wanted ansible, which I can do, but just now you were talking about doing it some other way and being able to ssh to the machines. I can't provide ssh access to them
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:03:43 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:04:13 GMT):<br/>
it has been ansible all alone, 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:04:16 GMT):<br/>
you said: `do I have direct access to 5 machines?`
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:04:30 GMT):<br/>
which to me, means, can I ssh to them? the answer is no
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:04:45 GMT):<br/>
so how the ansible can access them?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:05:08 GMT):<br/>
previously we had discussed (and I added in Sandbox) the ansible plugin
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:06:08 GMT):<br/>
from the jenkins server, I can ssh to the minions, and I assume the ansible plugin will use that to handle orchestration? how are you planning to do this?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:07:05 GMT):<br/>
I didn't enable the ansible plugin in sandbox because of the credential issue, which is now mostly solved. right now it is useless because there are no images in that openstack to instantiate
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:07:21 GMT):<br/>
jenkins machine runs ansible script, it can either use OpenStack cloud module provision against the OpenStack endpoint or if these machines have already been created, then the ansible script can simply use them but need to access them via ssh-agent and key pairs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:08:20 GMT):<br/>
seems you prefer my ansible script not to provision the machines?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:08:55 GMT):<br/>
I don't care how you want to implement it, previously you were wanting ansible, now you're talking about doing some other thing
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:09:06 GMT):<br/>
I need requirements that aren't changing
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:09:30 GMT):<br/>
what are you talking about? It has always been using ansible script, that never changed.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:10:15 GMT):<br/>
what I am asking is do you prefer I use ansible script running on jenkins to provision new machines or you prefer these new machines get created by you, my ansible script running on jenkins simply use them.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:10:39 GMT):<br/>
I don't care. Your ansible script can provision them
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:10:40 GMT):<br/>
the ansible script can do either.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:11:36 GMT):<br/>
ok, in that case, the jenkins job will need a credential which can provision VMs against the openstack cloud, so I will need the openstack endpoint (url) and a credential.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:12:10 GMT):<br/>
right, which as I said isn't quite ready because there aren't any images to provision there.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:12:11 GMT):<br/>
that credential will be a userid/password on the openstack cloud.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:12:31 GMT):<br/>
the new openstack exists and is ready to use, probably, but there are no images to instantiate yet.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:12:32 GMT):<br/>
ok, that is fine, you have entire next week to get that working.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:13:03 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:13:53 GMT):<br/>
we have also developed jenkins pipeline to start using it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:14:20 GMT):<br/>
@suryalanka @rameshthoomu can both help while I am away.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:17:06 GMT):<br/>
are you using pipelines internally? so your team has a lot of experience with Jenkins pipeline jobs?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:17:55 GMT):<br/>
yes, all the jenkins jobs we created are pipelines which we run on our own jenkins server.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:18:10 GMT):<br/>
excellent. are you using JJB internally?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:18:49 GMT):<br/>
a lot easier to manage, no, I am not using JJB, I think @rameshthoomu use it.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:19:14 GMT):<br/>
what kind of images are you planning to upload to OpenStack cloud?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:20:16 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I have to work on creating one.. @tongli right now, we don't have JJB with pipeline.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:20:50 GMT):<br/>
will create a one in sandbox and let you know how this goes.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:21:51 GMT):<br/>
@tongli they will be the same images we use in the current openstack cloud - Ubuntu 16.04 IIRC
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:22:00 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I do not think @rjones was asking if we are combining JJB and pipeline. I wish that we do not do that.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:22:21 GMT):<br/>
@tongli that is the only way forward, though
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:22:25 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, ok that is fine, I do not like to have images with extra stuff on.

@rjones JJB to include pipeline?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:23:39 GMT):<br/>
@tongli yes, we use JJB for everything, so for pipeline we will need JJB
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:23:48 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, are you saying developing JJB which actually produce a pipeline (or point to a pipeline jenkins project)?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:24:18 GMT):<br/>
I'm not quite sure what you're asking. 
</p>
<p><strong>jeremyphelps</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:24:44 GMT):<br/>
@tongli use JJB to instrument a pipeline
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:24:47 GMT):<br/>
JJB import into jenkins, but in our case, produce a pipeline jenkins project,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:25:03 GMT):<br/>
I think I understand what you are saying.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:25:28 GMT):<br/>
will be still a JJB but after put into jenkins, it becomes a pipeline project.
</p>
<p><strong>jeremyphelps</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:25:35 GMT):<br/>
yes 
</p>
<p><strong>jeremyphelps</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:25:42 GMT):<br/>
JJB can be used to create a pipeline
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:25:49 GMT):<br/>
vs some other kind of job in jenkins,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:25:55 GMT):<br/>
that is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:25:56 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:26:19 GMT):<br/>
if this is for automation, then yeah, we can go for that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:26:28 GMT):<br/>
no issue there.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:27:20 GMT):<br/>

</p>

I didn't see this.. let me check 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 19:34:44 GMT):<br/>
seems gerrit trigger causing this issue..
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 19:58:13 GMT):<br/>
seems like it's been happening for at least 1 day
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 19:59:50 GMT):<br/>
actually 3 days ago is the last time the standard tests ran
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 20:22:56 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 - issue is fixed and now all the jobs are triggered.. Will add `rebuild-node6-x` etc.. build phrases are reverted.. I am actually optimizing these triggers.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 20:23:08 GMT):<br/>
will work on this..
</p>

reverify not kicking off ... yes it's been merged but running merged already passed CRs can be very useful and this used to work for me.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 13:50:50 GMT):<br/>
odd the build happened but there was no message indicating it started
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:00:39 GMT):<br/>
@rickr After the patch is merged, `reverify` trigger the verify jobs not the merge jobs.. do `remerge` to trigger the merge jobs.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:01:27 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu  The build was retriggered 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:01:38 GMT):<br/>
It just didn't report it started 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:01:50 GMT):<br/>
yes it will trigger the verify jobs.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:02:10 GMT):<br/>
yes once the patch is merged, Jenkins is not reporting any status back to gerrit.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:02:24 GMT):<br/>
so what's the diff between reverfiy and remerge ?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:02:26 GMT):<br/>
we are waiting for the fix.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:02:49 GMT):<br/>
both does the same thing here.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:03:06 GMT):<br/>
ok so ignore your advice on remerge :)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:03:26 GMT):<br/>
so it's ok to trigger either reverify or remerge.. But the status is not reporting back to gerrit.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:03:35 GMT):<br/>
Will let you know once this is fixed.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:06:10 GMT):<br/>
np -- not so urgent --  The main thing is after the a while the output is lost and sometimes for the last merge it good to get that back to compare. 
IMO It would be great if the last merged output was never lost till ofcourse the merge but that _icing on the cake_

@rjones the rebase worked, but as usual one or two of the CIs still fail intermittently in each CR.  remind me what the rebuild-{} command is for fabric-verify-s390x?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 03:20:26 GMT):<br/>
I think rebuild-z? let me look
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 03:20:28 GMT):<br/>
or better yet show me where to look this up
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 03:20:57 GMT):<br/>
rebuild-z was the name when the verify job was called 'z'... just curious if it changed due to the s390 rename.

</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:56:57 GMT):<br/>
I know that curl is pretty buggy inside docker... did you guys recently changed the MTU for docker? @rjones?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:06:22 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:37:00 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall I haven’t changed anything, however, we did need to change the MTU inside docket a long time ago for one of @greg.haskins projects
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:37:00 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:38:48 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu the issue is docker no longer calculates the MTU correctly as of some version about a year ago
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:40:43 GMT):<br/>
thanks @rjones was this issue seen after upgrading docker (to 1.10 i think) .. we saw the same issues in ONAP.. but in ONAP's case curl wont work at all.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:41:20 GMT):<br/>
Even with the smaller MTU?
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:44:03 GMT):<br/>
not sure what is the default MTU.. but after doing some online investigation we found 1454 did the trick for us
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:44:05 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall sorry I misread what you said.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:53:10 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @jwagantall here is where we fixed it a long time ago: https://github.com/hyperledger/ci-management/blame/f2beb20e6b86798ac82a0ca9f607b67a47a61663/packer/provision/docker.sh#L66
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:53:33 GMT):<br/>
we discovered 1392 experimentally
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:54:27 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu are these builds that have worked with exactly these changes before? It's possible our upstream changed MTUs and I need to adjust MTU again
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:54:40 GMT):<br/>
@rjones yes these builds worked earlier and it's working now also but it's very inconsistent..

@rameshthoomu I can't compile the `release` version of the code due to what seems to be the same problem (only difference is version): 

```Step 2/10 : ENV SCALA_VERSION 2.11 KAFKA_VERSION 0.9.0.1 KAFKA_DOWNLOAD_SHA1 FC9ED9B663DD608486A1E56197D318C41813D326

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 03:04:48 GMT):<br/>

@rameshthoomu thanks. So `master` is merged into `release`? Is the branching model documented somewhere?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 03:50:06 GMT):<br/>
not today.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 03:50:19 GMT):<br/>

hi @rjones could you please create a repo for the fabric-evm chaincode per https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6590
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 14:49:32 GMT):<br/>
Hi @rameshthoomu request you to share your observation on fabric-ca|fabric UT for ppc64le.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 15:02:42 GMT):<br/>
Hi @harsha .. I have been working on this in sandbox.. After couple of fixes, it's seems fabric-ca and fabric unit-tests are working as expected on power nodes.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 15:03:32 GMT):<br/>
I will update average build time on power nodes and results in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5463

@rjones, @jwagantall the Fabric maintainers have voted for fabric-sdk-node repo using its own list of maintainers: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15647/, can the ACL changes be made accordingly? thanks!

@jimthematrix please send email to helpdesk@hyperledger.org and I’ll knock it out

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 24 Nov 2017 21:09:12 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix is this in addition to the fabric committers, or does this replace the fabric committers? is it a superset, or a distinct set? thank you

hi there, it looks like there is a problem with the builds
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 20:55:33 GMT):<br/>
I've a couple of CRs that are failing for "unknown reasons"
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 20:55:43 GMT):<br/>
looking into the log (https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-end-2-end-x86_64/10958/console) I see: 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 21:02:06 GMT):<br/>
there was a fire drill earlier this week, are the CRs on the tip of whatever branch?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 21:04:52 GMT):<br/>
@lehors could be a network glitch.. 

```
00:23:49.456 An HTTP request took too long to complete. Retry with --verbose to obtain debug information.
00:23:49.456 If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: 60).
```
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:11:18 GMT):<br/>
well, I've tried several times but it seems to fail every time even though I can't see how my change - only to the doc! - has anything to do with the failure

@rameshthoomu @lehors from what I can see it is taking longer than 2 seconds to create the channel through the orderer

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 18:42:21 GMT):<br/>

from the BDD...

@cbf  ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 18:33:45 GMT):<br/>
I dont think thats a good idea... Maintainers check CI jobs anyway. We know roughly what UTs are brittle and what are not. Disabling z ci makes no sense IMO especially since it runs faster than the x86 one

It doesnt really shorten the overall ci round
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 11:03:24 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm as for disabling Z verify... basically, the thinking is that we would only run it daily  and just run the x86 verify on each CR
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 11:03:46 GMT):<br/>
there are few times when the change is actually going to be problematic only for Z

hmm, why not do the opposite then?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 11:04:18 GMT):<br/>
run z and not x?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 11:04:21 GMT):<br/>
z is faster
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 11:04:29 GMT):<br/>
x is always the "long tail"

@rickr is this consistently happening.. I don't see any issues with build latency issues..

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 10:53:50 GMT):<br/>
hi there, I know the CI supports a bunch of commands through comments, such as reverify, rebuild-behave, etc. Are these commands documented somewhere?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 11:12:17 GMT):<br/>
ok, found the answer: the code :-)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 11:13:57 GMT):<br/>
seriously though, the ci-management doc could use a bit of love
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 11:14:11 GMT):<br/>
it still refers to ci-skip!
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 11:14:27 GMT):<br/>
which was removed back in April...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 18:13:08 GMT):<br/>
patch submitted and already merged - thanks @rjones!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 18:25:44 GMT):<br/>
@lehors I'm willing to try adding the `ci-skip` plugin again, if you think it's worth it. I feel it was probably unrightly maligned previously
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 18:26:21 GMT):<br/>
oh, I would like that
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 18:27:02 GMT):<br/>
I "often" patch the doc and find very silly to see the build kicking in when it is totally irrelevant
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 18:27:40 GMT):<br/>
it takes away resources that would be better use for other builds that really matter
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 18:30:17 GMT):<br/>
OK, installed. Let's see how it goes
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 18:31:17 GMT):<br/>
At the end of the day, though, your final commit would not have that in the commit message, right? I _feel_ having the commit log littered with `[ci skip]` messages would be ugly
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:22:59 GMT):<br/>
that is an interesting point
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:23:28 GMT):<br/>
at the same time maybe it is a good thing to have it in the log
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:23:54 GMT):<br/>
this can serve as a reminder that the commit wasn't checked against CI
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:24:44 GMT):<br/>
it seems that in case of problems down the line this might be help an investigation
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:29:01 GMT):<br/>
hmm, it doesn't seem to work, see https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/16407/
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:29:26 GMT):<br/>
what am I doing wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:29:33 GMT):<br/>
I might need to restart Jenkins
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:29:45 GMT):<br/>
ah...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:29:48 GMT):<br/>
oh well
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:30:06 GMT):<br/>
it's ok, this can wait
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:30:29 GMT):<br/>
I'm done for now
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:30:32 GMT):<br/>

@rjones, good morning, got a question for you. On our jenkins system, conditional step can have builders such as Trigger/call builds on other projects
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 13:57:45 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, see this picture.

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 13:58:59 GMT):<br/>
On my own jenkins system, I do not see as many builders , I must have missed something plugins or settings, can you shed a bit light on that? Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 15:27:10 GMT):<br/>
what is this test:  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-behave-tests-x86_64/234/ ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 15:28:28 GMT):<br/>
CR https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/16555  - behave failed originally and "rebuild-behave" triggered two tests

@rameshthoomu - any ideas here?   ^^^^^^
</p>

let me check
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 15:30:22 GMT):<br/>
will fix this.. Yesterday I have added this comment based trigger condition in the above job..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 15:31:01 GMT):<br/>
same comment added in another job also..

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:05:20 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, good evening, wonder if you see my earlier question on jenkins? 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:15:50 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I did, I don't understand your question.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:16:15 GMT):<br/>
are you asking for a list of plugins that I have installed?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:16:47 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, oh, ok. The picture I uploaded shows builders available when you use conditional step plugin .
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:17:02 GMT):<br/>
in what context?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:17:23 GMT):<br/>
but the list on my own test jenkins only show smaller number of builders, which does not include Trigger/call builds on other projects.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:17:59 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, any job which uses conditional step plugin.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:19:36 GMT):<br/>
if you have a list of plugins that you installed onto sandbox jenkins, I can compare with mine to see what I might have missed.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:19:57 GMT):<br/>
when I search for that exact string, and click a couple times, I end up here: https://plugins.jenkins.io/parameterized-trigger
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:20:29 GMT):<br/>
I have not grabbed the source for it to see if that string is in there, but when I run into problems like this, I find searching on exact strings to be useful
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:20:51 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, hmmm, I do not think it related to that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:21:25 GMT):<br/>
Here is how you see the list.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:21:42 GMT):<br/>
yeah I have about a million plugins.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:21:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm not copy pasting all this spew.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:22:01 GMT):<br/>
from any job which uses conditional step plugin,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:24:11 GMT):<br/>
after Run? you will see Builder which shows a dropdown box.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:24:18 GMT):<br/>
```parameterized-trigger-plugin ry$ grep -R "call builds" *
src/main/java/hudson/plugins/parameterizedtrigger/TriggerBuilder.java:            return "Trigger/call builds on other projects";
```
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:24:38 GMT):<br/>
so that string is in the plugin I pointed you to. I have that plugin installed.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:25:20 GMT):<br/>
oh, ok, let me verify that if I have it installed. will confirm. thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:33:00 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, confirmed. That is the plugin, I installed that, and the option appears in the builder list. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:33:12 GMT):<br/>
you're welcome!

@jeffgarratt please check this when you get some time FAB-7683
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:37:07 GMT):<br/>
will do
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:53:32 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu is logs forced == TRUE?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:54:06 GMT):<br/>
I would assume so, in which case you are hitting a bad  output message, but there was no failure.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:54:52 GMT):<br/>
yes it is set to force.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:54:59 GMT):<br/>
see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/bddtests/environment.py#L47-L48
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:55:11 GMT):<br/>
so the test passed, but the output message is poor, but your good to go
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:55:22 GMT):<br/>
I don't see a test failure but the message is confusing.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:55:27 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:55:27 GMT):<br/>
yes got it.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:55:31 GMT):<br/>
poorly state message
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:55:40 GMT):<br/>
nope..
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 20:29:32 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, we are splitting the big job 0f fabric build,testing into smaller ones, one issue we have is that all these jobs use same gerrit trigger, the verification comes from same user. Is it possible we create multiple gerrit servers which use different credentials? If we can do that, then each patch set will post different verification votes. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 00:48:31 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I'm out for the next few weeks, but what @jwagantall and @jeremyphelps could investigate would be adding a custom vote class - additional columns to the gerrit UI, with distinct jobs voting on different states.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 01:06:27 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, thanks for the info, I will talk to them. thanks.

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 09:52:44 GMT):<br/>
once SDK will update required API tests could be re-enabled

@jwagantall @JeremyMet hi, we have split the big build/test job into smaller jobs, but we are using same gerrit user for posting job results. I would like to know if it is possible to create few more gerrit users so that different job will be using different gerrit users to post build results against a patch set?
</p>
<p><strong>JeremyMet</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:51:46 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:56:35 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall @JeremyMet or at least customized Gerrit Trigger which use different labels.
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:57:58 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  i think the different users might be a little bit of a hassle.. do you want to use different gerrit triggers depending on the job? for example "remerge-fabric" ?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:58:43 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall yeah. I think too many users may not be a good idea. probably multiple gerrit trigger server with customized label?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:59:34 GMT):<br/>
each job uses a different gerrit trigger server which uses customized label. so that the vote will not over write each other?
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 19:06:26 GMT):<br/>
@tongli  can you give me an example? is this getting overwritten now becuase we have the different architectures using the same trigger? would it be better to add a trigger like "recheck-<arch>"?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 19:08:21 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall I am not sure. currently when we use same user (same gerrit trigger) on multiple jobs, the vote from different jobs overwrite each other's verify vote.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 19:08:26 GMT):<br/>
see the picture
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 19:08:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 19:09:03 GMT):<br/>
ideally, different jobs against same patch set have different verified votes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 19:09:32 GMT):<br/>
that is the goal. I am not sure which way is the best. I am sure if we use different users, then it will work. but that is probably too much.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 19:10:39 GMT):<br/>
either it is Verified label be different or the user be different, that is fine, as long as different jobs do not overwrite each other's vote, then we are good.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 19:19:24 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall what do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 21:59:52 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall please let me know what you think.
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:01:03 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I need to check if we can do something similar without the need of different users... not sure if its possible with the different users... let me investigate more on it.. in the meantime is there any RT ticket for tracking this task?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:01:46 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall there is none. where should I go to create one?
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:03:10 GMT):<br/>
yes pls... i will asign it to myself
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:03:26 GMT):<br/>
jira or somewhere else?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:06:07 GMT):<br/>
@tongli @jwagantall use custom labels https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-labels.html#label_custom
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:06:34 GMT):<br/>
yea.. that's what @tongli  also suggested
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:06:42 GMT):<br/>
Just create a label per test tranche
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:07:26 GMT):<br/>
I keep seeing the multiple user thing coming up
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:08:15 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, so we just need to propose one label per build, and create a gerrit trigger server per label, in the customize gerrit review command field adding the label, is that what you suggest?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:09:24 GMT):<br/>
How many builds fire at once? Each slice of builds should be a label
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:10:04 GMT):<br/>
for fabric, we are thinking about 4 builds, they do not fire up at the same time.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:10:19 GMT):<br/>
new patch set only triggers one build job.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:10:56 GMT):<br/>
based on that build results, other jobs get triggered. if the first job fails, no other jobs get triggered.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:11:21 GMT):<br/>
This is something to mess with in the sandbox project
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:11:36 GMT):<br/>
Since rule errors the affect nobody
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:11:41 GMT):<br/>
but if when all the jobs finish, each job should vote on its own label.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:11:50 GMT):<br/>

@rjones, adding custome label requires changes to gerrit project, I do not think we can do that on sandbox.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:16:18 GMT):<br/>
That isn't what I'm saying. Please outline exactly what labels you want-name, ID, in an email to helpdesk@hyper... And it will be before the right people
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:16:41 GMT):<br/>
oh. i c.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:17:13 GMT):<br/>
so we are taking the custom label route, can you confirm that?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:17:41 GMT):<br/>
No I can't confirm that.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:17:53 GMT):<br/>
There may be another solution.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:18:15 GMT):<br/>
Opening the ticket will start the conversation with a wider audience

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:18:15 GMT):<br/>
Opening the ticket will start the conversation with a roofer siding
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 22:18:38 GMT):<br/>
all right, I will open a ticket and put the requirement in.

Just wanted you guys to know that I reviewed the "Getting Started with Fabric CI" documentation with cbf- he was impressed with what he saw, and wants to know if we can "publicize" this documentation here on the #fabric-ci channel as well as the #ci-pipeline channel. Perhaps updating the channel topic in each?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 15:17:44 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu, @jwagantall ^
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 15:18:49 GMT):<br/>
or adding a channel announcement 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 15:19:33 GMT):<br/>
sounds good.... Could you please share the document here.. Will review and see If I can add few more points or Q&A
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 16:04:32 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:04:33 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar looking your comment in FAB-7011, it seems --exclude is for specific rules 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:07:11 GMT):<br/>
but as you know we have to skip few directories from fabric 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:10:17 GMT):<br/>
exclude works for directories also , I think. Have you given a try ? 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:11:16 GMT):<br/>
yes I have tried that https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/fabric-goast-daily-x86_64/11/console
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:11:39 GMT):<br/>
let me check this in detail.. 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:19:21 GMT):<br/>
ok.

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:22:49 GMT):<br/>
I have a strong suspicion yes

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:23:24 GMT):<br/>
Can you check the version of Kafka in the kafka container?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:24:01 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:24:31 GMT):<br/>
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27606065/how-to-find-the-kafka-version-in-linux
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:25:40 GMT):<br/>
I suspect you will find that the Kafka version is v0.9.0.1
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:25:45 GMT):<br/>
ok will check and let you know.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:25:56 GMT):<br/>
yes it should be https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-baseimage/blob/master/images/kafka/Dockerfile.in#L8
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:26:16 GMT):<br/>
will confirm
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:26:23 GMT):<br/>
But I know the CI has been running with v0.10.2.0 for the past several weeks
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:26:36 GMT):<br/>
Because it was pulling the fabric v1.0.0-preview docker image
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:27:54 GMT):<br/>
The `orderer.yaml` in master depends on v0.10.2.0 or newer: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/orderer.yaml#L249
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:28:26 GMT):<br/>
oh that;s the issue.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:29:01 GMT):<br/>
Well, whether the baseimage should be updated to v0.10.2.0 or `orderer.yaml` should be reverted back to v0.9.0.1 I don't have a strong opinion, but there is a mismatch
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:29:02 GMT):<br/>
we have released baseimage and thirdparty images (couchdb, kafka and zookeeper) wih 0.4.4 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:29:16 GMT):<br/>
So my patch https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17001/ is pulling 0.4.4 docker images.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:29:34 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that would do it
</p>

You may be trying to login from a different machine in which case, that public key may not be in the authorized_keys file
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:03:35 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:06:16 GMT):<br/>
I just deleted /tmp/fabric-shim on -18 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:07:32 GMT):<br/>
this worked now.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:08:27 GMT):<br/>
not sure how to fix this issue.. it seems root user is setting on these files, so jenkins is unable to delete these files.. 
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:11:15 GMT):<br/>
Are you including those rm statements in your job?
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:11:44 GMT):<br/>
My script is constantly checking for /tmp/fabric-shim and will remove/delete the directory if it isn't in use
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:12:19 GMT):<br/>
I would leave it to my cleanup script to delete those temp directories
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:12:43 GMT):<br/>
Also... can you paste in your public key? I'd like to see if it's in the authorized_keys file
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:30:13 GMT):<br/>

@rameshthoomu qq for you
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:37:29 GMT):<br/>
the output from the safesql_test.sh file as mentioned in FAB-1446 is being "surpressed" now. I'll re-upload the fabric-ca-verify-x86_64 job again to show you, but, basically it just says "passed". Do you guys have a way that you "bubble up" the script output results to the fvt test that gets triggered?

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:40:04 GMT):<br/>
Seems these errors are not from our code base.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:40:19 GMT):<br/>
I think it's better to ignore vendor module.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:40:53 GMT):<br/>
according to keith smith:
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:40:59 GMT):<br/>
```
It seems to me that we need to evaluate each of the "14 potentially unsafe SQL statements" above to see which pose real threats.
For all that pose a real threat, we need to fix them whether they are in vendor packages or not.
```
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:41:38 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:41:43 GMT):<br/>
even if we don't do anything about them, I'd like to at least see them
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:42:11 GMT):<br/>
because now when the job runs, it doesn't show this output, it just says passed, which basically means that the script successfully ran.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:43:19 GMT):<br/>
try to fail the job if we have errors
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:43:33 GMT):<br/>
I think I can figure out a way to alter the return code, based on what we get as output from the script running, but I'm wondering how you "throw" this output up to the fvt script that's running all of the others.....
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:44:04 GMT):<br/>
right, ok. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:44:41 GMT):<br/>
yeah, maybe I can handle that in the safesql_test.sh script itself. I'll try that.

<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 15:52:12 GMT):<br/>
hmm.  Let take a look at 17333
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 15:55:18 GMT):<br/>
it's happening in fabric-sdk-go projects also.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 15:55:44 GMT):<br/>
I triggered one build from fabric on 23 node and it's working
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 15:59:41 GMT):<br/>
Which build is working? the fabric-ca-verify or fabric-sdk-go?
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 15:59:55 GMT):<br/>
I see all of the failed builds are running on -16.
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:00:10 GMT):<br/>
Can you force the fabric-ca-verify build to run on another minion?
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:00:33 GMT):<br/>
I'm logging into -16 and will try and clean things up, where needed.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:00:44 GMT):<br/>
sure.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:00:58 GMT):<br/>
let me check where fabric-sdk-go builds are running
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:01:03 GMT):<br/>
OK
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:02:17 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:02:39 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:39:42 GMT):<br/>
question: looking around for an example of where the script output is written to a tmp file
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:40:09 GMT):<br/>
I want to parse that file so that I can fail the test if there's error output
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:41:09 GMT):<br/>
@harrijk please let me know once you cleanup workspace in all z nodes.. Will re-trigger all the failed builds 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:41:11 GMT):<br/>
I see CA_CFG_PATH in several of the the FVT tests
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:41:35 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Will do... waiting on -18 to complete
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:41:38 GMT):<br/>
is that a tmp dir that I can write my script output to?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:41:59 GMT):<br/>
ok well, maybe not that path, but the /tmp dir.... 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:42:34 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark which job you are referring? is it from CI job configuration or fabric-ca test configuration?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:42:57 GMT):<br/>
fabric-ca-verify
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:43:30 GMT):<br/>
which runs the fvt-tests make
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:43:51 GMT):<br/>
check with @rennman 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:44:05 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:44:31 GMT):<br/>
right now, when I run my version of the test that includes the safesql script
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:44:36 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu -18 has been cleaned up.  All minions have been cleaned.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:44:47 GMT):<br/>
thanks @harrijk 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:45:02 GMT):<br/>
it suppresses the output, so I need to fail that job if we see warnings in the output, and I'm thinking to write the output to a file, then parse the file before exiting
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:45:36 GMT):<br/>
but I need to know where I can write the file (temporarily)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:46:24 GMT):<br/>
you can write it any where outside of $WORKSPACE
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:47:25 GMT):<br/>
so that the you can take this as build artifact  in Jenkins.. Otherwise, write it in /tmp and mv this to $WORKSPACE
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:47:27 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark  in an effort to reduce the amount of log storage, the test will print a log only if the test fails ... if you insert a bogus exit # (not 0) the test will have presumed to have failed and print the log in the console log

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:47:59 GMT):<br/>
FAB-1446
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:48:02 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, if you have access to the VM that runs the test, all of the logs are stored in /tmp, under the specific testcase name
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:49:20 GMT):<br/>
if you look at that, you'll see that the script runs. we see 'potentially unsafe SQL statements' and as Keith Smith mentioned, we should get the opportunity to evaluate those.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:50:41 GMT):<br/>
even though the exit code is '0' (which says that the script ran successfully) we still need to fail the test because of these 'potentially unsafe' queries in the code. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:51:40 GMT):<br/>
@rennman you're saying that my script output is stored in temp under the test case name, and I can parse the output from there prior to exiting?
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:52:13 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:52:33 GMT):<br/>
thanks. I'll see if I can modify my script to then read the file there.
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:58:28 GMT):<br/>
all of the individual script output to STDOUT is stored in /tmp/fvt-test.results
however, most of the tests in /fvt create their own output logs in their own directory that exploits the feature of fabric-ca_setup.sh which uses CA_CFG_PATH as it's home ... the basic template is to
   set CA_CFG_PATH=<testcasename>
   then start abric-ca_setup.sh
therefore, all related conf files for each are now agglomerated in their own unique directory
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:59:21 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:59:35 GMT):<br/>
so I should export that env var too
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:59:38 GMT):<br/>
in my test 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:00:15 GMT):<br/>
(sounds like)
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:00:58 GMT):<br/>
@rennman ^
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:01:03 GMT):<br/>
however, it is still the script's responsibility to redirect '>' any log files you explicitly generate to that directory
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:01:15 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:01:29 GMT):<br/>
but anything written to STDOUT will show up in /tmp/fvt-test.results
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:01:55 GMT):<br/>
well, sounds like I should redirect, just so that I'm not looking through ALL of fvt-test.results
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:02:05 GMT):<br/>
good plan ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:02:15 GMT):<br/>
cool.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:52:50 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:54:54 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:55:43 GMT):<br/>
yeah, i've seen that twice today
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:57:08 GMT):<br/>
to pass rtd-verify, we need this patch to be merged https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17275/
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:58:57 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu shall I go ahead and +2 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17275 ? I assume you wanted both of those .gitignores in there?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:59:23 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:59:40 GMT):<br/>
I don't see FAB in the commit
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:01:02 GMT):<br/>
Shall I create one and upload new change?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:02:02 GMT):<br/>
i'm ok +2ing without the FAB number in this case since we'd like to unblock CI failures
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:04:35 GMT):<br/>
ok.. This only triggers on documentation change not on every patch set
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:15:57 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart It seems to do it often. I have no idea why. But "reverify" usually takes care of it. 

Although Adnan should have put [ci-skip] under his commit message. That does seem to help (although I've had it fail to verify when using it).

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:17:18 GMT):<br/>
Do we know what the new job rtd-verify does?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:17:50 GMT):<br/>
and will it still be executed for doc changes when we add [ci-skip] ?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:19:55 GMT):<br/>
ci-skip won't work in our jenkins jobs.. seems some security issues with the plugin.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:20:13 GMT):<br/>
so no matter whether you use or not, we trigger the build
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:20:46 GMT):<br/>
regarding rtd-verify job, this is a new job added which triggers when a patch set submitted with .rst or .md changes
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:24:57 GMT):<br/>
access the build logs to see the documentation output..

I´m really looking forward to use TS/Node.js to implement CC ;) :champagne: Would there be a possibility to enable the node.js remote-debugger to debug the code on a running ledger?  Are there any objections?

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 20:50:05 GMT):<br/>
@eugenluft seems the question is not related to CI, better post in #fabric-sdk-node 
</p>
<p><strong>eugenluft</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 20:53:26 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Sorry if i´m wrong, but i saw some discussions about node cc here and i´m not really speaking about the node sdk. So difficult to find the right place :-(
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 08:05:21 GMT):<br/>
@eugenluft as you probably know the node.js cc is new and I guess we don't have a dedicated channel for it but you'd still be better off taking your question to the sdk channel than this channel which really has nothing to do with it
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 08:06:16 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I see the build on https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17333/ was restarted and succeeded - thank you
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 08:06:45 GMT):<br/>
however, the vote didn't seem to register and it still says -1
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 11:16:32 GMT):<br/>
well, @smithbk restarted the build so that will take care of it hopefully
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 11:18:28 GMT):<br/>
yes, it was weird ... never seen the build succeed but not register
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 12:02:07 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu  In addition to rtd-verify, I see another new one byfn-verify that is failing in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/16719/ .  Could you announce on this channel when major CI job changes are done and what the job does at high level?  I still don't understand whether these should be ignored or not.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 12:04:04 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk the build was restarted by hand and I can only guess that this process didn't involve the voting registration
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 13:19:02 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart rtd-verify was added in fabric builds, triggers on .rst or .md changes. But the `byfn-verify` is part of the `fabric-samples` repository and it's not a new job.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 13:19:56 GMT):<br/>
sure will announce here, if I add new jobs..

yes if not there.. you can the same in post build action.. If you don't find any archive the artifacts, then pls add the correct path of the log
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 14:37:57 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:34:46 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu sure. that was an example that I saw
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:35:04 GMT):<br/>
but, I'm trying to determine what the correct path is....
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:35:23 GMT):<br/>
just give `**/*.log`
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:35:35 GMT):<br/>
oh ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:35:43 GMT):<br/>
I'll try that now.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:36:12 GMT):<br/>
make sure your log file is placed outside WORKSPACE directory.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:36:33 GMT):<br/>
I'm writing it like this:
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:37:21 GMT):<br/>
`safesql -v ../cmd/fabric-ca-client ../cmd/fabric-ca-server | tee $CA_CFG_PATH/safesql_tests.log`
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:37:51 GMT):<br/>
and that env variable is defined as `export CA_CFG_PATH="/tmp/safesql"`
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:38:37 GMT):<br/>
by adding **/*.log I should be able to see the log file in the build artifacts?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:38:37 GMT):<br/>
by adding `**/*.log` I should be able to see the log file in the build artifacts?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:38:58 GMT):<br/>
ok.. That won;t work. you have to move .log file from /tmp to WORKSPACE
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:39:13 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:40:21 GMT):<br/>
I don't seed to use that $CA_CFG_PATH env var at all then it sounds like...
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:43:38 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu so this in my script now:
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:43:43 GMT):<br/>
```
safesql -v ../cmd/fabric-ca-client ../cmd/fabric-ca-server | tee $WORKSPACE/safesql_tests.log
```
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:44:52 GMT):<br/>
and then in the fabric-ca-verify job, I added:
```
- archive:
          artifacts: '**/*.log'
          fingerprint: true
          default-excludes: false
          allow-empty: true
```
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:45:13 GMT):<br/>
under `builders:` is this correct ?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:46:16 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=YmX8swjf8pCcN3JJz) @jtclark ??
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:47:37 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu .... ok... where is the correct place to add the `archive` entry?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:48:22 GMT):<br/>
```
builders:
      - verify-commit-message
      - clean-environment
      - 'ca-golang-environment-{arch}'
      - output-environment
      - ca-unit-tests
```
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:48:47 GMT):<br/>
would it be underneath builders? or publishers? or somewhere else?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:49:50 GMT):<br/>
which one your command or Artifacts?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:50:01 GMT):<br/>
the artifacts entry above
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:50:03 GMT):<br/>
not my script.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:50:10 GMT):<br/>
my script goes in fabric-ca.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:50:22 GMT):<br/>
As I said, it should be in Postbuild actions.. so should be in Publishers
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:51:08 GMT):<br/>
awesome, thx
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:59:52 GMT):<br/>
I'm updated the job, and the script. testing it now on the sandbox.

@rameshthoomu the build finished - took 54mins - don't see the artifacts though....
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:08:37 GMT):<br/>
ok can you show me the build
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:09:14 GMT):<br/>
sure

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:10:38 GMT):<br/>
I don't see archive-artifacts section in post build action
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:10:45 GMT):<br/>
do you want me to add?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:13:25 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu that's strange.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:13:33 GMT):<br/>
I added this under publishers
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:13:40 GMT):<br/>
```
publishers:
      - lf-infra-publish
      - ca-code-coverage-report
      - archive:

          allow-empty: true
```
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:13:54 GMT):<br/>
then re-updated the jjb
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:14:00 GMT):<br/>
unless that's not correct....
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:15:17 GMT):<br/>
that's not correct
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:15:41 GMT):<br/>
how should this look?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:17:00 GMT):<br/>
do like this 

```
publishers:
      - lf-infra-publish
      - ca-code-coverage-report
      - dockerlog

```
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:17:12 GMT):<br/>
ah
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:17:15 GMT):<br/>
use that macro basically
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:17:47 GMT):<br/>
I'll try it
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 18:45:02 GMT):<br/>

after I updated the job with the - dockerlog entry

I should've went back in and changed the repo.

Hi @rameshthoomu - picking up where I left off yesterday on getting the script output logged and accessible as an archive artifact.... the job provide the archive, but it's empty. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 15:53:54 GMT):<br/>
try the same in your local machine.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:06:06 GMT):<br/>
ok.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:06:20 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:06:36 GMT):<br/>
I talked to @tongli a little bit about ansible/cello tasks
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:06:43 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:35:33 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:37:18 GMT):<br/>
I think we have JIRA tasks assigned.. let;s focus on completing them.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:37:47 GMT):<br/>
feel free to create jira tasks.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:38:29 GMT):<br/>
we have fabric-ci & fabric-build components in JIRA to track all ci tasks/issues
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:44:42 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark are you ok with the plan?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:45:14 GMT):<br/>
that's fine.

I
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:45:15 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:51:18 GMT):<br/>
any update on that?

I'm about to test adding the execute testcase for couchDB
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:57:20 GMT):<br/>
so, trying to get it to work
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 17:36:57 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=G8FpfTWbtqecjB8zP) @jtclark  There are already some tests defined in fabric-test/regression/daily/systest_pte.py.  If you look in fabric-test/regression/daily/runDailyTestSuite.sh, you will see a line commented out. I think you just need to start by uncommenting that line, run it on your environment, and then try it in a sandbox from a jenkins process and submit it. If I remember correclty, the problem is that it was failing when it was run by the CI. `#py.test -v --junitxml results_systest_pte.xml systest_pte.py
`

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sun, 04 Feb 2018 13:23:45 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu RTD CRs are still failing due to fabric-rtd-verify-master.   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17481/ What needs to be done?   Do we simply need to merge https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17275/ ?  I suspect it is not getting merged because maintainers don't understand what is going on with the RTD build and CI and how tox.ini fits in.  Can you elaborate here?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 04 Feb 2018 22:40:51 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart tox.ini is the configuration file to build documentation in RTD format. `rtd-verify` CI job looks for the documentation changes in the patchset and triggers the build. Once the build is triggered, it looks for the tox.ini file and build documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 03:52:39 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu so what needs to be done to fix the failures? Simply merge 17275?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 03:53:04 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:17:29 GMT):<br/>

Hi @jtclark any progress on FAB-1446 & PTE integration.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:34:42 GMT):<br/>
I’m OOTO today. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:34:51 GMT):<br/>
Still working on both. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:44:46 GMT):<br/>
I’m trying to test the PTE integration locally
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:45:28 GMT):<br/>
As suggested. Seeing what fails after I uncomment the tests
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:46:22 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks for the update.. let me know if you need any help on these.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:46:26 GMT):<br/>
take care
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:47:58 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu the main thing on 1446 is getting the output of the script right.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:48:22 GMT):<br/>
I guess I'll try to test that locally tomorrow as well, b/c with the sandbox
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:48:46 GMT):<br/>
I can't get the log file to "show up" as an artifact.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:49:21 GMT):<br/>
once I get that part working, I think it should be pretty easy to say pass on "no SQL threats" and fail on anything else.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 22:49:39 GMT):<br/>
that's the plan on that one.

@rameshthoomu so, I'm working on 1446 again this morning. I want to make sure that I am sending the output to the correct location
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:12:28 GMT):<br/>
so that it can be picked up

right now, this is what's inside my version of the safesql_test.sh 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:13:28 GMT):<br/>
Better test this in local machine and implement the same in Jenkins..

<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:13:48 GMT):<br/>
ok.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:14:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:15:43 GMT):<br/>
that sounds like what I'm doing, yes.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:15:45 GMT):<br/>
please inform the same in #fabric-ca channel.. Please make sure fabric-ca contributors are aware of this change..

hello, it seems something wrong with the jenkins. I can't open https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node8-verify-x86_64/349/

@rameshthoomu I think we *finally* have 1446 in a workable state:
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:22:57 GMT):<br/>
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/fabric-ca-verify-x86_64/2/console
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:23:17 GMT):<br/>
you can see that the test fails (as expected) and the output is given in the console output of the job.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:23:46 GMT):<br/>
I'll go ahead and update the patch
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:23:58 GMT):<br/>
and if you guys can review, that'd be awesome. :-)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:25:20 GMT):<br/>
before we enable this in production jenkins please check with @smithbk @rennman 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:26:12 GMT):<br/>
I see the test is failed in sandbox, if we enable the same this will fail all the builds.. right ?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:26:55 GMT):<br/>
yes. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:27:00 GMT):<br/>
I think what we will probably want
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:27:09 GMT):<br/>
to add... is a skip option eventually
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:27:19 GMT):<br/>
@rennman feel free to chime in
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:28:08 GMT):<br/>
yep ... I think Keith will have to weigh in ... in the jira he alluded to the fact that not all of them may be worth fixing, so someone from DEV will have o do some analysis of the results before we proceed
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:28:18 GMT):<br/>
+1
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:28:37 GMT):<br/>
and I think if the deem the "failures" to be false positives
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:28:37 GMT):<br/>
and I think if they deem the "failures" to be false positives
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:28:52 GMT):<br/>
we should probably add some sort of skip in a recheck (or something)
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:29:37 GMT):<br/>
but I'd like Keith to weigh in as @rennman suggests....
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:29:44 GMT):<br/>
once the 'baseline' is set we need to fasttrack it before someone injects more errors. I always find myself chasing my tail trying to get the test in before someone pr-emptively breaks it 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:30:17 GMT):<br/>
or I would say, create a bug and ask developer to fix those issues before we enable them.. meanwhile run this job daily if it;s ok to everyone..
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:30:32 GMT):<br/>
that's a good idea
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:30:56 GMT):<br/>
before we "enable them" <-- you mean add the test as is
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:31:06 GMT):<br/>
and then ask them to fix before they end up in a release?
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:31:21 GMT):<br/>
yes ... link the bug it to the existing jira item and put the ball in DEV court
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:31:37 GMT):<br/>
agreed. I think that's in concert w/ what Keith was saying
</p>
<p><strong>rennman</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:31:54 GMT):<br/>
they can prioritize as they see fit
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:31:55 GMT):<br/>
we should see the failures and have them addressed by the dev team
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:32:23 GMT):<br/>
still it might be good to offer a  --skip option b/c they *could* potentially identify something as a false positive
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:32:34 GMT):<br/>
(or false negative?) :-)
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 21:33:06 GMT):<br/>
for now, I'll submit my patch and let them review.

<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 23:15:29 GMT):<br/>
@nfrunza  you dont need additional permissions, just as long as you are a registered user you should be able to push a change into Gerrit

I think this is working now. thanks

<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:36:20 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu just so you know where I am with this JIRA ticket: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5283
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:38:53 GMT):<br/>
Ok I see comments your comments in the JIRA.. Instead of setting up another machine, i would suggest you to use sandbox. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:39:15 GMT):<br/>
anyway you already setup your local dev environment.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:40:18 GMT):<br/>
If you see @scottz comments in the JIRA, 5283 is working as expected in local machine but fails the same in Jenkins.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:41:03 GMT):<br/>
better you use sandbox to integrate PTE tests in daily test suite.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:44:32 GMT):<br/>
understood
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:44:43 GMT):<br/>
but, if I'm testing new PTE tests
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:44:50 GMT):<br/>
I want to know that what I'm doing is going to work
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:44:59 GMT):<br/>
before I submit patches and such
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:45:30 GMT):<br/>
I figured that setting up my own environment for testing is less resource intensive on the sandbox
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:45:55 GMT):<br/>
when you say, "fails the same in Jenkins"
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:46:15 GMT):<br/>
are you saying that the failures I'm now getting on my sandbox are the same as we're seeing on the sandbox?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:46:24 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu ^^^^^^^
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:50:26 GMT):<br/>
No.. Jenkins sandbox has that setup already.. all you have to do is just keep these lines in `runDailyTestSuite.sh`
```
echo "========== System Test Performance Stress tests driven by PTE tool..."
cp -r ../../tools/PTE $WORKSPACE/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/fabric-sdk-node/test/

couple of questions:
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 14:57:11 GMT):<br/>
1) There are a couple JIRA tasks that are no longer needed. I have them in the UNVERIFIED state, but is there a way to simply remove them? @rjones, @rameshthoomu, @jwagantall 
</p>
<p><strong>gskerry</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 17:13:37 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 17:58:34 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark I saw an alert from you about a JIRA you needed help with but I can't find the message. help?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 17:59:33 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I removed it. @rameshthoomu helped me via DM. the question was about removing JIRA tasks that are no longer needed
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 17:59:48 GMT):<br/>
basically, move them to DONE and add a comment
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:00:02 GMT):<br/>
unless there is actually a procedure for removing them....
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:01:21 GMT):<br/>
oh OK. No, they shouldn't be deleted. The only ones I've deleted were from spammers
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:01:25 GMT):<br/>
_I think_
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:01:33 GMT):<br/>
sounds good

Hi @rameshthoomu - quick update on FAB-5283 - I ran the fabric-test-daily-390x job again yesterday with the 'while loop' you suggested that I add in? The job still bombs. :-(
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 17:53:44 GMT):<br/>
Pls work with Dongming
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 17:54:36 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 17:54:43 GMT):<br/>
I pinged him about it
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 17:54:53 GMT):<br/>
waiting to hear back, just wanted to update you
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 17:54:59 GMT):<br/>
I talked to him yesterday
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 17:55:13 GMT):<br/>
Sure .. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 17:55:24 GMT):<br/>
and we discovered that the FAB-3833-2i scenario doesn't run the test cases in order
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 17:55:58 GMT):<br/>
if you remember, we saw the query test run first, instead of invoke
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 17:56:13 GMT):<br/>
anyway, I'll work with @dongming on it.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 20:55:51 GMT):<br/>
@tongli @rameshthoomu what I propose to do is to enable you two to be able to use https://jenkins-new.hyperledger.org/ as a sandbox with the provision that you only build jobs that trigger on changes in the `lf-sandbox` repo.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 20:56:56 GMT):<br/>
@tongli @rameshthoomu you will be able to create manual jobs, and use JJB, as you would in https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/, but only against `lf-sandbox` (or a new test repo, if you'd like). I'd prefer to use `lf-sandbox` since it already has a few custom voting options
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 20:57:01 GMT):<br/>
Ok. So these labels have been created?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 20:57:26 GMT):<br/>
in `lf-sandbox`, we have three additional custom labels.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 20:57:55 GMT):<br/>
if you can get your workflow working on `lf-sandbox` repo then you can migrate it to real repos without my intervention.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 20:58:30 GMT):<br/>
@tongli @rameshthoomu what I want to do is enable you to work on this without my being critical path, and to leave the current sandbox for people that can test without the gerrit trigger.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 20:58:50 GMT):<br/>
So how do we post vote against the label? I was thinking using the gerrit trigger.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 20:58:57 GMT):<br/>
enabling the gerrit trigger in the /sandbox/ would not work
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 20:59:08 GMT):<br/>
I like that. I think that will be the only question I have at present.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 20:59:16 GMT):<br/>
in the job configuration, you can choose how it votes. let me show you
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 20:59:34 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:01:01 GMT):<br/>
if you go to https://jenkins-new.hyperledger.org/job/step-0/configure and select gerrit trigger -> advanced, you can see where to put in custom votes. they will look like this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43848896/5453
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:01:11 GMT):<br/>
(I still need to add you two to the jenkins ACL give me a second)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:03:56 GMT):<br/>
OK you two should have the same access to jenkins-new as you have for /sandbox/. Do not create jobs with triggers against any project except `lf-sandbox`, OK?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:04:32 GMT):<br/>
@tongli @rameshthoomu I attached a `hyp-p` node for faster turn arounds on shell scripts
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:04:51 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Easy enough.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:04:55 GMT):<br/>
Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:05:28 GMT):<br/>
sure. I hope this unblocks you. I set the rules for `lf-sandbox` to 2+2, I think. If you need a vote on a change let me know.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:05:40 GMT):<br/>
K
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:05:55 GMT):<br/>
Custom labels are already created right?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:06:09 GMT):<br/>
this is the command I was using to vote: ```ssh -p 29418 ryjones@gerrit.hyperledger.org gerrit review 18797,2 -l Docs=-1 -l Unit-Tests=1 -l Code-Review=-1
```
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:06:15 GMT):<br/>
for instance
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:06:32 GMT):<br/>
to vote from my desktop
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:09:12 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @tongli if you look here: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/project:lf-sandbox you will see custom labels
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:10:38 GMT):<br/>
cool.. Will create a workflow in jenkins-new using lf-sandbox and let you know the update
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:10:56 GMT):<br/>
thank you. I will be watching closely. I have great interest in this.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:11:18 GMT):<br/>
how many x nodes available in jenkins-new? 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:12:14 GMT):<br/>
10
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:12:40 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu the hyp-x nodes have a 30 minute timeout so you can re-use nodes for faster turn around
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:13:16 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:14:07 GMT):<br/>
I suggest using the hyp-p node as much as you can, since it will be there
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:14:13 GMT):<br/>
but, do as you will.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:18:03 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu should I delete the three jobs I have there?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:18:27 GMT):<br/>
you can keep them.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:19:44 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I deleted my changes in Gerrit, so you will need to push a couple test changes

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:06:36 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Capabilities are new in 1.1, there should be nothing related to Capabilities in the release-1.0 CI.  Can you tell where it is coming from?  @jyellick is the Capabilities expert if you need any help.

In my sandbox, I have tested above patch on fabric (release branch), fabric-ca(release branch), fabric-sdk-node (release branch) and fabric-sdk-java (1.0.1 as there is no release branch).. I am not seeing fabric-sdk-node failures but I see fabric-sdk-java e2e tests are failing..

ignore fabric-sdk-java for a moment...   previously all the 1.0.x CI should use release branch of every project.   recently release was cloned into release-1.0 for fabric and fabric-ca.  we will do the same for fabric-sdk-node shortly. at that time, all the 1.0.x CI should use release-1.0 branch of every project.

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:22:08 GMT):<br/>
release branch will be sunset once we confirm release-1.0 branches are working properly

@rameshthoomu 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:24:46 GMT):<br/>
yes that helps
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:25:49 GMT):<br/>
so, you want me to disable fabric-sdk-java tests temporarily from fabric-e2e ?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:34:29 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu can you disable fabric-sdk-java e2e in the 1.0.x CI only?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:35:22 GMT):<br/>
sure will do that.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:35:43 GMT):<br/>
thx.  and you want us to go ahead and create the release-1.0 branch for fabric-sdk-node? 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:36:20 GMT):<br/>
and till you create 1.0.x for sdk-node, will clone from release branch for all 1.0.x builds
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:36:42 GMT):<br/>
sounds good.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:37:21 GMT):<br/>
we'll ask @bretharrison to do the `release` to `release-1.0` clone in fabric-sdk-node, since he is lead maintainer on that one
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:37:59 GMT):<br/>
sure.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:39:21 GMT):<br/>
also we'll ask @bretharrison to create `release-1.1` branch from `master` very soon.  @rameshthoomu does anything need to be updated in 1.1 CI when that change is made?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:39:54 GMT):<br/>
to ensure all the 1.1 CI is aligned at `release-1.1` branch?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:39:54 GMT):<br/>
to ensure all the 1.1 CI is aligned at `release-1.1` branches?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:40:52 GMT):<br/>
to be clear - we will publish all 1.1 release artifacts from the new `release-1.1` branches
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:40:52 GMT):<br/>
to be clear - we will publish all 1.1 GA release artifacts from the new `release-1.1` branches
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:40:52 GMT):<br/>
to be clear - we will publish all 1.1 GA release artifacts from the new `release-1.1` branches (expected end of next week)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:42:31 GMT):<br/>
I have to update the CI configuration to checkout to the specific branch..Once the node is ready with branches, then we are good to go..
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:42:43 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:43:02 GMT):<br/>
now, concerning fabric-sdk-java, let's take that up over in the fabric-sdk-java channel
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 03:43:20 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:49:37 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 why not just leave them there as artifacts of the past?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:50:19 GMT):<br/>
I don't have strong feelings about it either way. Just wondering
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:51:17 GMT):<br/>
I would prefer to delete the `release` branches, as it is very confusing to see `release` and `release-1.0` and `release-1.1`.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:52:39 GMT):<br/>
release was created directly from the tip of release-1.0 - so we have the entire history there

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:36:59 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, using the gerrit review command, I assume you really mean doing that in the gerrit server page, not at the job advanced page, is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:37:58 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I'm not sure exactly that you mean
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:39:20 GMT):<br/>
trying to figure out what you suggested in terms using the customized labels. All I can figure out is using the gerrit server advanced page on jenkins to do that. at each job gerrit trigger, there is no where to add gerrit review command.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:39:59 GMT):<br/>
@tongli if you go here: https://jenkins-new.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-docs-build-x86_64/configure
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:40:47 GMT):<br/>
yes. I am there.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:40:58 GMT):<br/>
click `gerrit trigger` tab, then click advanced
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:41:00 GMT):<br/>
looking at the gerrit trigger advanced page.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:41:16 GMT):<br/>
yes, that is where you would put it
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:41:32 GMT):<br/>
use URL to post field?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:42:09 GMT):<br/>
each job has this field customized, is that what you are saying?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:42:27 GMT):<br/>
no you put in tokenized gerrit commands. I gave you a link to that previously, on stack overflow
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:42:39 GMT):<br/>
you'll be customizing the verified stanza
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:42:54 GMT):<br/>
what you put in there will look like what I pasted before
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:43:06 GMT):<br/>
like this ```ssh -i /path/to/jenkins/.ssh/key -p 29418 user@gerrit-host gerrit review ${change},${patch} --label=customLabel=${result} --message=${message}```?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:43:34 GMT):<br/>
no, it will look like everything after and including the gerrit command
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:44:31 GMT):<br/>
it will look like `gerrit review <CHANGE>,<PATCH> ...`
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:45:03 GMT):<br/>
```gerrit review ${change},${patch} --label=customLabel=${result} --message=${message}``` this?

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:49:29 GMT):<br/>

what you pasted above does not look like a url.

I don't know how to make it more plain
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:50:00 GMT):<br/>
It isn't a URL
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:50:39 GMT):<br/>
that article talks about how to customize the gerrit server using customized command.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:50:57 GMT):<br/>
Read more closely
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:51:09 GMT):<br/>
which is different from the each job's advanced configuration section.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:53:11 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, please tell me which field you are talking about on the advanced section of gerrit trigger and how the content should be formed.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:54:39 GMT):<br/>
I just did? That answer does? It will need to be different depending on the result of the build, for each field
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:55:37 GMT):<br/>
no. it was not clear to me. that post is all about using it in the gerrit trigger configuration, not at a specific job configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:56:39 GMT):<br/>
it also shows why it was not possible doing it at the job level.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:07:25 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu for release-1.0 CI topic... `release-1.0` branches have been created for the SDKs.  please use `release-1.0` branch for all 1.0.x related CI
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:07:58 GMT):<br/>
yes.. I am working on that.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:42:37 GMT):<br/>
@tongli you were right, I was wrong, follow this example please: https://jenkins-new.hyperledger.org/job/votes/configure look at the bottom stanza
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:43:18 GMT):<br/>
@tongli you should have some logic to vote on the values you care about per job
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:44:53 GMT):<br/>
that makes sense to me. thanks for correct that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:45:01 GMT):<br/>
@ry. see above.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:45:23 GMT):<br/>
@rjones see above.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:47:28 GMT):<br/>
@tongli the next thing to do is to add the comments and the like, but I think you are unblocked for development, correct? I apologize for the delay
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:47:51 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I needed to add the jenkins user to the ACL for the new labels
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:48:00 GMT):<br/>
@rjones doing that means not using gerrit trigger to post the votes. it is using the script to do that.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:48:55 GMT):<br/>
basically ssh remote api call against gerrit.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:48:58 GMT):<br/>
I think you still get the vote on exit
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:49:22 GMT):<br/>
but you can over-ride that, no?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:50:07 GMT):<br/>
@tongli please also see my earlier comments about parsing the commit message. I'll add an example
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:52:27 GMT):<br/>
not sure. gerrit trigger should vote the last. but it does not vote on the customized labels , so I guess it is ok.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:55:01 GMT):<br/>
@tongli take a look at the last stanza of https://jenkins-new.hyperledger.org/job/votes/configure now, there is some logic you will need to write to parse commit messages
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:55:39 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I was more concerned with having, say, the docs job only vote on DOCS label, for instance, and not VERIFIED label
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:56:25 GMT):<br/>
if the doc job vote on some other labels, what does it mean though?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:57:01 GMT):<br/>
I think it is up to you to decide.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:57:41 GMT):<br/>
there must be a way to tell the gerrit trigger to not vote on a label. let me goof with it
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:59:26 GMT):<br/>
vote 0 should be that.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 18:00:05 GMT):<br/>
@tongli look at configuration now. You can tell it to skip a vote.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 18:05:09 GMT):<br/>
@tongli look at gerrit trigger advanced. I said it should not vote in any condition, since we are handling that
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 18:06:07 GMT):<br/>
i got it.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 18:06:39 GMT):<br/>
@tongli OK. are you completely unblocked? I will leave this example voting job, and that change, around if you like
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 18:07:16 GMT):<br/>
yeah. got it, I think that we are good for now. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 18:07:30 GMT):<br/>
sure thing.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 18:09:35 GMT):<br/>
@tongli when you get to the point that you want to add your final labels, and you have the names you want, please open a ticket helpdesk@hyperledger.org and tell me exactly what you want.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 18:10:06 GMT):<br/>
great. like that. thanks and will do.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=pjPdz8CAgwNu83ruX) @dave.enyeart this has to apply to `release-1.1` branch for all `1.1.x`related CI
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:38:06 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu agreed, but `release-1.1` branch is not yet created for the SDKs
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:38:20 GMT):<br/>
yes.. We have to do that.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:39:02 GMT):<br/>
I have pushed a change https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/18981/ to update the CI configuration
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:39:25 GMT):<br/>
```
set +e
BRANCH_NAME=$(echo $GERRIT_BRANCH | grep 'release*')
echo "-----> $BRANCH_NAME"
if [ ! -z "$BRANCH_NAME" ]; then
      echo "-----> Checkout to $GERRIT_BRANCH branch"
      git checkout $GERRIT_BRANCH
fi
set -e
echo "-----> $GERRIT_BRANCH"
```
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:39:30 GMT):<br/>
we plan to do that for the SDKs around release day.  do we need to do that prior?  for example to ensure all the tests and publishing works well from release-1.1?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:40:16 GMT):<br/>
yes it's better to do before to make sure release-1.1 is good across the repos.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:40:35 GMT):<br/>
makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:42:21 GMT):<br/>
@bretharrison are you ready to create release-1.1 branch from master for fabric-sdk-node?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:42:50 GMT):<br/>
i believe you have permission to do that here https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/fabric-sdk-node,branches
</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:43:20 GMT):<br/>
No, I would prefer to put in a few more changes
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:43:24 GMT):<br/>
it simply means any subsequent CRs will have to be cherry picked to both
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:43:41 GMT):<br/>
we need to close down fabric-sdk-node... how about on monday?
</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:43:42 GMT):<br/>
right, could we wait till Monday
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 21:43:48 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 22:09:44 GMT):<br/>
besides isn't your grep pattern wrong ?   `e*`   really mean  optionally as meany `e`s on the end ? 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 22:09:44 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 22:11:45 GMT):<br/>
BRANCH_NAME=$(echo $GERRIT_BRANCH | grep 'release-.*')   like dot asterisk  match option anything else on the end ?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 22:12:53 GMT):<br/>
I think you can just go with `BRANCH_NAME=$(echo $GERRIT_BRANCH | grep 'release-')`
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 22:20:27 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 22:33:14 GMT):<br/>
probably `grep "^release-"` , @rickr ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 22:33:14 GMT):<br/>
probably `grep `^release-` , @rickr ?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 23:49:10 GMT):<br/>
Maybe if you expect thing like "test-release-3.1.0 :)

</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Sat, 17 Mar 2018 16:20:16 GMT):<br/>
I suspect that one of the builds failed miserably and the usual cleaning out of docker containers and docker images at the start of each job didn't work due to the weird state that docker was in.
</p>

@rjones the above error is popping up in most of the builds.. Sometimes if re-trigger build may fix the issue temporarily
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 11:44:37 GMT):<br/>
@sykesm could you please re-trigger the build through gerrit comment `reverify-x`
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 11:44:55 GMT):<br/>
I've been doing that for two days across 13 CRs. It's no longer scalable.

<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 11:45:55 GMT):<br/>
If your around this morning, would also love to get your input on a makefile change that I'm having issues with. Completely unrelated and only if you have some time...

Any objections to my manually overriding CI's -1 here? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/19083/ This has been verified locally, a simple inspection of the code shows there's no reason why it would trigger a CI failure, and most importantly -- I've been reverifying for several days now w/o success. (Life's too short for that!)

Hi @rameshthoomu - I hit https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-9171. Simple fix is at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/19783/, but I'm curious how this made it past CI, but I am encountering it in my local build?

It claims there is a trailing whitespace, but, when I look at the CR: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/19969/2/sampleconfig/configtx.yaml#149 I see no trailing whitespace

I do see a couple bits of whitespace that are trailing in a section of that file which I did not modify, but it seems like all builds should be failing then?

As a general point, I don't think we should have anything in CI that cannot be executed as part of a local build.  Perhaps there is some broader plan here I am missing, but it seems like CI should essentially consist of a single line calling into the project to execute the tests.  The notion that to discover why CI is failing, I need to pull a separate repo and attempt to find the failing test seems problematic to me.

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 21:01:44 GMT):<br/>
(I know for instance, I've mentioned this with respect to the 'fabric-samples' repository.  That there's no way to test a change locally to see if it will pass CI without going and finding the corresponding script in another repo and executing it)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 21:03:09 GMT):<br/>
Agree @jyellick.. Will call these extra checks from fabric make file and will create single point script to call from CI
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 22:32:58 GMT):<br/>
will the unit test job work anytime soon?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 22:35:55 GMT):<br/>
CI is just killing me.  I'm sure people who are doing more than me are even more frustrated
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 22:48:43 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 are these inconsistent failures? I have 5 FAB's created on these failures.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 22:49:24 GMT):<br/>
not sure what's going wrong.. someone has to verify the those failures.. 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 31 Mar 2018 10:16:32 GMT):<br/>
the main thing that was failing was pulling down images .... I'm aware of the test flakes and am trying to fix a few of those, for example

https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/19977
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/20015

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 14:14:35 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I am on drive now.. can’t help you now.. will check build settings once I get access to machine
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 14:14:43 GMT):<br/>
sure no pressure
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:52:37 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm do you want all emails turned off?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:52:46 GMT):<br/>
not all emails....
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:52:55 GMT):<br/>
it used to be jenkins sent no emails.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:53:07 GMT):<br/>
so that would be a return to the previous way it was
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:53:13 GMT):<br/>
jenkins sent me emails when i was a watcher for a change set
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:53:21 GMT):<br/>
i.e someone commented something
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:53:50 GMT):<br/>
can we remove emails from the job builder only? 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:54:14 GMT):<br/>
OK. I need to be more clear. The emails come from gerrit. the previous way this worked was no jenkins comment triggered an email from gerrit.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:54:37 GMT):<br/>
I'm proposing a return to that - no jenkins emails about job status.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:54:58 GMT):<br/>
seems right to me
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:55:23 GMT):<br/>
OK. give me a bit
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 15:55:44 GMT):<br/>
you can have even 8 bits

@yacovm did you get an email from the start of this build https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-unit-tests-x86_64/673/ ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 20:52:13 GMT):<br/>
It's the first build to use the `--notify=NON` thing
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 20:53:58 GMT):<br/>
ignore that.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 20:59:06 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I'll rerun your build in a bit, OK?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 21:05:39 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm retriggered, sorry for the turbulence
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 22:44:47 GMT):<br/>
I don't know... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 22:46:01 GMT):<br/>
so - my last email from it was 2:29 EST
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 22:46:43 GMT):<br/>
it won't pass the build because I have some problem in the UT that doesn't manifest in my local environment, something with files I guess. I'll fix it today/tomorrow and will see if it keeps spamming me. thanks @rjones

Hello everyone! In first-network example from https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples, I couldn't find the network-config.yaml, but I can find it from "balance-transfer" network. So, I am wondering where/how I can find/generate the network-config.yaml file?

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 16:27:11 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti right now the script will check for all the files in the patchset.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 16:28:03 GMT):<br/>
will update script to ignore vendor files.. but for now, please fix the trailing space in the license file.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 16:28:35 GMT):<br/>
if possible, could you please create a FAB item in fabric-ci component.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 17:00:25 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu you should just check white space in there delta
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 17:01:18 GMT):<br/>
yes that;s what the script is doing now.. but the request is to ignore the vendor files

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=mu99oPDwaRpmb84GpQ) @rjones I have addressed your comment 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 17:03:21 GMT):<br/>
I had to fix master a few months ago because of a line ending issue in a vendor file
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 17:04:10 GMT):<br/>
If there is a white space issue in a vendor file it will still break the build
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 17:05:45 GMT):<br/>
yes.. that's true.. It's better to add this check as a target in fabric make file
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 17:06:15 GMT):<br/>
and developer have to check `make basic-checks` & `make unit-tests` before they push a change set to gerrit.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 17:06:29 GMT):<br/>
Agreed
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 17:07:08 GMT):<br/>
right now, I see issues with license check.. that;s the reason i have disabled `make basic-checks` target from CI and enabled only `make linter` and `make unit-tests`

@rameshthoomu https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/20081/ keeps failing, but works like a charm locally (I've explored multiple variations of byfn, eyfn, fabcar, etc and everything works as expected. However, I also note that for the fabric-samples build we are building fabric. This seems wrong. I thought that we were going to leverage tagged binaries and images from a previous build of fabric (eg a stable nightly build).

<p><strong>sheehan</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 15:03:10 GMT):<br/>
Hey @rameshthoomu - how can we add check_license.sh to the CI process? People keep checking stuff in that does not pass this check and it causes 'make all' to fail on our local systems. I'll be happy to add it if you point me to the script I need to update
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 15:05:08 GMT):<br/>
We have this added in basic-checks make target.. recently I have added and removed because I see issues in License files.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 15:05:48 GMT):<br/>
I thinks it’s better to fix all the issues which basic-checks target is reporting and enable the same in CI script 
</p>
<p><strong>sheehan</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 15:08:33 GMT):<br/>
sounds like a good plan. I'll report back here when issues are fixed

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 19:02:18 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, I would like to add a new cello image, still in the works, my understanding is that once I have the dockerfile checked in merged, I should ask you to create an automated build on docker hub, please let me know if that is correct.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 19:03:20 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. I think those are two orthogonal requests.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 19:03:42 GMT):<br/>
If you mean `packer` image, that has nothing to do with dockerhub.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 19:04:31 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, I mean a docker image like this one.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 19:04:56 GMT):<br/>
https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/cello-engine/
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 19:05:28 GMT):<br/>
I see. just open a helpdesk ticket
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 19:07:09 GMT):<br/>
so, once the Dockerfile is there, i open the ticket with the project url and docker file path, then after you done your part, the image will be automatically built when there is a change to the file, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 19:11:39 GMT):<br/>
@rjones
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 20:21:43 GMT):<br/>
I've never looked into exactly how or when docker hub rebuilds. I usually just point out at the repo.

Hi, I am curious why are CI tests failing intermittently for fabric-ca? I am having to do a bunch of reverifies. See: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20247/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 16:49:13 GMT):<br/>
@skarim looking into this.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 16:52:57 GMT):<br/>
I see multiple failures on this patch but the last one says gerrit timeout which will fix after today's upgrade https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-tsc/2018-April/001450.html
</p>
<p><strong>skarim</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 16:54:15 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Yeah, the end-2-end fails occasionally too and then will pass other times
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 16:58:43 GMT):<br/>
yes.. One suggestion is.. when a specific build fails, please trigger only that failed job.. see the comments you have to use to trigger the failed jobs

Hi @rameshthoomu - it looks like `make basic checks` is passing now. For the license check, it only looks at the last two git commits which is why it was sometimes failing and sometimes passing. I think if you enable it in CI now it should prevent people from adding or editing files without the updated lincense

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 23:47:30 GMT):<br/>
No.. You should not do `reverify` in fabric builds.. as these are dependent on each other.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 23:49:17 GMT):<br/>
You always have to look for VerifyBuild result, as this is the first job get trigger by patch set.. If you want to trigger any failed builds after VerifyBuild got +1, you can post comment phrases in the gerrit patch set.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 23:51:12 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 20:19:16 GMT):<br/>
You have to specify the arch value in the template.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 20:20:02 GMT):<br/>
little different.. remove the {arch} and hardcode the s390x.. OR change the node, and properties values in x86_64 job to s390x

we have to wait until golint fix the error

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 03:54:05 GMT):<br/>
yes.. otherwise, we have to incorporate the same workaround in all the fabric branches

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 04:50:51 GMT):<br/>
@zhaochy FAB has been created to incorporate workaround in fabric code till we get the fix in golint https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-9667

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 13:46:14 GMT):<br/>
sounds like it, based on the fact that you mentioned `fabric-baseimage-verify-docker-x86_64`

<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 20:48:47 GMT):<br/>
goes without saying , after the Merge, this work around patch  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20929/ has fixed the golint problem, Tested a fabric-end-2-end CI job and it is working fine without running into the golint error, a rebase should fix this patch, for older fabric- patchsets

@jwagantall @rameshthoomu @rjones ok, https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/20875/ has been merged, this gives us the script to generate and optionally push manifests for v1.1 multi-arch images

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 19:59:08 GMT):<br/>
all it needs is someone with the right credentials to run that script in publish mode
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 20:31:28 GMT):<br/>
Nice @cbf .. Will use this script to publish images to nexus3
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 20:35:57 GMT):<br/>
so will this `username ${USER} --password ${PASSWORD}` look for dockerhub credentials? What else we need to push images from CI?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 20:36:58 GMT):<br/>
manifest tool should be available for sure.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 20:59:36 GMT):<br/>
the `duckerhub` credentials should be in there somewhere
</p>

@rameshthoomu `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` `DOCKER_HUB_EMAIL` `DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD`

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 21:03:29 GMT):<br/>
If USER and PASSWORD is looking for dockerhub, then it need to modified accordingly 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 21:04:07 GMT):<br/>
I think when you call it you just call it that way.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 21:04:25 GMT):<br/>
call it with $DOCKER_HUB_USER for argv[1] and ... for ...
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 21:04:51 GMT):<br/>
right... you don't need to publish the images, they are already published

I'm curious about this, if all of these containers are explicitly pulled into the hyperledger project dockerhub, wouldn't it make sense to make the versions of the dependent containers match the version of fabric?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-questions?msg=hLYb4eAcYfyQfsnBs) 
</p>
<p><strong>voutasaurus</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 17:09:42 GMT):<br/>
It seems like the version required for "third party images" is currently 0.4.6 https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/scripts/bootstrap.sh#L13
</p>
<p><strong>voutasaurus</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 17:10:16 GMT):<br/>
This seems strange to me seeing as the version of fabric is 1.1.0, why not make the version numbers line up?

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 23:18:07 GMT):<br/>
better to change after the patch is merged. Otherwise, all the builds will fail till this patch is merged..  I can test this in sandbox if you want.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Sat, 28 Apr 2018 04:37:42 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @rjones It looks like the smoke tests are being kicked off even on CRs which are pushed with a WIP tag for some reason:

For example: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/21169/ (and see some of its WIP parents with the same symptoms)

@rameshthoomu @jwagantall Smoke tests are running for change sets it should not run. Look at this: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/21239/ smoke and unit tests are set +1 correctly, then smoke test runs and removes those votes. Why did smoke test run at all?

Hello @rjones 

This voting was from sandbox, for a fabric-smoke-test job that was tested. This job has been removed from sandbox now
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:13:17 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt @jwagantall I disabled the gerrit trigger in sandbox specifically to prevent these issues. Please don't re-enable gerrit trigger in sandbox.
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:13:47 GMT):<br/>
sure thing
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:15:42 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall I've edited the configuration for gerrit-trigger in sandbox to be invalid.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:16:58 GMT):<br/>
so, basically we weren't seeing a vote from the production Jenkins instance? is that what you guys are saying?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:17:31 GMT):<br/>
cause I just looked at the job: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-verify-build-checks-x86_64/1043/console
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:17:39 GMT):<br/>
and I don't see where the smoke test ran at all....
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:18:04 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark yes, this was a voting from sandbox job and not from production.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:18:47 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt ok. if we reverify, then will it display the correct votes?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:20:14 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark yes, it should just run the docs-build job as this is a .md change
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:20:25 GMT):<br/>
ok cool.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:30:31 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, @sambhavdutt - should we try a reverify then?

<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:33:03 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark not required, the tests were already retriggered, and it ran as expected last time

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 15:26:18 GMT):<br/>
Will commenting `VerifyBuild` do everything I need? Or do I need to also include each of the `Run <Task>`s as well? Do I need to execute them in order, or is there someway to force the entire CI to rerun?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 15:32:38 GMT):<br/>
(To answer my own question, it looks like `VerifyBuild` is re-running the whole CI)

<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 15:55:56 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick 
yes, like you said `VerifyBuild` will trigger all builds that includes smoke tests, unit tests, and docs build , depending on what the patchset conatains, 
for e.g. if it is a documentation job without any other changes ` .rst, .md, .py, .png,.css,.html  .ini ` , the docs-build job will trigger
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 16:03:51 GMT):<br/>
@rjones thanks a lot .. i will leave it disabled.. should be disabled 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 16:04:37 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall I basically mis-configured the gerrit trigger, so it should be some effort for it to get re-enabled
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 16:05:25 GMT):<br/>
thnak you .. also .. let me double check our setting files ... they should be just dummy ones.. except for some configuration (non-credentials) ones we have
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 16:09:29 GMT):<br/>
I feel that since testing this new workflow is over, the gerrit trigger config could be deleted completely from sandbox. But that is just a feeling.

> yes, like you said `VerifyBuild` will trigger all builds that includes smoke tests, unit tests, and docs build , depending on what the patchset conatains
Is this documented anywhere?
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 16:49:04 GMT):<br/>
@kostas  Ramesh has been working on a lot of documentation here: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20307/  This change just needs Sphinx corrections and should be ok to go.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 16:59:19 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick I am on leave today.. got some time to check messages.. Jobs won’t trigger for a commit message change.. that means build won’t trigger if you remove WIP from Commit message
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:00:35 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt VerifyBuild comment won’t trigger all the jobs. It just trigger the VerifyBuild job and it further triggers rest of the jobs based on the condition match..

hi @rameshthoomu are you back?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 13:48:27 GMT):<br/>
I think that there was a CI job that needed to be updated to allow https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/20853/ to be merged
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 13:48:58 GMT):<br/>
also, what about publishing the multi-arch manifest for v1.1.0? should I work with @jwagantall ?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:08:50 GMT):<br/>
@cbf yes.. I made changes in sandbox... If I update CI config without this patch merge, all builds will fail.. It's better to merge based on the sandbox changes and then update CI config.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:09:04 GMT):<br/>
I am looking in unit-test failures. Give me few mins.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:25:26 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:29:42 GMT):<br/>
@cbf few unit-tests are still referring 0.4.7 baseos.. Why these are referring to 0.4.7 on this commit.

```
00:06:33.890 unit-tests_1  | 2018-05-01 15:47:23.340 UTC [chaincode-platform] generateDockerfile -> DEBU 3a3

```
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:38:19 GMT):<br/>
ah, found the culprit... the baseimage is now hard-coded in the metadata
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:38:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:53:44 GMT):<br/>
Can you re-review this patch: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20681/ ?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:54:53 GMT):<br/>
LGTM.. Did you run this change in sandbox..?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:55:20 GMT):<br/>
awhile back, yes.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:55:44 GMT):<br/>
the output shows the report
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:56:01 GMT):<br/>
and there was some conversation about the weekly scan job stuff
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:56:22 GMT):<br/>
but to answer your question, yes I did and it worked
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:57:17 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu uploaded the fix
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 15:18:06 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu any chance of getting this one merged today?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 15:23:26 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu now failing smoke test - sigh
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 15:23:38 GMT):<br/>
this appears to be same as before
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 15:23:38 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 15:25:35 GMT):<br/>
yes.. Will take care of that now..

Sending votes between sandbox and production env is removed.. So I can't send +1 to patch set but the smoke tests are passed https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/fabric-smoke-tests-x86_64/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 16:15:03 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark Can I see the safesql log from sandbox?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 16:15:20 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I'll have to add that job back I think
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 16:15:24 GMT):<br/>
it's been removed
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 16:15:37 GMT):<br/>
let me look
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 16:16:04 GMT):<br/>
yes, it's been removed. I'll add it back
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 16:16:32 GMT):<br/>
sure. let me once done. I have removed -2 from your patchset.. Will get it merge today.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 16:18:18 GMT):<br/>
saw that. thanks. I'll add it back after lunch
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 16:18:46 GMT):<br/>
next on my list is FAB-8501. FYI.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 17:08:31 GMT):<br/>
Ok, how about unit tests then? @rameshthoomu I can manually vote
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 17:33:11 GMT):<br/>
I ran twice in sandbox.. failed twice https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/fabric-verify-unit-tests-x86_64/2/consoleFull
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 17:34:46 GMT):<br/>
I don't see this as related
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 18:28:55 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu if you link to the shipped logs on https://logs... it's faster and puts less load on Jenkins :)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 18:29:36 GMT):<br/>
ya... forgot to take that as a reference.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 19:54:54 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I ran the CR https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/20853/ locally and it runs fine... 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 19:55:06 GMT):<br/>
shall we merge and merge the CI changes?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 19:56:21 GMT):<br/>
Yes.. that's sounds like a good plan. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 19:56:28 GMT):<br/>
Will submit changes.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 19:57:50 GMT):<br/>
let's coordinate on this... I need to get others to help us merge my CR
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 19:58:20 GMT):<br/>
sure.. Will submit patch to CI now.. and will merge this after your CR is approved
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 20:07:53 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu the job is back on the sandbox
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 20:08:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm running it using the refs/changes/95/20695/2 ref from the fabric_ca repo
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 20:59:12 GMT):<br/>
I have pushed CI config change.. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/21339/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:01:17 GMT):<br/>
both fabric and CI changes should go hand in hand.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:11:28 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark Did you run this change in sandbox https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/19755/
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:11:57 GMT):<br/>
yes, we have
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:12:39 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/fabric-test-daily-x86_64/2/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:12:46 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:15:03 GMT):<br/>
How did it run?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:17:35 GMT):<br/>
ok Safesql is in.. I just merged it..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:17:44 GMT):<br/>
let me know the PTE test results.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:17:53 GMT):<br/>
from sandbox job
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:24:43 GMT):<br/>
PTE needs to be ran once more
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:24:47 GMT):<br/>
in the sandbox
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:25:06 GMT):<br/>
@scottz identified that perhaps the submodules were not updated
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:25:20 GMT):<br/>
and with the git-latest change that was just merged
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:25:24 GMT):<br/>
I should re-run it again
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:25:32 GMT):<br/>
to ensure that the underlying repos are updated
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:25:48 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu :point_up_tone2: 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:26:21 GMT):<br/>
this was from @scottz: "The jenkins job runs git-init but not the git-latest to update the submodules, so he is pushing a fix today and will let you know when done so you can kick off your test again."
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:26:55 GMT):<br/>
so I think I should test it once more just to be sure
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:30:53 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark @scottz Issue is not with the submodules.. There is an error with grpc module error.. see the bug here https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-9828
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:31:06 GMT):<br/>
oh ok
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:31:31 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark but you can run these tests with an workaround.. `npm install grpc@1.10.1`
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:31:57 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:32:00 GMT):<br/>
Please run this command after you do `npm install` from daily or smoke test suite..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:32:23 GMT):<br/>
Will merge your patch based on the sandbox test results.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:32:26 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:32:29 GMT):<br/>
one sec
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:33:51 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu - see my comment: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/19755/
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:34:04 GMT):<br/>
that's what you mean, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:35:03 GMT):<br/>
ommm.. Not in the patchset.. this is just a workaround step.. Run this in sandbox
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:35:42 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:41:21 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt @jtclark please list of issues in open status https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?filter=11500

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:44:13 GMT):<br/>
I'll do that now, @rameshthoomu 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:46:21 GMT):<br/>
Thanks.. will talk about the these tomorrow.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:46:24 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:46:28 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:49:23 GMT):<br/>
This is the priority one https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-9323

</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 16:23:50 GMT):<br/>

@manish-sethi seems x86_64 nodes went offline.

@rameshthoomu the core of the issue is uninteresting but one of the plugins we rely on for openstack only supports v1 of an API. an upgrade of openstack caused v1 to be disabled.

@jtclark there's a bunch of NaN results... is this expected? Also, what we really need is a dashboard that tracks results over time

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 21:54:28 GMT):<br/>
perhaps @scottz or @dongming can chime in on that
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 21:55:34 GMT):<br/>
perhaps killing the job prematurely did this during that job run?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 21:56:04 GMT):<br/>
we'll see if the most recent run (currently running) show us the same results

Glad to hear the PTE test is running; yes the first step was to get a few running and merged into CI. Next step was to use a plugin and track over time. Hopefully Jason can finish that next in short order.

<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 23:18:35 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark That PTE Test Summary log was just merged yesterday, so maybe there is an error with it. Looks like the time accumulation didn't go right. Create a bug for @dongming 
 against the PTE tool. This might be helpful: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14422207/object-returning-nan-when-sum-values

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 05 May 2018 20:14:04 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm patch#10-11 are rebase and commit message change. so the verify build is not triggered on these patchsets.. Now, when you try to run the smoketests on 10 or 11 patchsets, the build will fail as there are no images published on these commits.

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 19:53:52 GMT):<br/>
is there something I'm missing from the fabric repo?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 19:54:29 GMT):<br/>
perhaps we can talk more about this tmrw if you guys don't have an idea

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 19:55:12 GMT):<br/>
I can run the script locally, and it goes through the `run_local_build()` function
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 19:55:38 GMT):<br/>
which tries to grab all of the important local variables to get BYFN to run w/o error.
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 19:55:44 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark will check on this and let you know
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 19:56:29 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt yes, just check out what I have, and you can see what I'm doing. I talked about detecting the hostname, so that we can determine if the script is being ran by our Jenkins host(s) or by the developer locally.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 19:57:51 GMT):<br/>
if that doesn't work, the other idea that I had was to have the devs set a local variable to `true` to determine if you are running it locally or not.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 19:58:43 GMT):<br/>
like `LOCAL_DEV=true` or something, but have a look and let me know your thoughts. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 20:26:54 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu, @sambhavdutt - I think that the problem is that there no `fabric/release/linux-amd64/bin/` directory in the master branch
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 20:27:55 GMT):<br/>
I think I may have found something.... `fabric_preload.sh`
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 20:27:55 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark did you execute a make release, or , make-release all

<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sat, 12 May 2018 19:05:24 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Hi, Ramesh. How I can update ci to ignore extra whitespaces in java file. I updated grpc compiler and now generated file cause problem with build. Here change set:
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/21495/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 12 May 2018 19:59:03 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl Instead of ignoring white spaces better to fix them.. I see white spaces here https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/21495/3/fabric-chaincode-protos/src/main/grpc/org/hyperledger/fabric/protos/peer/ChaincodeSupportGrpc.java
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 06:58:28 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu This file generated by grpc compiler. each time I run build it regenerated :( 
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 06:59:43 GMT):<br/>
btw, did you saw my answer in FAB-10007?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 14:44:32 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark are you working on FAB-10007?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 14:45:10 GMT):<br/>
Haven’t started that one yet.  @rameshthoomu
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 14:45:56 GMT):<br/>
Could you pls work on that. Patch set is waiting for this change
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 14:46:12 GMT):<br/>
Ok sure. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 14:46:20 GMT):<br/>
Thanks 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 14:55:49 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu - so I'm creating a jenkins job that will pull the chaincode.jar file from fabric-sdk-java inside the core/chaincode/platforms/java/testdata/SimpleSample directory
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 14:56:35 GMT):<br/>
and storing it on nexus2?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 14:58:15 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu - will this job be manually triggered? or, do we want this to run daily? weekly?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 14:58:28 GMT):<br/>
just need a bit more info.
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:45:52 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark No, please don't do it
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:47:17 GMT):<br/>
It is not connected to java sdk
Right now in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20857/ I have chaincode.jar file
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:47:26 GMT):<br/>
 @gennadyl don't?
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:47:33 GMT):<br/>
This jar used for tesing
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:48:25 GMT):<br/>
And decision was to keep it in nexus, instead checkin it in each time
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:48:27 GMT):<br/>
so for FAB-10007 where should the chaincode.jar file come from?
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:48:57 GMT):<br/>
Right now you can take it from change set
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:49:00 GMT):<br/>
what jars and where should the come from
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:49:00 GMT):<br/>
what jars and where should they come from
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:49:06 GMT):<br/>
i mentioned earlier
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:49:26 GMT):<br/>
ok so for now, we just need to store the chaincode.jar file on nexus
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:49:34 GMT):<br/>
from your patchset
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:50:05 GMT):<br/>
but in the future is there a plan to store numerous jars on nexus?
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:50:15 GMT):<br/>
yes. And checkout it during ci build to core/chaincode/platforms/java/testdata/SimpleSample directory
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:50:20 GMT):<br/>
And yes
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:50:41 GMT):<br/>
But there is no build process for it, now it is static
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:51:08 GMT):<br/>
so.... checkout the jar from your patchset, and store it on the nexus repository.... no building nothing.... correct?
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:51:12 GMT):<br/>
and in any case it is not connected to java sdk, but to fabric-chaincode-java
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:51:19 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:51:25 GMT):<br/>
gotcha
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:51:35 GMT):<br/>
fabric-chaincode-java not the sdk
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:51:38 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:51:50 GMT):<br/>
I'll create something on the sandbox
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:51:52 GMT):<br/>
and test it
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:52:13 GMT):<br/>
then submit it to be merged so that this job will be on the Jenkins prod host
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:52:14 GMT):<br/>
No need to test jar itself, it used for fabric testing
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:52:21 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:53:37 GMT):<br/>
After you will store it in nexus, I will remove it from my changeset and will be able to merge it, finally
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:53:56 GMT):<br/>
gotcha.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:54:08 GMT):<br/>
actually, do we even need a job for this?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:54:17 GMT):<br/>
for this temporary solution?
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:55:19 GMT):<br/>
We don't need job to build jar file, for sure. It is totally static at this point
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:56:05 GMT):<br/>
But I have one question, if you have a minute
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:57:11 GMT):<br/>
I need this jar be placed in specific location during fabric ci build, for unit tests to succeed 
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:57:24 GMT):<br/>
How you make it happen?
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:57:24 GMT):<br/>
How do you make it happen?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 18:59:24 GMT):<br/>
well, I understand this to be a couple tasks:
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:00:06 GMT):<br/>
1. for now, we just need to put the jar file that you have on nexus. there's not building needed, we just need to store it on nexus
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:00:06 GMT):<br/>
1. for now, we just need to put the jar file that you have on nexus. there's no building needed for the jar that's in your patchset, we just need to store it on nexus
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:01:20 GMT):<br/>
2. the long term, we will need to figure out where that location is
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:01:20 GMT):<br/>
2. for the long term, we will need to figure out where that location is
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:02:00 GMT):<br/>
it depends on where it needs to be stored
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:03:12 GMT):<br/>
So, now you just store it in nexus. But how I will get it in core/chaincode/platforms/java/testdata/SimpleSample directory during build?
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:03:30 GMT):<br/>
I think I miss something here
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:06:35 GMT):<br/>
we'll have to think about that.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:06:52 GMT):<br/>
but let me see if I can get the chaincode.jar file you have in that commit stored on nexus
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:08:04 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:13:46 GMT):<br/>
keep me posted
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 19:14:53 GMT):<br/>
sure thing.
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 20:44:02 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl why do you still need to store this jar into nexus? IMO this is completely redundant and not need, please see my comments on your CR.
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Sun, 13 May 2018 21:25:57 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin - see my reply to your comment. It is real test, but I can cancel it, if you want...
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 01:10:54 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl, @C0rWin - did you come to an agreement on whether or not the .jar needs to be stored on nexus?

@rameshthoomu Good Morning
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:23:53 GMT):<br/>
sounds like they don't need to have the jar files stored on nexus
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:24:26 GMT):<br/>
I'll comment and close out on  FAB-10007 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:24:33 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:25:42 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu, @gennadyl do we still want to fail the job *if* a jar file is checked in?
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:26:11 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Do you remember I asked you about white spaces in automatically generated files
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:26:14 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu, @gennadyl or do we want to add *.jar to the .gitignore?
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:26:30 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark I did removed the jar file from changeset
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:26:52 GMT):<br/>
adding it to gitignore sounds like good idea
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:26:59 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 13:36:03 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl, @rameshthoomu - do either of you mind if I use FAB-10007 to denote that this is what we are going to do to prevent *.jar checkins? (via .gitignore) ?
</p>

got it. I'll take a look now.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:14:20 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I agree. we can still check the verify job to see if a *.jar file is checked in.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:14:20 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I agree. we can still check in the verify job to see if a *.jar file is checked in.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:14:39 GMT):<br/>
but this would add an additional safeguard
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:16:06 GMT):<br/>
if someone forces it in, then we still need to fail the verify job. so, there will be two patches to cover this case. one for the .gitignore and the other for updating the job to check for jar files.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:19:10 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl I think you can follow something similar to this https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/scripts/check_license.sh#L14
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:29:21 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Do you want me to change verify job?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:29:35 GMT):<br/>
I am checking
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:29:47 GMT):<br/>
I think it's ok to ignore `protos` directory
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:30:02 GMT):<br/>
all the files in this are generated by compiler
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:30:26 GMT):<br/>
I mean ignore whitespaces 
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:31:54 GMT):<br/>
Ah, got it. But does fabric-chaincode-java have this kind of verify job
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 14:32:40 GMT):<br/>
?

</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 18:11:31 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 18:14:15 GMT):<br/>
@latitiah thanks for the info.. So, I think it's better to add these tests (integration tests) as part of the smoketest build

<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 18:34:11 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu The E2E tests may use kafka and zookeeper docker containers. We don't necessarily know what network or how many or the name, config, etc... that each of these containers will have so they are dynamically built based on the specific test scenario. This is not like CouchDB which has a basic setup which doesn't change.
</p>

<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 18:36:20 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu For most integration tests this won't be an issue but with all tests that use kafka (and thus zookeeper) will be affected since these are docker containers. (With the current setup, you can't run docker containers in docker containers.)

Will push this change based on your comments
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 19:43:17 GMT):<br/>
ok. Will do.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 21:21:23 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar have you also been getting the safesql emails?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 21:25:11 GMT):<br/>
yes , I am getting safesql emails.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:24:50 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar please check the OWASP results https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/Weekly/job/fabric-sdk-java-owasp-weekly-x86_64/OWSP_20Dependency_20Check_20Results/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:25:15 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar this is all yours now https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/Weekly/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:25:15 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar this is all yours now https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/Weekly/ :wink: 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:29:02 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to understand the result.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:29:02 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to understand OWASP dependency check result.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:29:53 GMT):<br/>
ok check the above link that's the latest result from production jenkins
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:30:16 GMT):<br/>
Did you run maven before you run dependency check ? 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:32:04 GMT):<br/>
Per DependencyCheck result , it seems like there is no vulnerable dependency.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:32:49 GMT):<br/>
Also , I am not seeing scan for Fabric CA and NSP in the link  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/Weekly/.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:33:35 GMT):<br/>
I assume , I am going to get weekly email notification as well , right ? @rameshthoomu 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:35:56 GMT):<br/>
patches are on the way to nsp and ca
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:36:20 GMT):<br/>
and yes I run maven and run all the tests on before dependency check on the target jar
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:36:56 GMT):<br/>
I think email notification is not configured on owasp.. will enable in the next patch
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:45:28 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar do you need ca and nsp on all the branches?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:46:13 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean by all branches ? 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:46:30 GMT):<br/>
like master, relaese-1.0 and release-1.1
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:46:39 GMT):<br/>
hmm.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:46:56 GMT):<br/>
what are you doing for Fabric ? 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:47:04 GMT):<br/>
only on master
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:47:16 GMT):<br/>
then do the same for others too.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:47:24 GMT):<br/>
master will suffice.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:47:59 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 18:58:45 GMT):<br/>
@bretharrison looking at this FAB-10167.. Do you want me to push 8.11.2 in fabric-baseimage?
</p>

@bretharrison looking at this FAB-10167 .. Do you want me to push 8.11.2 in fabric-baseimage?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 18:59:38 GMT):<br/>
We have to test this first before publish baseimage.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 18:59:39 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I've noticed that when the first step of the new workflow fails, it doesn't set -1 in F1, it sets v=-1
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 18:59:53 GMT):<br/>
sometimes. I've also noticed it frequently doesn't vote at all.
</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:00:11 GMT):<br/>
is that what the Chaincode node container is based on ?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:00:39 GMT):<br/>
oh let me check the script
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:00:47 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu see https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/status:open+project:fabric+is:mergeable+label:F1-VerifyBuild%253D0 for instance
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:01:19 GMT):<br/>
Checking @rjones 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:01:29 GMT):<br/>
OK
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:02:06 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/status:open+project:fabric+is:mergeable+label:F1-VerifyBuild%253D0+owner:%22Matthias+Neugschwandtner+%253Ceug%2540zurich.ibm.com%253E%22
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:08:55 GMT):<br/>
I think it's because of quotes are missing from the -m flag in this command ` vote -m "$CHECKS_CMD are failed" -l F1-VerifyBuild=-1`
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:09:30 GMT):<br/>
other commands vote command looks like this `vote -m '"make docker failed"' -l F1-VerifyBuild=-1`
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:10:49 GMT):<br/>
I think this change is made to fix the $CHECK_CMD command appearing in gerrit without resolving.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:13:27 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu question: how long do the release jobs typically take?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:14:49 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu specifically the run_node_sdk_byfn.sh test
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:15:23 GMT):<br/>
now that I've fixed that in the patch the release test job is now taking a lot longer
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:15:23 GMT):<br/>
now that I've fixed that in the patch, the release test job is now taking a lot longer
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:16:43 GMT):<br/>
check what's there in that test..

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:25:03 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu you could vote in one step and comment on another

@rameshthoomu also, were you ready to share that management dashboard we were looking at yesterday?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:35:50 GMT):<br/>
@rjones looking into that now
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 20:00:54 GMT):<br/>
@rjones patch is merged now and I triggered this patch. Now I see voting back to gerrit https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/14769/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 20:01:27 GMT):<br/>

I created bug https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10216, and assigned Component = fabric-build. Please reroute if that was not the right place. When I "make docker-images" in fabric, is there really a need for THREE  of everything, with slightly differing tags? It's using up so much space.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 20:15:57 GMT):<br/>

@rameshthoomu is there anything wrong with e2e tests, they are failing
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 21:30:01 GMT):<br/>
@aambati could you pls provide failed build

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 21:49:52 GMT):<br/>
@aambati I see a bug is created here FAB-10223
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 21:50:20 GMT):<br/>
seems fabric-sdk-java tests are failing.. @rickr could you please check
</p>
<p><strong>aambati</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 22:09:34 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu i think i know what is causing it...we pushed a change set in fabric CA, need to make corresponding changes in SDKs
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 22:11:52 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 22:12:08 GMT):<br/>
can you please update the same in FAB-10223
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 22:13:13 GMT):<br/>
How the verify build passed?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Sat, 19 May 2018 05:51:07 GMT):<br/>
@aambati  SDKs run tests to make sure we work before we integrate.  CA obviously then does not ?   You broke you fix  FAB-10223 assigned to you thanks
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 02:44:29 GMT):<br/>
@cbf @mastersingh24 @rameshthoomu fabric-samples is failing CI due to amd64 vs x86_64 change. What do you think?  See the comment and failure in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22039/ for details.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 03:16:46 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart it's because of the ARCH value has been changed with this change https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/21733/4/Makefile . So, the maked docker from fabric-ca is failing to build fabric-ca-* images.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 03:17:15 GMT):<br/>
fabric-ca sample test is looking for fabric-ca-* images.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:01:53 GMT):<br/>
we publish the image tags.   I provided the script a month ago
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:34:17 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @cbf Ok, and where in fabric-samples do we need to change from x86_64 to amd64, so that fabric-samples CI starts working again?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:34:53 GMT):<br/>
sigh... just publish the tags
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:35:35 GMT):<br/>
could you be more specific please
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:39:42 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/20875/
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:40:18 GMT):<br/>
the script was merged almost a month ago... it needs to be run by someone with push privs to dockerhub hyperledger org
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:40:59 GMT):<br/>
that will let us use multi-arch everywhere
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:41:25 GMT):<br/>
the other thing that can be done - just tag the x86_64 images as amd64 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:42:27 GMT):<br/>
ok, and I assume both of those actions would be done by @rameshthoomu and team, right?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:42:38 GMT):<br/>
someone with push privs
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:42:50 GMT):<br/>
that's my question... who has that?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:43:04 GMT):<br/>
probably @jwagantall 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:45:19 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:47:18 GMT):<br/>
yes, there is

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:48:26 GMT):<br/>
ok, not pushed yet...
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:48:43 GMT):<br/>
and in general, are you driving the other subtasks for multi-arch? https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-9629
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:48:43 GMT):<br/>
no, because not urgent
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:48:51 GMT):<br/>
we don't need it until the release
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:49:12 GMT):<br/>
and that process is changing
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:49:14 GMT):<br/>
so...
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:49:44 GMT):<br/>
it's almost june, it will be urgent soon enough :)

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 14:56:18 GMT):<br/>
I also saw @scottz comments, so I'll need to address those
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 16:03:30 GMT):<br/>
@rickr Update CI config and re-triggered your change set.. Now the patchset is failing with FAB-10223.

k thx
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 11:35:52 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu where are we on the multi-arch manifests?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 11:36:22 GMT):<br/>
also, if we could get amd64 tags added to all 1.1.0 images that would be a good thing, too 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 11:36:34 GMT):<br/>
eg 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 11:37:09 GMT):<br/>
docker tag hyperledger/fabric-peer:x86_64-1.1.0 hyperledger/fabric-peer:amd64-1.1.0
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 11:37:22 GMT):<br/>
docker push hyperledger/fabric-peer:amd64-1.1.0
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 11:37:35 GMT):<br/>
this will help the transition to multi-arch 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 13:01:16 GMT):<br/>
I don't have permission to push this manually.. Will update Jenkins job to publish these images.. I was testing gen-manifests.sh yesterday..
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 13:40:12 GMT):<br/>
that seems unnecessary
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 13:40:23 GMT):<br/>
can @jwagantall run now that you've tested?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 13:40:46 GMT):<br/>
yes.. I have prepared a script to do this.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 13:40:52 GMT):<br/>
the whole: "maintainers cannot do stuff" thing is really annoying
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 13:40:52 GMT):<br/>
will share that with her.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 13:41:17 GMT):<br/>
if you cannot trust the maintainers, who can you trust?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 14:07:34 GMT):<br/>
the question is who can push to dockerhub?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 14:10:40 GMT):<br/>
@cbf using fabric-peer, the fabric team has had write access since day one, and still has write access. the fabric team is: you, @greg.haskins , @mastersingh24 , @sheehan .
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 14:11:07 GMT):<br/>
I can look at other fabric repos on dockerhub but they _should_ be set up the same way.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 14:11:20 GMT):<br/>
hmmm
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 14:12:30 GMT):<br/>
I just checked four random fabric repos and the permissions are the same.

cello is doing something interesting: they have dockerfiles for each repo, and they're automagically built on merge. it seems like one more thing to worry about to me, since you have to add specific build targets each time

@rameshthoomu did you modify the script I previously shared for v1.1?

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 14:24:47 GMT):<br/>
ok, I'm going to run that and publish manifest

@rjones I'm not actively pushing to the Fabric dockerhub repos so you can remove my write permission
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 17:29:02 GMT):<br/>
OK.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 17:29:46 GMT):<br/>
done. It may be an artifact of when dockerhub was being spun up two years ago
</p>
<p><strong>sheehan</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 17:29:58 GMT):<br/>
yes, was using it back then

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 17:31:16 GMT):<br/>
for dockerhub, since it's super easy to delegate permissions, maintainers that have a dockerhub ID have always had write access. For github ACLs are more problematic :(

@rjones I think that the dockerhub privs should be release managers (me, gari, dave enyeart)... I am ok with greg staying on for baseimage and chaintool
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 19:08:11 GMT):<br/>

latest fabric-ca has some important fix needed for fabric sdks

@rameshthoomu I added "Run IntegrationTest" to several Fabric changes and no builds were kicked off
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 18:55:03 GMT):<br/>
ci-management merge job finished just now.. I have added comment on the patchset now it;s triggered https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-integration-tests-x86_64/

@rjones @rameshthoomu @sykesm 3 of the IntegrationTests have failed this hour for 3 different reasons.  Is it too flakey to enable at this time?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:28:29 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart that's a good question for @rameshthoomu  :)

https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/label:F3-IntegrationTest%253D1+is:mergeable+is:open+project:fabric a few passed
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:31:42 GMT):<br/>
but there _are_ ~50 changes in flight that will need attention https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/label:F3-IntegrationTest%253C1+is:mergeable+is:open+project:fabric
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:34:09 GMT):<br/>
can we grandfather the pre-existing 50 somehow, to not require a +1 there?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:35:11 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart you _should_ see a button to insert that +1 manually
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:35:29 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart 
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20533/ - Patch#7 has been rebased.. So no images published from patch#7 to pull. So the test is failed while pulling these images.
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22015/ - Time out error
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22169/ - Not sure why it’s failed.. 

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:35:45 GMT):<br/>
and as a maintainer, your discretion on when to over-ride or add votes.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:36:14 GMT):<br/>
yeah, i just used my discretion on one and +1ed it
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:36:40 GMT):<br/>
@latitiah said they are some timeout errors and she fixed with this change set https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22015/

</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:38:59 GMT):<br/>
Let's take a step back, please.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:39:14 GMT):<br/>
First, the CI system isn't running the make target so it's living in its own little world.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:39:34 GMT):<br/>
Second, I had no insight into when or how this was to be integrated or I would have said something earlier.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:39:53 GMT):<br/>
So, I think we should revert what was done and try again.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:40:04 GMT):<br/>
Ideally we can do it *together* to make sure it does what it needs to do.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:40:53 GMT):<br/>
And, as far as I can tell, we enabled this without notifying anyone (again). Maybe I'm a little frustrated but, there it is
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:41:08 GMT):<br/>
right, some announcement should be made here and in fabric-maintainers for CI changes
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:42:03 GMT):<br/>
I just happened to notice it in gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:42:15 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/ci-management/blob/master/jjb/fabric/fabric-macros.yaml#L354 is what's running the tests and it seems relatively arbitrary and disconnected from what's in the source tree.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:48:03 GMT):<br/>
@sykesm we don't build the images in the downstream jobs (smoke, unit, integration) as the images are build and publish from build check job.. So, the integration test is running on the same patch set commit.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:49:09 GMT):<br/>
I also recommend revert and Ramesh/Matt review together before it is re-enabled.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:50:12 GMT):<br/>
ok.. @jwagantall @rjones could you please revert this change https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22215/ and remove the "IntegrationTest" label
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:50:33 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I propose people over-ride it instead of reverting it
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:53:01 GMT):<br/>
4th one has failed... nobody understands what this is doing well enough to know the criteria for over-riding
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:53:40 GMT):<br/>
I recommend revert, Matt/Ramesh review, communicate the coming change, then re-enable
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:54:42 GMT):<br/>
I won't pretend to know how difficult some of these changes may be. Does it make sense to leave the label and just have a dummy job that sets the label until we enable it?
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:54:42 GMT):<br/>
@rjones  how do we override it?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:54:55 GMT):<br/>
@sykesm that would be much easier
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:55:22 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall just vote on the job. See the screenshot I posted above - maintainers can just vote +1 for that vote
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:55:31 GMT):<br/>
So, that's probably the path forward. Have a dummy job that just states it's a placeholder, set the label, and we can go from there.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:56:05 GMT):<br/>
But I see people are posting a comment "Run IntegrationTest" as soon they see label with out vote
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:56:24 GMT):<br/>
well, I ran through and posted a bunch of them
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:56:59 GMT):<br/>
replace the existing script with one that votes +1 and move on
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:57:08 GMT):<br/>
not you.. someone posted.. don't remember the patchset.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:57:34 GMT):<br/>
Ok.. so it's always +1
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:04:35 GMT):<br/>
and for the pre-existing CRs, somebody gives them all a +1 manually?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:04:53 GMT):<br/>
at the same time you're giving the +2, I would assume
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:05:45 GMT):<br/>
can it be done in bulk now?  otherwise need a post to fabric-maintainers explaining it.  actually need a post to fabric-maintainers explaining it all in general.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:07:10 GMT):<br/>
it would bump all of those changes to the top of the list. if you're OK with that, I think it could be done
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:13:32 GMT):<br/>
@rjones could you please review this https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22225/
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:13:42 GMT):<br/>
probably don't want to bump them to the top... ok, @rjones could you post the action plan to #fabric-maintainers  so that everybody knows they need to +1 in the interim
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:13:52 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall ^^^^
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:13:58 GMT):<br/>
This change will not test the IntegrationTest but posts +1 against the label 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:16:29 GMT):<br/>
But if someone want to test the IntegrationTests, they can post a comment "Run IntegrationTest"

Hi Team! https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/ is now set to quietDown mode. We are upgrading Nexus3 to version 3.8.0-02 in order to get real anonymous access to the binaries. This will take 20 mins or less.

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 21:47:59 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu why are we building images? Should we not be pulling tagged images, instead?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 21:49:00 GMT):<br/>
yes.. that's the plan.. right now the docker images with DOCKER_NS is not working in fabric-ca.. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22467/
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 21:49:07 GMT):<br/>
also, I am thinking that we should be building from the make file... e.g. instead of .byfn.sh up etc we should have a makefile with a target that handles what we want
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 21:49:44 GMT):<br/>
so, to add jenkins to fabric-chaincode-evm I could write a jenkinsfile?

<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 21:50:20 GMT):<br/>
dona and upgraded now.. Jenkins is back on track
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 21:50:22 GMT):<br/>
Yes. We need JJB and jenkinfile should go hand in hand..

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 21:51:36 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 21:52:40 GMT):<br/>
I am still working on this change set to make it compatible to gerrit triggers.. Once this is done, will roll out on fabric-samples first

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 22:54:12 GMT):<br/>
I think it’s considering it as a documentation build
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 22:54:30 GMT):<br/>
On the way to home.. will check after sometime

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 22:57:45 GMT):<br/>
Very good.  I think all my change sets should be considered as doc builds and get automatically and immediately +1s from jenkins. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 23:06:39 GMT):<br/>
anyway the unit tests passed on the parent 3rd change set https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22463/ so i conclude that the bottom 2 are OK 
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 01:12:42 GMT):<br/>

@rameshthoomu, are all the images now tagged with stable if nightly is clean?


</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 15:41:12 GMT):<br/>
yes all fabric and fabric-ca images tagged with stable from master branch but after this patch is merged https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22467/ will publish with DOCKER_NS and override the PROJECT_VERSION to `amd64-stable`
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 15:41:34 GMT):<br/>
as we are going to publish images from s390x builds..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 15:45:17 GMT):<br/>
also, these images are publishing from every merge e2e job (which runs e2e_cli, byfn, efyn, sdk e2e tests)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 15:45:45 GMT):<br/>
and there is an svt job which leverages these images..
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 16:26:37 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu wrapping up 8501. last test is running now. I'll ping you shortly
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 16:27:38 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu is this one I can pickup? it's assigned to you atm... are you working on this one yet?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 16:27:40 GMT):<br/>
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10258
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 16:28:58 GMT):<br/>
Once this patch is merged https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22467/ the highest priority is to publish nexus images with nexus docker name space and pull these images in sdk's and fabric-samples
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 16:29:23 GMT):<br/>
ok, is there a JIRA item for this?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 16:29:28 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt is working on creating e2e merge s390x job.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 16:30:03 GMT):<br/>
yes.. see here https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20FAB%20AND%20status%20in%20(%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20%22To%20Do%22%2C%20%22In%20Review%22%2C%20Backlog%2C%20Unverified)%20AND%20component%20%3D%20fabric-ci%20AND%20%22Epic%20Link%22%20is%20not%20EMPTY%20AND%20project%20in%20(10002)%20AND%20cf%5B10006%5D%20%3D%20FAB-10068
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 16:30:46 GMT):<br/>
Once the fabric-ca is merged, the remaining task should finish by EOD today
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 16:33:47 GMT):<br/>
so this one: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10066

@jtclark @sambhavdutt Basically we are trying to finish the above flow EOD today.. You can ignore ppc64le for now.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 17:03:19 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu coolio... so stable is retagged every merge?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 17:03:55 GMT):<br/>
possibility that during a pull of images, you could have images from different commit-levels
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 18:13:47 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu see: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/fabric-test-release-x86_64/6/artifact/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/regression/release/output_e2e_node_sdk_release_tests.log
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 18:14:12 GMT):<br/>
yes e2e job publishes every merge e2e job.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 18:14:50 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu not sure why I'm seeing this...
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 18:16:40 GMT):<br/>
along with stable, we can also publish the images with commit (7 chars) tag but pull images with commit tag is little difficult from nexus
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 18:20:44 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark see where you are setting value to NODE_VER here this https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/18339/17/pre_setup.sh
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 18:21:33 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu and where is $NODE_VER set?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 18:24:58 GMT):<br/>
you have to initialize this..  You have change this in patch#15 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/18339/1..15/pre_setup.sh 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 18:25:23 GMT):<br/>
assign 8.9.4 or 8.11.2
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 18:25:53 GMT):<br/>
8.11.2 is future upgrade version in node sdk builds
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 18:40:09 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu so this var should be hard-coded for now?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 18:46:11 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 19:16:51 GMT):<br/>

you can work on https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8461

ok
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 17:47:07 GMT):<br/>
Basically it's very simple.. @sambhavdutt and myself pushed change here https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20307/
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 17:47:19 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 17:47:29 GMT):<br/>
but as it is huge change, you have to split that into multiple patchsets.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 17:47:34 GMT):<br/>
I gotcha
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 17:47:36 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 17:49:01 GMT):<br/>
I do have one more thing to add
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 17:49:15 GMT):<br/>
which is the comment about the tar command at the end. what's that for, exactly?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 17:50:12 GMT):<br/>
ok. will look into this
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 17:51:04 GMT):<br/>
took out alot of the obvious stuff. just lemme know what needs to be changed (if anything) and I'll push this one quickly.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 17:51:32 GMT):<br/>
we can just get this done, and talk about stuff again once we're past the 1.2 release

Not sure what change your patchset failing node test.. I am suspecting some container are still left over from the previous and it's not clearing them with your change set.. 

I have submitted WIP change https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22701/ and got +1 and fabric-samples is not broken as the existing fabric-sample tests are working as expected.

@jwagantall I think you have merged the integration test change.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 19:48:07 GMT):<br/>
yea.. it had 2 +1's
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 19:48:12 GMT):<br/>
Could you please enable the Integration-Test on gerrit voting?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 19:48:18 GMT):<br/>
is that disabled now?
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 19:49:01 GMT):<br/>
not that i know of... it should be enabled already from the fabric project rules
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 19:49:13 GMT):<br/>
ok let me do quick test
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 19:49:18 GMT):<br/>
sure.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 20:29:04 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall verified few builds on integrationTest job and seems changes are correct.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 18:07:20 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu this CR just does not like me... I started from a clean repo, release-1.1 branch and applied the changes manually to create a new CR... same unrelated failure

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 19:01:35 GMT):<br/>
if you don't find enough information from the prod logs, enable logs in sandbox and test this patchset

@cbf not quite working yet. need to cherry-pick your CR to the release-1.1 branch- I previously reported that this was working, but it was from the master branch.

@rameshthoomu Can u pls check https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-ca-verify-s390x/3248/, i don't see that error when i do make format in my workspace...Even after i fixed the formatting error, it is still failing...it is as though CI is not picking up latest change.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 17:12:26 GMT):<br/>
let me check
</p>
<p><strong>aambati</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 17:17:59 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu never mind...i repushed , it seems to went further this time...but we need to figure out why make format fails in CI but works on Mac
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 17:18:47 GMT):<br/>
we execute `make ci-tests` target.. I think you also execute the same right

ok

Hi
I trying to use fabric-baseos image 0.4.8 but there is no x86_64-0.4.8 tag in docker hub
https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/fabric-baseos/tags/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 17:27:23 GMT):<br/>
it should be on amd64-0.4.8 tag
</p>
<p><strong>firas.qutishat</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 17:28:10 GMT):<br/>
thanks

@rameshthoomu hmmm I think I know what's going on... I must be deleting an image I shouldn't be... I'll add some debugging
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 18:05:29 GMT):<br/>
no, that isn't it either... already seeing multiple tests run this is a puzzlement
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 18:06:05 GMT):<br/>
yes.. except node js chaincode tests .. rest all tests are working.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 18:06:25 GMT):<br/>
Will look into this in sometime.. Pushing last change of pipeline script
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 18:09:53 GMT):<br/>
this is low priority, I can make it WIP for now
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 18:11:06 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu where do we stand on having only one set of images tagged/day?

@rameshthoomu where do we stand on having only one set of images tagged stable/day?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 18:12:01 GMT):<br/>
yes.. We pushed stable images with 1.2.0-stable tag and working on Downstream jobs to kickoff (performance, svt and sdk's)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 18:12:50 GMT):<br/>
couple of patches are on in queue.. Target to finish them by EOD today

@rameshthoomu, @cbf - I captured the above issue (now marked WIP) in the following JIRA task: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10584
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:00:58 GMT):<br/>
I think there are issues with this machine NODE_NAME=prd-ubuntu1604-x86_64-4c-16g-4815 
```
10:17:40 [ERROR] /w/workspace/fabric-sdk-java-verify-1.0.0-x86_64/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/security/CryptoPrimitives.java:[325,46] cannot access java.security.SignatureSpi

I keep seeing this occasionally and theory  it's on one of the machines 
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-java-verify-1.0.0-x86_64/851/console 
Don't know if / who can rebuild it or fix that zip .. or can log on to it and investigate

@rameshthoomu now that FAB-10584 is WIP for now, I'm back to finishing up FAB-10066
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:52:40 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark 10066 is in-progress for master branch.. But would like to split the existing job to release branches
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:52:46 GMT):<br/>
Could you please work on that 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:52:48 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22443/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:53:33 GMT):<br/>
I am not using 10066 for the above patchset but you can use existing jobs for release-1.1 and release-1.0 branches
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:53:53 GMT):<br/>
so 10066 will get merged, but it will just be for pulling the images for master branch tests?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:54:15 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu :point_up_tone2: 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:55:58 GMT):<br/>
Modify this change only to release branches https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22733/
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:57:14 GMT):<br/>
I can do that, but 10066 modifies the the job to not build docker images
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:57:56 GMT):<br/>
that's now happening with pipeline.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:58:11 GMT):<br/>
as we have images only from master branch.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:58:54 GMT):<br/>
hmmm
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:59:16 GMT):<br/>
Create a Makefile and drive the byfn and eyfn tests through it.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:59:45 GMT):<br/>
for release branches.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:59:54 GMT):<br/>
ok which one do we want to go first?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 16:00:08 GMT):<br/>
10066
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 16:00:35 GMT):<br/>
it's all parallel tasks.. My changes are already pushed for master branch with pipeline
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 16:00:45 GMT):<br/>
it can't be.

22761 will step on 22733
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 16:03:58 GMT):<br/>
ok I have modified my patchset.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 16:04:58 GMT):<br/>
or you can amend to my patchset.. which ever you like
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 16:06:41 GMT):<br/>
let me modify that
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 16:08:43 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 16:08:57 GMT):<br/>
I see where your patch is for master, not release, is this right?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 16:09:15 GMT):<br/>
b/c I thought 10066 is for master

@rickr  if this is regarding the build issue.. i am checking on it
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 17:38:47 GMT):<br/>
@rickr  do you have a Jenkins link to the build where this is happening? since these are dynamic nodes is not easy to login into it and see why this is failing as the
workspace gets removed as soon as the job ends
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 17:40:23 GMT):<br/>

build 851
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 17:54:39 GMT):<br/>
I thought this would help I think there are issues with this machine NODE_NAME=prd-ubuntu1604-x86_64-4c-16g-4815
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 17:55:57 GMT):<br/>
I don't it's in the  workspace .  I'm suspecting the Java install on that machine is not up to par.  
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 18:12:20 GMT):<br/>
i can update the packer image... let me see
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 18:30:48 GMT):<br/>
@rickr  there was a new image available.. i have updated to that new one and ran the build once but i guess this issue is more sporadic .. right?
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 18:31:04 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 22:41:43 GMT):<br/>
with this fabric-sdk-node jobs are ready with nexus images
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 22:42:12 GMT):<br/>
please check the change and let me know if any changes required
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 22:42:20 GMT):<br/>
Ok 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 12:25:18 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu presume this will be post 1.2? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/22119/
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 12:25:44 GMT):<br/>
same with any dependency on new version of baseimage
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 14:33:53 GMT):<br/>
yes.. We can push this post 1.2 as it is depending on baseimage
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 16:55:43 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @tongli while I agree with Tong's observation, we can refactor later. I would prefer we didn't hold up progress, please as we need to apply this to other repos.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 16:57:52 GMT):<br/>
because when all is said and done, this could simply use the scripts/bootstrap.sh script with some tweaks to be able to load nexus images
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 16:58:23 GMT):<br/>
but again, we can refactor 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 17:05:20 GMT):<br/>
yes I agree with you.. we can refactor this later.

<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 19:16:59 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 20:58:30 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @jtclark any reason this is being tracked as a bug and not a task? https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10598

</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 09:18:34 GMT):<br/>
as far as i can see it failed because it got a timeout stopping couchdb
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 09:18:49 GMT):<br/>
what am i meant to do in this case? how do i respin it?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 10:34:24 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu why do you think that CheckAvailability is preferable to a much simpler docker pull?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 10:49:04 GMT):<br/>
note that CheckAvailability won't work against nexus
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:18:50 GMT):<br/>
@cbf I thought, docker pull is not required as we have an option to verify the image availability through docker api also the verification we will do on dockerhub account
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:19:13 GMT):<br/>
But I am ok with any approach
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:22:22 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu good morning. just checked all of the jobs... everything looks ok :sunny: 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:33:40 GMT):<br/>
Oh ok so you have pushed the changes which I have asked yesterday and all jobs are now good for master, release branches or is this yesterday's status?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:34:02 GMT):<br/>
oh ignore my comment
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:34:05 GMT):<br/>
got it now.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:34:23 GMT):<br/>
Did you push changes to publish thirdparty images to nexus?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:34:42 GMT):<br/>
let me know if you need any help
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:38:43 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark you also have to verify the svt and pte jobs (fabric-test-svt-x86_64	, fabric-test-pte-x86_64) 
I see few issues in svt job.. I am fixing those two issues
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:38:56 GMT):<br/>
FAB-10620
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:52:00 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I'm going to push my changes for publishing the thirdparty images to nexus this morning
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:52:35 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu ok, I'll add those to my list
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:52:51 GMT):<br/>
so you are ready with the change?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:54:02 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu let me ask you - I'm implementing this by adding a new job via the fabric-images-release-jobs.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:55:02 GMT):<br/>
I have the script ready, but we're using templates there, so looks like I will need a new template to add a buildthirdparty builder to the JJB
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:55:23 GMT):<br/>
unless I can create these two jobs w/o using the template?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:57:15 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu ^
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:58:19 GMT):<br/>
see this job jjb/releases/fabric-baseimage-images-release-template.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:58:19 GMT):<br/>
see this job template jjb/releases/fabric-baseimage-images-release-template.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 14:00:27 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 14:40:54 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I found the other approach more complicated than we need... I did address your other issue.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 14:41:33 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 18:17:04 GMT):<br/>
@cbf builds with "make docker" is broken with https://github.com/golang/go/issues/25872
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 18:30:47 GMT):<br/>
wonderful
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 18:43:07 GMT):<br/>
Seems it's fixed now..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 20:51:33 GMT):<br/>
@cbf if this is a valid change (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/23277/), will push the same in fabric-ca repo
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 04:17:19 GMT):<br/>
@latitiah Could you please verify Integration test failure https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/Daily/job/fabric-nightly-release-job-x86_64/20/console
</p>
<p><strong>nirro</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 12:56:28 GMT):<br/>
hi, is there any issue with the Jenkins server?
I see in several different CRs failures, not related to the change, the failures are in SmokeTest/UnitTest/IntegrationTest inconsistently.. each time in different tests
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:33:55 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark could you please check this
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:44:34 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu yes, I'll look into it
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:44:52 GMT):<br/>
in fact, I just checked all of the jobs:
```
## Jun 19, 2018
### Daily
* fabric-end-2-end-daily-master-x86_64
* fabric-nightly-release-job-x86_64

### fabric

```
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:45:28 GMT):<br/>
the ones with the `*` are the jobs I wasn't sure needed to have JIRA tasks opened for them....
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:46:04 GMT):<br/>
I'll start with the fabric jobs first.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:55:20 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark I was referring @nirro job failure.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:55:30 GMT):<br/>
@nirro could you please give us the failed job
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:55:36 GMT):<br/>
will analyze 
</p>
<p><strong>nirro</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:56:13 GMT):<br/>
here is one job for example:
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22857/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:56:43 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark as said, you no need analyze verify jobs failures until they are failing consistently.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:58:23 GMT):<br/>
@nirro I see images are not pulled in smoke and integration test job. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:00:33 GMT):<br/>
@nirro you have rebased your patch that created patchset#6 (If there is not change in the code, CI don't trigger jobs)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:01:26 GMT):<br/>
and posted comments to trigger the jobs which failed to pull the images as no images and binaries available on the rebased commit
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:01:30 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu here is the failure reason for the smoke test:
```
Error: timeout waiting for channel creation
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Channel creation failed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
================== ERROR !!! FAILED to execute End-2-End Scenario ==================
```
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:01:30 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu here is the failure I'm seeing for the smoke test:
```
Error: timeout waiting for channel creation
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Channel creation failed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
================== ERROR !!! FAILED to execute End-2-End Scenario ==================
```
</p>
<p><strong>nirro</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:01:58 GMT):<br/>
yes, I ran the smoke and other manually, the questions is why images are not pulled in the tests..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:04:36 GMT):<br/>
@nirro I have posted the reason above
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:06:19 GMT):<br/>
Note: When you want to trigger a specific job, you can trigger the job by posting a comment against the job (ex: Run SmokeTest)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:09:41 GMT):<br/>
I just posted comment (VerifyBuild) in your patchset and let me see how this will go
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:40:06 GMT):<br/>
@nirro pls don;t rebase your changeset... It's working as expected.. I will take care of this changeset
</p>
<p><strong>nirro</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:40:48 GMT):<br/>
sure, I actually had to rebase since there were changes in different CRs
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:41:20 GMT):<br/>
Ok I think you did the final rebase right?
</p>
<p><strong>nirro</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:42:52 GMT):<br/>
as far as I know now I think it's final, but some of the CRs I'm depending on are not in my scope.. so I hope I won't need to rebase again :/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 15:27:50 GMT):<br/>
@nirro I see Integration tests are failing.. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-integration-tests-x86_64/282/console. I think it's not related to your change.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 15:28:32 GMT):<br/>
@latitiah is analyzing Integration Test failures.. 
</p>

@davidkhala this is a known issue in master, release-1.1, release-1.0 branches.. We have to update the baseimage with s390x/debian:stretch..

@rameshthoomu @cbf  .... I had to re-tag Fabric v1.1.1 (we needed to add a fix this weekend to fix another fix  :-) )
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 10:31:51 GMT):<br/>
I also modified the Makefile to no longer build `buildenv` and `testenv` when using `make docker` target
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 10:32:41 GMT):<br/>
So I think we should be able to build and publish images for x86, s390x and Power
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 13:43:52 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 14:53:48 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Published x86, s390x 1.1.1 images to dockerhub.. Do you want me to publish ppc64le as well?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 14:56:27 GMT):<br/>
how about fabric binaries?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 14:59:50 GMT):<br/>
We should probably do PPC since we did it for 1.1.0.
And yes ... if you can publish the binaries that would be fantastic
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 14:59:56 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 01:29:22 GMT):<br/>

btw, can u help check the errors in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/24281/? It seems some images and nexus artifacts are missed, which trigger error report. I believe it's not related to the code itself.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 02:10:49 GMT):<br/>
When you rebase the patchset, you have to trigger a job with `Run VerifyBuild` or `VerifyBuild`
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 02:11:44 GMT):<br/>
When you rebase the patchset, will get a new commit and then you have provided a comment `Run SmokeTest` which looks for the images on the new commit.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 02:12:29 GMT):<br/>
see this one https://ci-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/fabric_ci_process.html#rebasing-patch-sets
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 02:14:08 GMT):<br/>
by the way, Before rebase, the smoketests are failed due to the timeout error
```
00:02:50.528 Error: timeout waiting for channel creation

@rameshthoomu   - I know the problem .... 0.4.10 use Go 1.10
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 19:16:15 GMT):<br/>
1.1 was originally built against 1.9

yes.. also we have baseimage (0.4.10) with amd64 but the 1.1, 1.0 expecting x86_64.. I made changed to pull amd64-0.4.10 but the lint errors with go version..

<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 21:43:28 GMT):<br/>
That build just passed .. once again I'm guessing it got allocated to a vm build system where the java sdk is ok
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 23:40:10 GMT):<br/>
that was stange, we are only using one image for all these ubuntu nodes.. 1 single template.  .. maybe a glitch?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 23:45:16 GMT):<br/>
do you generate the vm each time from the template ?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 23:46:52 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing not --  You have a pool of vms that have been created by that single image that get continually reused  and on some that file is corrupt.

Patch#8 was a commit update change.. so we don't trigger build on patch#8.. and then @will tried to post a comment "Run SmokeTest" and there is no commit available in nexus to pull them.. So the curl command failed to download on Patch#8

https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11377 breaks the clean phase of builds on MacOS. Previous behavior would generate noise when no images exist to clean but the target would succeed. Now the target succeeds but leaves behind the images.

<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:14:49 GMT):<br/>
I changed the way fabric-chaincode-java build
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:15:04 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:15:52 GMT):<br/>
Now build result is 3 artifacts - protos jar, shim jar and docker image
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:16:28 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:17:36 GMT):<br/>
So, how I make those artifacts deployed - jars to maven central or other public repo we use and docker image pushed to docker hub?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:17:59 GMT):<br/>
do you have a patch set prepared for this change?
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:18:10 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:20:49 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl right off, I'll have to look at what we do in the fabric-chaincode-java by taking a look at the Jenkins jobs we have out there
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:21:09 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:21:15 GMT):<br/>
my first thought is that if we want to test this, we probably have to push one of the jobs to the sandbox, pull this patch and test
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:21:44 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, the new jars and/or images won't get pushed until this patch is Merged
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:21:54 GMT):<br/>
sure. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 14:22:14 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=ypCZLb7f6u2aT2wBm) @gennadyl @jtclark Look at the fabric-chaincode-java merge job to publish jar, you have to create a release job to publish chaincode-java docker image... 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:31:46 GMT):<br/>
to publish a docker image, first you have to request @jwagantall to create a repo in dockerhub
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:31:46 GMT):<br/>
to publish a docker image, first you have to request @jwagantall to create a image repo in dockerhub
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:32:05 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl I'm going to create a couple JIRA tasks: 1) updating the merge job 2) creating a release job to push the docker image
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:32:26 GMT):<br/>
Check with @gennadyl, when he want us to publish the jar files
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:32:32 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I think javaenv repo in docker hub already exist
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:32:39 GMT):<br/>
yes we have.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:32:48 GMT):<br/>
if it is javaenv.. then we have a repo.. 
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:33:02 GMT):<br/>
https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/fabric-javaenv/
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:35:31 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark I think we need to push jars as well
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:35:43 GMT):<br/>
as part of merge or release?
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:37:09 GMT):<br/>
At the end, end user, who write java chaincode, need those jars to compile it. 
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:38:09 GMT):<br/>
I mean, as part of compile dependencies in maven/gradle
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:38:25 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:39:08 GMT):<br/>
And same jars should be part of docker image, to reduce build time during instantiate
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:39:15 GMT):<br/>
do we have any commands/steps, how to publish these artifacts.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:40:11 GMT):<br/>
when a patch set is merged to fabric-chaincode-java, do we need to publish jars and a docker image ?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:40:34 GMT):<br/>
when we run a release of fabric-chaincode-java, do we need to publish jars and a docker image?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:40:49 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=xW8fRXYzouo2hc4eB) @gennadyl I think we have to update this as part of the image build process.. Do we have this step in the current image build process?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:41:13 GMT):<br/>
those are my questions :point_up_tone2: 
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:41:17 GMT):<br/>
Yes, as part of build
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:42:03 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark I think we need to publish both - jars and image
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:42:40 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Yes, jars are pushed to image during image build
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:42:59 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu so it sounds like we need to modify the merge job to publish the jars and publish the image to nexus
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:43:14 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark What the difference between merge and release?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:43:34 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl merge jobs happen with every merge to the master branch
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:44:14 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl release jobs are manually triggered during a release where we tag then publish stable artifacts for the release in play
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:44:18 GMT):<br/>
Let me think a minute
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:44:37 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu is this correct ?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:44:51 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl I would like you to create tasks for this work.. Please specify what exactly you need in the JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:45:10 GMT):<br/>
please create these tasks in FABCI Project
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:45:20 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Ok. Will do
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:45:30 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl I can help you if needed.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:45:32 GMT):<br/>
also, before we publish these, could you please check this bug FAB-9701
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:46:06 GMT):<br/>
fabric-chaincode-java merge job is broken since months.. 
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:47:12 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we had any merges tofabric-chaincode-java since months
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:50:30 GMT):<br/>
thanks @SriramaSharma @harsha for the update. Please let us know when you are ready with the build nodes.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:51:00 GMT):<br/>
I have assigned this to @sambhavdutt . He will test the jobs once the nodes are available for test.. 
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:52:33 GMT):<br/>
:thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 14:56:50 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I looked into FAB-9701 - it is one of the thing I hope we will solve now. 
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 15:00:27 GMT):<br/>
I will add comment there with links to new jiras
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 15:07:34 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark I think we will need to publish jars and image only during release
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 15:07:48 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @sambhavdutt  The nodes are already added to the jenkins-ci
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 15:12:13 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark Is it possible to publish during merge not each time, but only once jars API changed?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 15:15:56 GMT):<br/>
@gennadyl not entirely sure. we may be able to add some logic that looks for diffs....
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 15:26:22 GMT):<br/>
@jtclarck
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 15:27:03 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark I just opened jira and explained there problem with publishing
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 15:27:16 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 15:27:40 GMT):<br/>
I have to move now, will try to reconnect later this evening
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 15:28:08 GMT):<br/>
I'll have a look shortly
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 15:29:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes that’s possible.. @jtclark pls look into the docs job for the logic @gennadyl [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=MQwHqgQMgWuy3A8uN)

@rameshthoomu @cbf do we need to do anything about the ppc CI errors in baseimage?  I'd like to get the updates that we reverted before v1.2 merged back in: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/24427/
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 19:33:27 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 19:38:24 GMT):<br/>
ok, i'll manually verify and merge, while Ramesh looks into that
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 19:41:45 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>SriramaSharma</strong> (Wed, 08 Aug 2018 04:54:35 GMT):<br/>
@cbf @rameshthoomu Would like to get the ppc64le builds back on to the CI. When the builds were disabled before 1.2 release, we weren't having any issues with the build nodes. Now that we have beefed up the build servers with more compute, we can even plan to have nightly builds done. So request your support and consent in getting the ppc64le builds back in community CI. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 08 Aug 2018 04:58:14 GMT):<br/>
@SriramaSharma Will test these unit and e2e tests on new power nodes and will update the results..

@rameshthoomu, Hello, we are having an issue with jenkins for the `fabric-chaincode-evm`. All of our runs are failing at the same stage: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-chaincode-evm-verify-master-x86_64/4/console. We get that JENKINS-41339 error. I am thinking it is because we try to modify the PATH variable. I think we have to do something like `PATH+EXTRA`, but I am not familiar with jenkins. Also wondering if you can help me test changes in the Jenkinsfile in general.

@rameshthoomu, @scottz, @latitiah, @sambhavdutt - please have a look at https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABCI-7. With @jwagantall support, I was able to implement a *new tab* that highlights the merge jobs (production), and a new build-monitor dashboard view (sandbox).
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 00:24:27 GMT):<br/>
@cbf :point_up_tone2: FYI - this is to address the "overall health" feedback we heard during the CI playback
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 00:32:10 GMT):<br/>
That's a lot of jobs. Can we keep only the "master branch" merge jobs and daily SVT jobs and the interop job (once we establish it) here on this birds-eye-openstream tab, and move all others to another tab for the birds-eye-prev-rls? 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 00:46:26 GMT):<br/>
@scottz sure, we can have as many or as few as we want.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 00:47:24 GMT):<br/>
as we discussed, we started with highlighting all MERGE jobs, but if that's too many, we should def narrow it down to the most important.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 00:48:15 GMT):<br/>
@scottz re: multiple tabs, in my opinion, that defeats the purpose. one tab is enough, IMHO.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 00:50:23 GMT):<br/>
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/view/Build-Monitor/ <---- this to me is where we should go.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 04:59:26 GMT):<br/>
@scottz we have couple of more options as per the build monitor plugin https://github.com/jan-molak/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin#i-have-too-many-jobs-on-one-screen-what-should-i-do.. I have requested LF team to install required plugins in sandbox.. Once these are installed, will look into it and see how we can minimize these with the filter option
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 05:05:05 GMT):<br/>

@sambhavdutt seems nightly-release-1.2 builds are failing since two days.. Is there any known issue in integration tests?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 18:07:36 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=qaZwS7PwMgvFh9qam) @rameshthoomu I saw that the integration tests are timing out in one test but integration are passing in the fabric-builds, so I didn't create a bug thinking it would be a slow test error like curl
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 18:08:20 GMT):<br/>
I'll go ahead and create one now
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 18:08:46 GMT):<br/>

@rameshthoomu Seeing a problem with the node chaincode builds on Z. Don't think it's related to the CR could be environmental ?

I'm periodically seeing rm: cannot remove '/tmp/fabric-shim/chaincode/hyperledger/fabric/peer/mychannel.block': Permission denied in the Go SDK S390 job (which fails the job). Created https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABCI-61
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 17:45:30 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda sometimes our s390x cleanup script is not deleting /tmp/fabric-shim directory.. We updated scripts to delete this directory but it seems some jobs are missing this command

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=rE76YKr7phtjmnfME) @rameshthoomu Does this cause the permission denied error?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 17:56:55 GMT):<br/>
yes.. I think fabric-sdk-node or fabric-chaincode-node tests are setting root permissions on this directory.. So, Jenkins is unable to delete this directory.. In s390x we use a cleanup script after the build is completed.. It seems some times it's failing to delete
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 18:03:03 GMT):<br/>
btw - are builds able to interfere with each other by using the same directory name?
</p>
<p><strong>jeremyphelps</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 22:24:00 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda That is a definite possibility. if they run on statically configured nodes in the same workspace.
</p>
<p><strong>jeremyphelps</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 22:25:16 GMT):<br/>
on a dynamically provisioned node, even if the workspace doesn't get deleted, it should not be reused for a subsequent job.  Although I have heard of this happening before.

@jtclark Could you please work on these two FABCI-72 and FABCI-73 ( Both are Highest Priority) as per @dave.enyeart these are blockers for SDK integration testing.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:04:02 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart FYI  javaenv image is not available on s390x platform.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:07:14 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu ok, what needs to be done?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:09:07 GMT):<br/>
we have to add a s390x job for fabric-chaincode-java builds and publish images which is compaitable for s390x platforms

@rameshthoomu @bretharrison Do you know why the merge job always fails on fabric release-1.2?  appears to be related to node sdk.  e.g. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/25827/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 18:34:41 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 18:35:11 GMT):<br/>
actually it is not specific to release-1.2, also fails on fabric master merge job, e.g.: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/25463/

<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 15:46:44 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt  When you are through with Dave... it looks like the daily master PTE tests did not run last night. When I looked to determine why, it looks like the upstream job did not work: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-nightly-release-job-master-x86_64/96/. Would that have prevented the pte tests from running?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 15:52:02 GMT):<br/>
@scottz yes, that prevented the daily tests from running, the x node was out of space even when the build was successful. Updated the details morning today in the JIRA Bug for this, 
FABCI-76
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 15:56:20 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @sambhavdutt !  I'll defer review to @rameshthoomu and @jwagantall

@dave.enyeart will do
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 15:58:32 GMT):<br/>
i converted it from FABN to FAB-CI : https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABCI-79
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 16:00:20 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt  should we apply the ci_failure label to that, and other similar bugs? Since we now have a FABCI project, I guess the fabric-ci label is not so useful anymore. The filters can sort the LF and CI issues into different list, based on project.
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 16:02:32 GMT):<br/>
@scottz yes, the FABCI project should be good, I will change the `labels`
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 16:09:53 GMT):<br/>

After we finish editing labels we should refine this, and publicize the list.  Also, some of these bugs will automatically show up on the Defect lists of the v1.3 page (those in Fabric project that are not quality/sdk issues); we need to make sure you and the team create the CI_FAILURE bugs by filling in the correct fields in such a way that they will be visible on the "Needs Triage" defect list: https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?filter=12267
</p>

@rameshthoomu you're right, we're all good, I was looking at the final entry only... I see in earlier entries that fabric-ca-verify did indeed run.

@rameshthoomu Can you add javaenv image pull before fabric build, in same way as you did for fabric-sdk-java?
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Mon, 03 Sep 2018 13:48:04 GMT):<br/>
I am seeing a _fabric-sdk-node_ CR build passing on X86 but failing on s390x. The failure looks to be this, which isn't something I can influence or fix:
```14:43:53 [fabric-sdk-node8-verify-master-s390x] $ /bin/bash -eu /tmp/jenkins110674015023732511.sh
14:43:53 rm: cannot remove '/tmp/fabric-shim/chaincode/hyperledger/fabric/peer/mychannel.block': Permission denied
14:43:53 rm: cannot remove '/tmp/fabric-shim/chaincode/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto': Permission denied
14:43:53 Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure
```
Can anyone help?

@sambhavdutt Create a JIRA to clean up unused images from s390x build nodes.. I see old baseimages are also available in s390x build nodes.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 20:19:20 GMT):<br/>
we have to keep only latest active developement images (0.4.11 or 0.4.10 versions)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 20:21:23 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu will this remove these errors :```19:42:10 Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete b96aeb4b61e3 (cannot be forced) - image has dependent child images

yes right.. but this not impacting your build results.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 20:23:26 GMT):<br/>
you can ignore above two errors for now.. @sambhavdutt will create Jira items and will work on this

@Baha-sk Are you generating cobertura coverage report in sdk-go jobs?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 20:24:19 GMT):<br/>
ok, not sure why the builds are not stable though.. sometimes integration tests fail, and sometimes not.. and sometimes I see the errors above
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 20:24:40 GMT):<br/>
I see this 
```
00:11:57.926 [Cobertura] Publishing Cobertura coverage report...

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 20:25:07 GMT):<br/>

@sambhavdutt assign the first issue to LF team

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 20:27:48 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk I think the cobertura coverage report name should be `**/cobertura-coverage.xml` not the `**/report.xml`
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 20:27:55 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 20:29:36 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu we don't use cobertura in Fabric SDK Go.. this is probably a job script copy from Fabric? we have no control over this

Hi @jtclark  

will be over there in a short while, checking on some changes in gerrit

There have been many intermittent unit test failures in fabric CI the last couple days. Here’s an update on the two most common ones:
- TestCreds intermittent unit test failure being worked under: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26136/.
- TestGoodChannelCreateConfigUpdate unit test fix was merged today as https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26144/, rebase on master to pick up that fix.
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 18:20:14 GMT):<br/>
yes, today especially
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 18:20:37 GMT):<br/>
the bug is ready, can I post it
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 18:21:09 GMT):<br/>
I held back when some of the unit-tests passed about a couple hours back
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 18:21:40 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart thanks, got my answer
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 18:21:42 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart can you confirm which fabric jobs we are looking to pull the fabric-chaincode-java images for? I'm thinking we want to for the smoke, verify, merge, and merge-e2e tests

@jwagantall @tijohnson @dave.enyeart @jtclark 

Jason and I just had a chat about https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26157/ and https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26080/
we agreed that https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26080/ can be merged first, then make the changes in other accordingly, can I request to get https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26080/ merged if you think it's ok
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:48:42 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall @dave.enyeart @tijohnson @rameshthoomu 

Can you look into this CR too, I hope I am not rushing you 

https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26169/
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:57:07 GMT):<br/>
no worries @sambhavdutt  let me take a peek
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:57:18 GMT):<br/>
so https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26080/ first.. right?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:57:38 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall yes & thank you
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:58:15 GMT):<br/>
that patch is basically a prereq for the other
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:58:39 GMT):<br/>
we're basically doing the same thing in both the patches mentioned above (pulling the java chaincode image)
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:59:04 GMT):<br/>
so we need that one merged first, then I'll have to rebase and update my patchset
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:59:17 GMT):<br/>
so that we're not pulling the image twice
</p>

<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:08:03 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark @sambhavdutt  whats the difference between "MARCH" and "ARCH" ?
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:08:14 GMT):<br/>
other than a missing "M" :joy_cat: 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:09:21 GMT):<br/>
I don't think that there is a diff, is there @sambhavdutt ?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:10:09 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall yes, it is just that in this particular script the *MARCH* variable runs the `go env GOARCH` which would output the architecture as we know
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:10:29 GMT):<br/>
Can we use the same varaible across scripts?
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:10:36 GMT):<br/>
same name
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:11:19 GMT):<br/>
yes, let me change that
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:11:28 GMT):<br/>
thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:11:31 GMT):<br/>
is less confusing
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:11:42 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:12:56 GMT):<br/>
Also.. if you need to unset that variable between scripts you might need to add that.. If we want the same value between scripts, we should be good to go.. 
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:14:05 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall yes, will checkon this 
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:30:11 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall I have updated the `ARCH` on the scripts in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26080/ , I checked that there are no followup scripts that would need the `MARCH`
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:34:36 GMT):<br/>
thnaks!
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:34:40 GMT):<br/>
let me re-review
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:35:59 GMT):<br/>
looks good to me approved!
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:36:03 GMT):<br/>
next  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26157/ right?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:36:19 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall yes, but now it needs to be updated 
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:36:42 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=upTMGTqzuMiWRZaFv) @jwagantall thank you
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:36:43 GMT):<br/>
oh yes please.. the MARCH thingy
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:40:32 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:46:34 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall Can you look into this too when you are free https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26169/
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:51:47 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:52:02 GMT):<br/>
thank you
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:52:22 GMT):<br/>
yes.. looks good to me
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:52:36 GMT):<br/>
let me know once the https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26157/ is ready 
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:53:08 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall will do
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:35:58 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt question for you
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:37:13 GMT):<br/>
with FABCI-84 that was just merged, you added the chaincode java image pull to the `fabric-unit-tests-verification` right? 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:37:45 GMT):<br/>
that means that any of the fabric jobs that DON'T utilize this builder
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:37:59 GMT):<br/>
still aren't pulling the chaincode java image, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:39:26 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark yes, and I have added this to the fabric-integration tests too, the javaenv image pull
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:40:06 GMT):<br/>
ok so I just need to make sure that **my** patch set doesn't use the builder I created
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:40:11 GMT):<br/>
later we can fix it
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:41:16 GMT):<br/>
for example: fabric-merge does not use the `fabric-unit-tests-verification` builder
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:41:33 GMT):<br/>
so I can safely add my `pull-nexus-chaincode-java-image` builder
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:41:48 GMT):<br/>
and it won't pull the image twice
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:42:53 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:43:24 GMT):<br/>
ok I think we're good. I just rebased my patch and from what I can see, we're not using both builders in the same fabric job.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:59:52 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall I think that this change is ready
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 20:00:28 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt @jwagantall can you take a look plz? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26157/
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 20:01:05 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark will check
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sun, 09 Sep 2018 13:07:49 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @sambhavdutt @smithbk @skarim Any idea why CI is failing for fabric-ca?  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26117/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 09 Sep 2018 13:44:03 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart I am on mobile right now but checked the basic logs.. Seems we can ignore this result as s390x build is showing unstable
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 09 Sep 2018 13:45:10 GMT):<br/>
unstable is because we are getting error in the post build action which is not related to the build
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 09 Sep 2018 13:45:30 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt could you pls verify this and confirm pls
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Sun, 09 Sep 2018 14:55:55 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart @rameshthoomu I will look into this now
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Sun, 09 Sep 2018 15:31:25 GMT):<br/>
it's still unstable in fabric-ca for https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26117/, does not look like a build error to me too
</p>

@rameshthoomu @sambhavdutt: can someone please publish fabric 1.3 docker images for use with fabric-ca? Right now, they are using 1.2 images in the makefile.
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:14:24 GMT):<br/>
I can change the makefile to use the correct version, but it still errors out because the 1.3 builds for fabric have not been published
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:15:39 GMT):<br/>
@latitiah 
I will check on this

```
the fabric and ca are using the 1.3.0, I had rebased one of Ramesh's change and pushed it for this, just wanted to make sure if we are pulling the right ones on the latest build. 
Did I answer your question correctly..
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:47:27 GMT):<br/>
no, the fabric-ca-peer and fabric-ca-orderer builds are using v1.2 fabric-peer/orderer builds. I've verified this already.
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:48:33 GMT):<br/>
I am fixing the Makefile so that the builds for these images uses the correct base image, but one of the issues that I had was with pulling the correct published fabric-peer and fabric-orderer builds.
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:48:48 GMT):<br/>
I've fixed this for local builds.
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:49:38 GMT):<br/>
I'm not totally sure how CI is performing these builds - do you build fabric, then build fabric-ca?
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:49:58 GMT):<br/>
Do you only build fabric-ca and pull the necessary images as needed?
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:51:33 GMT):<br/>
I can spend more time to make sure that both scenarios work, but it's not necessary to do so, if you always build a set, prescribed way.
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:54:00 GMT):<br/>
in the `fabric-ca` now, we are building the images for ca and fabric, 
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:54:28 GMT):<br/>
(you can see my posts and conversations about this in #fabric-ca and #fabric-orderer from last night)
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:55:34 GMT):<br/>
fabric-ca only builds ca images. It pulls fabric images.

You can look at the Steps in the pastebin above
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:56:51 GMT):<br/>
You'll notice it's pulling v1.2 images for fabric-ca-peer and fabric-ca-orderer
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:58:03 GMT):<br/>
thanks I'll check, 
sorry, yes, I mean we are cloning the fabric and `make docker` in the `ca` builds
I'll see if I can update this wit a CR
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:59:17 GMT):<br/>
no worries. I already have a fix for the Makefile issue, but wanted to make sure that I didn't break anything that CI has in place.
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:59:45 GMT):<br/>
I'll be sure to put you on the CR that I'm about to push now, then maybe you can test it in the sandbox

@rameshthoomu two CRs were merged to fabric-baseimage; when/how do the images get updated and pushed?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:18:49 GMT):<br/>
@cbf or @dave.enyeart has to tag fabric-baseimage.. Once the repo is tagged with new baseimage version, jobs will trigger and push images to dockerhub
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:28:38 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu ok will do shortly
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:29:00 GMT):<br/>
on a separate note, we aren't publishing the fabric-javaenv images to nexus (or dockerhub, for that matter)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:29:12 GMT):<br/>
built in the CI for fabric-chaincode-java
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:30:06 GMT):<br/>
then we also need to update the pull_artifacts script and the various bootstrap
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:30:11 GMT):<br/>
for 1.3
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:31:05 GMT):<br/>

@rameshthoomu we just got the new fabric-macro merged in that will pull the javaenv image (from nexus) in all associated fabric jobs
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:31:40 GMT):<br/>
every successful fabric-chaincode-java merge will publish javaenv image to nexus repo.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:32:06 GMT):<br/>
Will update release job CI scripts to push javaenv image to dockerhub.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:33:54 GMT):<br/>
ah, so then the sha is not the same as fabric
</p>

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:34:49 GMT):<br/>
Pushing it to nexus with `amd64-latest` tag.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:34:52 GMT):<br/>
how do we label the latest stable version?

latests thanls
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:35:24 GMT):<br/>
in all the subsequent jobs we are using above tag to pull and re-tagging
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:35:40 GMT):<br/>
ok, the pull_artifacts.sh needs a section for that

A nice touch IMO across all project for every build would be a `reverify-failed`   that would see what  builds failed and retrigger :)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=oauvxkfdpuK2JpvWJ) @nirro Like you said , the test is failing in *basic-checks* that performs basic checks like license, spelling and linter checks. Could they be because of a syntax or typo
</p>
<p><strong>nirro</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 12:32:13 GMT):<br/>
I have no idea.. I haven't changed anything except for removing one directory
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 12:32:59 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt perhaps we open a bug for this, and investigate?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 12:35:16 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark yes if it is a consistent fail, will check if it happens again and we can decide to open one
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 12:37:09 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt looks like the `check-deps` step in the Makefile is failing
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 12:40:10 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark yes, one of the linter checks `make linter`
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 12:43:27 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt right. that make target calls check-deps
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 12:44:06 GMT):<br/>
which basically just runs dep version and dep check
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 13:04:50 GMT):<br/>
@nirro ignore the above error you have posted. In CI, we have condition which checks for the trailing spaces on the files committed in the patchset. As these files are removed from the patchset it's says it can't find that files. The script continued further and executed dep-check and failed with the below error. 

```

<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 13:06:34 GMT):<br/>

how can I understand what's going on using make linter command?
I  can't understand from this error what is the problem..
</p>
<p><strong>nirro</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 13:16:30 GMT):<br/>

FAB-12272
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 00:43:51 GMT):<br/>
This issue is related to CouchDB Custom Channel BYFN tests that are failing because of Timeout. The default timeout was increased from 3 seconds to 15 seconds, but this issue is still intermittent. What I want to ask is, the same test runs well on the local systems, with even the 3 second Delay but does not when it runs on the x or z nodes even when the time is increased to 15 seconds. 
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 00:44:26 GMT):<br/>
Does it have to do with the Jenkins worker nodes that run these tests

@sambhavdutt see the couch log here https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-nightly-release-job-release-1.3-x86_64/9/Docker_Container_Logs/peer0.org1-custom-channel-couch.log.gz

handleRequest -> WARN 04d[0m Retrying couchdb request in 125ms. Attempt:1  Error:Get http://couchdb0:5984/: dial tcp 172.19.0.6:5984: connect: connection refused
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:40:25 GMT):<br/>
@AdnanC could you please give us some inputs on the above error
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:42:01 GMT):<br/>
it means couchdb was not available when the peer tried to connect, all retries were exhausted
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:42:38 GMT):<br/>
do you have the log from the couchdb container?  would be interesting to compare timestamps with the associated peer log
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:43:15 GMT):<br/>
are the CI machines resource constrained relative to local hardware?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:44:08 GMT):<br/>
@chris.elder has been looking into relative slow couchdb start time ever since the new baseimage was created
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:44:27 GMT):<br/>
we have seen it be a couple seconds slower than prior baseimage
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:45:03 GMT):<br/>
but i can't explain why it would be 30 seconds or more slower, unless the environments are very resource constrained
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:45:30 GMT):<br/>
yes I too observed the same error while testing new baseimage but this got fixed after we increase the timeout
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:45:39 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart see the couch logs here https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-nightly-release-job-release-1.3-x86_64/9/Docker_Container_Logs/
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:48:26 GMT):<br/>
in this example, the last peer retry was at 02:24:12.777 , while couchdb0 container first log message was at 02:24:14.483
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:48:59 GMT):<br/>
so it missed by a few seconds
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:49:22 GMT):<br/>
why it is taking so long to spin up the couchdb0 container, i do not know...
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:51:49 GMT):<br/>
We had these issues intermittently with build nodes but in this case it seems consistent with the latest changes in couchdb.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:51:59 GMT):<br/>
until we figure this out, CORE_LEDGER_STATE_COUCHDBCONFIG_MAXRETRIESONSTARTUP could be increased from default of 10 to 20
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:51:59 GMT):<br/>
until we figure this out, peer's CORE_LEDGER_STATE_COUCHDBCONFIG_MAXRETRIESONSTARTUP could be increased from default of 10 to 20
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:52:42 GMT):<br/>
each retry will wait 2x as long as the prior retry
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:52:46 GMT):<br/>
may be increasing few more secs may fix this issue but we need to look into these issues more closely.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:53:19 GMT):<br/>
@tijohnson @jwagantall ^^ we need your help in accessing one x build and try this test case manually
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 01:57:17 GMT):<br/>
Thank you all for your inputs on this 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:00:37 GMT):<br/>
also MAX_RETRY can be increased from 5 in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/first-network/scripts/script.sh#L24
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:01:12 GMT):<br/>
that would probably be better than further increasing the 15 second delay
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:03:26 GMT):<br/>
increase to maybe 15, for about 225 seconds (15x15) of retries rather than current 75 (5x15) seconds of retries
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:04:14 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart thank you, I will submit a CR to increase this
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:04:34 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26733/ -- Just for testing 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:07:00 GMT):<br/>
in fabric-samples, the same test is taking 4 retries.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:30:58 GMT):<br/>
I am changing maxRetriesOnStartup, so that you don't have to override it: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26735/
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:33:04 GMT):<br/>
that will take it from 2minutes to 8minutes of total retries... i don't like it... but better than failing a CI job
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:35:18 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart please submit the same change in release-1.3
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:35:36 GMT):<br/>
Do you want me to abandon my change https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26734/
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:43:28 GMT):<br/>
we need both
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:43:54 GMT):<br/>
mine will keep peer alive longer, yours will keep byfn alive longer :)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:44:18 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:44:53 GMT):<br/>
I'd advise move MAX_RETRY higher than 7
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:45:15 GMT):<br/>
how much you suggest? 15 ?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:45:42 GMT):<br/>
for now yes... it's a painful delay, but better than CI failure until we figure this out
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:46:30 GMT):<br/>
I cherry picked mine to release-1.3 as well: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26737/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:47:00 GMT):<br/>
I don't think this will take more than 5 re-tries.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:47:36 GMT):<br/>
it's failing at current 5 MAX_RETRIES sometimes right
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:47:36 GMT):<br/>
it's failing at current 5 MAX_RETRY sometimes right
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:48:02 GMT):<br/>
correct.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:48:19 GMT):<br/>
how about 10 then
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:48:52 GMT):<br/>
I think that's; better.. Will run few times with that number in sandbox
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:49:03 GMT):<br/>
ok, want me to +2 it?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:49:51 GMT):<br/>
Will update to 10

yes.. posted the same in #ci-pipeline 
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 21:50:40 GMT):<br/>
I could use some help to understand why our weekly test suite, which passed a 12hour test on Oct 1 and created a console log and an xml file, shows no results when I click on "Test Results Analyzer" link. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-svt-weekly-pte-x86_64/
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 21:51:41 GMT):<br/>
Does the jenkins job look for the xml file in the fabric-test/regression/weekly/ folder as it should?
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:21:08 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt  @latitiah  The CI Daily behave tests must be failing every day in orderer.feature file because
there is NO peer or orderer rows with any xml file results in the display at
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-daily-behave-master-x86_64/test_results_analyzer/

For example, see this job:
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-daily-behave-master-x86_64/41/consoleFull
IS there a bug open for this failure? I don't see one. If not, we need one and need to fix this pronto!
orderer.feature FAB3852 1.3 : solo, nodejs sdk
  When an admin instantiates the chaincode on "peer0.org1.example.com"
  Assertion Failed: The expected chaincode container 6d75a2a2c55011e8965dfa163e3c24df-peer0.org1.example.com-mycc-0 is not running
OError: [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable

And this one
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-daily-behave-master-x86_64/42/console
fails at
orderer.feature FAB3851 1.1 : solo, nodejs sdk

</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:43:51 GMT):<br/>
@scottz FAB-12040 is the open bug for Behave tests, and some comment on FABCI-144

I will create one for orderer.feature FAB3852 1.3 : solo, nodejs sdk
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:49:35 GMT):<br/>
@latitiah just checked the test on Sandbox that was triggered after the latest patch was merged , 
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/fabric-test-daily-behave-master-x86_64/1/consoleFull
failed because of a Jenkins error, 
```
hudson.remoting.ChannelClosedException: Channel "unknown": Remote call on snd-ubuntu1604-x86_64-4c-16g-16 failed. The channel is closing down or has closed down

```

</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:52:42 GMT):<br/>
should wait for the nightly build to kick off the Behave tests for an accurate result
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 01:09:53 GMT):<br/>
@mbwhite https://fabric-shim.github.io/master/
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 01:23:57 GMT):<br/>
Yes, also the test above mentioned by @scottz failed due to resource issues (again) ```04:08:19 IOError: [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable
``` It should be noted, I'm 99% sure there are containers that are still running with those jobs after the first failure (as we've discussed before) so I can see there being possible resource issues.

Hi! Working on some integration tests for `fabric-chaincode-evm` and was wondering does the travis job have node installed on it or do we have to do something to enable that?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:45:20 GMT):<br/>
Hi @swetha is that travis or Jenkins? 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:45:36 GMT):<br/>
Jenkins I think
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:45:40 GMT):<br/>
Sorry I meant jenkins

@rameshthoomu I'm looking at the `fabric-chaincode-evm` jobs....verify and merge... I don't see in the configuration where node is installed, does this mean that the baseimage has node included?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:52:13 GMT):<br/>
@swetha I'm confirm my question above with Ramesh, but if you let us know what your integration tests need, we can make sure that the job launches nodes with any prerequisite tools
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:52:13 GMT):<br/>
@swetha I'll confirm my question above with Ramesh, but if you let us know what your integration tests need, we can make sure that the job launches nodes with any prerequisite tools
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:53:01 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark Thanks! Currently just need to add node. I am planning on packaging the node_modules required with the tests so that should be covered
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:53:30 GMT):<br/>
@swetha As we have multiple versions of node dealing in different repo's.. We use nvm to install node on the vm for every build. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:53:50 GMT):<br/>
if you use containers to do your tests, then the node is installed in baseimage. 
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:54:44 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we are using containers, but if nvm is there I can use that to install node and packages I need

Okay thanks! Will do
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:59:52 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark Does this line imply node is installed? https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-evm/blob/master/Jenkinsfile#L10
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:00:59 GMT):<br/>
ah.... didn't realize that this was a Pipeline Jenkins job....
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:02:04 GMT):<br/>
does that mean we need to do something else?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:02:25 GMT):<br/>
we're adding the path that's for sure, but I'd have to look into whether or not node is installed. I think what Ramesh said is true- since we use containers for most of our jobs, we have a baseimage for those containers that includes node. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:02:41 GMT):<br/>
no using Pipeline is ok, we're switching to it.
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:03:01 GMT):<br/>
okay, how do I see if we are using containers?

this is the merge job for fabric-chaincode-evm. I'm going to dig through this to see if I can answer your question :-)
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:04:55 GMT):<br/>
Thanks so much! Please let me know what I can do to help in this process
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:05:16 GMT):<br/>
Indeed. Adding the FABCI JIRA task would help.

@rameshthoomu the java chaincode tests are now passing, i suspect that the node build was looking for a tagged npm modulet that didn't exist yet. The failures (looking at the last set of available logs) are now failing at the "fabric network" tests. There was a decision made to prevent the publishing of `fabric-network`, which leads me to believe that we are witnessing the same type of "module not found" error here. Is there any way i can view the peer logs on the fabric-sdk-node merge builds to verify this suspicion?

<p><strong>dthom</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 13:04:53 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu yes, I'm working on recreating the issue
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 13:06:59 GMT):<br/>
@dthom thanks
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 13:07:57 GMT):<br/>
@nkl199 I will run this in sandbox and provide you the logs..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 18:59:58 GMT):<br/>
@bretharrison shall I close this https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABCI-138?

</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 19:04:35 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 19:05:20 GMT):<br/>
OK, maybe tomorrow
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 19:07:04 GMT):<br/>
this should go first before trigger any chaincode-node merge job from master branch https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26773/

<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 20:47:27 GMT):<br/>
Can you check this one when free, not done yet, have to add the baseimage condition to change `-snapshot` to 0.4.13
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26861/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 21:01:56 GMT):<br/>
yes. please add that and let me know once done.. I have added a comment
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 21:02:12 GMT):<br/>
please address them and verify this in sandbox on s390x platform

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 21:02:55 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall Could you please add `gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/$PROJECT` to BASE_DIR
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 21:03:06 GMT):<br/>
like $GIT_BASE
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 21:14:42 GMT):<br/>
@tijohnson  Can you please help on this request please?  I can review your change once you have it ready
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 21:34:37 GMT):<br/>
@tijohnson could you please verify this error https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/ci-management-jjb-verify/1811/console
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 22:23:54 GMT):<br/>
I expect the add the path to BASE_DIR will solve that problem, sending change out for review  in about a minute
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 22:54:00 GMT):<br/>
@ramesh change is out for review: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/26862

The gotools are failing to build in fabric, this is affecting all the fabric related jobs.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:34:02 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt Matt has provided a fix in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26937/
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:34:41 GMT):<br/>
Do you have rebase privilege on other people's CRs?  I believe all failing CRs will need to be rebased after https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26937/ is merged
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:38:41 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart I don't have the rebase access, I will check with @rameshthoomu who has the rebase privilege for ci jobs
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:42:59 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt ok, probably better if you just add a comment to each failing CR suggesting that clicking 'Rebase' will resolve the problem, after https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26937/ is merged of course
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:43:45 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart sure thing, will do that

@dave.enyeart, @rameshthoomu I'd like to complete the go 1.11.1 upgrade. I believe go 1.11.1 is already in all of the packer images so the big hold up is the base image. The CR is out there so, iiuc, the next required steps are merging, tagging, and publishing.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 13:01:54 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark It's been there since 1.2 it part of the verify merge

I don't see how any recent changes impacted that.

</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:20:26 GMT):<br/>
I removed that cause it shouldn't be needed as current sdk seems to work .. not sure why 1.0.0 would choke 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:21:26 GMT):<br/>
you removed it just now, or it's been removed?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:21:33 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:21:34 GMT):<br/>
now
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:21:37 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:21:50 GMT):<br/>
trying another reverify?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:21:56 GMT):<br/>
wait
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:21:59 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:29:24 GMT):<br/>
I restored that .. I'm confused cause it isn't needed for 1.3

Hi, looks like s390 is encountering some issues,
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-go-tests-verify-s390x/4092/console

all SDK s390 builds started to fail since last night
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:33:50 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark  I'm fairly certain that was it  -- have to update fabric.sh too for it work   thanks .. didn't know  dockerlogs were directed there or else I would have caught this
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:44:48 GMT):<br/>
good that they are
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:45:12 GMT):<br/>

@swetha could you please look into this https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26827/

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 18:17:02 GMT):<br/>
@sykesm observed goimport errors on fabric builds. Could you please check this https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-verify-build-checks-x86_64/6052/console
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 18:52:15 GMT):<br/>
This is another example of fallout from constantly rebuilding tools from master. 
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 18:52:57 GMT):<br/>
3 hours ago, a commit landed (that I disagree with) into goimports. It no longer honors explicit grouping
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 18:53:19 GMT):<br/>
since each and every one of our builds pulls the tools from master at the time of the build, we get what we get
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 18:53:38 GMT):<br/>
so, as with earlier in the week with lint, we've been bitten by imports
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 18:58:22 GMT):<br/>
for those that want to look: https://github.com/golang/tools/commit/12a7c317e894c0a622b5ed27f0a102fcdd56d1ad

It impacts builds back to at least 1.2
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 19:18:50 GMT):<br/>
actually looks like linting 1.0 is impacted as well
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:43:12 GMT):<br/>
a 1.4.0 snapshot has been published though
</p>

@mbwhite can you also confirm which branch we need to publish the fabric-contract-api module?
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:52:10 GMT):<br/>
it's master
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:52:24 GMT):<br/>

Hi all, I've just raised https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABCI-170 as it is currently blocking work on a fabric-sdk-node jira. It relates to the requirement of publishing a new npm package to enable code consolidation within the fabric-sdk-node repository

Hi!
Is there a plan to integrate IoTs to fabric? 
For example, an IoT can update transactions into the fabric periodically. 
How do we authenticate it? 
What APIs are provided for the IoT to connect? 
How do we secure the APIs?

@tijohnson Let me know after you update the the maven version to 3.5.0
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 20:25:40 GMT):<br/>

it that true for both production and sandbox ?

Hi All, We are still having issues with node in our jenkins pipeline job for fabric-chaincode-evm. It does seem like it successfully installs but some reason from our run integration script node is no longer there. We need a little help to make sure we are running our tests correctly with the node installation.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 00:31:45 GMT):<br/>
@swetha Shall I push change on top of your patch?

I stopped it from forking. But it affects Jcoco so not a good solution.  I want Maven upgraded to the version I'm running 3.5 .
I have another *theory* that it can't fork because of lack of memory -- it's a long shot.  Maybe fabric and the JDK has gone over what the VM will give? 
But still lets get Maven updated

@rameshthoomu Question about the node fix for the fabric-chaincode integration tests. Is it unavoidable about installing node in the integration test script? I am trying to keep all the jenkins specific aspect of the tests in the Jenkinsfile
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 21:54:18 GMT):<br/>
I think it is possible.. I am doing the same in fabric-sdk-node and it's working as expected.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 21:54:42 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 21:55:04 GMT):<br/>
Keep it in Jenkinsfile and will see how that goes.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 21:55:29 GMT):<br/>
if that doesn't work, then I will use withEnv to install the node from Jenkinsfile
</p>

@swetha the jenkins sandbox has the pipeline v2.5 installed.. we can install it in prod once is tested in sandbox
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 01:28:46 GMT):<br/>
if I wanted to have a build image, rather than some final artifact. I suppose I can build it in one step and carry it around through future steps, but it might make more sense for it to be commonly available rather than 'only on the build makchine'.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 01:30:51 GMT):<br/>
You can use nexus3 for docker and nexu2 for binaries to keep regular artifacts.. 
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 01:31:00 GMT):<br/>
neat.
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 01:31:25 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall Okay so until that happens we won't be able to have the node plugin?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 01:32:30 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall I think you have install https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/NodeJS+Plugin in sandbox to test with pipeline
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 01:33:11 GMT):<br/>
yea.. the node one it is there too 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 01:33:42 GMT):<br/>
looks like for some reason Node JS 1.2.7 is installed in prod but the pipeline plugin in not.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 01:33:53 GMT):<br/>
I can re-adjust prod once sandbox is tested

I've heard of no issues of anyone else building the JSDK so I'm guessing it's being built on quite a few different os platforms with different memory sizes
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 09 Nov 2018 18:14:59 GMT):<br/>
BTW just be sure you don't grab temporary workaround to stop forking.  Given the build works then I'm _slightly_ doubtful_ it's the the Maven version.  *Irregardless that needs updating too.*

Questions on Fabric CA - I recall some discussions pre 1.0 where intermediary certs could be used for channel user authorizations and any user cert created from them would be authorized for the channel per the authorizations associated with the intermediary cert. Is this the case? If so, does this extend to any Roles and Attributes associated with the intermediary cert, or constrain the certs generated from the intermediary cert?

@tijohnson @rameshthoomu  I was able to reproduce the Java build with forking issue on a Ubuntu machine.  I updated to the latest maven  3.6.0  and it continued to fail. 
I also got the memory increased (16G) with still the same failing results.  I also upgraded to the latest plugin version still failed.   Finally I download and used the latest Oracle jdk and that worked. 
I read where this was a bug in open-jdk  so I'm pretty sure that the root of this. 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:27:42 GMT):<br/>
I think the first step is to see how we can get an older verison of the open jdk installed that does not experience this problem.  Not sure off the bat how to do that.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:53:19 GMT):<br/>
@tijohnson  Please don't stop getting Maven upgraded even though I'm fairly certain it's not going to fix this issue.
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 18:01:49 GMT):<br/>
In complete agreement, I will work toward a process that can deployed. Duplicating this problem on Ubuntu is a GR8 idea
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 18:02:55 GMT):<br/>
I was able to try a back level open jdk   and it seems to work 
```
322  apt-get --purge remove openjdk-8-jdk-headless openjdk-8-jre-headless
  
  
  325  apt-get install openjdk-8-jre-headless=8u77-b03-3ubuntu3

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 15:44:58 GMT):<br/>
@bretharrison @rickr How have proto updates been handled in the past? First it is merged to fabric, temporarily breaks the SDKs, and then the SDKs have to quickly sync the protos? Is there anything that can be done to improve it beyond quick coordination?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 15:53:23 GMT):<br/>
No we have a copy of the protos.  It's a manual sync.  The proto's need to be kept backward compatible. Given that there should be no breakage.  
</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 15:56:13 GMT):<br/>
Adding new protos is not supposed to break the SDK's, what is broken ?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 15:57:57 GMT):<br/>
Ah right, I was thinking of a scenario in past dev where we all agreed to change a contract. for normal additions there should be no breakage

@tijohnson  I don't think you can run any sudo needed commands .. I doubt that privilege would or should be given.  If it really was that _simple_ the issue would now be closed. I gave you those commandsto help you know this appeared to fix the issue for me locally and what JDK version worked.   I suspect you need to run those commands or something similar and then create a VM image of that which would get reused. 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 16:12:52 GMT):<br/>
If we are going to do that, maybe we should just add maven 3.5 to the base image also 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 16:14:41 GMT):<br/>
I thought that was the plan.  Why would we want that overhead on each build. 
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 16:19:25 GMT):<br/>
Updating the base is cumbersome and we don't want to do it until we are sure we have all the correct pieces and the changes are compatible with all the build that use it

@rickr @rameshthoomu Which images need maven 3.5 ? I know 'snd-ubuntu1604-x86_64-4c-16g'. Is that only one or do we need it in

<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 16:58:48 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt  @rameshthoomu  for the `make dist-all` problem that was causing build failures for days, a fix for https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-12907 was submitted and this Bug closed yesterday. Is this required to pass to trigger the "downstream jobs" for fabric-test daily jobs?  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-daily-results-master-x86_64/test_results_analyzer/ shows that the fabric-test daily jobs did run, except for the behave tests that have NO results for the past 5 days. I am trying to find a bug for the "no results" for the behave tests.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 17:01:38 GMT):<br/>
was that 12907 blocking the daily behave tests (which use x86)? that one is a windows problem, so I don't see why, so maybe we can tweak the job.
Also I am confused why the other daily tests ran ok, but not the behave tests. can you explain why?

<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 14:51:42 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart 

Can we add a new job-status field for Bugs in JIRA with tags like `first-time` , `failed-twice` , `Intermittent` , `Consistent` ,  if this is helpful. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:48:56 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt I recommend to use 'labels'.  we already have a label `flake` that we use for flakey test failures.  i would certainly recommend using `first-time`, `intermittent`, and `consistent` in addition to the `flake` label.
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:52:05 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart 
thank you , I will use the `flake` label for the test fails appropriately.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:54:45 GMT):<br/>
go ahead and use `first-time`, `intermittent`, and `consistent` as well. if it doesn't let you use those labels let me know, i may have to create them in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:55:41 GMT):<br/>

yesterday night
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:29:21 GMT):<br/>
check the job.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:29:24 GMT):<br/>
hmmmm
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:29:25 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:29:58 GMT):<br/>
what @latitiah and I saw earlier (hence the Slack ping last night) was that the image tagged latest wasn't actually the latest one
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:30:17 GMT):<br/>
I'll check
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:31:01 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:34:11 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu one more thing
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:35:31 GMT):<br/>
@latitiah also needs the $GIT_COMMIT in the names of the artifacts. my understanding is that the can use it to check and ENSURE that the artifacts are indeed the latest

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:36:25 GMT):<br/>
sure will check
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:36:32 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking that the change we just made: https://github.com/hyperledger/ci-management/blob/d6a0717af8de91385a20847b8464a17d52a5f68d/jjb/fabric/fabric-macros.yaml#L665
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:36:42 GMT):<br/>
we should modify this to say:
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:37:05 GMT):<br/>
`-Dversion=$binary.$PROJECT_VERSION-$COMMIT-SNAPSHOT`
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:37:37 GMT):<br/>
this way each artifact will have the $COMMIT in the name too.
</p>

@rameshthoomu :point_up_tone2: 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:38:58 GMT):<br/>
I've got a patch set ready for that, if you find that this should be done.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:44:04 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark sure.. Before I merge this patch, please also write a script to pull the latest binaries with the above approach
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:52:12 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:52:21 GMT):<br/>
this is where the binaries are, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:53:05 GMT):<br/>
Ok shall we push this discussion to #ci-pipeline 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 19:53:16 GMT):<br/>
no prob.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:13:46 GMT):<br/>
Looks like we may broken PKCS#11 differently
```
./scripts/config_softhsm2.sh
Update SOFTHSM2_CONF via export SOFTHSM2_CONF=/Users/sykesm/lib/softhsm/softhsm2.conf
CKR_SLOT_ID_INVALID: Slot 0 does not exist.
make: *** [softhsm2_initialization] Error 1
```
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:13:50 GMT):<br/>
it's like cat and mouse
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:15:07 GMT):<br/>
That was local. In CI (not my CR) we get a different behavior:

putting a configuration file in *my home directory* is not okay with me.

```
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:19:46 GMT):<br/>
this is like a previous project I was on where we were told to run our tests as root since that's how CI was run; it's the wrong model. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:20:41 GMT):<br/>
the above CR parent commit is not on this fix.. this needs to be rebased
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:20:58 GMT):<br/>
yes - there are two separate issues
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:21:21 GMT):<br/>
the first is that my local dev environment is once again broken. This happens at least twice on ever release.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:21:59 GMT):<br/>
the second is that contributors (who don't know what's going on) get CI failures because we've changed the CI to run off of things that are not in the tree. This leaves a terrible taste in their mouths.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:22:40 GMT):<br/>
AFAICT, the CR that was merged is making a mess of things
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:23:22 GMT):<br/>
we have not changed the CI, fabric make file has been changed. We still run the `make unit-test`
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:23:44 GMT):<br/>
@harsha posted this in other channel
harsha 2:10 PM
@kostas here's the flow :-
1) After cherry-pick, issue `./scripts/config_softhsm2.sh`
2) Update `SOFTHSM2_CONF` via `export =$HOME/lib/softhsm/softhsm2.conf`
3) trigger `make unit-test` , this should hopefully work now.

</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:23:46 GMT):<br/>
then why does anyone need to rebase? something changed outside the tree
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:23:59 GMT):<br/>
let's step back
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:25:11 GMT):<br/>
Let's look at the change first.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:25:31 GMT):<br/>
1. Is is appropriate in anyone's mind for a build system to put artifacts outside of the build tree>?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:27:02 GMT):<br/>
I agree on that.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:27:25 GMT):<br/>
let's pull @harsha into this.. 
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:37:08 GMT):<br/>
I would like to create the CR to revert that change. This is for these reasons:
1. the build process should never modify items outside of the build tree
2. pkcs11 configuration is an aspect of how the build system is setup
3. creating the softhsm token may be inappropriate if the current environment has already configured PKCS11_LIB, PKCS11_PIN, and PKCS11_LABEL as required by the tests
4. this change conflicts with the pending documentation update that describes how to install and configure softhsm to use during development
</p>

Developers are forced to install softhsm2-util post removal of `testenv` target from Makefile, where following things happened.
1) softhsm2-util token creation was done as a root user that leverages default `directories.tokendir` definition from `/etc/softhsm/softhsm2.conf` . As listed here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.3/images/testenv/install-softhsm2.sh#L24 
2) Post removal of target testenv, every developer had to install softhsm which was no where found to be documented. Despite installation of softhsm, as non-root one still will be writing to `directories.tokendir` i.e `/var/lib/softhsm/token` on which no non-root user have access permission. 
3) Despite initializing PKCS11_LIB, PKCS11_PIN, and PKCS11_LABEL inside environment, I still see we run into this issue 
```Could not get Slot List [pkcs11: 0x190: CKR_CRYPTOKI_NOT_INITIALIZED]]FAIL	github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp/pkcs11	0.008s```

@latitiah I don't see where that particular image is published as amd64-latest in the nightly job....
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 15:24:03 GMT):<br/>

Yes, I was not able to pull this image from my local system now. I see that peer:amd64-1.3.1 is available, let me check the scripts
</p>

In the `12HrTest.py` file in the weekly directory, I cant see the script that is pulling the `1.3.0-stable` If that is replaced to `1.3.1-stable` this should work.

@rickr @rameshthoomu We have merged RELENG-1541 Install Maven 3.5
Maven 3.5.4 is now available in the following builds:  fabric-sdk-java-merge-x86_64 & fabric-sdk-java-verify-x86_64
If you want it available on some other builds I would be willing to lend a hand
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 12 Dec 2018 14:20:57 GMT):<br/>
thx @tijohnson    @rameshthoomu  is the JSDK built for any other fabric tests?  I really think they should all be made consistent. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 12 Dec 2018 14:32:32 GMT):<br/>

@sambhavdutt but this is not the one I was familiar with. Where is the gulp test log?

Hi experts. I find that previously CI will have node8 built, node6 built environment and corresponding tests, but now seems look only one. So how compability test is implemented for different node version now?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 02:34:34 GMT):<br/>

@dave.enyeart I will check

<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 21:36:54 GMT):<br/>
I can see that a variable `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` for thirdparty images is not fetching the complete value, but the script looks fine, 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/ab46e3548c46acf1c541eca71914c20bbe212f6a/Jenkinsfile#L14

the value should be `amd64-0.4.14` but it is just getting till `amd64-` 
there have been no changes in the script from last successful build, I'll confirm if this is because of infrastructure

@rameshthoomu It looks like it is dead so I would not invest CI resources on it at this point.  @odowdaibm @andrew-coleman What is the strategic direction for REST SDK on top of Node.js SDK?  Fundamentally, it seems a little odd to me to have a synchronous REST API on top of an async node API.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=t4i3w5EMoJT2Bpmaz) @dave.enyeart By the way here, we could always await for those async node API and reponse back. Not a problem, but I have a feeling from community that most application will provide their own REST service along with application access control, making REST sdk inactive and only provide a reference.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=t4i3w5EMoJT2Bpmaz) @dave.enyeart By the way here, we could always await for those async node API and reponse back. Not a problem, but I have a feeling from community that most application will provide their own REST service along with application access control. We only see it as a reference mostly

<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 10:53:04 GMT):<br/>
Is  job builder out of service now? I find after reply with `reverify`, the CI is `aborted`

@rameshthoomu @jtclark Just wondering if the Documentation broken link analyzer is turned on and now running against all Documentation builds? We had a few broken links over the holiday, but I did not see any notifications of this.
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 13:27:49 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko I'll have to check
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 13:45:26 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko in the current configuration of the fabric-docs-build job, I don't see where the linkchecker is enabled
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 15:04:15 GMT):<br/>
@vijay.bP could you please help above question..

@rickr need your thoughts on this https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABJ-397
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 17:51:24 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @jtclark @vijay.bP Are we ready to enable to the documentation link checker now then? Or are there still some kinks to be worked out?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 17:53:19 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark said there are two patches out for review couple of weeks back..
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 17:53:22 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark Can you give update on this ^^
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 17:53:40 GMT):<br/>
He is trying to skip the false link check failures.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 17:55:01 GMT):<br/>
I don;t see any open patchsets on fabric but I see one here https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27511/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 17:55:28 GMT):<br/>
Jason, Could you please test above patch set in sandbox and make sure there are no failures on the docs builds..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 17:55:44 GMT):<br/>
please re-run this job multiple times in sandbox and let me know the update.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 17:55:50 GMT):<br/>
will merge it later today
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 18:49:16 GMT):<br/>
@vijay.bP, @vijay.bP, @vijay.bP Yes, we can re-enable it. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 18:49:16 GMT):<br/>
@vijay.bP, @vijay.bP, @vijay.bP Yes, we can enable it.

</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 18:50:02 GMT):<br/>
I will push it out to the sandbox once more just to make sure things are configured properly, and then we can merge the changes that enable link checking

there are several broken links associated with the 1.4.0 tag.... @pandrejko are these the broken links you noticed in the documentation?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 20:58:26 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu any idea why readthedocs is not getting published?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 20:58:37 GMT):<br/>
for example I merged a doc change: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28436/
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 20:59:53 GMT):<br/>
but a RTD build is not getting triggered for the change: https://readthedocs.org/projects/hyperledger-fabric/builds/
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 21:00:22 GMT):<br/>
last RTD build was more than a week ago
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 21:00:33 GMT):<br/>
I just triggered one manually for 'latest'
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 21:00:44 GMT):<br/>
you can see the same issue for release-1.4

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 21:33:15 GMT):<br/>
@vijay.bP could you please point me the bug which you have created for fabric-chaincode-node failures
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 21:34:31 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark I opened jira https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13474 for the broken links. Could you look at #4 on the list in there. I think it is a false positive. We will address the others.

@rameshthoomu @sambhavdutt please take a look at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28472/. Latitia created fabric-test release-1.4 branch and this is the patchset to get it all working. Sambhav, make sure your jenkins 1.4 daily/verify/merge jobs will work with the Makefile and pull scripts in her CR for the 1.4 branch.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 20:48:34 GMT):<br/>
@scottz CI change for release-1.4 branch https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28380/5/jjb/fabric-test/fabric-test-daily-job.yaml

wait
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 15:14:20 GMT):<br/>
also, pls add `docker tag $NEXUS_URL/$ORG_NAME-$IMAGES:${IMAGE_TAG} $ORG_NAME-$IMAGES:${VERSION}` line after this https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/scripts/Jenkins_Scripts/CI_Script.sh#L144 and https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/scripts/Jenkins_Scripts/CI_Script.sh#L156

yes.. could you pls add that as well
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 15:33:22 GMT):<br/>
need baseos as well!
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 15:38:00 GMT):<br/>
:( we are not publishing baseos from nightly jobs to nexus.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 15:38:06 GMT):<br/>
let us do that now.. 
</p>

i see baseos-0.4.14 is on the system from the logs
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 15:39:09 GMT):<br/>
has it got the wrong version number from somewhere?

<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 15:39:45 GMT):<br/>
or is there a new baseos:2.0.0 image just not being published?
</p>

baseos is now part of fabric like other images (peer. etc..)..

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 18:01:46 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 21:15:15 GMT):<br/>

unfortunately no, but we are working to to get the container logs, we can't ssh into a ongoing build system for s390x, and the build data is purged after every run
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 10:03:13 GMT):<br/>
ah okay
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 10:03:17 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 14:56:02 GMT):<br/>
@sstone1 could you please increase the buildtimeout to 50mins here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.x#L5
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 14:58:10 GMT):<br/>
should that be in Jenkinsfile.x or Jenkinsfile.z ?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 14:58:32 GMT):<br/>
Change in both files..

@rameshthoomu We are having issues pulling patches: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-chaincode-evm-verify-x86_64/8/console. Is this related to https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28373/

Hi Swetha.. Seems there is an issue with this patch https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28596/ - I triggered build in sandbox and I see below commits. Observed this https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28597/ related change to this patch is missing from the log.

The second patch you linked depends on the first.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 22:21:00 GMT):<br/>
I don't see any issue with the CI change.. it's working for other patchsets submitted to evm.. 
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 22:21:24 GMT):<br/>
We will try investigating more and let you know what we find
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 22:22:09 GMT):<br/>
yes. all 4 patchsets are linked each other.. but the 2nd patchset is missing from the first patchset build log
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 22:22:49 GMT):<br/>
Okay I think maybe some temporary git issue. All 4 patches are now able to get the patchset

hi, is it ok to store in fabric/unit-test some test artifacts?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 17:16:00 GMT):<br/>
specifically, I'm looking for a place to move some of the "examples" which really are not quite examples but test artifacts into a different, more meaningfully called, directory

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 17:16:39 GMT):<br/>
I just don't know whether I should simple create a new directory such as test-artifacts or if unit-test is good for that
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 17:17:32 GMT):<br/>
I'm specifically referring to what's today under examples/chaincode and examples/plugins
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 17:18:33 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 18:27:07 GMT):<br/>
please don't put anything under unit-test; IMO, most of what's under examples should be killed with fire or moved to where they are used. 
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 18:27:34 GMT):<br/>
unit-test should also be removed; we don't use the compose file any longer and the script can be relocated to scripts
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 18:27:44 GMT):<br/>
the miscellaneous references can then be updated
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 18:57:57 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks for the input
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 18:58:33 GMT):<br/>
if something is used in a single place it's easy enough to put it there but for instance we have chaincode/go/example02 used about everywhere
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 18:58:47 GMT):<br/>
so, some central place is needed
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 18:59:48 GMT):<br/>
if anyone needs convincing, just run: git grep examples/chaincode/go/example0 :-)

I don't see a problem with putting common chaincode artifacts in /test-artifacts directory, at least as a means to remove /examples until some larger test refactor occurs

@lehors  I don't see a problem with putting common chaincode artifacts in /test-artifacts directory, at least as a means to remove /examples until some larger test refactor occurs. See an issue @sykesm ?
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 19:51:32 GMT):<br/>
@lehors @dave.enyeart  Instead of moving the fixtures, let's do the right thing. Here are the references to example02 in current master:
```
$ ag -l 'go/example02'
core/chaincode/exectransaction_test.go
core/chaincode/platforms/golang/platform_test.go
core/common/ccprovider/ccinfocache_test.go
core/scc/lscc/lscc_test.go
core/handlers/validation/builtin/v12/validation_logic_test.go
core/handlers/validation/builtin/v13/validation_logic_test.go

examples/chaincode/go/example02/cmd/main.go
examples/chaincode/go/example05/chaincode_test.go
examples/chaincode/go/example04/chaincode_test.go
```

I only see a few buckets.

1. The peer chaincode command tests
2. Documentation. (Which, IMO, should not be referencing these artifacts as they're not really user consumable and they don't show any best practices.)
3. The core/chaincode tests.
4. The ccprovider tests
5. Lifecycle tests

this can't be pulled from the docker-compose.yaml in the sdkintegration as the nodeenv image is not available on dockerhub yet, just on Nexus. If ok, I can get the nodeenv image from nexus, and tag it so it doesn't have to pull again during the test

<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 20:54:30 GMT):<br/>
@lehors the right thing is to
1. delete the stuff that's not actively referenced in code
2. remove doc references
3. evalute the tests and see what they're doing; My guess is that the vast majority are simply looking for assets that will compile - not run. That means we can have a 10 loc chaincode impl that lives with the test that needs the code.
4. Where we need actual running chaincode, consider if we can reference the integration/chaincode artifacts in the interim and open issues to remove that dependency

</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Sun, 20 Jan 2019 19:24:09 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart Just give `VerifyBuild` Please refer this doc https://ci-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/fabric_ci_process.html
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sun, 20 Jan 2019 19:25:24 GMT):<br/>
Ramesh has mentioned to me before that either `VerifyBuild` or `Run VerifyBuild` works.  But that's besides the point... the main problem is that when I uploaded patch 2 CI did not get triggered automatically.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 20 Jan 2019 19:28:35 GMT):<br/>

I have been advised to update all the plugins at the same time. One of the Pipeline plugins 'Pipeline: Supporting APIs' gave this warning:
_Warning: the new version of this plugin claims to use a different settings format than the installed version. Jobs using this plugin may need to be reconfigured, and/or you may not be able to cleanly revert to the prior version without manually restoring old settings. Consult the plugin release notes for details._
The other Pipeline Plugins had no warnings. Let me know if anyone is concerned about the warnings on the Pipeline Plugin.
This  change is being tracked here: https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/browse/RELENG-1701

@rameshthoomu I've +1ed the java update now.  Note that +2 privilege is not working today. I've emailed helpdesk about it.  We'll want to rebase https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27953/ and ensure it passes CI now.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 15:06:48 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 15:37:10 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu +2 privilege is back. It was already up to date. I've done +2 and `reverify`

Hi I have a question about [fabric-test-daily-behave](https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/search/?q=behave). Some of them seem to have been failed since about a month before. Currently I'm trying to setup testing environment for my custom fabric-peer image, which is based on fabric v1.4.0, to run behave test locally. How can I create a testing environment which complete to run these behave tests without error. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 14:19:14 GMT):<br/>
@nekia please post the same in #fabric-quality channel
</p>

Thanks @rameshthoomu . OK, I got it.

<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 15:53:39 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu my z builds seem to be failing with random errors: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-s390x/720/consoleFull
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 15:53:50 GMT):<br/>
various network errors - ECONNRESET, stream removed, etc
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 15:53:55 GMT):<br/>
is the z build machine healthy?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 15:58:18 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt Could you please check.. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-s390x/720/artifact/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/orderer.log
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 15:59:04 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu yes, I'll check on this
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 16:14:38 GMT):<br/>
I see that the three builds triggered for this patchset have one common fail, the orderer container is not available/down during the tests
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 16:18:30 GMT):<br/>
Could you please check why the orderer is not available.. Also, is it possible to print docker ps after docker-ready gulp task.. 
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 16:20:45 GMT):<br/>
yes, these 3 builds were triggered on the same z machine which is good, so this may nt be the problem with the z machines
</p>

try to add `docker ps -a` here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/build/tasks/test.js#L113
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 16:22:14 GMT):<br/>
I mean after that line and see which containers are up and running.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 16:22:39 GMT):<br/>
Also, do you know why the container logs are not showing up in buildArtifacts?

@rameshthoomu @sambhavdutt thanks for looking - turns out there's expired certs in the SDK tests, we're looking at fixing - no idea why it hit Z and not X yesterday, but is hitting both Z and X this morning.

@rameshthoomu when I set GO_TAGS env variable and build peer image I see go install -tags "" is empty 
</p>
<p><strong>firas.qutishat</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 20:49:36 GMT):<br/>
I think the reason is not passing GO_TAGS is an arg to peer image

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=27dELqok8E5RLpLRZ) @firas.qutishat I don't see GO_TAGS is passing as env to peer image.. 
</p>
<p><strong>firas.qutishat</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 20:53:18 GMT):<br/>
I think it's needed to pass
</p>
<p><strong>firas.qutishat</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 20:53:59 GMT):<br/>
if you export GO_TAGS="pkcs11" and then make peer-docker
</p>
<p><strong>firas.qutishat</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 20:55:13 GMT):<br/>
you will see that building peer image is ignore the GO_TAGS
</p>
<p><strong>firas.qutishat</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 20:55:25 GMT):<br/>
because it's not passed 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 20:56:03 GMT):<br/>
ok will check in sometime
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 21:00:33 GMT):<br/>

@sambhavdutt I see e2e master build is failing since 6 days.. Do you have bug for this? I don't see one in https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?filter=12705
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 03 Mar 2019 23:56:30 GMT):<br/>
Could you please follow up on the bug if you have one otherwise please create one with highest priority and post it in #fabric-maintainers channel.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 03 Mar 2019 23:56:45 GMT):<br/>
Seems channel join is not working and failing consistently.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:38 GMT):<br/>
Also, If the builds are failing consistently, please bump the priority of the issue to highest and reach out to the person or post in channels for their attention.. I see fabric-sdk-node release-1.4 and master builds are failing while joining the channel.. 
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:16:31 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu 

Yes, there is a bug open for this , the jobs are failing in sdk-node tests,

Hi, fabric-chaincode-node is currently failing on Jenkins with the error Failed to pull hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:2.0.0 when attempting to instantiate smart contracts in our tests. Any ideas on how we can rectify this?
</p>

@awjh 
Let me check if I can find a resolution for this

</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 14:53:51 GMT):<br/>
this should fix the problem in the verify jobs while instntiating the chaincode

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 14:57:12 GMT):<br/>
Why the build is not started?

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 14:58:42 GMT):<br/>
never mind.. it started now
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 14:59:01 GMT):<br/>
yes, it just started now
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 15:04:14 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt Could you please check with @bretharrison on FABN-1165.. He said this was fixed in master but I still see the issue in daily jobs which was triggered on the fix commit..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 15:04:41 GMT):<br/>
FYI https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABN-1165 is in Closed status now..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 15:08:16 GMT):<br/>
Also, do you have the same bug for release-1.4?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 15:09:22 GMT):<br/>
FABN-1165 was for both master and release-1.4
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 15:09:22 GMT):<br/>
yes, FABN-1165 was for both master and release-1.4
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 15:32:43 GMT):<br/>
btw due to the changes that happened recently with the configtxgen tool - the basic-network that the chaincode-node relies on - can't work.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 15:34:04 GMT):<br/>
we might need the change to be pushed in along with @awjh  change that will fix this
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 15:43:23 GMT):<br/>
I am ok with that.. as this is a simple change.. 
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 15:52:35 GMT):<br/>
Can confirm that the fix once added to my code moves me past that error
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 15:58:36 GMT):<br/>
@sambhavdutt could you please abandon your patch

Hi - is it possible to confirm who has +2 rights on the `fabric-samples` repo... looking at gerrit itself I can't find any way to confirm this... 
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 11:53:28 GMT):<br/>
For example Jim Zhang is on that list as a retired maintainer; he's still listed in the maintainers.md of the fabric-chaicode-node - but I can't determine if he still has gerrit +2 rights.,
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 14:20:25 GMT):<br/>
I think all fabric maintainers has +2 rights on fabric-samples

@bretharrison any update on this issue..  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABN-1165 It seems e2e sdk node tests are failing since 12 days.... As we have disabled e2e jobs from verify jobs we are not seeing any impact on the builds but I could see merge and daily jobs are failing consistently..

@rameshthoomu  there has been a recent update to the node-sdk tests to generate the required test certificates prior to running the tests (we were broken last week due to expiring certificates) and it is now part of the build process ... looks like you need to run `gulp install-and-generate-certs` or `gulp install-and-generate-certs-s390` for linux/zLinux respectively
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 12:11:04 GMT):<br/>
Ok if possible could you pls add this in gulp test target. So that I can just run this target
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 13:43:06 GMT):<br/>
Ignore my above comment.. I was actually using `run-tape-e2e` target to run the sdk-node tests on fabric-ca changes.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 13:43:57 GMT):<br/>
I just added `gulp install-and-generate-certs run-tape-e2e` to my test in sandbox.. If this works, I will add this target in the gulp file

@rameshthoomu @sambhavdutt We have a Fabric Bugs and Tech Debt dashboard that we have been using more recently: https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=11706.  It includes widgets for bugs and jiras with 'flakes' label. We can add some more widgets to bring attention to the CI list. I think it would make sense to base new widgets off of labels. But first, let's agree on the labels to use. I still don't think we have an agreed upon consistent way to label CI bugs, so people don't know which ones are the true CI blockers.  If it is labeled as 'ci_failures' but not labeled as 'flakes' does that mean it is a true CI blocker?  Perhaps we need a new label like 'ci_blokcer'. Some jiras use label 'flakes', some use description text "Consistent:No", some use "Intermittent:Yes".  Let's get some consistency here... please propose the crisp list of labels you would like to use, as well as their definition.  We can then create widgets based on the labels and have common understandings. Finally, for the most important items that are still not getting attention, feel free to bring up on fabric-maintainers.  Once we have the widgets in place we could post the widget link to fabric-maintainers as often as needed to get attention to this.

`ci_blocker` would be a good label, as `ci_failure` is assigned to all failing CI jobs, whether it is a blocker or not. Like the 'first-time` can we have labels for `consistent` and `intermittent` too, as long as it doesn't pool up the list of labels,  sometimes we use more than two labels which would be the only concern

@rameshthoomu @sambhavdutt @vijay.bP @sykesm How about we withdraw use of the current general ci_failure label and use one of these four mutually exclusive labels (with corresponding dashboard widgets for each):
ci-blocker - true blocker that impacts all CRs for a project and must be addressed to get CI working again
ci-failure - consistent failure but not blocking (what is an example?)
ci-flake - rename existing 'flakes' to indicate intermittent failure
ci-first-failure - label to use the first time an issue is seen, should be converted to one of the three above once there is more data is available

yes, the above labels would be good, 
*ci-failure* the daily cron tests , for e.g. fabric-test jobs fail in some of the tests but they wouldn't be a blocker to fabric or CI jobs, 
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 13 Mar 2019 20:44:44 GMT):<br/>
we were using ci_failure label to identify all bugs found and created as a result of running CI automation jobs, to show the usefulness of the automation. Some of these bugs were for different types of work to be done by different teams (LF infrastructure, upgrading tool versions or scripts in jenkins jobs, bugs for fabric developers, or bugs for fabric-test scripts or tools). It seems to me that could still be useful, but I guess it would be ok if we replace the use of ci_faillure by instead using one of the 4 mentioned. That will have an impact the filters in place already, and as you say any new tables and filters, but that is manageable, and I agree it could be more helpful to use more specific labels so we could filter results into different tables on the dashboard (and different teams could focus on different tables).

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Mar 2019 21:43:58 GMT):<br/>
fabric-chaincode-evm-jobs.yaml - is just to create a pipeline job with the default configuration.. You hardly modify this file.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Mar 2019 21:44:22 GMT):<br/>
You want to re-trigger the job or the test?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Mar 2019 21:45:15 GMT):<br/>
if you want to re-trigger the job manually above are the comment phrases.. if it is automatic.. I have no idea how to do that..

also, we are working on updating this documentation with the recent changes.. Most of the projects are moved to pipeline.. So, some project content might be outdated but will update this doc as soon as possible..

@rameshthoomu this is a node 10 / node 8 mismatch - we need @mastersingh24's CR https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/29982/ to be merged to resolve the problem

regarding the e2e node we need to update the gulp tests  there are patches merged for this in  master and release-1.4, I need to check on the earlier branches/versions
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 13:47:25 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu the CR is failing on s390x as grpc won't compile on Alpine 3.9 (amd64 has precompiled binaries, so doesn't hit the problem). @mastersingh24 is putting in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/30084/ which should solve the CI problems.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 14:24:59 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=ZACkPGh7xdfyC4Dt6) @sambhavdutt ok.. Did you update these new gulp targets in the e2e job?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 14:28:14 GMT):<br/>
yes, the CR is updated for 1.4 and master, I'll just need a confirmation from sdk-node team if we should run the previous tests for branches other than 
master and 1.4

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 17:08:34 GMT):<br/>
May be because it was rebased immediately after patch1 upload...
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 17:11:19 GMT):<br/>
yes, the rebase after the patch was uploaded, the jobs wouldn't trigger after the rebase. I just triggered them now
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 17:13:42 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @sambhavdutt .  Also I've noticed that on project `fabric` it takes on average 3 minutes for the first job to trigger.  While on other projects it is immediate. Any idea why?

</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 17:21:57 GMT):<br/>
I'd say the wait is because fabric just triggers on the x nodes. The jobs in z nodes trigger immediately as these are configured already unlike the x nodes that have to clean up and install the pre-req's using packer before the build starts. It's the same case with the fabric-test jobs that trigger just on the x nodes

I released and tagged fabric-baseimage 0.4.15 this morning.  I see https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/fabric-baseimage/tags/ but not third party images in dockerhub such as https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/fabric-couchdb/tags/ . Any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 19:23:15 GMT):<br/>
I see the latest thirdparty images were not built in this release job(0.4.15), we'll have to get the `make dependent-images` work to publish `0.4.15` thirdparty images to dockerhub and nexus, I'll ask ramesh to retrigger this

@sambhavdutt  @C0rWin  @BrettLogan @sykesm I've converted `flakes` label in Jira to `ci-flake`. Please update your saved filters accordingly.

also converted `ci_failure` to `ci-failure`
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 11:16:32 GMT):<br/>
Going forward, please pick ONE of these labels for CI issues:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 11:16:37 GMT):<br/>
ci-blocker* - true blocker that impacts all CRs for a project and must be addressed to get CI working again
*ci-failure* - consistent failure but not blocking (what is an example?)
*ci-flake* - rename existing 'flakes' to indicate intermittent failure
*ci-first-failure* - label to use the first time an issue is seen, should be closed or converted to one of the three above once more data is available
</p>

@dave.enyeart 
sure, I'll use these labels for issues. I was able to use the ci-blocker that you enabled, now that all 4 are available, I will use these on the new bugs and replace the labels on existing open bugs.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 11:25:24 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 14:02:03 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu we could probably remove in favor of pull_build_artifacts.sh... what do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 14:03:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes. We push this file to bin directory after run make dist-all or make dist (not sure).. I think the intention is to download the bin tar file and pull the images using that script..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 14:04:27 GMT):<br/>
I think most of the people are using bootstrap script now a days.. Not sure who is using this script..

Hello, I have a request for multiple Node.js version testing with fabric-sdk-node

</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 21:25:08 GMT):<br/>
@bretharrison 

I just saw the Jira description, do you want to run the gulp `run-end-to-end` on Node 8 first, update to node 10, run this again. The tests in this sequence will be required for `release-1.4` and `master` branches, not for any other branches. Please correct me if I'm wrong
</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 21:25:59 GMT):<br/>

@aso The images are built with latest fabric, ca commit and published to Nexus every day around 8 PM EST. The `fabric-samples` pulls these images, in this case for 2.0.0, in the BYFN, EYFN tests, so any commits after 8 PM will be published the next day

`docker pull nexus3.hyperledger.org:10001/hyperledger/fabric-nodeenv:amd64-2.0.0-stable`

can pull the nodeenv image from Nexus, the latest one published today and can be tagged

@bretharrison @nkl199 I see fabric-sdk-node builds are aborting after 40 mins build timeout.. Could you please check why the builds are taking more time.. and if you would like to increase the build time out.. please change here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.x#L5 same as in z..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 25 Mar 2019 01:03:31 GMT):<br/>
if builds are taking more time, better to run them in parallel approach. Can we do that .. It seems integration tests are taking 80% of the build time..

What if we also checked an environment variable that would override the release and thirdparty settings of the package.json ? The script that calls the 'gulp test' would have to  'export `FABRIC_SDK_RELEASE=latest` and `FABRIC_SDK_THIRDPARTY=latest`

@rameshthoomu I'll be happy to investigate tomorrow.  FWIW CI has been very flaky for me ever since the earlier disruption to Gerrit.  I don't know of anything that's been merged on the peer side in the release-1.4 branch that could have this sort of effect, but will be happy to help you investigate.

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:57:43 GMT):<br/>
@tijohnson I would like to talk to you regarding this issue.. Though this is not a new issue but this kind of latency issues are failing many builds.. The severity of the problem is very High.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:58:05 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible to involve infra support team to debug this issue.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:58:24 GMT):<br/>
This is likely the root cause of many of the flakes in Fabric CI we have seen lately
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:58:45 GMT):<br/>
yes... and this is a long pending issue from LF.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:59:52 GMT):<br/>
@tijohnson, I think I have forwarded the tests we ran on LF infra nodes and found couple of issue with IO... 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:00:37 GMT):<br/>
May be its; worth taking a deep look at these issues with Infra team... 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:01:11 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu For those of us new to this issue... could you summarize what information has already been collected and sent to infrastructure team? Is it written down anywhere?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:01:47 GMT):<br/>
yes.. Allen bailey ran these tests on LF infra nodes almost an year ago.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:01:56 GMT):<br/>
Will forward that email.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:06:02 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart @tijohnson I have forward the email.. Sub: disk performance on x86 machines
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:21:43 GMT):<br/>
ok, Allen's tests were on IO throughput over a year ago and I don't think anybody is actively investigating that.  The problems are not just limited to throughput, at times the IO completely locks up for almost 10 seconds at a time for even the most trivial IO operations.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:21:44 GMT):<br/>
Discussed with @rameshthoomu and he will open a help desk ticket as well as a Jira infrastructure (IN) issue so that we can track the various IO issues we see.

<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:09:28 GMT):<br/>
@all I have worked on many build systems and a common policy is to minimize dependency on intranet and eliminate dependency on internet
There were a bunch of reasons for doing this, and build reliability has always been a primary one
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:16:41 GMT):<br/>
@tijohnson not sure if we can do these things now, when we build we will need to access a lot of places.
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:28:40 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I understand that, but with increased 'points of failure' the builds are going less robust 
a 'wget' that works 99.9 % seems pretty good until you start doing it 1000 times a day in builds
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:30:56 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I understand. I am not seeing a lot of choices though.

</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:32:47 GMT):<br/>
typically the thing you wget from is a very local server cache, and then you retry a couple times before failing. 
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:33:17 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if we have a local-to-the ci docker registry, and docker doesn't retry, it just, poof, fail.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:44:15 GMT):<br/>
@tijohnson The most critical issue recently is the IO issues, not the network issues.  I've updated IN-59 with some more context.  
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:45:42 GMT):<br/>
We are asking Linux Foundation to urgently investigate IO in the CI infrastructure
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:46:02 GMT):<br/>
This is causing CI failures across projects impacting large numbers of developers

Sure; ginkgo doesn't care. The network creates everything in temporary directories so point TMPDIR to a tmpfs and it will use that.

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 17:20:21 GMT):<br/>
I have found it useful for doing pre-release testing, and I expect others would find it useful (if it were documented). Most people have no idea how to pull pre-release images and binaries. @sykesm if we don't keep this specific script... what would you recommend to people that want to pull down pre-release images and binaries?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 17:21:13 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 19:08:57 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda 
this is good for the sdk-go jobs to pickup the version from `ci.properties` file, before that we need to update it in Jenkins , the current available version is 1.11.5
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 19:10:27 GMT):<br/>

We want to understand why this is necessary? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/30448/8/Jenkinsfile@114 Are we not running in containers? Does lack of cleanup affect other runs? Also can we get a link to the ci scripts that will handle the cache of third party images? Thanks!

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 01:03:43 GMT):<br/>
@swetha these lines execute after the build is complete https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/30448/8/Jenkinsfile@114.. Just for clenaup all the containers after the build is done.. 

See this script https://github.com/hyperledger/ci-management/blob/master/packer/provision/docker.sh#L122 for some reason, cleanup script is deleting cached images.. That's the reason, evm build is taking few more mins.. 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 18:44:51 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Added a comment there as follows: Agreed we should rename baseos in master before the final v2.0 release.  In the shorter term we will simply not tag images from master as 'latest' in dockerhub, so as to not impact v1.4.x users.  For example the 2.0.0-alpha images will only be tagged as 2.0.0-alpha.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 20:06:52 GMT):<br/>

@rameshthoomu looking at the changes in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/30448/ makes me very concerned for the setup of CI as a whole.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 20:28:37 GMT):<br/>
I think we were under the impression that our builds were isolated inside container or something.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 20:29:11 GMT):<br/>
It doesn't make sense to me to have each build ensure it's cleaning up the environment. That should be something automatic.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 20:32:14 GMT):<br/>
the hardcoding of specifically available go versions is also seems strange. the ones in there are 4 point releases behind. 
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 22:57:51 GMT):<br/>
If I were to remove this part:
```
      // Delete containers
      fabBuildLibrary.deleteContainers()
      // Delete unused docker images
      fabBuildLibrary.deleteUnusedImages()
```
what would happen? build machines fill up? How is that any individual projects responsibility?  
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 00:00:01 GMT):<br/>
In regards to the same patch that @MHBauer is talking about above, I am also curious about this piece:
```
      // Don't fail the build if there is no log file
      archiveArtifacts allowEmptyArchive: true, artifacts: '**/*.log'
```
What is the default behavior?
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 00:06:15 GMT):<br/>
I was confused by the comment above
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 13:47:23 GMT):<br/>
@MHBauer We use x86_64 vexx build nodes pre-loaded with a packer image not the containers. Once the Jenkins build get triggered, Jenkins identifies a build node (say vm). These nodes get purged after the build is done. One build = one vm
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 13:51:56 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=QpdcuarxftoBH6itH) @MHBauer We can update Jenkins file to get latest version from fabric Makefile.. something like this 
`GO_VER=$(curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric/master/ci.properties && cat ci.properties | grep "GO_VER" | cut -d "=" -f2)`
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 13:54:56 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=ijZMy24uZTyuhaopM) @MHBauer Nothing will happen.. as we purge the vm after the build is done (it deletes all the build artifacts).. We usually use these lines between test to test.. but as this is in post build action.. we don't need these steps..

@rickr 
Can you point me to the test that skipped

@rickr  thank you 
I see that the unit-tests started but failed as the timeout exceeded and this test failed in `TestParallelSend` , we can retrigger the individual test in this case
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 12:41:54 GMT):<br/>
I think I did do the re run.  I was just more curious about the _skipped_ 
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:17:30 GMT):<br/>
@rickr 
the skipping of the build happens in 2 cases,

1. When we submit an update to CR and push it to Gerrit, the tests will start again and the current build if still running is aboted/skipped

2. When we try to retrigger/rerun with the job/build with comment phrase, before the job/build is completed, this would abort/skip the running job and trigger it from beginning

Chaincode shim releases:  For Node.js there is a master branch - snapshot published per build. For Java chaincode there is only something published on alpha/beta/ga releases.  

Wanted to float the idea of doing something more regularly for Java as well.  Not every build - but something more regular, every couple of weeks maybe?  

Any thoughts from a CI perspective?

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:11:12 GMT):<br/>
@MHBauer here is the change we discussed. I added a message if the VerifyBuild step fails as to what the reverify command is: `Code checks failed, reply with VerifyBuild to run code checks again`. Adding an initial post-back message isn't possible without some additional refactoring. The regular expression for triggering builds via reply would pick those initial messages up as triggers if we included any of the other commands. I also elected not to dig into that too much, as the other steps have their actual messages posted in the Gerrit CR when the other tests are triggered. After VerifyBuild passes, Jenkins posts `Succeeded, Run IntegrationTest, Run UnitTest` to the Gerrit CR which triggers the other tests. So you can refer to that for the command. We can work on refactoring the regexes and messages Jenkins posts so we can provide an initial message at some point in the future

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 17:38:31 GMT):<br/>
@tommyjay We never officially used Moby. I actually did the work to implement Moby throughout Fabric but we ultimately decided to punt on it and abandon the transition. Moby wasn't nearly as mature as the current library we use. The amount of workaround that was required to perform the simple functionality that was innate to our current library just wasn't worth the headache. Until such a time as Moby catches up, or, there is a breaking change in the client we use vs. what we need Docker to do, we decided to stick with the current client

@rickr The error is coming from the CR you pushed, it doesn't relate to the verify build.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 18:27:44 GMT):<br/>
what leads you to that ?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 18:28:18 GMT):<br/>
The code is the same for 1.4 and 2.0 that's being built .. the error message points to a corrupt file
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 18:28:39 GMT):<br/>
2.0 seems to build 
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 18:36:33 GMT):<br/>
May be a flake, please retrigger again.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 19:10:57 GMT):<br/>
I have been https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/31386/ 
But they're not kicking off or they're not showing up in the gerrit UI.  Another flake?
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 19:37:42 GMT):<br/>
@rickr I triggered them up, but saw the same issue with compilation error.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 19:38:33 GMT):<br/>
yes - corrupted file.  The error is now slightly different.  Seems to be unreliable :( 
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 19:39:40 GMT):<br/>
I'm opening a JIRA for this issue now.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 21:35:20 GMT):<br/>
It fails with different messages making it seem that file is somehow bad. Up above it was BigDecimal.class  on another run below  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.class 
Has to be environmental -- blame it on global warming?

@tijohnson  Are we starting with a *fresh* vm with just prereqs each time are they being just reused.  Like for 1.4 having fabric docke images already present and for java the maven cash still present?   I don't know if there is a later 1.8 java but see if updating that may help?
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:19:36 GMT):<br/>
Each build is a fresh VM  that is part of our speed problems... it takes a couple of mins to before the actual can start
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:21:18 GMT):<br/>
I see in your scripts where they sometimes assume that cruft could be left over from previous build
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:27:29 GMT):<br/>
So the vm is created from a `template` then started (from turned off) and then the build starts?
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:28:27 GMT):<br/>
yup
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:28:27 GMT):<br/>
@rickr yup
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:29:43 GMT):<br/>
some minor stuff happens after boot but before build (like create 'jenkins' user account and install ssh keys
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:31:07 GMT):<br/>
has with in that last week any changes happened to that template ?
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:34:34 GMT):<br/>
We moved to a new image on May 10 (added GO 1.12.5)
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:36:17 GMT):<br/>
@rickr wait... What is the build you are seeing this problem in? How about a link to the log
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:37:34 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/31386/
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:39:16 GMT):<br/>
I was told a JIRA was opened on it... doesn't that fall in your lap? :)
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:43:02 GMT):<br/>
By the way another issue if you look at that link is I tried a `reverify-1.4` that should have kicked off a new 1.4 build.  Which it either does and does not show up in gerrit or never did actually kick in!
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:44:26 GMT):<br/>
The fabric-sdk-java build are 'special' they required python 3.6 which is in a new image (not same as it used by other builds
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:44:33 GMT):<br/>
@rickr 
I am working on that comment trigger for the verify jobs, as of now it is `reverify`
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:45:31 GMT):<br/>
so can't retrigger just a 1.4 build?
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:46:26 GMT):<br/>
after my CR is merged, you can trigger the master job with `reverify-x` and 1.4 with `reverify-1.4` respectively
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:46:37 GMT):<br/>
not now
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:47:00 GMT):<br/>
can I get a `justworkdamit`
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:47:30 GMT):<br/>
I can realate
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:55:11 GMT):<br/>
'comment triggers' are a real problem, they are broken ... primarily a resource issue
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:56:14 GMT):<br/>
and the really shouldn't be even necessary :wink: 
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:56:32 GMT):<br/>
yea right...
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:58:31 GMT):<br/>
I am running fabric-sdk-java-master-verify-x86_64 on sandbox... plus sent a 'retry' to the review
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:58:39 GMT):<br/>
well I got to break away ..
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:58:50 GMT):<br/>
it trigger the build, but it failed
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:58:54 GMT):<br/>
what
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 00:59:03 GMT):<br/>
I do to (my dinner time)
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 01:00:27 GMT):<br/>
what's odd is it seems to fail almost always on the 1.4 build and master works.   But that difference is Fabric not the SDK.   On both those builds its the JSDK 2.0 (master) that's being built
</p>

<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 15:05:18 GMT):<br/>
Was something changed?   We can't do 2 days of reverify to get it passing.
</p>
<p><strong>sambhavdutt</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 15:09:03 GMT):<br/>
there were no changes made in the code to fix this error, just the comments were added, Tim is looking into the nodes, if there needs to be some cleanup done, if some clutter was left behind in the nodes, that might be the answer
</p>

@rickr I was looking into this this morning and I am having problems understanding what it is you expect me to do
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:45:07 GMT):<br/>
Fix the issue with the environment doing the builds producing unreliable result,  would be a good start  
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:47:36 GMT):<br/>
This only seems to be happening in that environment.  No one else is reporting it.  Takes 5 build attempts to not see a corrupted file message that's a prereq that needs to be there. 
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:56:35 GMT):<br/>
What is it that your build needs in the environment that we need to provide?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:57:29 GMT):<br/>
The Java JDK 
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:57:42 GMT):<br/>
this is stupid to be talking about this in chat, we need to meet 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:58:09 GMT):<br/>
why does this not work ?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:58:25 GMT):<br/>
What have you tried ... please list 
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:58:53 GMT):<br/>
I do not really have anything to do with the Java SDK, I click a button in Jenkins and it installs it
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:59:27 GMT):<br/>
I can select different versions but that is about it
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:03:38 GMT):<br/>
So have you looked into if it's the latest version? 
Have tried googling for that error to see if anyone else has seen It ?
Have you updated template for the latest Ubuntu fixes? 
Have looked at all at the pattern of what vms are failing and once are passing?
  If you retrigger on that successufl vm is it always successful? and the vms that don't always fail 
Is there a ways to change out those vms ? 
Have you tried upping memory ?  
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:12:26 GMT):<br/>

You seem to want to just though this problem over the wall, we need to work together to work toward a solution
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 20:48:40 GMT):<br/>
I've recommending some things you could have already been looking at. That's throwing over that wall?

Let's start with, it isn't a Fabric or Fabric Java SD issue, it's a Maven and Open Java JDK issue. The problem originates in Fabric code, but the failure is in the Maven compilation of core JDK libraries imported by our SDK. Maven compilation errors due to corrupt zip files aren't uncommon on systems that aren't running well. And history tells us, our nodes are over utilized. Running tests in our current CI takes 5x as long as running on commodity hardware (proven by benchmarks I've run as recently as today). I can force replicate this problem in an IBM Data center where I overutilize the machine, with Jenkins installed and limit bandwidth on the network connection. We need to figure out why our vexx nodes are so slow, despite having 4 times more resources than comparable machines that compile with no problems. Tim, let's talk about this on Tuesday, I'd like to discuss our current cloud infrastructure and see if we can't get answers from whoever we need to identify why our CI nodes are so incridbly so. I have a few questions I'd like help getting answered. Rick, I know it sucks, but we have to keep doing the reverify until we can figure out why the slave nodes are so overutilized. I'd like to do some real benchmarking activity next week on network and CPU

Hello guys, does anyone know why nexus repository publishes only fabric-ca-client but not fabric-ca-server binary? E.g. from here: https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric-ca/hyperledger-fabric-ca/darwin-amd64-1.4.1/

@maniankara 
`fabric-ca-client` is published on official release dates to Nexus, because they expect people to use the `fabric-ca` image that is published in releases, not just the `fabric-ca-server` binary

The comment triggers have been updated for fabric-merge jobs

`remerge` will trigger both merge jobs as usual,
`remerge-x` will just trigger the unit-test job
`remerge-e2e` will just trigger the fabric-end-2-end job

@BrettLogan (your comment from May 17) this is exactly the kind of stuff we should be have covered in the meeting today
By the way the pathway off of VEX requires projects move to a image created with a new process (common-packer)
as of today ci-management & fabric-sdk-java are the only two projects using an image generated by common-packer

Hello, I have a question.
I noticed when I read the document on CI Process of fabric-samples (`docs/fabric-samples-ci.md`).
The document says the CI job sends build failure email notifications to the submitter on every merge failure.
But it seems that the job does not send an e-mail to the submitter as far as I see recent failure logs
(log message: An attempt to send an e-mail to empty list of recipients, ignored).
Does it match the specification and/or expectation ?
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 01:21:26 GMT):<br/>
@tatsu-sato I saw the console for last three build failure's, it's sending the mails inconsistent and not respective to the CR owner, thanks for the info, i will check and make correction on this.

Hi, I have a question about Hyperledger Jobbuilder runtime environment. In merge job, I have 500 error when executing curl. The exact same task is working fine on **verify** job now. Is there any difference between these 2 runtime environments? In this task, I download Hyperledger Fabric binaries of a specific version for our e2e test.

@nekia It's not the curl command that is failing, the job downloads and pipes the script into bash. It is actually failing on this command `/bin/bash -c 'if [[ -z $(which configtxgen) ]]; then echo "### Need to install tools ###"; exit -1; fi'`
</p>

Drafts have been removed as of 2.15 unfortunately. It has been totally replaced by the WIP system. If you push a WIP and don't want others to see it, you can use the UI to mark the WIP private now.

Hi, just looking at the fabric Java projects and wondering which maven repositories snapshots should be getting published to. There seem to be some in https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots/ and some in https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/ (It would be nice to have source jars for all the projects as well)

Hey there, I’m having an issue with verify builds on fabric-sdk-go using the s390x machine. The x86_64 works fine and I’ve issued reverify but the problem is that jenkins isn’t able to remove child images from the very beginning. I think it's caching these images.

My change request has nothing to do with docker: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-go-verify-s390x/216/console

I just pushed a dummy change and it failed for the same reason:
- jenkins s390x build: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-go-verify-s390x/217/console
- gerrit code: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric-sdk-go/+/31813

I think there might be an issue with the `removeUnwantedImages` function in the configs: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-go-verify-s390x/configure

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 21:01:07 GMT):<br/>
@tommyjay I manually deleted all these images from the s390x build node and restarted the build. For now no issue. Could you please create JIRA ticket, will ask some one to look into this.

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:04:08 GMT):<br/>
That is an unfortunate flake, you can replicate it on your local machine if you call `make docker` from the fabric repo (or any repo that builds docker images) and cancel the build at the exact moment the docker build process is moving form one step to the next, this is probably why we very, very rarely see this issue. We can theoretically extend `include-raw-fabric-clean-environment.sh` to  catch that error to deal with this problem, we would then have to individually capture the dangling images and individually remove them. But this could get cyclical as dangling images may depend on each other, and guaranteeing we delete all of them could possibly put us in an infinite loop if we don't properly identify every dangling image. The root cause was probably another build being aborted in the middle of its docker build process, which can happen, if you update a CR, the previous build is aborted. 
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 15:59:17 GMT):<br/>
@tommyjay The child images has been deleted from the 390x node which is always picking up on the build, so we can get clear info when it tries to run on different minion.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 22:29:16 GMT):<br/>
@MHBauer b/c the votes happened on an old patch
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 22:29:34 GMT):<br/>
a new patch came in while builds were in progress, so the votes don't carry forward
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 22:30:30 GMT):<br/>
I added a reverify comment, which should kick it off again

@mbwhite So, you are looking for the verify and merge jobs for Z platform on 2.0 and 1.4 branch, and from the merge job do we need to publish javaenv image.

I’d like to get my team (programming model squad in Hursley) access to publish JARs under the group id `org.hyperleder.fabric` but don't have write permission to https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/hyperledger/fabric/. Currently there are separate groupids. This is published when the merge builds run for Java SDK, Java Gateway and Java Shim. Can anyone help me out please?

@heatherp Let me check on the nexus for the path where the gateway-java jars are publishing, and we don't have writing privileges for nexus LF do,  I am assigning the FGJ-30 to me.
</p>
<p><strong>heatherp</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 14:14:54 GMT):<br/>

@heatherp The group id for fabric-gateway-java is https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-gateway-java/blob/44d0ebd143dbbbbf0b949902c6986f4756ab3c59/pom.xml#L8 and the jar's are publishing to right path https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/hyperledger/fabric-gateway-java/ the above link you provided is for fabric not gateway-java.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 15:07:23 GMT):<br/>
Hi Vijay - the point is that we don't think that the groupid for either the gateway or contract java is correct... 
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 15:07:55 GMT):<br/>
i.e. we'd like to have a group id of `org.hyperledger.fabric` and assets within that for gateway, protos, java-shim etc...
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 15:08:22 GMT):<br/>
we don't think that today we're able to publish those as we can't write the `org.hyperledger.fabric` directory
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 15:19:11 GMT):<br/>
@mbwhite I think that's not possible while downloading the artifacts jenkins use the metadata.xml file for the directory, which should be independent for the projects fabric, gateway-java, cc-java.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 15:21:47 GMT):<br/>
so it's not possible to share the same groupid across all the artifacts?
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 15:22:31 GMT):<br/>
NO, matt.
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 15:23:10 GMT):<br/>
ok.. not sure I follow why though..
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 15:24:12 GMT):<br/>

@andrew-coleman @bestbeforetoday Could you please look into this JIRA item https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABJ-462 causing consistent failure on java-sdk tests on fabric-merge-end-2-end builds.
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 18:10:15 GMT):<br/>
@mbwhite Please review and merge this CR https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/fabric-chaincode-java/+/32582/
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 08:51:56 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart Thanks for the heads-up on the change that caused the breakage
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 08:52:40 GMT):<br/>
Is there a mechanism for people to communicate to me when they are going to make changes that will break the SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 08:52:58 GMT):<br/>
Ideally before the breaking change is made! :)

FAB-16149 was merged into master and seems to have exposed failures. 
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:05:07 GMT):<br/>
@sykesm me again, thanks for taking a look. any idea how it got past CI before merge?
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 14:38:02 GMT):<br/>
The details are in the revert. When you added parallel processing for endorsers, you made the order of the responses non-deterministic. That impacted assumptions in the test. Depending on timing, it would work or fail.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 14:39:43 GMT):<br/>
I'm changing the test to provide consistent responses and I need to chat with @wlahti when he's back from vacation about the intent and behavior of the test.
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 14:42:16 GMT):<br/>
makes sense - i couldn't reproduce it when running all the tests, only when running the test using the command you provided
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 14:43:14 GMT):<br/>
i didn't understand the test either - it looks like the CLI code will never attempt to order transactions with a 500 status, even if they have valid endorsements
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 10:41:20 GMT):<br/>
Hi, is this the right place to request that zLinux builds be removed from fabric-chaincode-node? I assume it wouldn't be a good idea to just remove the Jenkinsfile.z file from the repo? Thanks. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-16196

<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 15:53:37 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 You would have run the job on a docker image (hyp-x-docker). What repo/job(s) are you referring to ?
The steps to make this change depends on whether the job is a pipeline or  freestyle job
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 15:53:57 GMT):<br/>
fabric
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 15:54:45 GMT):<br/>
I was hoping you would not ask for that one...
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 15:55:02 GMT):<br/>
I know  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 15:55:52 GMT):<br/>
Those jobs are mostly (all pipeline) jobs, which means the cloud image to use is specified in the Jenkinsfile 
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 15:56:18 GMT):<br/>
when it is set is Jenkinsfile it applies to ALL fabric jobs
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 15:56:30 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 15:58:19 GMT):<br/>
you could have your own version of Jenkinsfile to develop/verify but you can't push that until rest of fabric is ready for new image
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 16:01:01 GMT):<br/>
I suspect most jenkins jobs will be OK  unchanged on docker image, but I expect to have a few issues
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 16:01:50 GMT):<br/>
some of our jobs launch containers
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 16:02:23 GMT):<br/>
I assume the hyp-x-docker jobs use containers as the workers ... so that won't work
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 16:03:34 GMT):<br/>
it is same as hyp-x image, the big difference is the image a created using Ansible rather than a shell script
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 16:04:04 GMT):<br/>
ok .. ok ... so worker is still a VM with Docker daemon?
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 16:04:49 GMT):<br/>
I have already ported fabrci-sdk-go & fabric-sdk-java & fabric-chaincode-java
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 16:05:42 GMT):<br/>
yes works same as old image
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 16:06:26 GMT):<br/>
most of my work has been because MVN is not longing installed in the image, some jobs expect it to be there

the image is named 'docker' because it support docker, if you don't need docker you don't want to use it. I also have a hyp-x-builder image that does not contain docker

</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 14:22:36 GMT):<br/>
We can specify a different config file: 'Jenkinsfile-docker' for some jobs you would have to maintain two identical versions (except the node entry) of this file for awhile
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 14:28:05 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 You can pick which jobs I do first, so you can move forward with moving to GO 1.12.7 on those jobs
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 18:42:18 GMT):<br/>
@tijohnson can explain what actions are necessary to bump the go version in the fabric builds now? You've performed some actions that mean our existing processes and knowledge no longer apply yet we still have the requirement to build with the new version of go.

@sykes The new version of GO 1.12.7 is available in the hyp-x-docker image. For freestyle builds this setting is job specific, but for pipeline jobs the entire project needs to be moved at once.

</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:20:16 GMT):<br/>
Any pipeline jobs based on the fabric repo use the image specified in the Jenkinsfile in fabric repo, I betting that effects about 100 jobs....

</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:21:37 GMT):<br/>
we could make that change and if 10 jobs break we fix them, if 90 jobs break we back out the change
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:21:46 GMT):<br/>
I thought that fabric was freestyle - most of the ancillary stuff is pipeline but not core fabric. (that's my understanding..)
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:22:05 GMT):<br/>
there is no Jenkinsfile in fabric

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:23:24 GMT):<br/>
What is different about the x-docker image and the one we use now in how Go is managed within the image? Are the x-docker images assuming we use the Go Plugin?
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:24:16 GMT):<br/>
The docker image installs 1.12.7 the hyp-x (baseline) only installs 1.12.5
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:28:20 GMT):<br/>
what might help me is for me to prioritize the jobs/projects that I am porting to docker image and then get some help testing the merge/release jobs that would be affected by the change
</p>
<p><strong>tijohnson</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 21:36:55 GMT):<br/>
more accurately the docker image installs 1.12.5 & 1.12.7

Does anyone know how to get more information out of a failing build? I can't figure out why https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric-chaincode-java/+/32607 is failing. The method it seems to be complaining about exists and although the related files were changed recently, other builds are working, e.g https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric-chaincode-java/+/32798 even though they weren't changed in the failing build. Any suggestions appreciated as I'm very confused at the moment.

Thanks @BrettLogan, that's definitely useful. I've not ever managed to get the integration tests to run on my machine for some reason- I'll see if setting up a Linux VM helps but if you know of any gotchas, that would be great. Would you be able to zip up the logs from your local build and send them over later if I don't get anywhere? Thanks again

Hmmm, that all exists in the CR _but_ this looks suspicious https://github.com/jt-nti/fabric-chaincode-java/blob/master/fabric-chaincode-docker/Dockerfile#L57
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 12:46:49 GMT):<br/>
Do I need a new chaincode release with the updated protos in, _then_ update and release the Dockerfile, _then_ get this CR in?!
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 12:53:28 GMT):<br/>
1.4 protos already exists in Nexus, wouldn't you expect this to at least be on those at this point?
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 13:04:10 GMT):<br/>
Hmmm, I think the required protobuf change is in the 1.4.3 release so could use that, but the mismatching versions seem troubling.
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 13:04:46 GMT):<br/>
Yea, so your workflow seems correct. Update protos, dockerfile, then your CR
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 13:07:46 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately the Dockerfile seems to have the same outdated files in on the 1.4 branch, and the same CR there built ok on that, so I'm not convinced this is definitely the cuase https://github.com/jt-nti/fabric-chaincode-java/blob/release-1.4/fabric-chaincode-docker/Dockerfile#L50
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 13:08:27 GMT):<br/>
Is there anything else that might be causing it, or is it worth trying an updated Dockerfile?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 13:09:17 GMT):<br/>
I just tried building everything myself, that didn't fix the issue

</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 13:41:14 GMT):<br/>
Ahhhh, I think it might be the SDK missing the proto updates! `testCompile 'org.hyperledger.fabric-sdk-java:fabric-sdk-java:1.4.1'`
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 13:43:18 GMT):<br/>
Maybe not- that's the same in 1.4 chaincode as well
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 13:48:00 GMT):<br/>
...but the tests are different in 1.4 so maybe... 
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 14:09:39 GMT):<br/>
Woot, it built! Thanks for putting up with the ramblings- that was driving me slightly crazy! Just need to fix the test now...

</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 14:55:57 GMT):<br/>
Bother. Changing the sdk version didn't fix the build even though it worked on my VM. Setting up a fresh VM to see if the first run on a clean system behaves differently :shrug:

Hi, I've had a go at updating the script which publishes javadoc for fabric-chaincode-java https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/ci-management/+/32946 I'm not sure how I can check it really works since I don't have access to the repo it publishes to but could someone have an early look to see if there are any glaring errors please? It would be great to get it properly reviewed and merged sometime next week when the matching changes are ready in other repos (if it works, it'll break some links at the moment :)

@bestbeforetoday @andrew-coleman Please look into this bug https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABJ-469 it's a blocker on fabric-merge builds.
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 19:33:02 GMT):<br/>
FYI: Fabric Unit Tests are broken for a couple hours. We migrated to a new cloud image today built using a new process to support newer versions of Golang. There was a minor bug in it, that wasnt caught in our sandbox CI system. We are building the new image now and will have the change in within the next couple hours 
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 16 Aug 2019 12:56:08 GMT):<br/>

We are going to do a quick restart of Jenkins to address issues in Pipeline jobs, jobs will continue to queue and start automatically after the jenkins restart
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 22:53:35 GMT):<br/>
Jenkins is restarted. Jobs that have some downstream dependency on the AnsiColor wrapper, whether through your own jenkinsfile, or via the LFIT Global Macros will fail until we can address an issue in the plugin. We are working to resolve this
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 00:23:01 GMT):<br/>
We've disabled the AnsiColor wrapper in the Global Macros, which almost all pipelines depend on. I'll reach out to projects affected by this in the morning. If there are projects that want to address it before then, I've published several changes for our projects, you can merge them as you see fit https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/q/owner:brett.t.logan%2540ibm.com

Does that explain why fabric-chaincode-java builds are failing? (I've seen a selection of different failures, including test failures, timeouts and what look like network issues, so I'm not sure.)
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:36:32 GMT):<br/>
@jtonline Unfortunately no, this only affects projects that have a Jenkinsfile in the root of them (are pipeline-based, not freestyle). However we have noted the issues related to time and network(jars from Maven cetnral not being able to be downloaded). This is just fodder for the fact that the new CI system can't come soon enough
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:50:13 GMT):<br/>

@rjones Ill submit patchsets tomorrow to fix these when i get back to Raleigh. A couple if these repos we just put off doing it since they hadnt been touched in months. Our hope was we would fix the ANSI wrapper, but something is broken in core jenkins, so we removed the plugin since the only way to fix this is to do a full backup, reinstallation and restoration of jenkins.

Ry, I disabled the global Ansi wrapper in the CI-management repo. Tim merged that change just now, so Ansi-Color is no more for now. I reverified all of your changes so we could rule out Ansi issues and actual flakes. I also commented on 2 of your changes with patchsets you need to rebase on as Blockchain Explorer and Fab-Lib-Go had Ansi-Color enabled in the repo-level Jenkinsfiles so you can pick up the new Jenkinsfiles where I disabled those wrappers.

Here's some high level thoughts on the CI and SCM transition...
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 15:43:40 GMT):<br/>
Steps per project (start with fabric-ca to discover any issues)
1. pre-merge verify jobs on Azure (using github mirror at first)
2. gerrit to github transition (change github to read/write, turn on PR process)
3. have jenkins do post-merge jobs against github (temporarily)
Can still do releases from jenkins at this point
4. Use gitlab (or Azure) for post-merge jobs
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 15:44:11 GMT):<br/>
@BrettLogan please keep me honest, does that accurately reflect what we discussed?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 15:50:14 GMT):<br/>
Correct. The above is the plan I'm working to put together. I am working on a public backlog in Jira to support this. The thought process to only putting verify jobs on AZP or Gitalab for now, is that it will allow us to get our repos on GitHub, which is a major milestone and quicker than if we needed to rebuild all of our post merge jobs which have more complex requirements.
</p>

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 15:52:09 GMT):<br/>
Leaving post merge jobs also allows to migrate repos before 2.0 release, otherwise we would be holding off for 2 months in an effort to not threaten the 2.0 release process
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 16:18:39 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking very low traffic stuff here, like the homebrew-fabric repo for instance: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/admin/repos/q/filter:fab AMCL hasn't had a code merge in a year, test-resources since 2017
</p>

fabric-docs
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 07 Sep 2019 16:20:59 GMT):<br/>
The obvious question: why am I bringing this up in a CI/CD channel? Because I want to test to process of breaking the mirror, marking the repos read-only in Gerrit, and making sure nothing Bad Happens.

Hey Ry, I took a look at these repos last night, I agree, let me just run it by maintainers tomorrow morning to be sure they are okay with it and we can work through it this week. We want to migrate Fabric-CA asap, so going through these repos to define any issues will be great

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Sun, 08 Sep 2019 19:27:25 GMT):<br/>
I didn't realize most of these repos even existed. After moving them to Git, I'd like to inventory them and figure out what we are doing with them and deprecate where need be. Homebrew hasn't been update for the 1.4 stream, milagro crypto (which is what AMCL is a "clone" of) doesn't even have a public repo anymore for us to pull updates from, fabric docs never ended up serving the purpose it was intended to (though Joe and the WG may want to revisit it)

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 08 Sep 2019 20:34:22 GMT):<br/>
if you cruise through Gerrit, there are a few more questionable repos. I'd be fine if they ended up tombstoned, archived, and forgotten

<p><strong>caod</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 17:10:17 GMT):<br/>
the desire is moreso in the case when there are no conflicts, Gerrit handles it fairly well with the existing rebase button on CRs
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 17:10:46 GMT):<br/>
the way to do it in GitHub is, TBH, allow only rebase merges.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 17:10:52 GMT):<br/>
well, final merge gets you a rebase button, but I've had bad rebases in the past, so I would never fully trust anything automated.

@dsessions what's the motivation for go 1.13 on fabric 1.4?
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:09:51 GMT):<br/>
I think we need to bump to 1.12 in 1.4 and 1.13 in master, fwiw.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:10:48 GMT):<br/>
We have an extensive kubernetes deployment, which includes doing the install and instantiate / upgrade on a fabric-tools based image
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:11:25 GMT):<br/>
In a nut shell . . we have the team using fabric-sdk-go and using 1.13 . . with full mod support, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:11:51 GMT):<br/>
but to do anything with the chaincode, we have to re-set our environments 
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:12:02 GMT):<br/>
it's a lot of context switching and variables from our perspective
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:12:12 GMT):<br/>
right - but we don't support modules in fabric. And for chaincode, builds occur in ccenv, not at the tools.

<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:14:05 GMT):<br/>
In master, we have very basic support for packaging and building chaincode modules. That is not part of 1.4

<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:14:18 GMT):<br/>
gotcha

<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:14:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:14:31 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately its a flake of the CI system and gerrit. If you push two changes quickly back-to-back Jenkins doesnt handle it well

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:15:06 GMT):<br/>
YTwo of the core reasons (there are really many) we decided to migrate from Jenkins to AZP are the ability to manage our own dependencies, and the sheer number of flakes we saw related to unstable Jenkins slave infrastructure at our cloud provider. Its obvious how the second one is impacted by the migration, moving to AZP moves us onto a world-class cloud provider where they dynamically manage infrastructure for us. The first issue, around dependencies is what accelerated the timeline for us. Today in Jenkins, we bake all of our system dependencies directly into our VM images. Meaning if we want to upgrade to Go 1.13, we first have to generate a new OpenStack Image with 1.13 in it. Unfortunately, the process we've used for years to build the images was recently

It doesn't sound like submitting a ticket / patch to increment the go version in master at this point is going to be fruitful anyways if there isn't a CI image that can build it
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 15:48:49 GMT):<br/>
master will probably be updated to 1.13 as soon as we move off jenkins provided everything works in GOPATH mode.
release-1.4 is a little different. We don't want to shake the tree too much there. My concern with 1.11 is that it's not going to get fixes so moving to 1.12 is likely.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 16:34:47 GMT):<br/>
makes sense

I can kick off builds again now but they are failing with timeouts as submitting transactions is taking longer than 3 minutes when running in Jenkins. Running locally (twice to be sure) the whole suite passes. Is Jenkins unusually slow today?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 16:55:13 GMT):<br/>
It's been a recurring problem for a few weeks now
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 19:01:15 GMT):<br/>
It would be cool if you could try module based chaincode against master using the new fabric-chaincode-go repo/module.
</p>

@vijay.bP  At 09:08:20 timestamp in the fabric release-1.4 merge job this morning triggered by the updating of base image version, https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-merge-end-2-end-x86_64/6509/consoleFull , errors occur with instantiation of java cc. Bharadwaj is having trouble himself running tests in 1.4 today with our samplecc (go). Is anyone else seeing or hearing of other problems elsewhere, having to do with the baseimage version and/or java cc ? 
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 20:23:24 GMT):<br/>
Retriggered the fabric merge builds again on baseimage update CR, lets check the failure again.
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 20:39:49 GMT):<br/>
We did just upgrade the baseimage
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 20:39:59 GMT):<br/>
Move to a new version of debian
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 20:41:00 GMT):<br/>
I have to look at what you are doing, there are issues with CA and the new baseimage
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 20:42:19 GMT):<br/>
However, looks like its not related to that issue. SDK node is experiencing the same issue
</p>
<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 20:45:30 GMT):<br/>
Cryptogen is running with Node OU enabled, which no longer populates admincerts directory.

However the orderer and peers without the latest capabilities enabled will not be identifying admins via Node OUs, they will still be identifying admins via admincerts directory. Without the directory populated. cause the error in multiple builds and it was fixed in the fabric-samples.

<p><strong>vijay.bP</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 14:23:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes it is, and there are CR's merged in chaincode-node project, this may cause the problem in chaincode install in multiple places like fail byfn(javascript chaincode) in fabric and chaincodes testing in fabric-test projects.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 14:26:52 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu  yes that would explain why our tests are failing that use chaincode written in the nodejs language. @vijay.bP  Did you open a bug yet for these failures? If you see that the error is the same in different jobs, you could create one bug with each job as a reference, rather than duplicate bugs. And ship it to the people who changed things yesterday in chaincode-node.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 14:31:22 GMT):<br/>
the error may not be a coding error but rather a problem with the images, per:  `No matching version found for fabric-contract-api@2.0.0-snapshot`

@BrettLogan  The crl_test.sh script in the fabric-test daily CTE job (fabric-ca tests) uses openssl. Did you say that is changed, or no longer available in fabric-ca?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 14:13:56 GMT):<br/>
Yea. The version of ssl changed. Though if all your doing is generating certs, your fine. If instead, you are calling openssl with --text flag to return the output to the cli, and then you are using that output, the format has changed. 
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 14:15:44 GMT):<br/>
Of course, also, if fabric-ca is a submodule, and you haven't upgraded to the latest commit, but are using the latest baseimage, the fabric-ca-setup script that is used to stand up CAs is broken because of the openssl change 
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 14:16:15 GMT):<br/>
The simple fix there is update to the latest commit in the submodule 
</p>

@scottz 
</p>

yes at least once we are parsing the text:   r="$(openssl crl -noout -text -in $CA_CFG_PATH/$ADMINUSER/msp/crls/crl.pem |
             awk '/Serial Number:/ {printf $NF" "}')"
and we do have fabric-ca submodule in fabric-test - but let me see if we are actually using it for these tests...
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 15:23:55 GMT):<br/>
@BrettLogan  I see on my laptop:  $ openssl version
OpenSSL 1.0.2s  28 May 2019
and the CI jobs seem to be using version OpenSSL 1.0.1t
When you say the version changed... where? changed to what?

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 13:19:57 GMT):<br/>
hi, you should get that approved via the `fabric-rfc` process I think
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 14:41:41 GMT):<br/>
It ended up being that maintainers don't have permission to issue comment triggers, trying to work through what the correct settings are for this. According to the doc everything seems to be right, but still doesn't seem to pickup comment triggers from people who aren't admins.

Hi, what is the process for getting azure pipelines turned on for github.com/hyperledger/fabric-contract-api-go?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:03:58 GMT):<br/>
Do you have a pipeline written for it yet? @awjh 
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:04:32 GMT):<br/>
Yes it is in the .azure-pipelines folder
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:05:15 GMT):<br/>
I'll enable it when I get back from lunch
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:05:20 GMT):<br/>
you ask @BrettLogan to tell me to turn it on
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:06:11 GMT):<br/>
Lolol
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:07:07 GMT):<br/>
@awjh what is your GitHub ID
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:07:14 GMT):<br/>
awjh-ibm :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:08:43 GMT):<br/>
since you don't have a valid, public email in your GitHub profile, I can't invite you to azure 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:09:34 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 16:49:44 GMT):<br/>
@rjones any ideas why this woul dbe happening with Azure on a PR? It ran automatically. I did force push over a previous commit if that makes a difference?
</p>
<p><strong>awjh</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 16:50:44 GMT):<br/>
The repo is fabric-contract-api-go
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 16:57:39 GMT):<br/>
@awjh the issue is @BrettLogan renamed things and I need to make a change to match.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 16:58:57 GMT):<br/>
@awjh look now :)
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 16:59:43 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Ry, forgot to fix that part
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 17:00:56 GMT):<br/>
I don't think you could have.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 17:37:19 GMT):<br/>
@BrettLogan do you need anything from me to support the new YAMLs I saw merged?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 17:43:21 GMT):<br/>
Not yet, we are switching over on Friday
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 17:44:36 GMT):<br/>
right, I meant vault binding or anything like that
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 18:54:56 GMT):<br/>
Ah, no, only Fabric need the vault binding but it is set up already
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 18:55:18 GMT):<br/>
And we are running CI for Fabric in Azure alongside Jenkins to test it through Friday
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 18:55:23 GMT):<br/>
It's looking good
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 22:26:19 GMT):<br/>
@BrettLogan why did you rename all of the workflows? I'm OK with it, I just want to make sure I do the right thing in the future
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 22:37:40 GMT):<br/>
@rjones So depending on how you name the projects and pipelines, if you copy the urls from the Azure UI it generates an escape sequence for some of the characters, and then when you paste them in RockteChat, it interprets the tailing end of the escape sequence as one of its special sequences and converts it something like a square purple box

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 22:38:26 GMT):<br/>
So I've been trying to rename them to use `-` dashes instead of spaces and capital letter for each word as the special sequences dont ever include capital letters as ebst as I could tell
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 22:39:09 GMT):<br/>
And then the default name for the pipelines I've been renaming to the projects name to prevent the same thing occuring

Can someone help me understand why the azure check isn't being listed under the "Checks" tab for fabric-sdk-node (nor fabric-contract-api-go) PRs? e.g. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/pull/33/checks

Despite a build running against it
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:41:17 GMT):<br/>
hmmmm
</p>
<p><strong>heatherp</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:42:20 GMT):<br/>
maybe it doesn't matter? But it kinda makes it seem like all it cares about is the DCO
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:45:36 GMT):<br/>
There is no discernible reason I can see why it wouldn't be listed on the Checks page, let me research it a bit. The only post I've found about it doesn't apply to us
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:48:48 GMT):<br/>
why do you have two sets of identical branch protection rules?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:18:00 GMT):<br/>
Becuase we had to exclude gh-pages from the rule
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:18:00 GMT):<br/>
Because we had to exclude gh-pages branch from the rule

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:18:41 GMT):<br/>
Is there a way to regex the pattern
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:18:45 GMT):<br/>
ah. I wonder if branch protections support negations in regex?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:18:49 GMT):<br/>
I tried to find doc on it but couldn't
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:19:21 GMT):<br/>
I dunno. Make a repo in your personal account and create some branches and dork with it

@davidkhala that is correct, everything else had moved to Github and Azure Pipelines 
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 23:01:31 GMT):<br/>
We have merged the change to the make the `/ci-run` comment active. Maintainers and the Pull Request author can comment `/ci-run` to retrigger failed CI. Note: It does retrigger all of the jobs, maintainers, next week after the holiday, I will get instructions out on how to create Azure DevOps accounts so you can trigger individual jobs rather than all of them.

Hey guys, I'm making some changes to the way the node sdk runs tests, and back in Jenkins world, I was aware that on fabric merge builds, "gulp test" or something similar, was run after the node sdk was pulled down. I can't see any evidence of this or something similar being run in azure (i.e. https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/Fabric/_build/results?buildId=2969&view=results).

If I remove the "gulp test" command from the node sdk, will this impact fabric merge builds?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 14:39:39 GMT):<br/>
When we moved Fabric and Fabric-CA we stopped running BYFN and other SDK related suites on merge. Today we run their own Unit Tests only. So you are ok to make this change. @heatherp

</p>
<p><strong>heatherp</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 14:40:08 GMT):<br/>
awesome, thanks!

@BrettLogan did I break this yesterday? https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/commit/11b5a553c88192e649c2e2b1b8891fe649f3ae15
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:29:06 GMT):<br/>
It never worked. It finally worked today. They published NPM for the first time today
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:29:25 GMT):<br/>
So maybe you broke it, but we will never know lol
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:30:00 GMT):<br/>
oh OK, cool. I deleted the NPM and NPM_OTHER tokens and updated the service connections to use the new token yesterday
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:30:30 GMT):<br/>
Also, I'm starting to loathe NPM the website
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:31:35 GMT):<br/>
200% agreed, so unintuitive
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:32:14 GMT):<br/>
and wrong. I followed the examples for using the `npm` command line tools to manage the `hyperledger` org and the examples are wrong
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:33:22 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like Fabric a little bit
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:43:16 GMT):<br/>
What is the feeling of Fabric developers on the reliability and speed of AZP versus the previous implementation? It looks like the number of flakes is lower
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:49:52 GMT):<br/>
Neat: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solarlabru/fabric-chaincode-utils (MIT license, though)
</p>
<p><strong>heatherp</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 16:38:25 GMT):<br/>
Our biggest woes have been permissions/control based. But I find it much more reliable, easier to navigate build output. fabric-chaincode-go hasn't got any integration tests yet but a build takes just two minutes. I'm sure previously I would have waited two minutes for jenkins to wake up

@BrettLogan is this actually a nexus issue, or something else? https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/Fabric-SDK-Node/_build/results?buildId=3373&view=logs&j=12f1170f-54f2-53f3-20dd-22fc7dff55f9&t=bd05475d-acb5-5619-3ccb-c46842dbc997&l=210
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 21:05:44 GMT):<br/>
No, the Chaincode Java project is publishing with the wrong tag
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 21:06:24 GMT):<br/>
So the 2.0.0-stable image aged out finally and now the only thing that exists 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-stable. We opened a Jira today for them to remove "SNAPSHOT" from the tag
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 21:25:40 GMT):<br/>
ahh ok
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 21:26:05 GMT):<br/>

@rjones Please could you (or @BrettLogan) add the GitHub publishing credentials to the https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/Fabric-Gateway-Java pipeline so we can do doc publishing to the _hyperledger/fabric-gateway-java_ gh-pages site, similar to the other SDK and chaincode builds? So it’s just the *GITHUB-PAT* variable that’s needed (as it’s named in the fabric-sdk-node pipeline credentials)

@BrettLogan hi brett, i have a question about timestamp of CI logs. I'm investigating a [new flake](https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/0227bd2c-c4f6-478f-be00-ee519f115180/_apis/build/builds/4849/logs/65) and i wonder if the timestamp in logs actually reflects real time? they seem to be printed at the *time* (within 1 sec)? the flake is caused by an `Eventually` assertion timeout, which is 10seconds

Hi, how do I install a package (such as `couchdb`) during CI? Should I modify azure pipline configuration or something else? Thanks in advance!
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 19:33:01 GMT):<br/>
@dexhunter what do you mean, install a package, couchdb isn't a package, its a service. Can you explain what you are trying to do and I'll help you through it
</p>
<p><strong>dexhunter</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 03:19:25 GMT):<br/>
@BrettLogan Thanks. I want to store some values in the couchdb. I have been able to install couchdb by modifying `azure-pipleline.yml`
```
  - script: |
      apt update
      apt install snapd
      snap install couchdb
```
</p>
<p><strong>dexhunter</strong> (Tue, 24 Mar 2020 03:20:08 GMT):<br/>
But the port isn't open, any ideas on how to start the couchdb service? Thanks in advance
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 09:56:08 GMT):<br/>
Rather than installing CouchDB on the build machine, you might consider starting up a Docker container hosting CouchDB, and mapping the CouchDB port from the container to a port on the host machine so it is accessible locally to the build
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 13:22:13 GMT):<br/>
Yea, I pointed them to the service container doc, for anyone else who may be searching for this solution: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/service-containers?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#single-job
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 13:22:29 GMT):<br/>
```resources:
  containers:
  - container: couchdb
    image: couchdb
    ports:
    - 5984:5984

services:
  couchdb: couchdb```
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 13:22:47 GMT):<br/>
Much simpler than dealing with modifying the host
</p>

Hi. Not sure if this is the right group to ask.
I see that there are no baseos being produced for `s390x`? Last I see was `v0.4.18`
</p>
<p><strong>ahmedsajid</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 18:02:46 GMT):<br/>
Is that intentional? 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 19:08:38 GMT):<br/>
@ahmedsajid yes, s390x support was dropped a while ago
</p>
<p><strong>ahmedsajid</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 19:16:30 GMT):<br/>
any particular reason why ? :) @rjones ?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 19:49:29 GMT):<br/>
We moved from Jenkins to Azure Pipelines (which does not support s390x) and the chief consumer of it was IBM itself
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 19:49:53 GMT):<br/>
The pieces exist in fabric still, you can pull the code on Z and run `make docker` and build the images yourself
</p>
<p><strong>ahmedsajid</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 19:50:16 GMT):<br/>
makes sense. Thanks @BrettLogan 
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 19:50:25 GMT):<br/>
All of the Z and Power targets still exist, for the binaries as well

@BrettLogan I find the build problem is still there as https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/pull/257/checks?check_run_id=794357780
It seems chaincode install fails always with 
```
 'Error: chaincode install failed with status: 500 - failed to invoke backing implementation of \'InstallChaincode\': could not build chaincode: docker build failed: docker image build failed: docker build failed: Error returned from build: 1 "
```

Hello Guys, Hope you are doing well.
I need your help and guidance in Hyperledger Fabric.
Can you please suggest me good resources on how to generate crypto materials (manualy) using fabric ca in hyperledger?
Also the answers of few questions

My questions are:
1) which testing framework to use for fabric contract api chaincode (node.js) testing?
2) How to handle crypto certificates in production projects? How to generate certificates ? Where & how to store certificates ?

I'll be waiting for your all your response and suggestions.

Thanks & regards,
Abhishek

GitHub repositories are not picking up Azure Pipelines build status as part of their PR checks, so cannot be merged even though the build has completed successfully. See this PR in _fabric-sdk-node_, and _fabric-gateway-java_ and _fabric-sdk-java_ are seeing the same issue:

Interesting. While we don't use those in Actions, we do use the equivalent ones in AZP, I can't find anything that they might be affected as well (and I also don't think we use it for sensitive variable, but I'd need to confirm)

Let me take care of that, it's stupid how Azure manages it and it's really easy to mess up. IBM has an Azure Active Directory, so our work emails are registered in Acitive Direvtory already, so if you tie it to AZP wrong, you can't reverse it because IBM owns the AD

Swap the binary or docker image of an existing network, you can use the `fabric-samples test network` to do this

@Param-S I've tried a couple times to give you this permission. I don't know where the disconnect is between Azure and your GitHub account, but I don't have visibility into that.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 14:30:12 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I've a simular problem. Brett tried to add my github email but I've not been able to get access either
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:08:52 GMT):<br/>
All I can say is, I don't have any visibility into why you can't. All I can do is send an invite to an email
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:10:18 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel what email address?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:11:22 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:11:31 GMT):<br/>
(with emails)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:15:01 GMT):<br/>
@Param-S perhaps create your account with the email address first, then add GitHub login later?
</p>
<p><strong>Param-S</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:16:32 GMT):<br/>
let me try
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:17:34 GMT):<br/>
For what it is worth, the invite worked for julian
</p>
<p><strong>Param-S</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:19:01 GMT):<br/>
`is already a Microsoft account. Please try a different email address.`
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:19:26 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart but it looks like Julian never logged in?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:22:45 GMT):<br/>
@jcastrence said he logged in successfully (i think)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:23:39 GMT):<br/>
I give up... why is rocket not recognizing jcastrence? Shouldn't the id be the same as listed here - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jcastrence
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:24:10 GMT):<br/>
sure - that's JIRA, not Azure :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:24:53 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart do you have access to this page? https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/_settings/users
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:25:54 GMT):<br/>
I have view access, but i dont think i can grant privileges
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:26:11 GMT):<br/>
which account are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:26:11 GMT):<br/>
~~which account are you using?~~ found it
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:28:06 GMT):<br/>
i see julian's email account, but i thought he was using his github account - https://github.com/jcastrence - i thought everybody should use github rather than direct email access
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:28:20 GMT):<br/>
I just gave you the same access Brett has to Azure
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:28:26 GMT):<br/>
thank you
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:28:41 GMT):<br/>
Sure. I thought you always had it

are you able to see the "add users" button here, now? https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/_settings/users
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:30:06 GMT):<br/>
now i see it :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:31:03 GMT):<br/>
awesome. In the future - if you don't have permissions in Azure - just ask; I want you to have all the power you want over there :)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:31:46 GMT):<br/>
ok, i just added jcastrence (github id)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:33:08 GMT):<br/>
and now I've added Param-S (github id)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:33:23 GMT):<br/>
@Param-S try again
</p>
<p><strong>Param-S</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:35:01 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:35:30 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel  And I've added davidkel (github id)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:35:37 GMT):<br/>
you guys can try to access https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/ now
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:37:44 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart I signed up all of our orgs for the GitHub issues beta - should be a nicer JIRA replacement
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:38:28 GMT):<br/>
good. we can give it a look (is it really still in beta?)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:38:40 GMT):<br/>
or is there just some new functions in beta?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:39:10 GMT):<br/>
This is the beta: https://github.com/features/issues none of our orgs are in, yet
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:40:56 GMT):<br/>
I guess there is a difference between the 'old' GitHub issues, e.g. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/issues/ and this new GitHub Issues beta?
</p>
<p><strong>Param-S</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:41:39 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart , now, I am able to see the hyperledger resources
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:41:48 GMT):<br/>
yes, it's more like JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:42:04 GMT):<br/>
cool, so let me know when we can start trying it
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:42:43 GMT):<br/>
Ok, so the access issue is resolved... I guess the lesson learned is to always use GitHub id
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:43:08 GMT):<br/>
which I never thought would be an issue. I wonder if this is due to an edge case.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:43:21 GMT):<br/>
It used to be adding by GitHub ID was hard to make work
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:44:15 GMT):<br/>
it is a little difficult for IBMers because you have to add another email to your github account first, but that is what we've been advising everybody to do (with success)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:47:01 GMT):<br/>
well, whatever I can do to make it easier.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:47:14 GMT):<br/>
And help moving over to GitHub Actions :)

Not sure if this is of any help, this is the error page I get when trying to sign in through GitHub
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:24:18 GMT):<br/>
Can you login to https://dev.azure.com ? Does it show your github avatar?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:24:18 GMT):<br/>
Can you login to https://dev.azure.com ? Does it show your github avatar in top-right?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:24:34 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart Thanks Dave, whatever you did has got me further now. I can actually see the page with hyperledger resources
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:24:45 GMT):<br/>
ok, so 2 out of 3
</p>
<p><strong>jcastrence</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:27:57 GMT):<br/>
I signed into the link you just sent through Github and it isn't showing my Github avatar and it's also displaying my regular email
</p>
<p><strong>jcastrence</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:29:16 GMT):<br/>
And it's saying it's my Microsoft account
</p>
<p><strong>jcastrence</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:31:34 GMT):<br/>
My Github account is linked to my Microsoft account apparently so whenever I sign in it automatically is my Microsoft account
</p>
<p><strong>jcastrence</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:34:36 GMT):<br/>
On dev.azure.com/Hyperledger however it seems to be using my Github profile

@jcastrence no I do not - I would need to defer to @dave.enyeart

hello friends, this is question on the docker base image that is used to build fabric images. we see using alpine as base image. Can we not deploy the statically linked peer or orderer binary directly on scratch base image.  This would reduce the image size further and prevent attack vector.

@bardia this channel is really more for CI discussion of the Fabric project - I think the mailing list, or #fabric , is probably a better place to ask
