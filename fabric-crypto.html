for context ... I'm a client running the SDK and I receive a signed ProposalResponse from an endorser
</p>
<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 19:17:33 GMT):<br/>
i have the endorser's certificate in the ProposalResponse ...
</p>
<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 19:17:55 GMT):<br/>
how do I determine the signature algorithm ?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:16:22 GMT):<br/>
The signature algorithm you can figure out from the type of the key inside the certificate
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:44:21 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki , there is no guarantee that the algo inside the cert should be the same the algo that the user has signed the transaction with.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:44:39 GMT):<br/>
well it should no?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:44:53 GMT):<br/>
not necessarily.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:44:53 GMT):<br/>
or you mean the hash used?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:45:13 GMT):<br/>
in our case , we have defaulted to ECDSA,
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:45:27 GMT):<br/>
and hash is based on BCCSP config.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:45:34 GMT):<br/>
and the curve.. right 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:45:47 GMT):<br/>
so if we use default BCCSP , then it all works fine.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:46:14 GMT):<br/>
curve , we get from Cert which is GO implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:46:49 GMT):<br/>
I remember there was at some point discussion with @adc  to include some prefix in the signature itself that would indicate the type of the signature algo and hash function used to generate it. Following a standard.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:47:12 GMT):<br/>
Wait
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:47:20 GMT):<br/>
so the default bccsp hash should map to curve in cert.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:47:41 GMT):<br/>
Hold on.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:47:50 GMT):<br/>
In my TCERT option 2 , I am asking client to specify signature algo.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:48:22 GMT):<br/>
A leading question: How many different algos/schemes does it currently support?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:48:31 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar: one, right?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:48:38 GMT):<br/>
That's not what @elli-androulaki suggests.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:48:39 GMT):<br/>
no , 4.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:48:41 GMT):<br/>
So, the certificates include a key-type, along with the key in X509
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:49:07 GMT):<br/>
2 each for SHA2 and SHA3.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:49:31 GMT):<br/>
Key length/size does not define a NEW scheme.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:49:39 GMT):<br/>
Sig algo == hash algo.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:50:00 GMT):<br/>
hm, i think they work in combination these two...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:50:00 GMT):<br/>
We have also disabled some others (i'm talking about the full end-to-end). From SDKs all the way down.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:50:03 GMT):<br/>
as we are defaulting to ec,
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:50:23 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:50:25 GMT):<br/>
Yes, we have the (algo + size)
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:50:25 GMT):<br/>
so AFAIK , we are using default BCCSP.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:50:25 GMT):<br/>
so AFAIK , we are using default BCCSP CONFIG.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:50:55 GMT):<br/>
But what if we don't? And that new BCCSP' has different "defaults"
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:51:34 GMT):<br/>
Oh, `config` [just saw the edit]
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:51:52 GMT):<br/>
I think we should have an identifier...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:52:15 GMT):<br/>
And pre-agree strings to define these. I will be a nightmare to support otherwise.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:52:15 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:52:15 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:53:30 GMT):<br/>
Correct. So two things: (i) for the fabric platform related structures (e.g., signatures included in the proto messages) genesis block would include the hash algorithm used within. Adding @jyellick  to confirm here.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:55:05 GMT):<br/>
For the client/peer generated signatures using one of the existing MSPs, well MSPs should either be aware that they would support only one type of signatures and use that default type to verify their members' signatures, or (if they support multiple key types) they would need to prepend to signatures some standard label.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:55:34 GMT):<br/>
second statement makes sense.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:55:48 GMT):<br/>
(that's what I meant by 1 scheme, above - yes, thank you @elli-androulaki )
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:56:15 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps @vpaprots can identify the standard of the label pre-pended to the signatures :)
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:56:24 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi , sure!

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:58:35 GMT):<br/>
How does a Fabric - compliant MSP implementation deal with it, in a graceful way?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:59:15 GMT):<br/>
Of course we can have one very basic MSP that works with key size of 16 (bits, not bytes ;-))
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:59:31 GMT):<br/>
[I'm joking]
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:59:59 GMT):<br/>
What I mean to say is that we do not want to use the bare-minimum/allowed crypto everywhere.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:00:26 GMT):<br/>
And of course, we may need to change things in the future.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:01:42 GMT):<br/>
I can't see us always working with just the default.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:04:13 GMT):<br/>
You mean we should enable configurable key algo and length inside an MSP or in BCCSP that is used by an MSP?
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:04:50 GMT):<br/>
I see BCCSP as a golang version of Java JCE. In fact we were thinking with Angelo of splitting it out and proposing it to gophercon (I know some people going) or just asking the golang community to include it part of the language.. but I digress.. another tangent.. it would be nice to have one 'string' specifying' all the algorithms used, TLS style.. "FABRIC_SIGNATURE_HASH..." or something..
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:04:55 GMT):<br/>
Cause BCCSP you can also specify a specific hashing algorithm, and uses the default only if you dont specify it afaik

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=LLtzNQJJXzFgZj48o) can I suggest we standardize on http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html  ?  I see that Go crypto has its own set of names
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:05:45 GMT):<br/>
Angelo and I want to remove the notion of 'default algorithm' from BCCSP.
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:06:07 GMT):<br/>
(different then 'default BCCSP' !)
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:06:11 GMT):<br/>
Right, that I am aware of. I think it was there for simplicity at the beginning
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:06:12 GMT):<br/>
In TCert option 2 , I am asking SDK to pass signature algo.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:06:29 GMT):<br/>
Ash, this has to flow all the way through.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:06:38 GMT):<br/>
and call BCCSP API accordingly.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:06:49 GMT):<br/>
yup  , I agree.
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:07:37 GMT):<br/>
ok, another thought.. can we mix algorithms?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:07:40 GMT):<br/>
@vlad, good remark. 
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:07:40 GMT):<br/>
@vpaprots , good remark (for the default algo vs default Bccsp). 
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:08:20 GMT):<br/>
one MSP has ECDSA P384, another P256 and yet another SM3?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:08:22 GMT):<br/>
mix algorithms in what sense? support a variety of algos?
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:08:28 GMT):<br/>
cross-border 'trading'
</p>

OMG !
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:08:35 GMT):<br/>
yes, that should be possible I would say
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:08:49 GMT):<br/>
I think in Germany, they want Brainpool curves actually
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:08:58 GMT):<br/>
And in Russia ? ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:09:02 GMT):<br/>
thts one of the advantages of MSPs being modular :)
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:09:03 GMT):<br/>
will that go into the config block?
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:09:19 GMT):<br/>
(@JonathanLevi :D)
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:09:50 GMT):<br/>
Well, here is the thing. The MSP type should be supported by the peer's code. 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:10:01 GMT):<br/>
I know a Russian bank that had to re-write the entire memberservc because of the government restrcition.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:10:06 GMT):<br/>
Yup
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:10:18 GMT):<br/>
in the config block you can put hashes of source code corresponding to each MSP type
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:10:20 GMT):<br/>
in that case
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:10:26 GMT):<br/>
That's why I am so into configurations.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:10:30 GMT):<br/>
plus the assumed MSPs' configuration
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:10:44 GMT):<br/>
aha
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:11:13 GMT):<br/>
Yep, I know of a chinese firm working on the SM* algorithms, I suggested to them that they implement their own BCCSP for that.. thats the scalable extension point I want to use..
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:12:11 GMT):<br/>
so.. if we get a BCCSP configuration from a country/company/whatever with their own crypto considerations.. can we pick it up in the rest of fabric
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 21:13:16 GMT):<br/>
(and we dont get stuck implementing 3 dozen algorithms! In fact.. I think I would not even be allowed to ;) )

About @tuand suggestion about JCE names. Yes! (well, me biased). 'Small' issue.. no official name for SHA3 yet, and SHA2 name is 'bad', easy to confuse with SHA3. We work with oracle though, they already have names, just prepend SHA3-bits

Hi, for the crypto-squad Jira items under fabric-crypto, and Sprint 11 contain the list of pending items that correspond to @mastersingh24 's list.
In summary, our pending work items, blockers and estimated effort in PDs (= Person Days):
1) Channel ACL in endorser, orderer, and gossip logic [~ 2 x 3 PDs]. We are blocked by channel policy setup through genesis, and pending design on LCCC instantiation
2) Minimum level of replay protection [0.5 PD]
3) MSP-implementation completion (intermediate CAs, admin/OrganizationUnit) [1.5 PD]
4) Code todos that are not covered by the items listed before 
5) Application libraries for ACL [ETA: end of month]
6) Research paper (ETA: end of month)
7) Security review of new designs in CC2CC, deployment model, and reconfiguration

@aso @jeffgarratt I have a question on the `join channel` request, and it's probably best to ask it in the context of Jeff's bddtest `bootstrap.feature`, the following statement at line 130:
```
When user "dev0Org0" using cert alias "dev0Org0App1" requests to join channel using genesis block "genesisBlockForMyNewChannel" on peers with result "joinChannelResult"
```
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:43:55 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:45:07 GMT):<br/>
how does the peer2 in organization peerOrg1 validate the cert `dev0Org0App1` that's signed by peerOrg1 CA?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:45:59 GMT):<br/>
the peer's each have the org CA's in their cacerts for the localMspConfig
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:46:50 GMT):<br/>
ok that's what i'm confused about: i thought localMspConfig is only for signing purposes, not for validating incoming certs and signatures
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:47:09 GMT):<br/>
it may be
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:47:41 GMT):<br/>
and a related question is, how would the app know what "mspid" to use in the request? i assume it needs to be set to the id matching each peer's localMspConfig
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:48:14 GMT):<br/>
it collects the peer template info (which is really the reference to the orgs)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:48:57 GMT):<br/>
    And the user "dev0Org0" creates a peer template "template1" with chaincode deployment policy using chain creation policy name "chainCreatePolicy1" and peer organizations:
      | Organization  |
      |  peerOrg0     |
      |  peerOrg1     |

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:49:03 GMT):<br/>
line 95
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:49:30 GMT):<br/>
that then creates the MSPCOnfigItems for the join chain
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:49:46 GMT):<br/>
I mean chain create
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:50:48 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:52:43 GMT):<br/>
ok, but I think my problem is slightly different, when I send this join request to the peer, I sign it and the peer needs to validate my cert
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:53:01 GMT):<br/>
correct, that comes from the localMSp
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:53:05 GMT):<br/>
I believe
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:53:10 GMT):<br/>
@aso can verify
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:53:34 GMT):<br/>
I create a devOrg0App1 reference to a cert for devOrg0 signed by peerOrg0
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:53:45 GMT):<br/>
that is used for signing, and is in the peer's localMspConfig
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:54:09 GMT):<br/>
    When user "dev0Org0" using cert alias "dev0Org0App1" requests to join channel using genesis block "genesisBlockForMyNewChannel" on peers with result "joinChannelResult"
      | Peer       |
      | peer0      |
      | peer2      |

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:54:21 GMT):<br/>
using cert alias "..." means it uses that cert to sign
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:54:32 GMT):<br/>
> ok that's what i'm confused about: i thought localMspConfig is only for signing purposes, not for validating incoming certs and signatures
￼
validating a join channel request is the one exception to that rule
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:54:33 GMT):<br/>
or supplies it with the signature
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:55:08 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki can confirm
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:55:14 GMT):<br/>
and as peers always do, it first looks at the mspid that comes along with the cert in the "creator" field, this mspid should represent my app's signing identify which is really mapped to the peerOrg0. so the peer's local msp config is already configured with that (ca certs for peerOrg0), then it can validate
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:56:12 GMT):<br/>
@aso "validating a join channel request is the one exception to that rule" - aha that makes sense now
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:56:52 GMT):<br/>
yeah - for all other cases we can use the trust setup from the genesis block, but on a join channel we have no genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:57:03 GMT):<br/>
@aso, confirmed :)

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:57:05 GMT):<br/>

@aso "for all other cases we can use the trust setup from the genesis block, but on a join channel we have no genesis block" - yeah was discussing this with @cdaughtr and I realize this was a chicken-n-egg problem, but using local msp makes sense

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:02:55 GMT):<br/>
so my next question then is when the join channel request is sent to peer0, we need to set the "mspid" in the "creator" field to the value matching peer0's local msp, and same for peer2 in a different org. and as a result we'll have to construct each request targeting peers in different orgs separately right?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:03:14 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:03:30 GMT):<br/>
exactly, you would have to go through the whole template... blah blah process again
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:03:37 GMT):<br/>
choose separate orgs, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:03:52 GMT):<br/>
you can simply copy and paste the behave steps to join multiple channels if you like
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:03:59 GMT):<br/>
it is a DSL, so have at it
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:04:47 GMT):<br/>
I would caution that with new config changes, then may be slightly askew for a bit
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:04:50 GMT):<br/>
aka not working
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:04:53 GMT):<br/>
aha so that's another epiphany ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:05:15 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:05:19 GMT):<br/>
(in reference to using different mspids for the creator field)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:05:31 GMT):<br/>
indeed

</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:28:05 GMT):<br/>
the joinchannel request comes with the genesis block, which must include the peer orgs, so I would prefer to open up the block and set up MSP mgr. I know it is chicken and egg, but the process is quite odd at the API/SDK level otherwise.  Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:31:03 GMT):<br/>
from what I know- the join channel that has the genesis block, is signed by the "admin private key" which any peer can verify using its local MSP

</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:35:16 GMT):<br/>
right, but peers in different orgs would require the app the switch to their orgs certs to sign the joinchannel proposal request
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:36:52 GMT):<br/>
to switch to their admin keys, yes I would assume so... but I fail to see the problem, I thought that's how that was to work ?

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:44:38 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix  - each "org" is responsible for calling join channel on its own peers
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 16:45:24 GMT):<br/>
(if there was going to be a central authority, of course you could handle this by having a common root cert - in addition to the org cert - in each peers local msp)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 17:39:43 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 yeah i agree that'll be the logical conclusion that the app on a per-user basis is only able to send the join channel request to the peer in its own org because it won't have the private key needed to sign something that can be validated/verified by a different org. unless like you said there's a common root cert

quick question
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 12:34:00 GMT):<br/>
I think we have some basics in place for this, but do we currently support using the same root CA / issuer across multiple MSPs (with the MSP differentiated by say the O / OU in the actual issued certificates)?
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 13:17:14 GMT):<br/>
hey Gari. I'll soon (today) drop a CS that permits policy verification based on OU
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 13:17:48 GMT):<br/>
basically a policy can specify that it requires a signature by a member of MSP foo that has OU = bar
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 13:18:02 GMT):<br/>
which - if I got your Q correctly - should address that point
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 13:38:07 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 14:33:16 GMT):<br/>
if still there, are we checking certificate usage?  I am pretty sure that Go's crypto implementation does this by default?

For example, I know that within the TLS stack, it actually checks for proper usage for both the certificate and the issuer of the certificate

I was looking into Go Crypto package and found that it supports only Weierstrass curve with a=-3 , which to me seems to be severe limitation.

<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 20:43:33 GMT):<br/>
whereas Bouncy Castle java implementation provides number of curves as per NIST.

<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 10 Feb 2017 20:44:36 GMT):<br/>
We might have requirement from customers to have Curve with higher N value so that subgroup with secure K value can be found.

@aso @adc @elli-androulaki @mastersingh24 question on when MSP is loaded from a config, how is crypto parameters like security level, hash family and digital signature algo are decided. we could get that from the admincert or signercert, or specify that in the chain policy. i see this is pending in the peer code ATM:

mspimpl.go, line 63:
```
// TODO: security level, hash family and keystore should
// be probably set in the appropriate way.

@mastersingh24 @ashutosh_kumar Actually, this is _precisely_ why @adc and I (and few more people) want BCCSP. We (the fabric team) get out of the business of writing crypto primitives. (And Ash.. actually I dont see the brainpool or the chinese curves ;) ). The point of BCCSP is exactly 'fabric provides a few samples, you want other algorithms, you are welcome to write 'BrainpoolBCCSP'.
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 02:26:43 GMT):<br/>
We are not quite there yet.
- Step 1: configure which BCCSP to use
- Step 2: configure the _custom_ _name_ of algorithm to use
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 02:30:00 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 I am not quiet sure how to get Step2 above done.. It kind of ties into what @jimthematrix was discussing (and @JonathanLevi and I earlier), where to specify a custom signature algorithm name. I suspect it will be somewhere in the protobuf structs..
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 02:30:50 GMT):<br/>
in which case it would be nicer to adjust protobufs now, even if we just hardcode to ecdsa-sha3-p256 or something (or OID..)

yeah bccsp is one level of abstraction that enables different algos and (for EC variations) curves to be plugged in. my question earlier was definitely your step 2 above, which would be on another abstraction level the MSPs. in the current code i think it's possible to make these params (algo, hash family, key length) a per-channel setting, so that the peers and orderers all follow the same set of params when signing and verifying. this requires orderers and peers to use per-channel-per-org MSPs (since the same org may be using different algo/hash/keylen on different channels). in real practice though i wonder if this level of complexity is needed or not. could this be decided by the consortium so all channels use the same? if v1.0 does this (statically set to a common setting throughout the network) will it cover 80% of use cases?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 20:54:09 GMT):<br/>
Curve is algtogether beast by itself. It gives you point as Public Key on the curve. Curve and Algorithms are kind of orthogonal to each other.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 20:55:19 GMT):<br/>
e.g same sig algo can be applied to different curves but getting generator of a curve is real pain.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Sun, 12 Feb 2017 20:57:37 GMT):<br/>
So coming up with Algo String is not going to solve the problem of adding support for different crypto providers , I think. Main issue is providing support of curve. For that BCCSP should be able to provide different crypto provider implemented in plethora of languages.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 13:18:28 GMT):<br/>
I see 2 high level methods for identifying a "peer org" for X509-based providers:

1) Each peer org has its own "issuer" (i.e. unique root and/or intermediate certificates)
2) Multiple peer orgs "share" a common issuer but we distinguish different orgs based on the OU in the issued certificates
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 13:18:55 GMT):<br/>
we then have MSPConfig and MSPPrincipals
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 13:20:50 GMT):<br/>
so how exactly do we expect this to be "configured"?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 13:48:15 GMT):<br/>
Hi @mastersingh24, there are two ways one can use to accommodate this need: i) the OUs is part of the configuration of an MSP in which case one need to extend (the current MSP implementation to accept as valid only certificates that are not only signed by a specific CA but rather also include a specific OU in them)
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 13:48:51 GMT):<br/>
ii) leave MSPs configuration as they are and allow the OU-based separation at the access policy level, which is what @aso's CR allows for.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 13:49:42 GMT):<br/>
So, you say, I want a certain resource to be allowed by members of MSP with id X and belong to OU: "Payment Division
</p>

So, you say, I want a certain resource to be allowed by members of MSP with id X and belong to OU: "Org1.Payment Division"
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:01:53 GMT):<br/>
Ok - right - so if one chooses a model where each "peer org" has its own issuer, there would be a separate MSP per "peer org".  Correct?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:03:15 GMT):<br/>
and if one chooses the "OU" for each "peer org", you would only need a single MSP
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:05:02 GMT):<br/>
correct, one could go either way
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:05:33 GMT):<br/>
what do you think is the simplest?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:05:36 GMT):<br/>
but then the question is:   how do these MSPs get distributed?   And then we have MSPPrincipal used in policies.  So you need to define these MSPPrincipals.  For the OU case, seems that MSPPrincipal.principal should be serialized bytes of OrganizationUnit (which reference an MSP - so where is that MSP configured / distributed)?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:06:11 GMT):<br/>
and in the case where you use MSPPrincipal to be a "member" own"admin" is that the serialization of the actual MSP itself?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:06:41 GMT):<br/>
I am a bit torn as to which way to go - on the one hand, not having to duplicate the MSP in the OU case is nice
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:07:17 GMT):<br/>
on the other hand, having a consistent way to identity orgs is nice as well
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:09:55 GMT):<br/>
Yes, so say we have two orgs A and B that have the same root CA. If they agree that they will always be served by that CA and that a single (list of) admin(s) would serve both needs, (in other words that the same MSP configuration would serve their needs), we can use one MSP and have distinction based on OUs at the policy level. 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:11:01 GMT):<br/>
or we simply move "OU" under the MSPConfig and everything is based on MSPID
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:11:07 GMT):<br/>
However, if we want to keep the membership of each org seperately, we may as well define two MSPs (each with the same CAs, but perhaps different admins) and still define policies based on OUs or, 
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:11:15 GMT):<br/>
Correct!
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:11:28 GMT):<br/>
Which would be ideal actually, but not sure if the time permits
</p>

> mastersingh24 3:11 PM
> or we simply move "OU" under the MSPConfig and everything is based on MSPID
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:14:15 GMT):<br/>
I think it should simplify things actually if we go that route now.   This way we can have a consistent way of identifying "orgs"  - I think @aso should be able to modify the code so that in the case of member/admin, if for the given MSP OU is populated just make the OU check at that point?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:15:27 GMT):<br/>
(BTW - this is how I was originally thinking things might work - hence why I was "confused"  ;)  )
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:15:58 GMT):<br/>
got it! 
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:19:24 GMT):<br/>
so, what should I do?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:27:54 GMT):<br/>
Hi @aso 
So here's what I think we (well you  ;)  ) should do ( @elli-androulaki please correct me if I'm off anywhere):

1) I think we go with a model where an MSP actually contains both the issuer (root/intermediates) and the OU  (so you'd need to add an OU to the MSPConfig)
2) Instead of having a principal type of OrganizationalUnit, just have ROLE and IDENTITY
3) For ROLE, when you check things, you'll now need to see if the MSP specified on OU and if so make sure that the principal is not only from the issue in the MSP but also contains the OU specified as part of the MSP definition)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:29:38 GMT):<br/>
so hopefully it's more or less adding a field to an MSP and then rearranging the code you have a bit in the implementation
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:30:02 GMT):<br/>
(sometimes I am an optimist  ;)  )
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:15:48 GMT):<br/>
So, i think for (2) we can leave mspprincipals as they are today, given that they support identities, admins, members (where members now would be forced to have a specifig OU inside their X509 cert?), and OUs that would make sense if there are multiple OUs within the same MSP (do you think the latter is a valid use-case)?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:22:58 GMT):<br/>
we could probably leave the OU principal type in there for now
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:23:51 GMT):<br/>
question:   
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:26:33 GMT):<br/>
members would not be "forced" unless the MSP has a list of OUs
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:43:44 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki @aso - so do we just stick with what we have now and add to it (maybe later)?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:44:38 GMT):<br/>
the current model lends itself well to having a "central" membership provider which differentiates orgs by OU but still has centralized control of the CA.
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:52:23 GMT):<br/>
so we would stay in a model (the current) where a principal must match an MSP ID *and* an OU?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:52:31 GMT):<br/>
re-thiniking - I think https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5939/   is good
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:52:38 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:52:43 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:52:59 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki are you good as well?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:53:25 GMT):<br/>
if people want to do things differently, we could add that later, but I think that the notion of OU to distiguish orgs is really geared towards the model with a central issuer
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:53:53 GMT):<br/>
but we still need to differentiate orgs in that model for policy enforcement.  so @aso what we did in the CR makes perfect sense to me
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:58:13 GMT):<br/>
Sure, fine for me.

so the above discussion settles the "msp-per-org" vs. "msp-per-issuer" question, what about the "msp-per-chain" question I had above, as I thought the same issuer can sign certs with different parameters (algo, hash, curves), no?

therefore, the same org uses ecdsa/256/sha2 for chain A but rsa/384/sha3 for chain B, and as such would need two separate local MSPs for each chain

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 16:14:35 GMT):<br/>
so first question is if the fabric wants to support different chains using different signing parameters. and if so, the preferred way is to use a single MSP by with different bccsp, instead of multiple MSPs

I do not think so , I might be wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 16:30:09 GMT):<br/>
as bccsp is tied to Private Key.

I think , we can instantiate single BCCSP per MSP and call , say , verify method , based on algo that is being passed.

<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 19:22:49 GMT):<br/>
So I ran into a problem that I don't quite know how to address.. Been staring at this for a day now. Would appreciate some new thoughts.
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 19:24:03 GMT):<br/>
With https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/4877/8  I insist that BEFORE one uses BCCSP you _must_ call `factory.InitFactories(config OR nil)`
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 19:25:10 GMT):<br/>
The second part of that idea is here: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5897/1. Modifies the `orderer.yaml` and `core.yaml`
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 19:26:15 GMT):<br/>
seems to work fine.. problem.. none of the test cases actually call `factory.InitFactories(nil)`. And there are a lot of those..
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 19:27:14 GMT):<br/>
I am debating the idea that for the peer, BCCSP config should be part of MSP config
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 19:28:08 GMT):<br/>
but, just like last couple of questions, I am not entirely clear how MSP is configured. 
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 19:29:26 GMT):<br/>
func GetLocalMSP() msp.MSP { << would be nice to have viper access here?
...
		if lclMsp == nil {
..
			lclMsp, err = msp.NewBccspMsp()
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 19:30:08 GMT):<br/>
@binhn @mastersingh24 ^^ any thoughts on whom I can bug for this? dead in the water here..
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:04:51 GMT):<br/>
I think "type" of MSP is associated with a type of BCCSP - but I don't think that the config for bccsp should be in individual MSPs
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:06:35 GMT):<br/>
I think the "real" question is where do we define the crypto parameters for the blockchain.  do we do it "global" to the entire blockchain?  do we do it per channel?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:06:56 GMT):<br/>
I would not think that we define signing algorithm within an MSP
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:08:30 GMT):<br/>
for X509, I guess we could have a mismatch for EC versus RSA (and I supposed even ECDSA versus some other EC signing mechanism - e.g. EdDSA)
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:45:23 GMT):<br/>
I think , there is one-to-one mapping between private key and bccsp. 
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:50:35 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Let me reword somewhat. You are right, there are many configuration questions. The one I am stuck on is 'I want this executable to use THIS crypto implementation (BCCSP)'. So the way I approached it.. `ls build/bin` great, I need to patch `orderer` and `peer`. That seems to make sense to me.. except all the `go test` executions also produce an executable
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:13:29 GMT):<br/>
@vpaprots  - so in 
```
func GetDefault() bccsp.BCCSP {
	if defaultBCCSP == nil {
		panic("BCCSP Factory: Must call InitFactories before using BCCSP!")
	}
```
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:13:45 GMT):<br/>
why not just call InitFactories here?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:14:53 GMT):<br/>
mind you that was not a deep look at all the code  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:15:13 GMT):<br/>
typically, I want the config available.. if you could have a look at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5897/1/peer/common/common.go
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:15:40 GMT):<br/>
for default init, I am just fine calling InitFactories(nil)
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:15:59 GMT):<br/>
but typically, this comes from viper.Unmarshall
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:18:18 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 ^
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:19:35 GMT):<br/>
well.. that does remind me of a decision made of not having viper inside bccsp..
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:25:53 GMT):<br/>
yeah - well the whole config stuff is a bit messy 
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:26:07 GMT):<br/>
:(
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:26:21 GMT):<br/>
its been making me cry!! :)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:26:29 GMT):<br/>
but it seems that GetDefault is supposed to more or less load the default setting - which I assume would come from config
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:26:42 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:28:27 GMT):<br/>
so if you did  InitFactories(nil)  in GetDefault, wouldn't that basically be the same as how things work today?
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:28:58 GMT):<br/>
thats what I do here: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/4877/8/bccsp/factory/opts.go
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:29:21 GMT):<br/>
that patch set is ready..
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:29:35 GMT):<br/>
the next one is trying to actually make it configurable
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:29:49 GMT):<br/>
(there are two 'related' patch sets)
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:31:09 GMT):<br/>
(as a side benefit.. I am getting free review from you! :D)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:31:41 GMT):<br/>
yeah - but I guess in code which just calls GetDefault without going through the whole config path, it seems that instead of panicing in GetDefault that calling InitFactories(nil) would actually be the right them to do?   else you'd have to modify all code that calls GetDefault
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:32:05 GMT):<br/>
hmm
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:32:24 GMT):<br/>
if not initialized, call initfactories(nil)
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:32:33 GMT):<br/>
well.. that could work..
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:32:49 GMT):<br/>
I think I like that..
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:32:56 GMT):<br/>
still hacky and would not be the case for normal operation through the peer / orderer
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:33:06 GMT):<br/>
only via component test paths methinks
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:33:19 GMT):<br/>
I get worried with defaults in crypto code.. typical attack vector would force the 'fallback'
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:33:23 GMT):<br/>
so I think it is the easiest solution to get things moving
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:33:27 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:34:13 GMT):<br/>
thanks @mastersingh24 !!
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:48:39 GMT):<br/>
I think that at some point, in one way or another, we will also need to also think about the *usability* of the "entire" solution.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:49:50 GMT):<br/>
That is, we have a few different "configurable" components... whether they are the default ones in some cases, or specific ones that a "deployer" would like to use... say in the "roll you own crypto" scenario.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:50:38 GMT):<br/>
We should be able to make sure that the system does what is intended... especially in terms of matching the various components and their versions.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:52:36 GMT):<br/>
So a few things: We need to have the "pluggable" architecture, where one can replace components as needed, at the same time, I don't like viper, and I don't want it to be too complex to bootstrap.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:54:38 GMT):<br/>
Let's get things moving and also make sure we have enough time to work out a/the few "flows" that are plausible and are well tested... so that we can point people to a few working examples (that include some good non-default components/behavior)...

Onto my next 'argument'. KeyImports of Clear text PEM vs GetKey of SKI PEM ;) protobuf: `FabricMSPConfig`-> `SigningIdentityInfo`-> `KeyInfo`
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 03:16:22 GMT):<br/>
 // KeyInfo represents a (secret) key that is either already stored
// in the bccsp/keystore or key material to be imported to the
// bccsp key-store. In later versions it may contain also a
// keystore identifier
type KeyInfo struct {
	// Identifier of the key inside the default keystore; this for
	// the case of Software BCCSP as well as the HSM BCCSP would be
	// the SKI of the key
	KeyIdentifier string `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=key_identifier,json=keyIdentifier" json:"key_identifier,omitempty"`
	// KeyMaterial (optional) for the key to be imported; this is
	// properly encoded key bytes, prefixed by the type of the key

</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 03:17:57 GMT):<br/>
Great.. well.. I kinda wish the 'KeyMaterial' element wasnt present at all, but I will admit that I can 'live' with it as an 'option'..
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 03:18:35 GMT):<br/>
`KeyIdentifier` is an SKI, and `KeyMaterial` is empty. 
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 03:19:34 GMT):<br/>
Can we agree that that is indeed a valid usage? 

msp/configbuilder.go:	keyinfo := &msp.KeyInfo{KeyIdentifier: "PEER", KeyMaterial: keys[0]}
msp/mspwithintermediatecas_test.go:	keyinfo := &msp.KeyInfo{KeyIdentifier: "PEER", KeyMaterial: []byte(key)}

"PEER" does _not_ looks like an SKI
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 14 Feb 2017 03:20:07 GMT):<br/>
in fact `KeyIdentifier` should also be a `[]byte`.. whom do I talk to about protobuf changes!?

@aso  When running end-to-end or endorser-tests, peer exits with code 2 running msgvalidation.go.checkSignatureFromCreator.  The code that is failing is MSPConfigHandler autogenerated, so not able to add any helpful debugging.  The only difference between fabric-sdk-node and fabric that I have found it that node has an identity.proto class that is missing in fabric.  Even though there were many fabric proto changes recently, I did not see anything significant for mspConfig.

this is an (expected) regression that was introduced with the new config work; it will be fixed as soon as 5989 and 6021 are merged; that said, MSP should fail more gracefully, which is a separate change set that I'll push shortly

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:34:46 GMT):<br/>
@cdaughtr  in the end-to-end.js it's generated as `tx_id = utils.buildTransactionID({length:12});` where buildTransactionID just calls crypto.randomBytes()

Error message 'Illegal value for Message.Field .protos.ChaincodeProposalPayload.transient of type bytes: object (proto3 field without field presence cannot be null)'.  I don't see what changed in the endorser code to cause this.  Any ideas?

[ You probably found this yourself, but GetLocalMSPConfig simply reads the actual crypto material itself from a folder structure under the `dir` parameter.  The `ID` passed in will be used to the the `Name` field of the FabricMSPConfig instance](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=nZMG6HCyMosREDYYk) @jyellick 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 13:13:46 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sun, 19 Feb 2017 08:33:35 GMT):<br/>
The way MSPs are (re)configured is not up to date given the recent changes in config mechanism, but will be sometime next week. But the logic and the parameters an MSP takes to be setup (proto messages) are up to date.

I agree that we might want to look at checking the CRL is signed by the CA it claims to be for, but given you'd only verify the signature if you find a matching cert in the revocation list, doing it this way should not overhead in the common path

@vpaprots bccsp/pkcs11 package needs to be refactored to leverage the existing SW implementation rather than duplicate all the functions. Otherwise, it is a mess to keep them in sync :(

<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Sun, 19 Feb 2017 15:28:15 GMT):<br/>
@adc Actually.. the idea was to replace the other SW operations in PKCS11 BCCSP with PKCS11 operations. I will get there, but its more important now for the PKCS11 code to be used first

@jyellick regarding your https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6225/, I would have expected a test to highlight the fact that CheckProposalTxID has to be enforced only for endorsed transactions otherwise we risk other issues in the future, no?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Sun, 19 Feb 2017 15:36:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I wanted to discuss this with you.  Obviously we could set the txID for config transactions, but I'm not sure that it would be useful for them
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Sun, 19 Feb 2017 15:40:37 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki @jyellick actually, it would be nice to have txid computed in the same way for the all the transactions but I see that config is a special case
</p>

@kostas - uh - it's really simple and I agree with you that we should explain the basics of an X509-based MSP.  There's only a few fields to populate and in the simplest case for MSPs used for organizations you should only need to provide a name and a root certificate  ;)

I guess there's 2 parts:   populating an MSP  (which is what end users will care about) and then there's using the MSP interfaces within fabric components (which fabric core developers will care about)

@adc @elli-androulaki Why is the `tx_id` in the header a string when it is a hash? (and not bytes)
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Sun, 19 Feb 2017 16:59:49 GMT):<br/>
if I remember correctly, if was bytes at the very beginning and then it was requested to change to string 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Sun, 19 Feb 2017 17:00:05 GMT):<br/>
I'm fine to move back to bytes
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Sun, 19 Feb 2017 17:01:40 GMT):<br/>
The fact that we are base64 encoding it is very odd to me

The `channel_id` used to be bytes but was changed to string, I do not know about `tx_id`
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Sun, 19 Feb 2017 20:00:36 GMT):<br/>
Have to ask this ...  Why is the SDKs creating the tx_ids at all ?  Shouldn't when we create a proposal the proposal response has the tx_id that the fabric created for us to reference this ?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 09:22:09 GMT):<br/>
in that case, the client may retry the request. But, if the request is not idempotent it might cause problems (i.e : increment a value twice instead of one time)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 09:22:37 GMT):<br/>
if the request is tagged with an ID, the server could see that this request has already been processed before and either not execute it, or return the previous computed value, etc.

@elli-androulaki @adc - RE:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6277/   - what exactly is the `identityx` package?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 14:14:15 GMT):<br/>
it is the new name for the accesscontrol package :)

@adc: any design doc we can look at? (I don't have a strong preference regarding the name, but now for example, the directory name does not match)
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:23:50 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi it will have the same functionalities he had in 0.6 adapted to the new infrastructure
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:23:55 GMT):<br/>
that's it :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:24:54 GMT):<br/>
Oh, I see... more of a "re-packaging" [no pun intended ;-)]
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:26:11 GMT):<br/>
So the question now is, do we feel that it's more identity (of the guarding of thereof, etc.)... or really the same good ol' access control mechanism we had (adapted/updated)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:27:34 GMT):<br/>
Taking another look at it (to clarify, of course we can always replace a few strings... so we not hold our breaths, either way).
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:29:22 GMT):<br/>
OK, another question (sorry ;-))
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:30:09 GMT):<br/>
in fabric, it is all about identities :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:30:50 GMT):<br/>
OK, is it possible to add/remove/rename this is one changeset?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:32:23 GMT):<br/>
Because *git* will not be able to correlate the changes, we may lose history/tracking, and it will be much easier to evaluate... I believe.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:42:42 GMT):<br/>
@adc Am I making sense? (you can still do it in 2 steps if you really want to... starting with *git mv*, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:43:33 GMT):<br/>
so Jonathan, I was doing that but then I noticed that the change-set was getting too big
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:43:44 GMT):<br/>
that's the reason why I decided to split in two
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:44:07 GMT):<br/>
:(
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:47:15 GMT):<br/>
I think the problem with change sets being too big is only when there is many code to review, not to rename
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:50:26 GMT):<br/>
correct, so a change-set that removes accesscontrol and then add a little bit of identityx, would that buy you anything?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:51:06 GMT):<br/>
I was just pointing something out, Angelo
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:52:09 GMT):<br/>
sorry Yacov, the question was for Jonathan building on your comment :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:57:51 GMT):<br/>
I can't assess without knowing what's in indentityx. Deleting a long list of files is not a problem.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:58:13 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:58:24 GMT):<br/>
Have your rewritten everything from scratch? 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:58:26 GMT):<br/>
I will modify the commit message
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:58:29 GMT):<br/>
to better clarify
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:58:34 GMT):<br/>
what will come in identityx
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:58:40 GMT):<br/>
it will be mostly the same files
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:58:44 GMT):<br/>
you will recognize the name
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:58:46 GMT):<br/>
OK hold there.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:58:46 GMT):<br/>
OK hold it there.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:58:48 GMT):<br/>
just rearrenged
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:59:20 GMT):<br/>
That's what I was trying to find out. Cool. If it's the same files - then definitely let's use *git mv* commit.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:59:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it would really help clarify.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:59:48 GMT):<br/>
but I need refactoring
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:00:00 GMT):<br/>
running just git mv will not help much me
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:00:06 GMT):<br/>
:(
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:00:09 GMT):<br/>
how can we do that
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:00:11 GMT):<br/>
??
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:05:05 GMT):<br/>
Again, I am not sure what are the exact changes that you have made (maybe it will be good to summarize actually in JIRA)... 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:05:22 GMT):<br/>
But, the simplest is probably to start by refactoring "in place"...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:05:37 GMT):<br/>
So that we don't lose the tracking info/history.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:06:53 GMT):<br/>
We can rename that updated folder with the "imports" in a separate CR
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:11:49 GMT):<br/>
let's see. I will give a try to the refactoring in place
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:16:51 GMT):<br/>
Thank you. Yes, let's see. Feel free to even mark it as WIP, push to gerrit, etc. will be happy to look at things.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:17:21 GMT):<br/>
The new versions of git are actually pretty smart about these (but not when it's done in isolation)
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:23:35 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi How does it look now? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6277/
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:33:44 GMT):<br/>
Yes, exactly. Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:34:09 GMT):<br/>
oh, it was easy. I though it was a nightmare 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:34:42 GMT):<br/>
No, not. Git is "sweet" like that, when you it the *git* way. Otherwise, it is a nightmare.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:35:30 GMT):<br/>
Let me know when it's ready for review.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:35:30 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 08:21:50 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick @binhn @muralisr @aso @elli-androulaki, the CLI needs to updated to set the /channel/Application/Writers and /channel/Application/Readers policy at channel creation time. 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 08:22:17 GMT):<br/>
By default, when a policy does not exists, a reject all policy is returned. This can make the CLI failing 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 12:26:51 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi, https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6277/ ready. May you have a look at it? Thanks :)
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 14:09:42 GMT):<br/>
@adc The CLI does / should be setting these, the bdd does not.  I have not had a chance to exhaustively test the absolute policy paths, so you may be hitting another bug
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 14:33:22 GMT):<br/>
ahh, I thought it was the other way around 
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 16:37:59 GMT):<br/>
Here is https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5897/11 again.. adding yaml configuration to BCCSP (the more rebases, the more files it seems I have to touch.. )
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 17:18:24 GMT):<br/>
@binhn @muralisr @elli-androulaki @aso may we assume that system chaincodes will not use CC2CC and no chainless invocation will go through a CC2CC for v1?
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 17:30:36 GMT):<br/>
i m aware of 2 scc's that are "chainless":  lccc and cscc.  Lccc doesn't call any other chaincodes in the sense of cc2cc.  So I think we can make that assumption for these 2 unless murali has a legitimate use case. 
In general (scc that instantiated on channels) should be treated the same as other cc's since they would be invoked with the same context
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 17:31:57 GMT):<br/>
maybe the query scc that @muralisr mentioned. This would need to invoke LCCC (or is part of the chainless LCCC?). 
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 17:35:59 GMT):<br/>
why would we not provide the query directly from lccc?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 17:39:47 GMT):<br/>
Here is what @wlahti mentioned: that the qscc (or extension of chainless lccc) would need to support the following queries:
1. list the installed chaincodes on a peer
2. list the instantiated chaincodes on a channel => this may require triggering the lccc of the channel the query refers to? 
3. list all the channels for a given peer 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 17:39:47 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 17:48:25 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the second query is currently coded to use a state range scan on the LCCC to retrieve the instantiated chaincodes. See https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6289/ , which is under code review. 
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:02:43 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti is the code on lccc or qscc calling lccc to get the info?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:03:01 GMT):<br/>
right @wlahti ... we *are* calling LCCC from qscc for that
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:03:13 GMT):<br/>
(or rather we will be )
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:03:30 GMT):<br/>
why wouldn't we imple on lccc?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:04:11 GMT):<br/>
oh wait
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:05:07 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti that change happends to be confined to qscc 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:05:14 GMT):<br/>
so its not CC-2-CC call
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:05:40 GMT):<br/>
we *could* have implemented by putting that code in LCCCC and calling from qscc
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:05:56 GMT):<br/>
but as implemented, there's no cc-2-cc call
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:06:31 GMT):<br/>
am I missing something @wlahti ?
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:06:39 GMT):<br/>
`itr, err := queryExecutor.GetStateRangeScanIterator("lccc", "", "")`
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:06:50 GMT):<br/>
is that a backdoor?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:06:52 GMT):<br/>
thats a call to the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:06:56 GMT):<br/>
not to chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:06:57 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:11:08 GMT):<br/>
Oh right, I forgot that we decided to use the call to the ledger entries for LCCC instead of truly using LCCC. 
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:12:36 GMT):<br/>
so this is certainly not allowed in chaincode, but as a scc, power be with you :-)  that is, a scc may poke into any cc's data ?
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:23:43 GMT):<br/>
#1 and 3 above should only be allowed to admins, and so it should go on lccc and cscc respectively
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:24:04 GMT):<br/>
though i am not sure how we control access to cscc
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:52:06 GMT):<br/>
https://chat.hyperledger.org/direct/elli-androulaki?msg=Jv922rSdgh965Fhs3
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:53:09 GMT):<br/>
Elli provided these thoughts on access control for these queries a few days ago: 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:53:38 GMT):<br/>
"From the access perspective:
so proposal is sent to the peer for "invoking" that query scc, and let C be the creator
a simple and straight forward approach would be that the peer checks that C is among his MSP admins and rejects if C is not within that set"
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:54:09 GMT):<br/>
"a more elaborate approach would be

for query of type 1: 
- check that C is the peer admin and list everything if so
- check which channels C has read access for (using the instantiated chain read sets) and return the list of chaincodes that have been installed on the peer and have been available in the channels C has read access to

for query of type 2:
- check that C is the peer admin and list everything if so
- check that C has read access to the requested channel and if so, respond to C 

for query of type 3:
- check that C is the peer admin and list everything if so
[ optionally: - check which channels C has read access for (using the instantiated chain read sets) and return the list of channels the peer has joined from the ones C has access to ]"
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 20:42:55 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki are these check done per chaincode and by the chaincode code itself  or from the peer like we do now but somehow look up the chaincode by name to apply admins or writers?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 20:51:06 GMT):<br/>
I would say either way; perhaps inside the may have its advantages as one can substitute the policy in one without impacting the ACLs in the rest
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 20:55:21 GMT):<br/>
if inside the chaincode then we would need shim API 
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 20:57:22 GMT):<br/>
I see...
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 20:58:29 GMT):<br/>
which means that the shim should be able to call and evaluate the policies on MSP
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 20:58:46 GMT):<br/>
(local MSP of peer)
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:00:44 GMT):<br/>
right; we don't need to in this case since they are scc, so we can just call msp validation directly, but we need to tell it to use which group (readers, writers, admins)
</p>
<p><strong>agaragiola</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:00:53 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:01:48 GMT):<br/>
ah it will only need to use a static policy that the scc would create. 
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:02:07 GMT):<br/>
Cause readers/writers/admins are channel-scoped.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:02:48 GMT):<br/>
Actually I take that back. 
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:10:40 GMT):<br/>
Let a policy object P defining the local MSP admin. SO one MSPPrincipal that refers to the local MSP's admin.

for query of type 1:
- check that C / and its signature on proposal satisfies P and if so output the list of installed chaincodes to the peer
- if not, for each channel the peer has joined, 
     - retrieve channel Readers, readers
     - check if C (and its proposal signature) complies with readers and if so retrieves the chaincodes the peer has installed and are on that channel
The latter may leak information on the channels a peer has joined to the readers of the channel. We may want to restrict that to members of the organization of the peer. 

for query of type 2:
- check that C / and its signature on proposal satisfies P and if so output the list of chaincodes on that channel
- check that C has read access to the requested channel and if so, respond to C

for query of type 3:
-  check that C / and its signature on proposal satisfies P and if so answer

</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 18:14:49 GMT):<br/>
Also @wlahti, what is the full set of QSCC? Does it aim to only serve chainless proposals? @aso pointed out that things are differently in the code. May you, please, clarify? This would help us tremendously finding out what access policies one would need to apply in each case. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 18:16:49 GMT):<br/>
We're switching two of the queries (the chaincode-related ones) to reside in LCCC instead of QSCC.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 18:17:36 GMT):<br/>
I believe the channel-related query will reside in CSCC but I haven't started on it yet so things may change.

Hello fabric-crypto!  is this the right place to ask questions about the HSM/PKCS#11 strategy?  EG: https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/attachment/10360/mserv-TCertOptions-v3(1).md

<p><strong>MikeGardiner</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 18:56:56 GMT):<br/>
Excellent!  OK, so from what I read from jira the p11 bccsp is pushed out a bit, but focused on the #2 case in that document I linked to.  That document seems to indicate the IBM HSM is supported for #1 - (tcert generation in the hsm) but I don't see how that was accomplished.  I want to have the same support in our HSM.
</p>
<p><strong>MikeGardiner</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 18:58:16 GMT):<br/>
The other related thing, the .6 version used hmac key expansion similar to Bitcoin's BIP32 for tcert generation.  The 1.0 release uses some rerandom function, and the crypto docs I've read so far don't explicitly say what the derivation/diversification algorithm/strategy is.  So where can I get clarity?
</p>
<p><strong>MikeGardiner</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 18:59:23 GMT):<br/>
Normally I think of these diversification actions as something specific to public block chains.  This may be a question more for another group.. but what's the use case for unique Tcerts/keys in the private hyperledger world?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 19:29:08 GMT):<br/>
Hi Mike, by "unique TCerts/keys" -> do you mean "TCert-specific" keys?

<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 19:29:16 GMT):<br/>
Shouldn't `identities.proto` be in `protos/msp` rather than with the msp go files ?   I ask because the SDK builds copy everything under protos/ and will miss this 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 19:43:04 GMT):<br/>
@MikeGardiner : TCerts are mainly for unlinkability purpose. Say Bank 1 makes 2 transactions. It'll use 2 different tcert Key/Pair to sign transaction. There TCerts belong the the member making transactions as these are derived from long term cert , named EcERT , which member own. Did I answer your q ?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 19:45:09 GMT):<br/>
The rerandmization function in 1.0 is to derive another Elliptic Curve Cert from Given Elliptic Curve cert. The algorithm used is derived out from the curve that is being used.
</p>
<p><strong>MikeGardiner</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 20:37:48 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar can you point to some documentation about the rerandomization function?  I'd like to have it implemented in hardware and expose it over P11, but I also need to know it's not going to change again.  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 20:41:46 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 10:37:14 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix  I don't understand something regarding https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6543/ ( * Hash algorithms for signing and txId * ) 
In https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/peer/core.yaml#L208 it configures the peer's hash algorithm, right?
But, if this can be changed then how does the SDK know of the hash algorithm the peer uses? Isn't it a possible problem that the peer can be configured with a custom hash algorithm and the SDK isn't aware of that?
I assume we don't have a "negotiation" phase or any discovery API that tells the SDK of the peer's hash algorithm
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 11:06:36 GMT):<br/>
@RezwanKabir  - what version of fabric are you using?

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 11:22:15 GMT):<br/>
@RezwanKabir  - ok.  well for V1.0 we no longer use grpc for the `fabric-ca` component - all the APIs are http-based.   Did you build your own images or where you following http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asset_setup/ ?
</p>
<p><strong>RezwanKabir</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 11:52:32 GMT):<br/>
my bad. I am working on sfhackfest22017/fabric-ca: x86_64-0.7.0-snapshot-6294c57 right now. But in future I will use yeasy/hyperledger-fabric-ca:latest . It will be wonderful if I get the usage in both cases.

@RezwanKabir  - the NodeJS fabric-ca-client does support register and enroll functions when working with the fabric-ca .  Not sure if we have a sample yet but the APIs are available in the latest fabric-ca-client that's checked into the fabric-sdk-node repository

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 15:19:31 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm the crypto parameters (algo, hash2 vs. sha3, keysize) have always been knowledge from out-of-band sources b/w the peers/orderers and client. they are configurable on both sides (except a few cases where sha2 is always used, like generating the SKI and the txID)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 15:20:30 GMT):<br/>
CR 6543 is simply about matching the default of the app to the default of the peer and orderer
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 15:24:15 GMT):<br/>
in fact there's some more work later (but not right now) to either allow the sdk to be configured to use different parameters when signing for requests to the peers vs. orderers since on the backend they are separately configured (peer/core.yaml vs. orderer/orderer.yaml), or to enforce both peers and orderers to use a common set of params. but right now the sdk is assuming they are the same
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 15:25:25 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 6543 should be a simple one for your judgement, so if you agree with the change can you please merge it?

The images will be loaded daily at 8 am est based on a successful Function Integration Test (FIT) run for Intel, Power, System z architectures.   The images will be stored at the rameshthoomu organization until we have the Nexus v3 environment running through the linux foundation.  Also, release images will be published to the hyperledger organization in docker hub moving forward.  Currently, FIT consists of passing the Node SDK e2e test and the cli e2e test (being added right now).   The cli e2e test does not actually use an sdk or fabric-ca.  FIT will continue to be enhanced as new function and SDK's become operational.   

A message will be published in Rocket chat on fabric-ci channel with the following format:

```
rameshthoomu/fabric-orderer-x86_64:x86_64-0.7.0-snapshot-29d7fc0
rameshthoomu/fabric-peer-x86_64:x86_64-0.7.0-snapshot-29d7fc0

 fabric-sdk-node *commit# bc36ef5*

Docker images for Power and System z are also available by modifying the last component in the repository based on the desired architecture.  The above images represent the intel versions. 
intel = x86_64
power = ppc64le
Sstem z = s390x

The images are also saved with the tag of : latest.

@mastersingh24 Missed the discussion about default crypto algorithms.. and you might have noticed that it kinda.. perhaps.. maybe.. well.. me who put the SHA3 in? @adc and I were talking about this.. BCCSP should not have 'Defaults' at all.. that code needs to be cleaned up. As @JonathanLevi put it, we need a unified front. have configuration in a single place, so that (for purposes of exposition) somebody could create a fabric network with MD5... with a few yaml changes

I dont think there are that many places, we just don't manage them.
- Signature algorithm MSP is to use
- Ledger Hash for merkle tree

(now I feel like I missed a few)

</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:45:44 GMT):<br/>
that's the reason why I'm saying let's have a proper pkcs11-based bccsp and then we can see how it integrates with the fabric
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:45:54 GMT):<br/>
I don't see how one can do the other way around
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:46:52 GMT):<br/>
dont follow. bccsp is an abstract interface. its not pkcs11 that should be integrating. its fabric that is not using bccsp properly
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:47:38 GMT):<br/>
what if someone wants to create a new bccsp? there is currently no way to plug that in, which was entire point of bccsp
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:49:18 GMT):<br/>
before that, we need to remove the defaults 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:49:31 GMT):<br/>
in fact you can see already the effect of not having done that before
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:50:01 GMT):<br/>
we have in configuration something that will disappear 
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:52:08 GMT):<br/>
yeah. I am all for removing defaults.. the more bccsps we got, the more defaulting code we have to dup..
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:52:08 GMT):<br/>
yeap. I am all for removing defaults.. the more bccsps we got, the more defaulting code we have to dup..
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:53:37 GMT):<br/>
that can probably fall under making the algorithms names follow a convention like OIDs..
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:53:49 GMT):<br/>
all in one swoop
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:54:12 GMT):<br/>
when the pkcs11-based bccsp will be available?
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:54:39 GMT):<br/>
you mean when it will be finished? its available now, does only ecdsa..
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:54:39 GMT):<br/>
you mean when it will be finished? its available now, does only ecdsa through pkcs11..
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:55:16 GMT):<br/>
the full implementation
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:55:54 GMT):<br/>
like I said, not until the fabric uses bccsp
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:56:16 GMT):<br/>
why?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:56:48 GMT):<br/>
can you also point to places where the fabric is not using bccsp?
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:57:32 GMT):<br/>
I need to be able to switch bccsps to test pkcs11 code
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:57:43 GMT):<br/>
not at all
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:57:50 GMT):<br/>
you need first to test pkcs11 alove
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:57:50 GMT):<br/>
you need first to test pkcs11 alone
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:57:59 GMT):<br/>
and then we do the integration
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:00:06 GMT):<br/>
there are only a few places that @binhn has included in a jira item for us to take care of when polishing the code
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:00:20 GMT):<br/>
there is a reason to do integration now, while we havent arrived to v1.0, the integration task is huge (just look at my last couple of changes..). it affects all components on fabric. pkcs11 code change is small and easy to contain
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:00:21 GMT):<br/>
But most parts relate to TLS / X509 related management
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:00:56 GMT):<br/>
let's do first the easy tasks
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:01:17 GMT):<br/>
we pushed a lot of config that will now be removed 
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:01:30 GMT):<br/>
I did that in 0.6 and by the time I tried to commit, it was locked down
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:01:41 GMT):<br/>
nope, the config all stayed
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:01:51 GMT):<br/>
the has family and security level
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:01:53 GMT):<br/>
needs to go
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:01:55 GMT):<br/>
I just changed the fileks implementation
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:02:15 GMT):<br/>
yep, the security level has to go, most definetelly
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:02:24 GMT):<br/>
also hash family
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:02:26 GMT):<br/>
locking ourself to nist curves doesnt seem portable..
</p>

@Nishi Ah, in our previous conversation you referred to certs "to register on the network", which implies a connection to MSPs, which is why I referred you here. As the question stands now, I see that the focus is on Kafka brokers. The answer is that for your end-to-end tests you do _not_ need certs for the Kafka cluster.

If you wanted to try that, you would configure your ordering node by editing this file: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/orderer/orderer.yaml#L133 (and following the instructions here: https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-security-authorization-authentication-encryption/ for both your client --which is the orderer in this case-- and the Kafka brokers).

@aso @adc @elli-androulaki @mastersingh24 @JonathanLevi sorry for the spam, but I'm hitting the following error when submitting an install proposal (or any proposal):
```Error: The creator certificate is not valid, err The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "x509: ECDSA verification failure" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "peerOrg0")```
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 04:51:12 GMT):<br/>
I used the crypto materials generated from bdd (sent by @muralisr) to start the fabric-ca (setting --ca.certfile to ca/peerOrg0_cert.pem, --ca.keyfile to ca/peerOrg0_pk.pem), orderer and peers. so when I enroll with fabric-ca, it should have been signed with the private key in peerOrg0_pk.pem

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 04:51:40 GMT):<br/>

@adc that timestamp is misleading, i think docker has a time skew that doesn't match the host and this has always been the case with ecerts signed by fabric-ca docker

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 12:57:26 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 indeed they are not the same, trying to cp the cert from ca to peer...
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 13:04:56 GMT):<br/>
now am getting this when running configtxgen to create orderer's genesis block:
```Setting up the MSP manager failed, err CA Certificate did not have the Subject Key Identifier extension, (SN: 1000)```
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 13:05:34 GMT):<br/>
the ca certs in the "ca" folder indeed do not have the extension
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 13:14:05 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 do you have a more coherent set of crypto materials that i can use for sdk tests? it seems the ones being floated around don't have the proper ca certs i can use with fabric-ca. for applications the node sdk does have the ability to load ecerts from file so we can cut the fabric-ca out of the loop to make this work, but i also need a set up that has fabric-ca involved
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 13:15:23 GMT):<br/>
basically what's missing are the private keys for the cacerts inside the peer orgs 'cacerts' folder

@jimthematrix   - just posted an update to https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6635/   - hopefully you can use this tool to create artifacts you can use with fabric and fabric-ca.  The CR has details on what it generates, etc, so if you like please give it a try

The `cryptogen` tool looks really nice.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 19:35:12 GMT):<br/>
What I am looking for now is a simple doc that explains how all of these certificates and private keys are used.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 19:35:23 GMT):<br/>
We've solved the problem of creating keys and certs, now the next questions that come to my mind are: what does every dir in there stand for, and how is it used by the system (a mid-level view of things).
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 19:35:27 GMT):<br/>
I will repeat my offer to write this document up if someone's willing to guide me through it.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 19:44:39 GMT):<br/>
i was disrupted but was finally able to run through the test:
- use 6635 cryptogen to generate a 2 peer org 4 peers 1 orderer org set
- generate orderer block
- generate channel config template
- using sdk send config template to orderer to create channel
- download the config block from orderer and send to peer to join
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 19:45:07 GMT):<br/>
on that last step I'm getting the following error:
```Error: The creator certificate is not valid, err The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority```
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 19:45:07 GMT):<br/>
on that last step I'm getting the following error:

<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 20:32:39 GMT):<br/>

thx @ashutosh_kumar  - it's a little tricky dealing with that stuff because it seems to me I could not set a keystore to different value due to the way the default bccsp gets loaded.  I supposed I could try switching the options, but for now it seems to work  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:46:46 GMT):<br/>
so to validate my understanding of how the MSP works at various stages:
- create channel: the orderer uses the msp from the system chain's config block to validate cert, so any existing orgs can create channel
- join channel: the target peer uses the local MSP to validate, so each app can only request peers in their own org to join
- install chaincode: it looks like the peer actually uses the local msp to validate this call, so each app can only install chaincode to peers in their own org
- instantiate chaincode: peer uses the chain's msp (from the config block) to validate, so any participating org can request an instantiate
- invoke, query: same as instantiate
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:47:09 GMT):<br/>
@aso @adc @elli-androulaki @mastersingh24 ^^^ ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:51:36 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix  - I believe that is correct.    join and install are basically "local" calls to the peer and as such the peer's local MSP is checked.   instantiate,invoke,query are "channel" scoped - so the MSPs in the genesis/latest config block for the channel are used.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:52:07 GMT):<br/>
yep that matches my understanding of the reason as well
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 21:52:18 GMT):<br/>
for create channel, it would be orgs that are part of the orderer set
</p>

@mastersingh24 I was talking to @jimthematrix and @smithbk today about key generation and key stores. BCCSP abstracts keystores away from us. using SW Filebased keystore directly works as a shortcut for now, but can I use your tool to generate keys with any arbitrary BCCSP?

<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 00:12:09 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 configuration stuff that we were talking on crypto channel earlier..
we need a field in MSPConfig/genesis block I think to specify which algorithm each MSP (local/verifying) is using
that way we can also mix different signing algorithms..
I might choose to use SHA3-384-P256-ECDSA.. somebody else on the same network SHA2-256-P224-ECDSA..
(perhaps that already exists)
and bccsp takes its cues from that spec
same for channel create I suspect.. needs to specify the HASH of the chain
goal: bccsp has no defaults
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 00:23:42 GMT):<br/>
@vpaprots  - I intentionally went down the bccsp route for just this purpose - of course for simplicity I just use basic defaults, etc, but in theory should be able to make things configurable
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 00:25:18 GMT):<br/>
I think @adc and I would be happier to not have concept of defaults at all inside BCCSP. It should come from outside.. i.e. based on what cert you got, bccsp defaults might make no sense
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 00:25:57 GMT):<br/>

One other nice feature to have is the server should broadcast its capability to the client , so that client can choose from there and Server crypto to be configurable to allow only certain security primitives to be allowed. Second requirement has real life use cases.

@ashutosh_kumar that ssl-style agreement gonna get difficult fast.. they got two parties to agree and look how hard its just for two parties.. adding a few new algorithm names requires a whole new TLS spec! yikes.. 
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 05:28:53 GMT):<br/>
but perhaps something can be done at application side, the one that needs to create the genesis block.. 
</p>
<p><strong>vpaprots</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 05:31:36 GMT):<br/>
Clearly all the signatures specified by genesis block (assuming I get my config request ;) ) are to be supported by everyone on the channel. the specification on just how two orgs are to agree on this set of MSPs is currently 'out of band' but will be needed by everyone..

Hi @jimthematrix : So, 
> - create channel: the orderer uses the msp from the system chain's config block to validate cert, so any existing orgs can create channel
I believe there is to be a dedicated policy for channel creators in (orderer) system channel; but @jyellick to confirm
> - join channel: the target peer uses the local MSP to validate, so each app can only request peers in their own org to join
I would say authenticating the join channel requests against local msp admin would make sense.
> - install chaincode: it looks like the peer actually uses the local msp to validate this call, so each app can only install chaincode to peers in their own 
Correct and same as join channel
> - instantiate chaincode: peer uses the chain's msp (from the config block) to validate, so any participating org can request an instantiate
There would be a chaincodeAdmins policy that the genesis of the chain should include and chaincode instantiation requests would need to run against The one we would recommend I believe is the list of participant org admins. 
> - invoke, query: same as instantiate 
This one is restricted to the writers of the chain, that is any member of the participant orgs.

Isn't it being done now? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 08:37:43 GMT):<br/>
And why is `Query` restricted to writers? Don't we have readers?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 08:38:52 GMT):<br/>
So, we cannot distinguish invokes from queries at the moment
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 08:39:54 GMT):<br/>
ah right because they are both "endorsements"?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 08:42:55 GMT):<br/>
we cannot distinguish whether a call aims to also have writes but only after the execution has been completed
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 08:42:55 GMT):<br/>
we cannot distinguish whether a proposal aims to also have writes but only after the execution has been completed
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 08:43:06 GMT):<br/>
(the simulation of the execution)
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 08:45:41 GMT):<br/>
Which would on one hand offer this fine-grained access management and allow readers to query, but to some extend (not entirely) defeats the purpose of doing the access check up front to avoid doing unnecessary simulations. 
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 08:46:07 GMT):<br/>
Also i believe that strong queries could need to go through the blockchain, which means write access to the chain for the queriers would be needed.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 08:51:55 GMT):<br/>

What do you mean by "strong queries"? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 08:52:51 GMT):<br/>
And I don't understand why can't a request be tagged with whether it's a write or only a read and then it can fail the simulation if it tries to mutate the state and tagged as a read?

[I'm fine with saying that we don't have "secret" embedded defaults for bccsp and that we require explicit configuration.   That being said, we are absolutely crazy if we think we can support doing this via MSPs at this point.  We can explicitly configure bccsp parameters within the various "*.yaml" config files (e.g. core.yaml, orderer.yaml and the fabric-ca yaml files.  Might be better to actually have a separate config file for this so we could just reference it and share it with the various components.  We should agree on the default settings (e.g. EC, ECDSA, p256, SHA256 or whatever )](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=pD6JsMbbPFP48QaGi) @vpaprots 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 12:35:11 GMT):<br/>
I DO NOT support trying to do "per channel" settings for crypto at this point and don't deem it necessary for v1.0.  As a matter of fact, doing so will make things even harder than they are currently

@mastersingh24 "we are absolutely crazy if we think we can support doing this wia MSPs at this point". At no point I brought up schedule of when this will go in. Thats your decision. I am trying to point out a whole in our design. We have magically set {EC_ECDSA_p256_SHA256} all over the place. Usually hardcoded. Trying to change any of those defaults breaks in unexpected ways as @binhn found. Do we ever intend to allow people to use p384? SHA3? anything else at all? How will multiple algorithms co-exist?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 02 Mar 2017 13:19:19 GMT):<br/>
we should clearly externalize the settings into config

Earlier we have been using hyperledger fabric v0.5 and v0.6 with vagrant and successfully developed various sample applications. Now we want to switch to v1.0. Though we are following the steps given on "http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-setup/devenv.html", but somehow we are facing issues while setting up development environment. Is membersrvc.yaml file replaced with fabric-cop? Thanks in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:07:00 GMT):<br/>
@SyneBlockChainTeam it's now called "fabric-ca". It's a cfssl-based CA which issues certificates to registered users. Then this certificate can be used for chaincode deployment/invocation, and fabric will validate the identity based on what CAs it trusts defined in the MSP config.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:07:51 GMT):<br/>
you can get fabric-ca here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca, you can read about MSPs here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qg7ZEccOIsrShSHSNl4kBHOFvLYRhQ3903srJ6c_AZE/edit#

<p><strong>tsnyder</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 14:30:52 GMT):<br/>
Question regarding CRL usage within the Peer and Fabric SDK (Java) - In a meeting last week it was mentioned (Gari I believe) that the CRL's would need to be placed in each channel / Ledger. And that if it was there the Peer and SDK code would validate against the CRL. Is there any documentation on how this works, what type of transaction (CONFIG?), and what key(s) they need to be associated with?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 15:29:47 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 ^^ see Tim's questions Gari
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 18:54:58 GMT):<br/>
@tsnyder  - from a pure format perspective, we would expect and X509 Certificate Revocation list and it should be the full list of revoked certificates each time (e.g. we don't do delta updates).

channel config transactions are a bit complicated to draw out, but essentially within each channel you'll have the "orgs" which belong to that channel defined and each of those will have a MSP config structure associated with it  (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/protos/msp/mspconfig.proto#L70)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 18:56:08 GMT):<br/>
you case might be a little trickier in that you actually have the same root issuer for all orgs differentiated by OU.  So in that case, we could either use the same CRL to update each org in the channel or just have separate CRLs for each org
</p>
<p><strong>tsnyder</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 14:10:29 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 - So from the above and a review of the MSP config structure the takeaway is the if the CRL list changes for the parties associated with a channel, then the MSP structure attribute FabricMSPConfig.revocationList needs to be updated on that channel. I presume this is a CONFIG transaction but am not sure how it would be generated or rather the process to update it. Is there example code we wold follow (maybe a test case)? An additional aspect is how would the Java Fabric SDK obtain this and use it? It could be obtained via eventing but not sure what we would need to do from there. Can you delegate to someone who understands both sides?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 14:40:32 GMT):<br/>
`I presume this is a CONFIG transaction but am not sure how it would be generated or rather the process to update it`
Currently, the only human understandable way to do this would be to use the configtx tool (located in the common/configtx package - I believe you are already using this tool to generate the blob that is used as input for create channel).   The SDKs currently only take the output of the configtx tool as the input to createChannel (I don't think any of the SDKs have implemented updateChannel at this point).   But basically at this point there is really no easy way to update the configuration of a channel.  The core functionality to actually perform the update exists in the ordering service, but we don't yet have the end user APIs / tools to be able to do this yet
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 14:41:09 GMT):<br/>
All of this information ends up serialized in the genesis and/or latest config block for each channel.  
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 14:42:02 GMT):<br/>
The SDKs can actually query a channel and get the latest config block for any given channel which will have all of the channel information embedded in it.  Not sure if this is in the Java SDK yet, but it will be.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 14:43:04 GMT):<br/>
NET-NET - we have the machinery in place to do this, but updating a channel is not ready for prime time from a consumability perspective.   (first we need to make sure you can actually configure / create a channel ;) )

Could peer0's certificate be signed by both root CAs (or intermediate CAs) in org1 and org2?
One organization should be all banks(bank1 bank2 bank……) or mixed business parties(bank1, corp1, corp2), or both ok?
One root CA (or intermediate CA) should be only bind with one orgnization or can cross multi orgnization?
</p>
<p><strong>guhaihua</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 05:39:28 GMT):<br/>
From the point of cryptographic standards, I think peer0's certificate can't be signed by both CAs.

Hello,
I have basic knowledge of PKI. Can anybody confirm if my understanding is correct? When a single peer with ca is started, the peer generates it key pair and registers it public key to the certificate. So whoever need to send this peer a message they sign it with the public key(they acquire the public key from CA). For checking that the peer is legitimate, it checks the ACA. These ecerts and tcerts will be only given to client and not the peer(Is it correct?) Are ecerts and tcerts like public key used to sign transcations? If somebody captures these ecert and tcert while giving it client, is the client compromised?

No, it will not be compromised because you sign message using private key and verify using public key (Ecert, Tcert). So if you keep private key private you can even print your Ecert on fliers and give it to random peoples and nobady will be able to sign a message. They will be able to verify that some message is signed with this certificate private key, but only this. And yes, they can get data stored in Ecert like enrollment ID

@rickr  - so you want to have the SDK tests use different users with different MSPIDs?   This is all going to start with generating the right config for a channel so that it contains multiple organzations (each with their own different MSPID).  You might want to ping @jimthematrix  because he has a nice set of artifacts for this 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 10:55:23 GMT):<br/>
Last I looked the Node SDK does use mullit orgs  but using a single user for all interaction. So unless each org was defined to use the same  user with same MSPID I don't catch the connection.  I didn't even think the organization of Peer/Order definitions were tied (bound) to local  users MSPID/Org . I thought the only requirement was a trusted root signing authority

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 11:18:42 GMT):<br/>
in order for things to work, the peers must be aware of multiple MSPs.  The only way they get that information is via joining channels (via the genesis/config blocks).  So you'd need to use configtxgen to actually create channels which have multiple orgs (each with it's own MSP) in them.  You'd then also need to generate users for each of those MSPs.  
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 11:19:16 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 12:26:40 GMT):<br/>
if you look closely you see that:
- the admin in Org1 did the create channel
- admin of Org1 joins peer0 and peer1 in Org1
- admin of Org2 joins peer2 and peer3 in Org2
- admin of Org1 installs chaincode in peer0 and peer1 in org1
- admin of Org2 installs chaincode in peer2 and peer3 in org2
- admin of Org1 instantiates the chaincode for the new channel
- admin of Org2 invokes a transaction in the channel
- admin of Org1 queries for information in the channel

Great!,  Is the MSPID  of all the users  still something that is only known by each user through _out of band_ means?  Can you _divulge_ how the Fabric matches  each user independent  MSPID/Cert  ?

We definitely has plans for TCerts. Encryption is kind of tricky topic. For attributes that you want to pass along in TCert , those are encrypted using symmetric key , we support TLS for link encryption and data encryption responsibility lies with application.
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 00:51:35 GMT):<br/>
there is no at-rest encryption right?

Hi - not sure if this is the correct place to ask this, but how can a peer be configured to use a different MSP at the moment? Or is it hardcoded to use the Fabric MSP under the fabric/msp dir for now?

hi gang,  I'm getting this error `Extensions not allowed in v2 certificate`  when loading cert from the genesis block from the e2e scenario ?
</p>
<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:21:45 GMT):<br/>
I looked at some of the certs and there is one with this : ``` openssl x509 -text -noout -in peerOrg1.pem 
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 4 (0x3)
        Serial Number: 1000 (0x3e8)
        Signature Algorithm: ecdsa-with-SHA256
        Issuer: CN=peerOrg1

If i generate the genesis block and the channel configuration transaction with profile: SampleInsecureSolo in configtx.yaml, i don't need any MSP certificates right?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 11:19:23 GMT):<br/>
@Rymd  - installing chaincode on the peer is actually orthogonal to joining channels.  when you install chaincode on a peer, the peer checks to make sure that the submitter of the install command / API belongs to the same MSP as the peer (the local MSP for the peer)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 11:19:35 GMT):<br/>
how are you installing the chaincode?  from the CLI?
</p>
<p><strong>Rymd</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 11:21:58 GMT):<br/>
yea
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 11:35:19 GMT):<br/>
if you are using the CLI and the default peer setup, this should just work
</p>
<p><strong>Rymd</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 12:41:37 GMT):<br/>
it does work if i use the channel: testchainid, but if i use my generated channel with `peer channel create -o $ORDERER_IP:7050 -c mychannel0 -f crypto/orderer/channel0.tx` but when i try to join now i get `Tried joining channel mychannel0 but our org( DEFAULT ), isn't among the orgs of the channel: [] , aborting.`

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 14:02:41 GMT):<br/>
That's a gossip logging, isn't it?
It says that the list of channel members it got from the genesis block is an empty list
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 14:03:06 GMT):<br/>
So it detects a "bad configuration" and decides to ignore the channel joining. 
</p>
<p><strong>Rymd</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 14:49:22 GMT):<br/>
Is there any guide to setup your own network configuration and how the MSP and configtx are involved?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 15:29:04 GMT):<br/>
What is the MSP-id in the peer/core.yaml or if you're using docker then in the dokcer-compose file?
</p>
<p><strong>Rymd</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 16:45:05 GMT):<br/>
if i define my org in configtx, what do i set as MSPDir? can i use the sample config?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 16:51:59 GMT):<br/>
You need to set your MSP as it was in the configtx...

So I'm trying to run fabric-ca-server using p11.. after correcting the yaml file to be "csp" rather than "crypto"  and changing "software" to "pkcs11" then adding the p11 stuff.. I get an error:   Hash Family not supported [] while initializing the BCCSP PKCS11.  SHA2 seems like it should be the valid option for hash_family.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:56:38 GMT):<br/>
@AbhilekhSingh  - if GetCreator is returning the same value, then you are definitely calling the chaincode using the same user
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:56:56 GMT):<br/>
how exactly are you calling / invoking the chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:57:15 GMT):<br/>
   peer chaincode invoke -o orderer0:7050  --tls true --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/orderer/localMspConfig/cacerts/ordererOrg0.pem -C mychannel -n $CODEID -c '{"Args":["addSigner", "boardAdmin", "sudh"]}'

</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:57:20 GMT):<br/>
That I got it
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:57:48 GMT):<br/>
but from which folder it taking the certificate and which one it's taking it
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:58:09 GMT):<br/>
are you in the CLI container?
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:58:12 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:58:46 GMT):<br/>
I enrolled the user from CA which stores the certificate in msp folder
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:59:01 GMT):<br/>
the I figured out /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp which has certs 
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:59:12 GMT):<br/>
but replacing this certs also didn't help
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:59:31 GMT):<br/>
Also the cert I got in GetCreator() I don't see it in a filesystem
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:59:58 GMT):<br/>
is It dynamically generating in e2e_cli example?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:00:43 GMT):<br/>
you need to set the  `CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH` environment variable -   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/scripts/script.sh#L23
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:01:15 GMT):<br/>
thanks let me try that
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:01:24 GMT):<br/>
that's the "identity" the peer cli will use to sign transactions
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:01:39 GMT):<br/>
but this is Peer certs 
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:01:48 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:02:32 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:02:40 GMT):<br/>
CA server
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:02:51 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:03:26 GMT):<br/>
ok - and you have access to those from the CLI container?
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:03:33 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:04:05 GMT):<br/>
CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH will be different if I run transaction on different peer
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:04:16 GMT):<br/>
it should be same
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:05:27 GMT):<br/>
`peer chaincode invoke ...` is using the peer cli as a client.  When run in this mode, it still gets its identity from `CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH`
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:06:03 GMT):<br/>
which needs to point to a folder with the same structure as the peer MSP folders
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:06:41 GMT):<br/>
Let me try out changing it

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:07:33 GMT):<br/>
you can actually generate this structure with the fabric-ca-client as well:

```
fabric-ca-client enroll --config /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/fabric-ca-server-config.yaml -u http://admin:adminpw@localhost:7054 -M ${pick some directory}
```
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:08:20 GMT):<br/>
if you add the -M option to the fabric-ca-client, it will create an MSP folder structure which you can then point to with CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:10:23 GMT):<br/>
yes that's what I tried
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:10:40 GMT):<br/>
but didn't know that it's using it's own cert for transaction
</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:11:50 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:12:04 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>AbhilekhSingh</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:19:54 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 yes CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH is the one I had to change. Thanks a lot

hi everybody, is it true that v 0.6 does not support security and certificates . and in this case how can i decrypt the blocks of my blockchain to display the history of transactions done in my network

Also gossip between peers seems to be failing because client TLS certificates are not being sent.

Is the skip handshake flag on?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 21:41:14 GMT):<br/>
wait, @passkit  that's not because the client isn't sending certificate, but rather because the server isn't sending. 7051 is a server port
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 21:42:11 GMT):<br/>
the TLS isn't configured correctly and the server-side peer from some reason doesn't have the certificate.

<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 01:51:34 GMT):<br/>
Makes sense - had to turn off TLS on the orderer temporarily to be able to use the CLI.  Peer TLS seems to still need some work outside of the node function - and also for consistency across commands.  Seems strange to have to specify explicitly in a flag for channel and chaincode, but utilise code.yaml and environment variables elsewhere.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:31:55 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm - which certificates are used as TLS client certificates?  Peers act as both servers and clients, but the config files, environment variables and command line do not have any options to specify client certs.  I had previously assumed that the MSP certs would be used to identify the client.  If that was the case, I would not expect to see issues with peer to peer over TLS.  What am I missing?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:33:43 GMT):<br/>
@passkit I think there is no mutual auth between peers so far
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:34:53 GMT):<br/>

</p>

This is from my peer log, trying to connect to one of the other anchor peers over TLS
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:35:35 GMT):<br/>
If there is no mutual auth - how to configure around this?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:35:35 GMT):<br/>
take a look at `core/peer/config.go` line 183 `GetSecureConfig`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:35:57 GMT):<br/>
again- the error you see doesn't stem from the lack of mutual auth.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:41:01 GMT):<br/>
`peer.tls.key.file` refers to a Server key.  But a should a peer connecting to another peer not use a Client key?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:41:58 GMT):<br/>
From what I know- there is no use of mutual auth just yet.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:44:20 GMT):<br/>
I just want to run everything over TLS - I'm not specifically looking for mutual auth, but it seems to be being enforced and I cannot see how o disable it/
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:45:34 GMT):<br/>
It is not enforced.
Can you take a look at `examples/e2e_cli/docker-compose.yml` ?

</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 11:44:52 GMT):<br/>
With that set I get:
`NewDeliverService -> ERRO 34c Cannot dial to orderer:7050, because of grpc: timed out when dialing`
on the peer, and
` grpc: Server.Serve failed to complete security handshake from "172.17.0.1:53494": tls: client didn't provide a certificate` 
on the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 11:52:39 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Seems as if the orderer is still expecting a handshake. Was the `ORDERER_GOSSIP_IGNORE_SECURITY` (deprecated in fe8c021bd) the orderer equivalent of `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_SKIPHANDSHAKE`
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 12:22:49 GMT):<br/>
unless you have https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/orderer/orderer.yaml#L31   set to true, client certs should not be required
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 16:00:33 GMT):<br/>
I think you mean set to false.  My config was set to true.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 16:51:23 GMT):<br/>
Confirmed all working if `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_SKIPHANDSHAKE=true` is set and `ORDERER_GOSSIP_TLS_CLIENTAUTHENABLED=false`.  To ease the pain on others, may be worthwhile removing the clientauthenabled paramater from orderer.yaml (or at least commenting as unsupported) and maybe flipping the default of CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_SKIPHANDSHAKE to true until such time as client is available.

@o.o. in my setup, I used cryptogen to generate the certs and then took the peer CA cert&key and used it in the fabric-ca-server
</p>
<p><strong>o.o.</strong> (Fri, 31 Mar 2017 16:08:08 GMT):<br/>
Ok; so you need to move them there also. I'll let him know!
I assume you had _volumes_ move them and some _environment_ variable set the home to find them then; as set up in a docker-compose.yml.
And perhaps _--ca.certfile/keyfile_ as arguments to the fabric-ca-server start command.
Thanks Vadim!

Hi - Does Fabric provide any way of encrypting/securing the content stored in the ledger/world state?

The case I'm interested in is that if Peer A is part of Chain A and Chain B, it is storing the ledger and world state of both chains in the same database, just different directories (in the case of LevelDB). If an application on Chain A is storing confidential information in the chain, is there any built-in way to secure/encrypt the data so that there is more security than just "the data is in a different directory".
 
From the docs I've read, I don't see something like this. If that is the case, then one solution would be that the application should encrypt the data before writing it to the chain. However, the chaincode may need to decrypt the data in order to perform some business logic. If that is the case, then does Fabric provide some key management that is available to both the application and the chaincode where they could retrieve keys for encrypting/decrypting confidential data. Or are there plans for such a key management feature for the future.

@Vadim Thanks for the reply. I've already read that doc, and that was the one I was referring to. It mentions that _"Third, you can hash or encrypt the data before calling chaincode. [...]. If you encrypt the data then you will need a way to share the decryption keys outside of fabric. "_ Are there any plans to provide a service to share these keys? Or maybe some recommendations on how this should work (maybe using the existing MSP or something) 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 04 Apr 2017 14:32:05 GMT):<br/>
@farhan3 so far you just store it outside of fabric, whether anything is planned to store it securely in the fabric, I don't know

Greetings everyone. My name is João Sousa, a phD student from the university of Lisbon. I am developing a new consenter type based on the BFT-SMaRt java library. This consenter will need to have their consensus nodes written in java. I am already at a stage where I supply the rest of the golang codebase with a signed block generated at those nodes, using Bouncy Castle to generate that signature.  However, I am unable to make the rest of the golang codebase to sucessfully verify the signature that was produced in java.
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 15:55:03 GMT):<br/>
The code I am using to generate the signatures is something like this: '''Signature signEngine = Signature.getInstance("ECDSA", BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME);
        signEngine.initSign(privKey);
        signEngine.update(text);
        return signEngine.sign()'''
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 15:55:37 GMT):<br/>
while the code I use to verify the signatures is something lie:
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 15:56:23 GMT):<br/>
des := mspmgmt.GetIdentityDeserializer("")
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 15:56:44 GMT):<br/>
ident, err := des.DeserializeIdentity(sigHeader.Creator)
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 15:57:07 GMT):<br/>
err = ident.Verify(bytes, sig.Signature)
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 15:58:06 GMT):<br/>
I also tryed to verify the signature by directly invoking golang's native ecdsa functions, but the results were the same

Hi @snakejerusalem  - Welcome to the project.  I'd suggest you take a look at the Java SDK - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java - and/or post to the #fabric-sdk-java channel as the Java SDK is currently able to provide valid signatures for Fabric peers / orderers.  
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:47:51 GMT):<br/>
Is your code posted anywhere yet?
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:48:55 GMT):<br/>
Hi there @mastersingh24 . Nop, I didn't post it anywhere yet because I didn't start to conduct performance tests yet
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:57:41 GMT):<br/>
one quick thing to check, what curve are you using and what signing algorithm?   I believe the default for Fabric is SHA256 with a p256 curve.  So you might need to change `Signature.getInstance("ECDSA", BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME)` to `Signature.getInstance("SHA256withECDSA", BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME)` and make sure that you generated a p256 key , e.g.  

```
KeyPairGenerator g = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("EC");
ECGenParameterSpec kpgparams = new ECGenParameterSpec("secp256r1");
g.initialize(kpgparams);
KeyPair pair = g.generateKeyPair()
```
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:58:57 GMT):<br/>
Even though I wasn't explicitly setting the signature engine to use sha256, I was passing the plaintext already has a sha256 digest
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:59:55 GMT):<br/>
As for the curve, I am not generating any keypair; I am using the keys that already come with fabric, for the DEFAULT MSPID
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:00:55 GMT):<br/>
I am also making sure that I am serializing everything the same way fabric does
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:02:00 GMT):<br/>
could it be due to how I initialize the Signature engine?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:15:10 GMT):<br/>
`Even though I wasn't explicitly setting the signature engine to use sha256, I was passing the plaintext already has a sha256 digest`  - I am pretty sure you don't want to do that because I believe that the combination of update/sign actually hashes whatever you pass to the update function
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:23:06 GMT):<br/>
hmmm
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:23:39 GMT):<br/>
I will try them to change it to the way it is usually done with sha256withecdsa
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:35:25 GMT):<br/>
oh boy, you were correct. Once I changed `Signature.getInstance("ECDSA", BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME)` to `Signature.getInstance("SHA256withECDSA", BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME)` it solved a lot of problems
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:35:48 GMT):<br/>
however, I still have one last little problem
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:36:20 GMT):<br/>
for some signatures, I get this error: Could not determine the validity of the signature, err Invalid S. Must be smaller than half the order [88928327662531495998636124320422696545791494049447600416237270171581801383589][57896044605178124381348723474703786764998477612067880171211129530534256022184].
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:36:54 GMT):<br/>
From what I can tell, this is a verification done by the fabric codebase, not the golang native code
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:37:51 GMT):<br/>
should I just import the cryptosuite available in the java sdk, or should I add one more minor tweek isntead?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:48:18 GMT):<br/>
ah - right - this was for ECDSA signature malleability

<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:59:48 GMT):<br/>
it worked perfectly!

<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:02:28 GMT):<br/>
Not directly. It is my phD advisor, Professor Alysson Bessani, who collaborates mostly with Marko.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:03:03 GMT):<br/>
Ah - so they collaborate and you do the work  ;)

</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:06:04 GMT):<br/>
I dont' really feel that wise at the moment, given that I was missing something pretty obvious with that parameters in the signature engine
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:06:47 GMT):<br/>
I did stumble upon many examples that used sha256withECDSA, but it didnt' occur to me that it could be the problem
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:06:54 GMT):<br/>
isntead I was trying to check everythng else
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:07:02 GMT):<br/>
XD
</p>
<p><strong>snakejerusalem</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:57:17 GMT):<br/>
eh, I just noticed that the java sdk already comes with the protobuf data structures. I can ditch the ones I compiled myself from the golang code and use those instead
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:13:49 GMT):<br/>
I have MSP certs and MSP/BCCSP configuration settings and I want to end up with an object that implements `msp.SigningIdentity`. How would I go about doing this?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:13:55 GMT):<br/>
I thought I could use `msp.GetVerifyingMspConfig()` to get an `msp.MSPConfig` object,  then`msp.NewBccspMsp()` to get an `MSP` object, then run the `Setup(mspConfigObject) on it. But that wouldn't work cause cause the `GetVerifyingMspConfig()` call sets the `SigningIdentity` field of the `msp.FabricMSPConfig` object to nil.

</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:03:04 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Hm, this seems to be identical to the steps outlined above, and thus suffers from the same issue no?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:03:09 GMT):<br/>
(Namely that you don't end up with a `SigningIdentity`.)
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:03:18 GMT):<br/>
If you extend that test with:
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:03:26 GMT):<br/>
```_, err = testMSP.GetDefaultSigningIdentity()
	assert.NoError(t, err, "Error getting default signing identity")```
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:03:26 GMT):<br/>
```_, err = testMSP.GetDefaultSigningIdentity()
assert.NoError(t, err, "Error getting default signing identity")```
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:03:48 GMT):<br/>
You'll get:
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:03:51 GMT):<br/>
```--- FAIL: TestGenerateVerifyingMSP (0.02s)
        Error Trace:    msp_test.go:99

</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:04:21 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps I'm missing something though?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:06:21 GMT):<br/>
@kostas  - Looks like you changed the code in the TestGenerateVerifyingMSP rather than TestGenerateLocalMSP
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:06:34 GMT):<br/>
Arghhh
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:06:36 GMT):<br/>
or maybe I am missing something - you'll never be able to sign with a verifying MSP
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:06:52 GMT):<br/>
Well, that's embarassing
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:06:58 GMT):<br/>
Let me retry that
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:07:17 GMT):<br/>
not as embarrassing as it was when I suffered this same experience  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:07:28 GMT):<br/>
that's how I ended up with two test functions  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:07:54 GMT):<br/>
I hope it works - I think I used to have that in there at one point
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:08:24 GMT):<br/>
Oh nice, it works. Thanks Gari. Will study how you did it now.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:11:45 GMT):<br/>
Alright, so for everyone wondering the key is in calling `GetLocalMspConfig` versus `GetVerifyingMspConfig`. Seems obvious in hindsight.

Hi, I have a question on what you think needs to be included in v1 regarding support for endorsement policies that allow for OU-based endorser classification:

 a) Option 1: no support for classification of identities w.r.t. OU using MSP principals in v1 (guide people through setting up a separate MSP , e.g., different intermediate CA per otherwise defined as OU).

 b) Option 2: extend the MSP definition to allow for inclusion of OUs (FAB-2400)

 c) Option 3: extend the endorsement policy language to be able to recognise and trigger the creation of OU-based policies (the rest is already there). However this is not recommended in cases where organisation-scoped gossip messages should not be allowed to be propagated via gossip among peers of different OUs. 

Adding @mastersingh24 , @smithbk , @binhn, @jimthematrix  .  
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 17:41:36 GMT):<br/>
BTW: Is there an a time estimate for FAB-2400 ?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 17:41:36 GMT):<br/>
BTW: Is there a time estimate for FAB-2400 ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 18:12:11 GMT):<br/>
FAB-2400 has always been my opinion of what people want  and makes things more consumable in terms of being able to use a single CA
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 18:12:28 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki IIUC, option 2 would be used with a single OU in each MSP, thus allowing gossip to restrict routing to a group of MSPs/OUs.  
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 18:12:44 GMT):<br/>
option 2 works
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 23:39:17 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki : Sorry , I am kind of behind in my understanding. So , you are going to retrieve OU from Certificate , compute certchain and compare it against the hashed chain value in the validation process ?

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 13:09:37 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki so with option 2 the MSPs configured with OUs will need additional fields to identity, instead of the simple "mspid" that's been used everywhere so far right? the impact of this seems to be far reaching, basically anywhere "mspid" is used right now, for instance the endorsement policy.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 13:16:04 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix, OUs is already included as part of the X.509 cert structure.
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 13:37:16 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki IIUC, option 2 simply adds another condition to the validation of a signature.  In addition to checking the cert chain with root and intermediate certs of the MSP, it also checks that one of the cert's subject OU entries is also one of the OU entries of the MSP.  If there are no OU entries in the MSP, then there is no change and is sort of a wild-card OU match.  If there is one OU entry, then only certs with that OU match.  Elli, is this correct?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 14:00:14 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki to use an example to illustrate my question, when the app submits a transaction it needs to specify the mspid as part of the Creator field in the proposal, is that mspid still the simple org ID (an arbitrary name decided for that org's msp) or should it use the OU value, or a combination of mspid (for the top org) + OU (sub org)? based on your explanation it seems just the simple "mspid" is enough because the issuer value in the client cert will be inspected and expected to match the target MSP's OU?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 14:04:02 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk is it the OU portion of the cert's own DN or the cert's Issuer?
</p>

Got directed here.

Does the sending user have some keys corresponding to the creator certificate that could be used for signing the proposal is what I'm asking I guess?

Correct. Indeed, the MSP-id is still the simple org ID chosen for that org's msp.

<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 15:50:06 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki , based on your explanation for issuer OU , looks like the design is forcing to have another in-house CA for each OU whose certs are being signed by some intermediate CA , like Verisign. Did it sound right ? 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 15:52:59 GMT):<br/>
so , in most cases using fabric-ca as OU CA will be required , IMO.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 16:05:37 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar , if we extend the MSP config to include also OUs, it will not be necessary to have different intermediate CA per OU.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 17:39:43 GMT):<br/>
@farhan3  are your certs signed by the root CA of the orgs of the peer organizations?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 17:39:49 GMT):<br/>
or by different root CAs?
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:21:18 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Based on the cryptogen tool, each org has an independent root, so ordererOrg0.pem is the self-signed root:

@yacovm Based on the cryptogen tool, each org has an independent root, so ordererOrg0.pem is the self-signed root: https://pastebin.com/hFxjrxDr 

And then `signcerts/orderer0Signer.pem` is signed by that root: https://pastebin.com/zjyrP7iZ

ok, now - you say you have a TLS problem right? I guess you mean that the peers cannot connect to the orderer.
right?
So, the peers - need to trust the CA of the orderer. I think that since you just replaced the certs of the orderers, and didn't update the peers, that's where the problem lies.

</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:28:57 GMT):<br/>
No, it's not the peer. The TLS error occurs during channel creation. 
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:29:20 GMT):<br/>
Also, I don't see the Orderer's root cert anywhere in under e2e_cli/crypto/peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:29:37 GMT):<br/>
ah but the channel creation- uses the peer binary
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:30:53 GMT):<br/>
So the binary needs to be recompiled? Or the peer binary uses a default location to pick up the orderer root 
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:31:04 GMT):<br/>
And I'm not updating that location
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:31:33 GMT):<br/>
Because the peers only know about each other's roots

it uses the file system
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:32:39 GMT):<br/>
look at the code in `scripts/script.sh` under `examples/e2e_cli`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:32:59 GMT):<br/>
there are environment variables there that control the certificates that are related to TLS

`ORDERER_CA=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/orderer/localMspConfig/cacerts/ordererOrg0.pem`
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:33:57 GMT):<br/>
This would still point to my new root because I keep the same file name

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:34:56 GMT):<br/>
look at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/scripts/script.sh#L21-L35
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:38:29 GMT):<br/>
This is for the peers themselves, there is no mention of the orderer CA
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:39:48 GMT):<br/>
ah yeah you're right - `	peer channel create -o orderer0:7050 -c $CHANNEL_NAME -f crypto/orderer/channel.tx --tls $CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED --cafile $ORDERER_CA >&log.txt`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:40:13 GMT):<br/>
so you set the ORDERER_CA to be the new CA that signed the orderer's certs and it doesn't work?
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:40:22 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:40:29 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:44:54 GMT):<br/>
ok, hmm, thank you for trying :)
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:55:38 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, I think it might have to do with the common_name in the cert. The example cert has common_name set to "orderer0", which matches the hostname given to the orderer container. While the cert generated by cryptogen has common_name of "ordererOrg1Orderer1"
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:55:46 GMT):<br/>
Trying that now
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:59:14 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Yep! That was it, the common_name in the cert needs to match the container name/hostname.

@here..After going through the Fabric chain Membership access Control.. am trying to create new Orgs and Partners, once I use the cryptogen I see the ca's, admincerts, signers, etc are created..there are 4 folders (ca,msp,orderer/peer, users) --> For configuring peer, orderer, --> Under organizations --> we have ca, msp, orderder/peer we have all four certs (ca, admin, keystore,sign). We just need to select the certs from peers and orderer folder...So, ca's are mainly for ca-server, users are for user config, what are msp's certs used for? Does the MSP's folder need to be configured in BCCSP?

</p>
<p><strong>bkvellanki</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 19:35:50 GMT):<br/>
i am trying to understand the configuration..
</p>
<p><strong>bkvellanki</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 19:36:30 GMT):<br/>
In my example is use OrgA, OrgB, OrgC as MSPId's to govern the chain.
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 19:39:24 GMT):<br/>
Take a look at `fabric/examples/e2e_cli/configtx.yaml`. You would define your organizations there, and each would have an MSP (membership service provider). The enrolling peer would then need to have certs that match the MSP certs.
</p>
<p><strong>bkvellanki</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 19:52:34 GMT):<br/>
@farhan3 thanks for the response..I understood that piece that each org will have an MSP. But if you look at the directory structure created by the cryptogen tool as attached below..What would be you localMSPConfig directory --> Ia ssusme it is under peerOrganizations-->peers-->PeerOrg1Peer1. If so, what are peerOrganizations -->peerOrg1-->msp folder used for?  I can think ca's are for ca server?

<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 19:59:59 GMT):<br/>
Right, that's what I understood as well, peers/peerOrg1Peer1 would be the "msp" config for the peer. But not sure about the root msp directory, seems incomplete as well since i'ts missing the key under keystore. 
</p>
<p><strong>bkvellanki</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 20:00:55 GMT):<br/>

@farhan3 is the common name issue for orderer solved. Did you change the code in cryptogen to match that?
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 18 Apr 2017 20:23:44 GMT):<br/>

@elli-androulaki @mastersingh24 @binhn @JonathanLevi  want to ask your opinion about something, so the node SDK's MSP implementation always returns `true` from the `validate` call (java does validate certificate properly). this means it doesn't properly validate the certs before checking signatures (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3202)

it's a result of the node.js community not having good cert chain validators in general. pki.js v2.0 provides a CertificateChainValidationEngine that has good support for that but it's built with ES6 language features that are not supported by our current node.js version (6.9.x). if we upgraded our required node.js version then we'll have some struggle with grpc

I'm thinking, for v1.0 can we keep it this way without fixing it? it's meant to validate Endorser identity from proposal responses but those are received on a TLS connection so there's no danger of anyone messing with it. but there might be other concerns so want to ask you guys for input.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:55:37 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix  - in the end, it does not really impact the security in terms of the transaction path through the orderer and peers but just means that it is possible for the client may pass on a endorsement that is not actually "valid".  BTW - why doesn't pki.js v2.x work with Node 6.9.x?   I know that there are incompatibilities between the pki.js v1.x and v2.x APIs
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:59:32 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 when i tried running pki.js v2.0.55 in node 6.9.4 it complained not able to parse the `import` statement that replaces the require() calls
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:02:19 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix, I agree with @mastersingh24 . The only concern i would have is the following: if the client cannot check signature validity, isnt the case that the endorser could simply pass arbitrary data there that would ultimately be signed by the client?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:02:29 GMT):<br/>
_"it is possible for the client may pass on a endorsement that is not actually "valid""_ - right, which then will be caught by VSCC anyway. maybe the endorser's org has been kicked out of the channel for instance. or the proposal was sent to the wrong peers who are not part fo the channel
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:02:56 GMT):<br/>
still it won't affect the overall security posture...
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:04:00 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki see my comment above, yes the endorser could do that, but that will get rooted out by VSCC
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:04:00 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki see my comment above, yes the endorser could do that, but that will get rooted out by VSCC (assuming VSCC checks each endorsement's Endorser identity before validating signature which I think it does)
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:04:34 GMT):<br/>
But I guess if we assume that peers are generally trusted to "do the right thing" w.r.t., the clients, this should not be an issue. @adc, @aso, @eug what do you guys think ? :)  
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:05:12 GMT):<br/>
no the peers don't have to be trusted because of the checks at VSCC

> @elli-androulaki see my comment above, yes the endorser could do that, but that will get rooted out by VSCC (assuming VSCC checks each endorsement's Endorser identity before validating signature which I think it does) 
Correct; it will not harm the chain, in that sense. But the signature the client produced could be used elsewhere(?)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:05:34 GMT):<br/>
or the committer, not sure which does the cert validation
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:07:29 GMT):<br/>
I assume you are referring to the client signing the transaction that contains the endorsements. how would that be taken advantage of?

<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:10:23 GMT):<br/>
I mean if i am a malicious endorser i can send to the client "valid simulation result computed correctly" || "I store 100 $ from the account of Alice"

<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:11:27 GMT):<br/>
of course it is sort of restricted to a few bytes that cannot be a big message, but the endorser can trick the client to sign data that the client did not intend on singing

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:28:05 GMT):<br/>
If I understand you correctly, you are interpreting the client's signing as an endorsement on the ProposalResponse. but i don't think it's interpreted that way: the only function the client signature serves is for the orderer to check for ACL on the request. i don't think the client's signature gets preserved beyond the orderer's grpc request handler

@adc @elli-androulaki with https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7651/ we now need to get an admin identity to sign the join channel request in the SDK's end to end test
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:51:18 GMT):<br/>
I'm wondering how is that admin identity set up
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:56:00 GMT):<br/>
the app will have to pre-provision this identity so that the private key and cert are loaded into the app for a special admin user
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:56:00 GMT):<br/>
the app will have to pre-provision this identity so that the private key and cert are loaded into the app for a special admin user that matches the `admincerts` under the peer's local MSP dir
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:00:33 GMT):<br/>
you'll notice that I added a feature to cryptogen to anticipate these for being able to generate test / sample artifacts  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:02:31 GMT):<br/>
so it'll provide the private key for the admin right? that's the main thing i need
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:03:39 GMT):<br/>
ha! admin is the owner of one of the certificates listed in the mspconfig as admin!
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:06:11 GMT):<br/>
yep - private key for the admin issued by the peer's localmsp 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:15:59 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 when I `go install` and `cryptogen` it immediately returns with `Killed: 9`?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:17:17 GMT):<br/>
upgrade to 1.8.1? currently 1.8
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:20:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:23:01 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix the client sig on the tx remains with the tx, but you are correct that we don't assume the client would validate the proposal responses in the tx and why vscc does that prior to commit -- we might end up with more invalid tx's on the ledger, but that's part of the design

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 06:53:28 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 07:00:30 GMT):<br/>
that's typically about the wrong header and footer
</p>

had to change to "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY" and "END PRIVATE KEY" to get past that

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 07:10:29 GMT):<br/>
so "BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY" is not PKCS#8, I may have to manually parse it, would this look right to you:
- strip out header and footer
- base64 decode to byte array
- encode to hex
- load as DER

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 07:12:16 GMT):<br/>
(Gari has written a pemToDER() utility for fabric-ca that does the same)

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 13:20:13 GMT):<br/>
hi @mastersingh24, thanks, yeah i think marshaling to PKCS#8 format will give them better compatibility among key parsers
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 14:09:38 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix yes, openssl still used in BDD
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 16:17:16 GMT):<br/>
after googling , I found this golang package for pkcs8 : https://gowalker.org/github.com/youmark/pkcs8. This might help marshalling.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 16:21:37 GMT):<br/>
yeah i saw that earlier, definitely easier to do the converting to pkcs8 on the golang side than trying to parse the private key PEM with ASN.1 and OID in node.js
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:56:26 GMT):<br/>
Let's not use an "unknown"/unofficial user's implementation for this.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:58:18 GMT):<br/>
that can be used as guidance for implementation as most of the constructs are implemented there.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:59:37 GMT):<br/>
Sure. By the way, to be more precise... it's not just the un/marshalling that's not there. Effectively, Golang does not have the support for parsing encrypted PKCS#8 private keys.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 19:00:09 GMT):<br/>
So "by design", they chose not to implement this, back in 2013 (IIRC)...

Hi, I'm trying to run the block-listener example (to listen on a particular chaincode event), but I keep getting errors related to the signing identity:

```
error on Register send could not obtain the default signing identity, err This MSP does not possess a valid default signing identity
could not start chat could not obtain the default signing identity, err This MSP does not possess a valid default signing identity
Error creating event client
```

In mspimpl.go around line 117 I think what this does is generate a hash for the certificate which is later printed out in logs that show the identity being dealt with.   I'd like to match that in SDK but had no luck so far.   Is that cert.Raw the entities certificate as a pem file in bytes ?  and what hashing is being used ?  Is there any way the client/sdk can know that and be in sync?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:38:13 GMT):<br/>
@rickr, cert.Raw is just the DER representation of certificate 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:44:00 GMT):<br/>
ok ---  thx how about the hashing being used ?  Would it match the hashing that' used to sign proposals
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:52:49 GMT):<br/>
so, by default, SHA256 is used. In theory, the hash function used there can be different from the one used for signatures
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 16:42:16 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki @adc quick question: is the Policy.PolicyType.MSP supposed to work? I can't seem to find an example using it or tests that uses it. and https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/common/configtx/initializer.go#L80 seems to indicate this is not really supported
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 16:42:51 GMT):<br/>
did I understand it right? should we remove the handling of this policy type in the client (like when decoding the config block)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 19:51:02 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix  - there's no support for PolicyType.MSP

Reading the docs on endorsement policies regarding the policy if one is not specified, the docs say
```
NOTE - the default policy requires one signature from a member of the DEFAULT MSP
```
I can't find any description of what the default MSP is and how a proposal could be signed by this MSP. Anyone point me to some information ?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 04 May 2017 15:37:32 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel the default MSP is the local msp configuration.  I showed you some of the folders in our discussions yesterday if you recall
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 04 May 2017 15:38:42 GMT):<br/>

@davidkel so any one with a cert signed by one of the orgs in the cacerts folder can sign for the endorsment.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 04 May 2017 17:20:50 GMT):<br/>

Hi all! Your opinion on this issue would be greatly appreciated! https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3678
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 14:13:43 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand the "number of blocks" approach.
If there is no "action" in the channel, a block isn't created AFAIK. How does that solve the underlying problem that the certificate expiration is supposed to solve?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 14:40:33 GMT):<br/>

How does the new MSA OrganisationalUnit config help prevent imposters.  Is it not superfluous to the certificate entry?  The certificate can only contain one OU so why explicitly state it in the config.  Indeed why the need forthe config at all?

If it is not explicitly required, then perhaps it should be removed although open to accept justifications.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 12:55:30 GMT):<br/>
[ A few things which are probably not as clear as they should be:

1) Each organization has an MSP

2) The default MSP implementation is X509-based and in a typical setup each MSP would contain a different root certificates / set of intermediate certificates

3) 2) implies that each organization would have it's own CA / Intermediate CAs which avoids central control of a single CA 

4) There are some use cases where where there is actually the desire / requirement to have a single CA (i.e  a CA controlled by the founder of the network or perhaps a 3rd party CA mutually trusted by all participants)

5) If you go with 4), then there is an issue in that the root CA for the MSP for each organization would actually be the same and that means that if you know the MSPID for an organization you'd be able to spoof it since your certs are signed by the same CA

6) So in order to meet the requirements of 4) and avoid the vulnerability stated in 5), we added the option to include OU(s) in the MSP.   The allows all orgs to share the same root CA but now we can distinguish them based on the combination of the root cert and OU.  This does of course imply that the central CA has controls in place to ensure that it does not issue certificates for one org with the OU intended to represent another org

7) Recall that for all of this to work, the orgs must be included in the configuration transactions submitted to the ordering service and that there are policies which define how may signatures are require for the configuration transaction to be valid (which in turn means that multiple organizations will inspect the config transaction before signing it)

@elli-androulaki @adc (would include Matthias but couldn't find his ID) the node and java SDK e2e tests are both failing due to the following error. So I went back to review the instantiation policy added by https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8667/. if the chaincode itself does not include an instantiation policy (the chaincode package currently installed by both SDKs don't include one), it uses the local MSP to enforce the policy. what I don't understand is how would this work in a transaction cycle when org1's admin sends the proposal to peers in org2 (along with peers in org1), which would reject it?

```error: [Chain.js]: Chain-sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: chaincode instantiation policy violated

It's all broken again :)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:27:13 GMT):<br/>
at the time when this was discussed i thought it was pretty simple (the required change in the tests would be a single switch in the SDK API call)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:28:10 GMT):<br/>
but when I reviewed the CR above, it did not make sense to me. and the `instantiation policy included in the chaincode package` took my by surprise, I had no idea there was such a thing
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:30:43 GMT):<br/>

@jimthematrix - `what I don't understand is how would this work in a transaction cycle when org1's admin sends the proposal to peers in org2 (along with peers in org1), which would reject it?` that's correct, this will work only for 1 org scenario..... since using CDSPackage is meant to be temporary anyway (we should move to SignedCDSPackage as soon as we can) we should relax this constraint to me more workable default @elli-androulaki

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:45:42 GMT):<br/>
instantiation is a transaction so should use verifying MSPs in the channel config to check instead of local MSP
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:45:53 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix if we cannot get a decent default ( "should be some admin" ?), yes
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:46:29 GMT):<br/>
no the default policy is fine, but what I'm saying is the enforcing code doesn't seem right to me
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:46:52 GMT):<br/>
the enforcing code is using a default policy that's not workable
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:47:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:48:00 GMT):<br/>
from comment ` the default instantiation policy requires the peer's msp admin` ... this will change for each peer and lead to each peer's ProposalResponse being different
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:48:03 GMT):<br/>
right

(btw, the above is what @jeffgarratt found)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:50:08 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:51:50 GMT):<br/>
on a related topic.... the right thing would be to use SignedCDSPackage and move away from the old and tired CDS package
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:52:01 GMT):<br/>
i would return something like this as the default:
```ONE_OF_TWO_ORG_ADMIN = {
	identities: [{role: {
			name: 'admin',
			mspId: 'org1'
		}
	}, {
		role: {
			name: 'admin',
			mspId: 'org2'
		}
	}],
	policy: {
		'1-of': [{ 'signed-by': 0 }, { 'signed-by': 1 }]
	}
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:53:03 GMT):<br/>
i'm not sure there's anything wrong with the CDSPackage
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:53:07 GMT):<br/>
yes, if we did some more work and found all the orgs in the channel)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:53:58 GMT):<br/>
CDSPackage cannot specify policy - ie, you have to go with default
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:54:14 GMT):<br/>
SignedCDSPackage allows policy
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:54:14 GMT):<br/>
SignedCDSPackage allows user policy
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:54:36 GMT):<br/>
and users to sign the package
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:54:46 GMT):<br/>
using the signed cds package will make the instantiate process that much more complex just like creating channel
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:55:04 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:55:39 GMT):<br/>
it brings in the notion of "ownership" of chaincode like channel
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:55:43 GMT):<br/>
for for creating channel you have no choice but to embed the signatures before the transaction gets sent to the orderer, but here we can actually take advantage of the endorsement process to collect the signatures
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:57:42 GMT):<br/>
it does give you more option...however, the chaincode being outside of channels, there's value in specifying ownership 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:59:07 GMT):<br/>
in any case, we do have to solve the current problem for CDSPackage with right default policy regardless... not saying we should move to SignedCDSPackage right away
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:59:27 GMT):<br/>
are you guys working on patch this code so the default policy looks like something I pasted above? I think that should be the right fix
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 22:59:38 GMT):<br/>
or you have another solution?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:01:17 GMT):<br/>
need to check with @elli-androulaki  .... we could try something like what you have if we can get the list of MSPIDs for the channel from the peer
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:01:30 GMT):<br/>
it does look like a possibility
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:02:06 GMT):<br/>
I can investigate while we wait...
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:03:29 GMT):<br/>
should be pretty easy, already have the channel ID, can ask the peer for the channel's MSP manager
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:03:33 GMT):<br/>
which has all the MSPs
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:03:59 GMT):<br/>
right... that's what I was going to check
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:04:10 GMT):<br/>
but not sure what the actual apis were
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:11:04 GMT):<br/>
how about this
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:11:09 GMT):<br/>
```	} else {
		// the default instantiation policy requires any of the peer's msp admin
		mspids := peer.GetMSPIDs(channel)
		ipEnvelope := cauthdsl.SignedByAnyMember(mspids)
		ip, err := proto.Marshal(ipEnvelope)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("Marshalling instantiation policy failed: [%s]", err)
		}
	}```
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:11:47 GMT):<br/>
can be `SignedByAnyAdmin` to be more stringent
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:12:20 GMT):<br/>
and that'd match what we had expected ;-)

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:12:45 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:13:31 GMT):<br/>
need to a bit of refactor for common code and add that method I think... or is it there already ?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:19:41 GMT):<br/>
not seeing it there, but should be trivial to add by refactoring the existing SignedByAnyMember to a common local func that takes an arg to decide whether it's any member or any admin
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:21:05 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 23:21:08 GMT):<br/>
only cauthdsl_builder.go:128 `Role: msp.MSPRole_MEMBER` needs to be different b/w the two
</p>

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 09:10:23 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix @muralisr  - I am a bit confused as to what you decided the solution should be here.  I thought that the plan was to keep the "old" CDSPackage around (especially for development purposes) so that we could avoid all of the complexities of instantiation policy.  

It looks like that's what you decided?   I would also go with SignedByAnyMember rather than SignedByAnyAdmin   
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 11:06:27 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 right re CDSPackage
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 11:07:07 GMT):<br/>
that was just an observation that with SignedCDSPackage we don't have have to rely on fabric generated default policy
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 11:08:01 GMT):<br/>
easy to pick either Member or Admin 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 11:08:01 GMT):<br/>
about whether to use SignedByAnyMember rather than SignedByAnyAdmin.... easy to pick either
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 11:09:10 GMT):<br/>
But I'd have thought for instantiate an "Admin" role is more appropriate @mastersingh24  ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 11:12:37 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 testing a fix by the way (more work was needed to get the UT happy)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 13:31:36 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 so the error is due to something more than using AnyAdmin vs. AnyMember. to be honest at this point I don't think it's a big difference because to install chaincode you already have to use a peer org admin. that's why I suggested AnyAdmin to preserve the original spirit of https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8667
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 13:33:09 GMT):<br/>
in node SDK e2e both peers rejected the instantiate endorsement proposal, and in @rickr 's case his channel only has one org and that org's peer rejected the proposal too. so there must be issues with the policy evaluation logic or something.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 13:33:53 GMT):<br/>
just tried @muralisr 's patch that defined SignedByAnyAdmin as the default but still getting the error. investigating
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 14:47:55 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr and I found two problems:
- using local MSP as the default chaincode instantiation will prevent any channel with more than one org to successfully instantiate chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 14:47:55 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr and I found two problems:
- using local MSP as the default chaincode instantiation will prevent any channel with more than one org to successfully instantiate chaincode
- 2nd argument in the LSCC `instantiate` call is supposed to be the chainId, but node SDK and java SDK are both setting it to `default` because since long time ago this has worked. chainId is set in the proposal header as with any other proposals. Murali will later see if this can be eliminated
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 14:51:05 GMT):<br/>
@rickr see above 2nd item 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 14:53:16 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix will do another round of tests (also want to see if I can make the mock cleaner ... but that's a secondary at this point so I can get the fix in)
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 14:54:03 GMT):<br/>
thx jim I'll jump on this tomorrow ... went back a build and working on TLS enablement 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 15:04:53 GMT):<br/>
http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/9059 for node SDK fix (won't pass until after @muralisr 's fix is merged)

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 15:06:27 GMT):<br/>
thanks Murali for the investigation. @elli-androulaki please let us know if you have any concerns regarding the discussions and decisions above
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:01:09 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix  SignedByXXX was using MarshalOrPanic ... to be safe decided to do a bit more work to return the proto message and use error or panic on case by case basis
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:01:42 GMT):<br/>
will run UTs and push as soon as done.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:01:46 GMT):<br/>
within the hour for sure

<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:38:38 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix, regarding this:
> - using local MSP as the default chaincode instantiation will prevent any channel with more than one org to successfully instantiate chaincode
Are you considering a chaincodes that are installed on the peers of more than one organisations? If so, indeed default instantiation policy would not work, as it would result into two or more (depending on how many organisations are on the channel and have the chaincode instlaled) installation entries for the same chaincode across the peers i.e., <name, version, hash of code, ip*>, where ip* would differ depending on the org of the peer the cc is installed.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:42:24 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix , @muralisr, are you suggesting that the defaul instantiation policy would be set to the members of the org of the peer that receives the cc installation request.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:42:24 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix , @muralisr, are you suggesting that the defaul instantiation policy would be set to the members of the org of the peer that receives the cc installation request?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:43:20 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki admins in the orgs for channel to be specific
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:44:44 GMT):<br/>
currently each endorser will have its own msp based instantiation policy 
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:44:58 GMT):<br/>
(as default yes)
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:44:58 GMT):<br/>
(as default, yes)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:45:01 GMT):<br/>
two endorsers will come up with two different instantiation policies
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:45:15 GMT):<br/>
so if you are collecting endorsements, this won't work
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:45:17 GMT):<br/>
if they are members ofdifferent orgs
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:45:42 GMT):<br/>
but we dont need to collect endorsements
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:45:42 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone! Your feedback on this would be much helpful!
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 16:45:46 GMT):<br/>
we only need one, no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 17:35:43 GMT):<br/>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but - shouldn't we try to have instantiation policies that for every given principal, they evaluate (accepted/denied) in the same way across all peers in the org?
</p>

Otherwise we might run into inconsistencies. 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 18:13:12 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm really what we need to do is allow user to specify policy which we can do with the SignedCDSPackage (just ChaincodeDeploymentSpec + instantiation policy ... we can ignore the "owner signatures" for future implementation)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 18:13:40 GMT):<br/>
so basically we can allow users to specify policies
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 18:14:35 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to grasp the big picture behind the problem you and Jim are describing
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 18:16:17 GMT):<br/>
the instantiation policy ties the local MSP of the peer ... which works if you are using only one peer for instantation
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 18:16:48 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I understood this.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 18:17:20 GMT):<br/>
(as an aside @jimthematrix other UTs are failing due to the change ...working on getting them to work as well)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 18:17:58 GMT):<br/>
Anyway, I don't want to divert the flow of the discussion from what you and @elli-androulaki were talking about - carry on.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 18:18:33 GMT):<br/>
no worries, yacov :-)
</p>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 18:22:07 GMT):<br/>
I am worried though - fixing a problem with regard to the "default policy" is closing the hole in a leaking pipe, and you might have other holes which you do not know about.
That's why I was trying to think - what principal can be adopted so we will not run into such problems.
Users define instantiation policies themselves, right?
Isn't it a problem with regard to what I said a few comments before? Shouldn't we be able to restrict the expressions they can have in order for them not to make the channel reach a diverged state?

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 18:45:55 GMT):<br/>
but you define an instantiation policy with installation of a chaincode right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 18:46:22 GMT):<br/>
But you can install the chaincode on peers from different orgs with different instantiation polices, can you not?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 19:08:13 GMT):<br/>
Ah- so what I was missing is that the validation of the instantiation is via the endorsement policy, not the instantiation policy.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 19:08:13 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr when a peer receives an `instantiate` update from a block - it uses the endorsement policy to validate it? or the instantiation policy?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 20:16:57 GMT):<br/>
I am again confused.   I thought that "instantiation policy" was supposed to be analogous to "endorsement policy".  Here's what I mean:

For user chaincode, the endorsement policy is "attached" at instantiate time and then at validate / commit time the each transaction is evaluated against the endorsement policy 

But chaincode lifecylce actions (e.g. instantiate) are invoked against lifecycle system chaincode and therefore this would mean that you'd have to have endorsement policies attached to LCCC which is a checking and egg problem.

So I thought that the policy which is attached to chaincode at install time would effectively be evaluated like endorsement policy during the commit of the lifecycle chaincode instantiate function / transaction.

Now we also said that you don't need to specify an instantiation policy in order to make things more consumable and definitely more friendly at development time.  So I guess that's where the default instantiation policy comes in.

I think we all agree that a the simplest policy would be to require a signature from a single organization which belongs to the channel in which the chaincode is being instantiated.

So for this, as I see it, we would have two options:  Any member or any admin

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 20:46:32 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 good question, and that got me confused now ;-) I had thought the instantiation policy is simply for access control, not as the policy to check by the validators like the endorsement policies
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 20:46:53 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr @elli-androulaki @binhn can we get clarification on this point?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 20:47:26 GMT):<br/>
i'm pretty sure based on how I read the code it's meant to be an ACL policy
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 20:47:58 GMT):<br/>
that's why I was suggestion SignedByAnyAdmin instead of SignedByAnyMember being the default

The eventual instantiation would fail because lccc actually checks a hash of the signed chaincode package which includes the instantiation policy

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:06:14 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr  - let me try to ask some basic questions in order
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:06:24 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:07:05 GMT):<br/>
Let's forget about policies altogether for a moment ......  since at least I think I confused myself  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:08:19 GMT):<br/>
1) Instantiate - A client sends a proposal to a peer targeting LCCC on a channel and calling the instantiate function
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:08:23 GMT):<br/>
Is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:08:33 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:09:33 GMT):<br/>
2) Assuming the peer was able to find the package, things checked out, etc, the peer will respond back with a signed proposal response?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:09:44 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:10:16 GMT):<br/>
3) The proposal response actually contains a RWSet which updates the LCCC "state"?  (could be wrong here)  
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:10:30 GMT):<br/>
absoluteluy correct
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:10:57 GMT):<br/>
contains both LSCC and the actual chaincodes (from calling the Init method) RW States
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:12:01 GMT):<br/>
Is the instantiation policy serialized to (3) @muralisr ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:12:01 GMT):<br/>
Is the instantiation policy serialized into (3) @muralisr ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:12:01 GMT):<br/>
Is the instantiation policy also serialized into (3) @muralisr ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:12:19 GMT):<br/>
4) Client gets back the proposal response, packs it up in a transaction, signs it and sends to the ordering service 

5) Here's where I think I get confused - committing peers on the channel now get a block which contains the LCCC instantiate transaction .....
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:12:33 GMT):<br/>
(hang on on that please @yacovm ... that's part of the key thing will get to that)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:12:40 GMT):<br/>
4) yes
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:13:34 GMT):<br/>
5) that's quite correct @mastersingh24 ..not sure what the confusion is ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:14:14 GMT):<br/>
So normally at this point, the peer will run the validation, endorsement check and commit logic
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:14:24 GMT):<br/>
right...
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:14:47 GMT):<br/>
so what's the actual endorsement policy for LCCC?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:14:56 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:15:39 GMT):<br/>
Is it just a single endorsement from any member of the channel?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:16:15 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:16:39 GMT):<br/>
hich is different from the "instantiation policy" we have been talking about
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:16:52 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:17:54 GMT):<br/>
the only thing I'll add to that list is this... the *install* package should ideally contain the "instanttiaion policy" specified by the user as to who can do the *instantiation*
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:18:57 GMT):<br/>
and this is checked by LSCC on the endorsement side when a proposal is recieved 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:19:07 GMT):<br/>
the big elephant in the room is this
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:19:33 GMT):<br/>
so at the end of the day, you still only need a single endorsement to instantiate chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:19:41 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:20:23 GMT):<br/>
but peers should only endorse if the proposal is in line with the instantiation policy embedded in the package at time of deploy
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:21:02 GMT):<br/>
right..basically if lscc OK's the instantiation
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:21:29 GMT):<br/>
let me get to the elephant :-)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:21:35 GMT):<br/>
But - then does that mean that instantiation policies can really only be one of the form "one of ..."
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:21:41 GMT):<br/>
OK
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:22:29 GMT):<br/>
i'm hearing the elephant stumping now ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:22:35 GMT):<br/>
:-)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:22:51 GMT):<br/>
but let me answer the above question first - very relevant
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:25:21 GMT):<br/>
since we are basing the evaliation on the prposal, yes, the policy has to be something like "does this proposal creator satisfy the policy in the install package for instantiating this CC ?"
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:25:42 GMT):<br/>
not "do we have n signatures for instantiating this CC"
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:26:07 GMT):<br/>
did I understand / answer appr. @mastersingh24  ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:26:36 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:26:54 GMT):<br/>
ok. ...now for the elephant :-)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:27:44 GMT):<br/>
all the current problems are because we don't have the user defined policy - which is in SignedCDSPackage - as we are using CDSPackage which does not have a "policy"... 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:27:47 GMT):<br/>
```message SignedChaincodeDeploymentSpec {

        // This is the bytes of the ChaincodeDeploymentSpec
        bytes chaincode_deployment_spec = 1;

        // This is the instantiation policy which is identical in structure
        // to endorsement policy.  This policy is checked by the VSCC at commit
        // time on the instantiation (all peers will get the same policy as it
        // will be part of the LSCC instantation record and will be part of the
        // hash as well)
        bytes instantiation_policy = 2;

        // The endorsements of the above deployment spec, the owner's signature over
        // chaincode_deployment_spec and Endorsement.endorser.
        repeated Endorsement owner_endorsements = 3;
}```
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:28:04 GMT):<br/>
ignoring `owner_endorsements` which is not required
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:28:36 GMT):<br/>
if we use SignedChaincodeDeploymentSpec, we can set `instantiation_policy` and we won
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:28:36 GMT):<br/>
if we use SignedChaincodeDeploymentSpec, we can set `instantiation_policy` and we won't get into the "default policy" path
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:29:03 GMT):<br/>
Can you explain please what is going on here?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:29:41 GMT):<br/>
That's not correct though

sorry
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:29:53 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:29:56 GMT):<br/>
that's not correct
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:30:01 GMT):<br/>
need to change that
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:30:06 GMT):<br/>
instantiation policy seems to only be checked during invoke
</p>
<p><strong>himansri</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:30:16 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:30:24 GMT):<br/>
invoke on the LSCC
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:30:25 GMT):<br/>
OK
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:31:04 GMT):<br/>
the reason why we are using CDSPackage is so we can continue to send raw ChaincodeDeploymentSpect for installing
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:31:14 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:31:39 GMT):<br/>
and I would think that we only care about instantiate policy if using the secure cds
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:31:55 GMT):<br/>
my suggestion - move to SiignedCDSPackage, just specify a reasonable default instantiation policy so we don't have to rely so heavily on default policy
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:32:08 GMT):<br/>
in fact we can nuke that path and error out
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:33:40 GMT):<br/>
yea.. the idea was the "SignedChaincodeDeploymentSpec" is the future with the policy (and the "owner endorsements" if we care)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:34:18 GMT):<br/>
`in fact we can nuke that path and error out` - I mean not even have an artificial "default policy" in the LSCC
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:35:30 GMT):<br/>
let's not introduce another big change like this at this point unless it's absolutely necessary
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:35:36 GMT):<br/>
Agree
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:35:43 GMT):<br/>
it shouldn't be a big change
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:35:43 GMT):<br/>
i still think this could work out with CDSPackage
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:36:05 GMT):<br/>
well, it is if you consider all the other components like SDKs
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:36:13 GMT):<br/>
insteadn of sending ChaincodeDeploymentSpec, you'd send SignedChaincodeDeploymentSpec
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:36:19 GMT):<br/>
yeah - we can't change this right now
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:36:30 GMT):<br/>
WELL - hang on
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:36:54 GMT):<br/>
So what is the problem?   We are currently sending CDSPackage and it's no longer working?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:37:28 GMT):<br/>
nope... we are currently sending ChaincodeDeploymentSpec (which is what we have always been sending)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:37:35 GMT):<br/>
so what's wrong with each peer building the default policy exactly the same way for a CDSPackage?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:37:57 GMT):<br/>
if we use something you included in your fix
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:38:00 GMT):<br/>
I guess what broke?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:38:28 GMT):<br/>
I thought policy would only apply to SignedCDSPackage
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:38:33 GMT):<br/>
all peers would arrive at exactly the same default policy, so 1) no API changes needed and 2) determinism is preserved
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:39:03 GMT):<br/>
I am confused
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:39:09 GMT):<br/>
```func (lscc *LifeCycleSysCC) getInstantiationPolicy(channel string, ccpack ccprovider.CCPackage) ([]byte, error) {
	var ip []byte
	// if ccpack is a SignedCDSPackage, return its IP, otherwise use a default IP
	sccpack, isSccpack := ccpack.(*ccprovider.SignedCDSPackage)
	if isSccpack {
		logger.Info("Found signed CDSPackage")
		ip = sccpack.GetInstantiationPolicy()
		if ip == nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("Instantiation policy cannot be null for a SignedCCDeploymentSpec")
		}
	} else {
		// the default instantiation policy requires any of the peer's msp admin
		mspids := lscc.getChannelMSPIDs(channel)
		logger.Infof("Found MSPIDs for channel %s: %s", channel, mspids)

		//NOTE this uses MarshalOrPanic which needs to be modified to return err
		ip = cauthdsl.SignedByAnyAdmin(mspids)
	}
	return ip, nil
}

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:39:25 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 a policy is needed for either
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:39:26 GMT):<br/>
give me few mins, @jimthematrix :-)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:39:37 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:39:45 GMT):<br/>
just that when it's not Signed CDS then it's calculated
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:39:53 GMT):<br/>
But you only need to ever send to 1 peer
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:40:02 GMT):<br/>
what is this about multiple peers?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:40:27 GMT):<br/>
also - all peers in a channel should have the MSPs for all other peer orgs including their admins
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:40:29 GMT):<br/>
so @mastersingh24 the above is with the fix in progress
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:40:50 GMT):<br/>
And install already requires admin as well
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:40:52 GMT):<br/>
the previous code was using local MSP admin (each peer would have its own local MSP Admin)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:41:21 GMT):<br/>
Oops i forgot to mention the above is after Murali's fix (had thought it was the original code)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:41:48 GMT):<br/>
so... here's the deal ..promise just a few more sentences 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:42:43 GMT):<br/>
(1) we are not sending CDSPackage from SDK but sending ChaincodeDeploymentSpec (ie no change from pre-package days) 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:43:02 GMT):<br/>
(2) so we don't have a instantiationPolicy in the install package
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:43:51 GMT):<br/>
(3) so to make up for that a "default" instantiation policy was attahced (in the "else" part above ...) 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:44:46 GMT):<br/>
we could go ahead and keep that same flow with the right default in the "else" .. or we can send SignedChaincodeDeploymentSpec with a policy
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:44:51 GMT):<br/>
OK - but I'm still missing something:

1) To install chaincode, you need to be part of the peer's localMSP admins, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:45:01 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:45:15 GMT):<br/>
well...sorry, let me check that
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:45:16 GMT):<br/>
So we have that identity in the SDK already to make that work
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:45:22 GMT):<br/>
I know you need to be some admin...
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:45:28 GMT):<br/>
assume that for now though
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:45:38 GMT):<br/>
So why not just sign the instantiate proposal with the same admin user?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:45:41 GMT):<br/>
and we are done
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:46:14 GMT):<br/>
Instantiate only needs to be called on a single peer - so it can be your peer  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:46:35 GMT):<br/>
;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:46:49 GMT):<br/>
of course I like the new code better - any admin
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:47:12 GMT):<br/>
I feel like I am being dense or missing something here
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:48:52 GMT):<br/>
we could and maybe that's the right thing to do ... but in the general case (SignedChaincodeDeplouymentSpec) the instantiation policy is also maintained as part of the LSCC's data for the chaincode so VSCCs can do the same check
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:49:13 GMT):<br/>
( @yacovm this is probably what you were asking about )
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:50:12 GMT):<br/>
as all peers may not have chaincode installed, sending the policy for validation ensures everyone can validate it - even those that don't have the chaincode installed
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:51:59 GMT):<br/>
Well this is precisely what I don't understand
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:52:12 GMT):<br/>
```
			pol := cdRWSet.InstantiationPolicy
			if pol == nil {
				return fmt.Errorf("No installation policy was specified")
			}
			// FIXME: could we actually pull the cds package from the
			// file system to verify whether the policy that is specified
			// here is the same as the one on disk?
			// PROS: we prevent attacks where the policy is replaced
			// CONS: this would be a point of non-determinism
			err = vscc.checkInstantiationPolicy(chid, env, pol, payl)
```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:53:27 GMT):<br/>
This is the step where we take the *instantiation policy* from the block, right?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:54:14 GMT):<br/>
yes.. this is where peers that don't have the chaincode installed could also verify the instantiation using the policy in the TX
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:54:41 GMT):<br/>
Great, but isn't it a problem?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:54:51 GMT):<br/>
why ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:54:57 GMT):<br/>
It means that a single peer enforces its instantiation policy over all peers in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:55:13 GMT):<br/>
even though instantiation policy is a thing that can have different inputs for different peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:55:17 GMT):<br/>
(in diff. orgs)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:56:20 GMT):<br/>
hmmm as we talked (I think it was @mastersingh24 ... ) we are not talking about multiple orgs  "signing off" on a instantiation with multiple singatures
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:57:03 GMT):<br/>
in fact this is an additional sanity check for those peers that don't have chaincode installed but can still validate the same policy 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:58:07 GMT):<br/>
>  we are not talking about multiple orgs "signing off" on a instantiation with multiple singatures 
I'm just saying- we can have different instantiation policies configured
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:58:12 GMT):<br/>
but in the end, only 1 prevails
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:58:23 GMT):<br/>
isn't that a bit.... bizzare? 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:58:35 GMT):<br/>
in any case... with the original default policy created on the fly of  " *MY* local MSP admin"  (the code in the original "else" ) everyone will create their own little policy - and here's the problem @mastersingh24 - if we send the instantiation to > 1 peer we'll have different ProposalResponses... and SDK won't be happy. which is what @jeffgarratt ran into with BDD
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:59:05 GMT):<br/>
if we say we HAVE to send instantiation to one peer only, then we don't have a problem
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 21:59:15 GMT):<br/>
so
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:00:05 GMT):<br/>
one simple solution... keep the code as is and as long as we send ChaincodeDeploymentSpec, tell users to send to 1 user only
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:00:05 GMT):<br/>
one simple solution... keep the code as is and as long as we send ChaincodeDeploymentSpec, tell users to send to 1 endorser only
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:00:58 GMT):<br/>
when we get to specify our own policy with SDK sending SignedChaincodeDeploymentSpec, we can just remove the "else" code and error if  there's no policy specified
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:01:09 GMT):<br/>
or
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:01:45 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 i think we should bring in Murali's fix to create a SignedByAnyAdmin default policy
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:01:59 GMT):<br/>
yes - it needs to be that
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:02:08 GMT):<br/>
this allows the instantiate proposal call to be sent to all peers in the channle
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:02:14 GMT):<br/>
just like any other transactions
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:02:21 GMT):<br/>
that matches the current design
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:02:27 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:02:45 GMT):<br/>
or that
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:03:10 GMT):<br/>
so today SDK sends instantiate proposal to multiple endorsers ?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:03:30 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:03:42 GMT):<br/>
because it's a channel-aware transaction
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:04:01 GMT):<br/>
we'd like to emulate an app that gives all peers a chance to endorse that
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:04:09 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:04:22 GMT):<br/>
But - even if you just sent it to one, it would still fail today during vscc
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:04:37 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:04:55 GMT):<br/>
so that's the real need for any admin
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:04:58 GMT):<br/>
all other peers vscc except for the own orgs will mark it invalid
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:05:17 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:05:29 GMT):<br/>
wait... are we talking about the above code that @jimthematrix pasted ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:05:36 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:08:20 GMT):<br/>
would also note this... with the policy in the installed package, one policy will apply across all channels. 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:08:37 GMT):<br/>
with the "default" as above, we make one for each channel
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:08:59 GMT):<br/>
as a point in time "default" statement this may be ok...but calling it out
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:09:53 GMT):<br/>
(I don't think we have a choice ... )
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:09:56 GMT):<br/>
well, i think just like any other transactions, you don't have to specify an endorsement policy
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:10:12 GMT):<br/>
LSCC should also in the same way have a default endorsement policy
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:10:13 GMT):<br/>
the difference is in the scope
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:10:28 GMT):<br/>
policy per channel vs across channels
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:10:59 GMT):<br/>
the LSCC's default channel is also cross channels
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:11:08 GMT):<br/>
it just needs to be expressed in a channel-specific way
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:11:44 GMT):<br/>
default policy = "any admin of the channel"
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:13:18 GMT):<br/>
the intent is to use install package dicatate policy across channels. ..so one may not even be allowed to install a chaincode on a channel 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:14:06 GMT):<br/>
but if we make a default policy we change that intent from "can you instantiation on this channel" to "only admins of this channel can instantiate"
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:15:39 GMT):<br/>
that's ok as a "default" policy ..perhaps just evolve as we move to using user specified policy
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 07 May 2017 22:17:06 GMT):<br/>
i think that's ok as default, if more control is needed like disallowing instantiates, then use a custom policy in the package. which by the way none of the SDKs support
</p>

so I'll continue getting the UTs to run and try to put out a CR as soon as I can (the hiccups to UTs across a few packages are the hold up)

Can someone explain to me how cryptogen is working? - basically how does it make certificates that the MSP can use?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 10:56:05 GMT):<br/>
I guess it just randomly generates a private-public key pairs for CA, peers, orderes, signs the certs of the orderers and peers with the private key of the CA

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 10:56:36 GMT):<br/>
the MSP uses just normal x509 certifiactes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 11:33:56 GMT):<br/>
@tom.appleyard ^
</p>
<p><strong>tom.appleyard</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 11:36:07 GMT):<br/>
ok cool - so I'm not seeing an MSP or CA docker container when I fire up the network
</p>
<p><strong>tom.appleyard</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 11:36:10 GMT):<br/>
where is all of this handled?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 11:37:46 GMT):<br/>
you don't need the CA to be alive
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 11:38:22 GMT):<br/>
w.r.t the MSP - it's a logical entity that is constructed from all the PEM material + the MSP-ID (in the `core.yaml` )
</p>
<p><strong>tom.appleyard</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 12:11:04 GMT):<br/>
I see - sorry, could you explain to me exactly what an MSP is in this context and how it relates to a CA?
</p>
<p><strong>tom.appleyard</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 12:11:43 GMT):<br/>
I'm launching my network by using some docker images so I don't know what is in core.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 12:25:08 GMT):<br/>
ah so there is an excellent document on that actually

I have one question on the doc : Should not the CRL be read from cert itself instead of having the CRL folder ? How the content of CRL folder be synched with the CRL ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:40:51 GMT):<br/>
> Should not the CRL be read from cert itself instead of having the CRL folder ?
How can a cert have a CRL though? I don't think the x509.Certificate supports this 
> How the content of CRL folder be synched with the CRL ? 
so from my (limited understanding) the CRLs contains SNs and when the MSP checks if an identity is valid it looks for the CRL that matches the right CA of the identity and that the CRL contains a SN for the identity's certificate.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:44:01 GMT):<br/>
If you look at gloang X509 cert structure https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/x509/#Certificate , you'll see 3 fields : CRLDistributionPoints and OCSPServer            []string
        IssuingCertificateURL []string
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:44:30 GMT):<br/>
So , x509 cert contains CRL info.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:45:39 GMT):<br/>
your second statement seems correct. MSP should check for CRL in OCSP server.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:51:34 GMT):<br/>
ah you're saying the MSP can contact the CA to obtain the CRLs at runtime?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:51:34 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:52:09 GMT):<br/>
yup.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:52:17 GMT):<br/>
ocsp server.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:52:19 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it's a good idea. 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:52:40 GMT):<br/>
it is not CA , it is OCSP server.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:53:05 GMT):<br/>
well we an OCSP server as part of the fabric distribution and also that's in the critical path (validation)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:53:05 GMT):<br/>
well we don't have an OCSP server as part of the fabric distribution and also that's in the critical path (validation)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:53:54 GMT):<br/>
Anyway I was only trying to answer questions, not to argue on what we should or should not do
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:53:56 GMT):<br/>
you have to contact OCSP regardless for synching purposes
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:54:07 GMT):<br/>
ok. 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 14:54:32 GMT):<br/>
the doc is good. Thanks for pointing out.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 19:09:50 GMT):<br/>
@jtrayfield how are you creating them?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 19:09:52 GMT):<br/>
`openssl`?
</p>
<p><strong>jtrayfield</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 19:10:06 GMT):<br/>
yes, openssl
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 19:10:16 GMT):<br/>
use cryptogen
</p>
<p><strong>jtrayfield</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 19:14:44 GMT):<br/>
fabric/common/tools/cryptogen ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 19:16:07 GMT):<br/>
indeed
</p>
<p><strong>jtrayfield</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 19:16:50 GMT):<br/>
I'll give it a try, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 19:37:09 GMT):<br/>
alternatively , you can use cfssl. 
</p>
<p><strong>jtrayfield</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 20:15:53 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm ok, the problem is that they key generated by "openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256r1 > keyfile" has an extra header on it:
-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----
BggqhkjOPQMBBw==
-----END EC PARAMETERS-----
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHcCAQEEIKrVDCWVg7v4f2+2uNqZgHfACXOJCpTD1FUFL/vIUn8soAoGCCqGSM49
AwEHoUQDQgAElsv+o3/i3scyR8lHicR3DoMfH2l1RuXpoKS7+JfWBXTjKyuvdBYT
6nNtBNUBulLrtgIDK6xbdptZX4mnz6WEEQ==
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

</p>
<p><strong>jtrayfield</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 20:16:24 GMT):<br/>
this removes the header:
openssl ec -in ../orderer0key.pem.bad  -out orderer0key.pem
</p>
<p><strong>jtrayfield</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 20:19:43 GMT):<br/>
or you can remove it with emacs cause the PRIVATE KEY part looks the same as before
</p>

Re-posting question from @bkvellanki :
>Do we have a function in the shim to get the user attributes like similar to getUserAffiliates() in 0.6. The key reason for this is to restrict the user to perform only reads or writes based on the Role. Is see that we have them hfc sdk (getAffiliates, getSigningEntity, etc) and i think HFC fabric communicates with the Fabric CA to get the details. Is there any way to restrict the user in the chaincode to perforn only certian operations

@here I had few questions related to configtx.yaml and crypto-config.yaml. 1. How do we define entries for a member and an admin in the config file for a given Organization? 2. When we define that role and that org has couple of peer - are those roles common to both the peer nodes?

@chunhui what do you mean by multiple "MSP implementations"? Have multiple MSP per organisation is possible as long as the organisation is fine with the limitations described in /docs/source/msp.rst (which are considerable). Prioritisation across these MSPs is not supported. 
If i understood your question / need though properly you may need to build your own MSP (different type of MSP that considers multiple sub-msps with some prioritisation among them), and a different object in place of FabricMSPConfig.

<p><strong>chunhui</strong> (Sat, 13 May 2017 02:01:50 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki  thanks for the answer :smile: 

so having multiple MSP defined as their individual intermediatecerts is possible, as long as they are all PKI x509 based MSP,
and having multiple MSP implementation with prioritized sub-MSPs is something different.
</p>
<p><strong>chunhui</strong> (Sat, 13 May 2017 02:02:16 GMT):<br/>
right?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sat, 13 May 2017 18:02:04 GMT):<br/>
@chunhui sure! So, I am not clear where you consider the MSP prioritisation for. In Fabric v1 we allow for instantiation of membership service providers that follow standard PKI certificate hierarchy. That is, each MSP would consider a set of root CAs, and (optionally) intermediate CAs to validate MSP members (certificates) against. Ideally each MSP would correspond to the membership rules of a certain organisation. More details on the MSPs and their use you may find in /docs/source/msp.rst.

Now to have more sophisticated logic implemented within an MSP (e.g., certain prioritisation among CAs) you may need to implement it yourself complying with the interface of the MSP.
</p>
<p><strong>chunhui</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 07:48:57 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki i'm thinking of an alternate MSP implementation and considering if it can still co-exist with the default MSP. but since it will still have a root key, i guess they can be integrated by having 2 intermediate certs for the default and new MSP.  thanks :smile:

Hi all, I used transaction certificate attributes in v0.6 to do basic authorization, but it would seem that the relevant golang modules are missing in fabric 1.0 (I'm referring specifically to what was found in github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim/crypto/attr in v0.6).  How would I go about porting that capability to v1.0 chaincode?  Assuming that capability is even still there.

I think I have found a bug in setting up OUs.  When checking the OU certificate against the intermediates and roots, the OU certificate is extracted using `x509.ParseCertificate` whereas the intermediates and roots are sanitised then reimported through `msp.bccsp.KeyImport`.  The reimporting has the potential to change the signature algorithm which in turn results in certificates not marching, even though they are the same.

From initial analysis, seems like OU.CertifiersIdentifier is a hash of the chain, and certificationID is just a hash of the certificate.  Have you ran tests using with intermediate certificates?

<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 17:16:55 GMT):<br/>
so, `OU.CertifiersIdentifier` contains a hash of the whole chain, whereas `certificationID` contains only a hash of the first certificate in the chain

A quick hacky fix is to change line 734 of mspimpl.go to `return msp.getCertificationChainIdentifierFromChain([]*x509.Certificate{chain[1]})` to only return the intermediate cert (not the chain).  The rabbit hole on how the `msp.ouIdentifiers` is a little too deep for me to look at right now.

@yacovm See FAB-4003.  I am trying to enroll peers with certs issued from the chain attached to that issue.  Put simply, you are trying to determine certificate equality by comparing objects that have been prepared from the MSP files using different methods that yield different results.  In particular, where a peer cert is signed by and intermediate certificate, one method hashed the intermediate and the root, while the other just hashes the intermediate - resulting in a false mismatch and a panic.

@yacovm See FAB-4003.  I am trying to start peers with certs issued from the chain attached to that issue.  Put simply, the MSP checks are trying to determine certificate chain equality by comparing objects that have been prepared from the MSP files using different methods that yield different results.  In particular, where a peer cert is signed by an intermediate certificate, one method hashed the intermediate and the root, while the other just hashes the intermediate - resulting in a false mismatch and a panic.

A test would be very helpful here, and also - a directory structure of msp config that allows to reproduce a problem

Probably can - was in a rush to get something working for a client today.  Will take a proper look later and also try to tackle the peer issue.  Reproducing in a test should be possible.

I don't think the structure has the hash algorithm inside the block
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 13:10:21 GMT):<br/>
therefore I don't think there is a way of the client to know which hash was used to produce the block.

So if a user wants to verify the blocks hash it'll be solely _out of band_ information :(

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 18:36:16 GMT):<br/>
We have so many out of band stuff going on that this is the least of our worries.
Why would a user want to verify himself the block hash? The infrastructure does it for him.

Why are they paranoid though? Hash based validation only works backwords...

Well I've already had someone for the Java SDK doing the work to calculate this and asking to  commit so apparently it's wanted.  My concern is at the moment its assuming the hashing is the same as the peer/orderer signing.  My concern is that's not true and how it might be discovered

Hi - I have a question about revoking certificates. 

I'm using the cryptogen to generate my certs. And I'm trying to understand how each of certs can possibly be revoked or updated.

First, if a Peer/Orderer MSP signcert needs to be revoked, it can be done by sending an updated channel tx that blacklists the cert. The other Peers, will then no longer accept communications from the blacklisted Peer. 

Second, if the Admin cert needs to be revoked, the MSPs of the Peers using that Admin cert will need to be updated. This will be done by removing the admin cert from the admincerts dir in the MSPs. How would this be accomplished for "normal" user certs since they are not copied into the MSP dirs?

Next comes TLS certs - here is where I don't have the answer. If a TLS cert needs to be revoked, how will this be done? I've read around a bit and normally this would be done through Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). But I don't think fabric supports either (please correct me if I'm wrong). 
</p>

That's also correct, and they will also close connection to these peers.

You need to create a CRL and have the CA sign it.

You were OK so far

Can't imagine a way of doing it in fabric at the moment.

I think you're correct. However - we have additional authentication layers that are built on top of TLS so you should be safe in any case.
 @mastersingh24 is there any planning on supporting TLS cert revocation, or did I miss something and we already support it somehow?

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:14:53 GMT):<br/>
Hello @rasmustrew - while I am not sure what you are referring to as a "production" environment... in the sense of a "server" or "real data" or "mission critical" stuff, etc., I'll just mention that the latest "cut" of fabric was announced the Friday before last, which is `v1.0.0-alpha2`, and that we are working towards a `v1.0.0-beta` release soon.

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:51:36 GMT):<br/>
At it stands now, about a week (say, or two).
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:52:32 GMT):<br/>
Should not be longer. We are mostly waiting for some work on tooling with channel configurations, so we are holding on cutting a "beta", just in case it would require some API changes.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:54:25 GMT):<br/>
Other than that, I don't envision us accepting any API changes beyond that point for 1.0 (unless a real show-stopper is found, which really requires us changing the API for 1.0).

@here Using `cryptogen` we can generate keystore and signed certs. I was hoping to generate the CSR too, so that the tool can be used to generate pk and csr, and an offline CA signing could be done. Does anyone know if it's been done?

(I'm guessing that currently an administrator needs to manually revoke and upload a new CRL whenever a cert expires)... (not exactly enforced).

@JonathanLevi Production environment as opposed to a test environment like the e2e scenario. Would you mind giving a further explanation, if possible, on the purpose of the cryptogen tool, in relation to the CA. Is the cryptogen tool mostly created for testing purposes? If not, should it be used to create just the admin certs or more?  When should the CA be used instead of the cryptogen tool? These are mostly "best practice" questions i suppose.

Hi all, as far as I can tell from searching Jira for 'tcert', tcerts are not going to be supported in v1.0.. is that correct?  Is there an estimated release that they will be supported?  This ticket indicates perhaps that is v1.1 -- https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2441?jql=text%20~%20%22tcert%22 -- but other relevant tickets show "future" for the fix version(s).

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 16:25:21 GMT):<br/>
@vdods  - given the desire for tcerts, it seemed to make send to have them on the initial list of features for the next version.  Ones that are not so clear are marked "FUTURE"
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 16:27:07 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 is there a single Jira ticket or list somewhere that enumerates the features going into the next version?  I assume you're talking about v1.1, not e.g. alpha3 or whatever the next release is.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 16:30:20 GMT):<br/>
sorry - yes - I meant next MINOR release - e.g. 1.1
There's no JIRA ticket for v1.1 and there has not (yet) been any formal planning

<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 19:01:07 GMT):<br/>
Does v1.1 have an approximate release schedule, and if so, what is it?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 19:21:38 GMT):<br/>
Also, is there a document describing all the files generated by cryptogen and their relationships?  I'm trying to figure it out by reading tools/cryptogen/main.go and friends but it's not too clear.  My main goal is to figure out which keys/certs do what, and which ones are needed for the various actions, such as user creation (client.createUser in fabric-sdk-node) and channel creation (client.createChannel)
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 19:22:27 GMT):<br/>
There are so many files to pick from and there's no clear correct choice, and the lack of specifics in the API docs for e.g. fabric-sdk-node isn't helping (e.g. use this key+cert here)
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:18:07 GMT):<br/>
This command is illuminating -- `find crypto-config -type f -exec sha512sum {} \; | sort` -- in that it shows which files are the same, but there are still mysteries, such as why peerOrganizations/org0.example.com/msp/admincerts/Admin@org0.example.com-cert.pem and peerOrganizations/org0.example.com/users/Admin@org0.example.com/tls/server.crt are the same file.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:58:55 GMT):<br/>
A few other questions I have about the crypto materials: Which directories are meant to go to which entities?  E.g. peers, orderers, SDK-using web server, etc.  So far my dockerized peer network (which is analogous to other working examples) works fine using only about half the materials
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 00:19:28 GMT):<br/>
@here Anyone have a word on this?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 21:14:24 GMT):<br/>
Also, related question: Is it just for convenience that the `tls` and `msp` materials are shared per entity in the output of cryptogen?  For example, the following pairs of files are identical (sha512sums truncated for readability):
```
a4c98e4a  ./ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/cacerts/ca.example.com-cert.pem
a4c98e4a  ./ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/tls/ca.crt

@yacovm Ok, thanks.  And just to make sure I'm straight on this -- these files produced by cryptogen are the same for purposes of convenience?

@LordGoodman   - there was a thread about this on the mailing list as well - 
```
The underlying issue is that hostname verification is failing when communicating with the orderer.
The reason for this is due to the fact that the CN/SAN in the TLS certificate used by the orderer is "orderer.example.com" and not the ip address / host you are now assigning to the orderer.
 
You could attempt to regenerate all of the crypto material and start from the beginning, but a simpler solution might be ti simply add a hosts entry for orderer.example.com in the hosts file (/etc/hosts) on the host where you are running the peers and the CLI.  Just map orderer.example.com to the IP address of the host it is running on
```

@bh4rtp may you be more precise, please? maybe an example
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:07:07 GMT):<br/>
@adc for example, in a market, there are seller, purchaser, trader and regulator. the quoted price should keep secret to other sellers or purchasers, and only can be accessed by trader and regulator.

may you expand more, please
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:09:19 GMT):<br/>
it looks like you want to achieve some kind of access control
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:10:46 GMT):<br/>
yes. in the blockchain network, some invoke methods are not open to all peers.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:11:48 GMT):<br/>
so, the chaincode needs to be programmed to perform access control
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:12:19 GMT):<br/>
what you can do at the current stage is the leverage the shim's GetCreator method
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:12:27 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm said it can be done using endorsement policy.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:13:01 GMT):<br/>
he probably had another picture in mind
</p>

<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:13:15 GMT):<br/>
@adc thanks. maybe the GetCreator method does work.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:13:23 GMT):<br/>
can't you specify a specific identity in the endorsement policy, Angelo?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:13:45 GMT):<br/>
No, the get creator has nothing to do with that. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:13:56 GMT):<br/>
it's the certificate of the client SDK
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:13:58 GMT):<br/>
that send the proposal
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:14:46 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:14:58 GMT):<br/>
it all depends what is the goal one wants to achieve 
</p>

<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:16:07 GMT):<br/>
maybe access control is beyond the fabric, but it should provide the identity interface. am i right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:17:29 GMT):<br/>
from what I understood from @bh4rtp he/she wants to deny certain peers from endorsing chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:17:33 GMT):<br/>
espeically, from the chaincode side, i know who is calling.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:17:39 GMT):<br/>
right?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:18:04 GMT):<br/>
if that is the case, then you can just declare who should endorse, no?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:18:38 GMT):<br/>
an endorsement policy is just a formula over MSP Principals
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:18:51 GMT):<br/>
wow formula 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:18:59 GMT):<br/>
a possible MSP Principal is that identify a precise identity in the fabric network
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:19:05 GMT):<br/>
I'd say it's a predicate over MSP principals 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:20:11 GMT):<br/>
if you just say predicate then one might image that can point to a function that returns true/false
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:20:27 GMT):<br/>
you actually specify a formula and evaluate its satisfiability 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:20:30 GMT):<br/>
but anyway
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:20:34 GMT):<br/>
it is a predicate :)
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:20:34 GMT):<br/>
it is a predicate too :)
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:20:59 GMT):<br/>
@bh4rtp what do you want to achieve then?
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:30:25 GMT):<br/>
@adc i think it should be the best to achieve through endorsement policy. otherwise, the accesses cannot be strictly controlled. 
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:30:47 GMT):<br/>
that is under the fabric lower layer.
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:32:51 GMT):<br/>
if it is implemented above chaincode, then someone can bypass the access control.

 @mastersingh24  Why not add support for IP SANs in cryptogen? it only supports dns names
This code snippet fixes this:
```
	for _, s := range sans {
		ip := net.ParseIP(s)
		if ip == nil {
			continue
		}
		template.IPAddresses = append(template.IPAddresses, ip)
	}
```

Should we try to add it, or is it too late at this point?

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:31:23 GMT):<br/>
putting those together, what we are saying is your endorsement policy needs to be different for different invokes
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:31:27 GMT):<br/>
correct ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:31:27 GMT):<br/>
correct @bh4rtp 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:31:27 GMT):<br/>
correct @bh4rtp ?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:39:35 GMT):<br/>
it would be interesting to have an endorsement policy per function, actually
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:52:14 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr yes. i had thought be different for different invoke. for example there are queryPrice, declarePrice, i want queryPrice only invoked by the seller or purchaser who declared price, the trader and regulator. while declarePrice can only be invoked by the seller and the purchaser.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:53:18 GMT):<br/>
It makes no sense to prohibit invocations. 
What you really want to do, is prohibit endorsements by these peers 
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:54:43 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm yes. the proposal response should not send to these peers.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:12:48 GMT):<br/>
but do you need queryPrice to be endorsed?
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:17:15 GMT):<br/>
@adc should be endorsed, but you remind me that it is just a query.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:17:35 GMT):<br/>
a query needs to be endorsed only you want a strong query
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:17:35 GMT):<br/>
a query needs to be endorsed only if you want a strong query
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:17:50 GMT):<br/>
meaning that the result will appear on the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:18:16 GMT):<br/>
so, if it does not need to be endorsed then you need to enforce access control at the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:18:41 GMT):<br/>
so, it looks to me you are kind of implementing an auction, no?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:24:30 GMT):<br/>
@bh4rtp @adc @yacovm just wanted to make sure we are not steering in a wrong direction.. or applying the wrong tools for the job. Lets put down what we *really* want to do and then workaround if that's not possible
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:24:31 GMT):<br/>
@adc yes. a trade example.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:25:29 GMT):<br/>
to me what @bh4rtp really wants is ACL mechanisms in the chaincode where the chaincode can decide if something invoke should go through or not
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:25:32 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr  +1
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:26:54 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr but in the chaincode, how to check the identity of invoke peer?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:27:08 GMT):<br/>
that is the crucial question
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:27:38 GMT):<br/>
I have an educated answer :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:27:53 GMT):<br/>
This doesn't make sense though, why would you want the chaincode to do that? 
If the request reached the chaincode, you are already invoking it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:28:01 GMT):<br/>
you need just not to send the request to the peer
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:28:04 GMT):<br/>
(@adc correct if Im wrong) .. the GetCreator is the only mechanism currently which gives some idea of "who is calling me"
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:28:15 GMT):<br/>
will yield to @adc ;-) now
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:28:16 GMT):<br/>
the peer that invokes a Txn, does it via its chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:29:28 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr, you are right. The shim exposes the GetCreator method that returns the byte representation of the MSP identity of the signer of the proposal
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:30:17 GMT):<br/>
so, for example, the chaincode might associate, in some way, to an asset a list of serialized MSP identities 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:30:17 GMT):<br/>
so, for example, the chaincode might associate, in some way, to an asset (might be any resource the querier wants to access) a list of serialized MSP identities 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:30:44 GMT):<br/>
and then the chaincode can checks if the creator of the proposal is in the list
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:30:44 GMT):<br/>
and then the chaincode can check if the creator of the proposal is in the list
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:31:05 GMT):<br/>
if yes, the chaincode grants access, otherwise it returns an error
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:33:27 GMT):<br/>
let me also notice that access control is orthogonal to confidentiality
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:33:44 GMT):<br/>
in the sense of security, i think it is not useful to implement in chaincode. firstly chaincode is source code and secondly the peer controls its access, doesn't it? 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:33:53 GMT):<br/>
if the chaincode exposes a query function and the ledger is not encrypted then any reader of the ledger can derive directly that information
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:34:23 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=nK4zYA8ykgG58wTD8) @bh4rtp not sure I got what you meant
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:35:54 GMT):<br/>
@adc yes. that is the second question. how to encrypt the trade secret data? :grinning: 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:36:00 GMT):<br/>
it makes very sense to perform access control at the chaincode, the peer only check that the creator of the proposal is a writer of the channel the chaincode is running into
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:36:17 GMT):<br/>
aha, encryption is another beautiful story :)
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:36:56 GMT):<br/>
for that I would need to know more about your setting
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:37:13 GMT):<br/>
encryption can be performed at the client side and/or at the chaincode side
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:37:23 GMT):<br/>
each solution has different trade-off to consider
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:37:34 GMT):<br/>
in terms of key distribution and so on
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:38:46 GMT):<br/>
@adc @elli-androulaki @mastersingh24 @vpaprots can I ask the configurability of the BCCSP settings throughout the fabric? at this point, where and how do they get configured, if configurable at all? I see BCCSP sections in both core.yaml and orderer.yaml. I see that `SHA2` is not recommended to be changed since it's hardcoded in multiple places (according to the comment). I know `sw` vs. `pkcs#11` can be configured. what about security level `256/384/512`? if I change the security level, that must be done everywhere (sdk/peer/orderer) otherwise validating signatures will fail right?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:39:45 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix that section is useless at the current stage
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:40:12 GMT):<br/>
also the security level is meaningless because, if we consider MSP, it comes from the signing identity directly
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:40:34 GMT):<br/>
meaning that the crypto material a peer is loaded with implicitly induce the security level
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:40:34 GMT):<br/>
meaning that the crypto material a peer is loaded with implicitly induces the security level
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:40:54 GMT):<br/>
now, we have the hash function configured at configuration transaction
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:41:02 GMT):<br/>
but that is not use everywhere
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:41:02 GMT):<br/>
but that is not use everywhere, yet
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:41:31 GMT):<br/>
but the signer (say SDK when submitting a request) and the validator (say the peer when validating the request) must coordinate out-of-band on the MSP settings correct?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:41:50 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:42:02 GMT):<br/>
so that given an "MSPId" it's clear what settings to use
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:42:04 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:42:14 GMT):<br/>
in particular for signature verification, the coordination needs to be on the which hash function to use for computing the digest
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:42:16 GMT):<br/>
nothing else
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:42:23 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:45:04 GMT):<br/>
on _which hash function to use_, so given a security level, I thought the hashing function must use the same length, so you'd only have SHA2 vs. SHA3 to choose from (since the length is dictated by the key algo's security level). is that understanding correct?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:45:23 GMT):<br/>
very much :)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:45:34 GMT):<br/>

Hi - does anyone know how the Peers decide on whether to use TLS or not when talking to the Orderer? I don't see that option anywhere on the Peer side, however, on the Orderer side, you can enable/disable TLS.
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:26:42 GMT):<br/>
Reason I'm asking is, because I'm trying to use a different CA for my TLS certs, but then the Peer-Orderer handshake fails after the Peer joins the channel.
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:27:37 GMT):<br/>
```peer0.org0 | 2017-06-07 19:09:22.823 UTC [ConnProducer] NewConnection -> ERRO 2ed Failed connecting to orderer.org0:7050 , error: grpc: timed out when dialing

```
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:28:05 GMT):<br/>
```orderer.org0 | 2017-06-07 19:09:19.831 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 7fa grpc: Server.Serve failed to complete security handshake from "172.26.0.1:48008": EOF

```

</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:28:45 GMT):<br/>
How does the Peer determine what TLS cert to use during the handshake with the Orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:37:21 GMT):<br/>
in the core.yaml there is a tls section
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:53:11 GMT):<br/>
Right, to set the TLS crt and key for the Peer. There is also a place to provide a root crt.
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:53:24 GMT):<br/>
Is that the Root crt used during the handshake with the Orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:09:43 GMT):<br/>
no. There is no mutual TLS with the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:09:48 GMT):<br/>
Only mutual TLS with  peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:09:54 GMT):<br/>
and the certificate that is used is the one listed there
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:09:58 GMT):<br/>
as the server certificate
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:16:35 GMT):<br/>
Right, no mutual TLS. But when you try to do a TLS handshake, you still need to trust the Root cert who has signed the cert of the server you're connecting to.
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:17:26 GMT):<br/>
So when the Peer is connecting to the Orderer. The Orderer will send it's cert to the Peer, the Peer then needs to trust the Root who signed the Orderer's cert.
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:18:20 GMT):<br/>
Where is that Root cert specified? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:19:56 GMT):<br/>
ah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:20:06 GMT):<br/>
it's in the config block of the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:20:08 GMT):<br/>
i.e the genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:20:24 GMT):<br/>
basically we have some dynamically updating root CA pool
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:20:35 GMT):<br/>
that as you join channels, it is updated
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:20:52 GMT):<br/>
Ah, I see
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:21:42 GMT):<br/>
So if I want to use an external CA to sign my TLS cert of Orderer. I would need to add that TLS Root under the Orderer's MSP?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:22:01 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:22:16 GMT):<br/>
Under cacerts I presume 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:22:26 GMT):<br/>
ah no
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:22:35 GMT):<br/>
you need to make that information
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:22:38 GMT):<br/>
get into the genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:22:49 GMT):<br/>
so not the local MSP
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:22:52 GMT):<br/>
of the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:23:03 GMT):<br/>
but into that folder that is consumed by the `configtxgen`
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:23:19 GMT):<br/>
Right, I'll put it in the Orderer's MSP and then generate the genesis block using configtxgen
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:23:29 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/configtx.yaml#L90
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:23:33 GMT):<br/>
This one
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:24:09 GMT):<br/>
Ah, right. The Orderer's Org's MSP. Not the Orderer's MSP.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:24:17 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:24:25 GMT):<br/>
ok, cool. Let me give that a try.
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:24:27 GMT):<br/>
Thank you :D
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:24:29 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:42:07 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm worked!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:42:57 GMT):<br/>
cool
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:44:19 GMT):<br/>
Just to summarize for everyone else: `The Root CA cert that signs the Orderer's TLS cert must be added to the Orderer Org's msp/cacerts dir before the genesis block is created via configtxgen.`

@mastersingh24 We need to know how to run crypto-gen tool to use a customer provisioned root, intermediate (chained) and customer server provisioned certificates - so that we can setup a QA node instance that uses cryptographic material (x509 certs) for our various network entities with the certs are parked in the folder titled ``crypto-config``. We just want to use the same tool to generate crypto artifacts in the same manner - however we want to pass in the root and intermediate pem/key artifacts to the tool (parameterized). We do not mind some other way to generate these artifacts automatically (versus manually). At this point - we have customer generated key file, cert file and chain file running on a customer QA server. We want to run e2e sample on this server - with custom configurations. Thanks.

Hi - I have some certs that I generated for the peer msp using fabric-ca. In alpha2, these certs worked fine with the MSP lib. However, in beta, I get an MSP error when I start the peer:
```

```

Have some additional checks been added to the MSP lib? For example, I noticed that in the certs generated by the cryptogen tool, there is a `X509v3 Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Server Authentication, TLS Web Client Authentication` setting, but certs generated via fabric-ca don't have this.
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 20:11:46 GMT):<br/>
I have verified that the certs aren't expired. Basically, I have the alpha2 and beta images for the peer. Using the same msp dir, I can start the peer when using the alpha2 tag, but not when using the beta tag.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=iCL7ETqoEskvkMjzG) @mastersingh24 How did you generate these certs? I tried using these and they work with alpha2 and beta.

In `fabric/msp/mspimpl.go`, if I change `line 692` from 

```
validationChains, err := cert.Verify(msp.getValidityOptsForCert(cert))
```

Back to:
```
validationChains, err := cert.Verify(*(msp.opts))
```

It works

+func (msp *bccspmsp) getValidityOptsForCert(cert *x509.Certificate) x509.VerifyOptions {
 +	// First copy the opts to override the CurrentTime field
 +	// in order to make the certificate passing the expiration test
 +	// independently from the real local current time.
 +	// This is a temporary workaround for FAB-3678
 +
 +	var tempOpts x509.VerifyOptions
 +	tempOpts.Roots = msp.opts.Roots
 +	tempOpts.DNSName = msp.opts.DNSName
 +	tempOpts.Intermediates = msp.opts.Intermediates
 +	tempOpts.KeyUsages = msp.opts.KeyUsages
 +	tempOpts.CurrentTime = cert.NotBefore.Add(time.Second)
 +
 +	return tempOpts
 +}

hmmm
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:06:12 GMT):<br/>
ok let's do an experiment
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:06:16 GMT):<br/>
can you put prints
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:06:29 GMT):<br/>
to print the not before
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:06:31 GMT):<br/>
and not after fields
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:06:33 GMT):<br/>
of your cert?
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:07:19 GMT):<br/>
Sure, gimme a few minutes, I was cleaning my environment 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:15:08 GMT):<br/>
@farhan3 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:15:13 GMT):<br/>
you can also paste the PEM here
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:15:24 GMT):<br/>
...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:15:29 GMT):<br/>
while you're cleaning
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:15:59 GMT):<br/>
ok, I don't know exactly which cert it is, I'll send you the entire msp dir. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:16:08 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:16:16 GMT):<br/>
that'll work too...

I was wondering why msp.tar.gz wasn't even showing up in the list
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:45:05 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:45:09 GMT):<br/>
so... from some reason
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:45:14 GMT):<br/>
adding 1 second isn't enough :O
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:45:24 GMT):<br/>

for your certs

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:45:28 GMT):<br/>

Oh, hmm
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:46:20 GMT):<br/>
These were generated via fabric-ca - if that matters 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:49:18 GMT):<br/>
let me take a look at them
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:50:27 GMT):<br/>
ahhhhhh
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:50:34 GMT):<br/>
maybe it's because: `Not Before: Jun 13 18:50:00 2017 GMT`
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:50:40 GMT):<br/>
GMT?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:50:40 GMT):<br/>
isn't that... um
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:50:45 GMT):<br/>
heh 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:50:47 GMT):<br/>
wait a sec
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:51:44 GMT):<br/>
hmmm so when did you generate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:51:47 GMT):<br/>
these certificates
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:51:52 GMT):<br/>
did fabric-CA generate all of them?
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:52:04 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:52:32 GMT):<br/>
I just generated another batch, let me check the time in the cert vs time on my machine
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:52:45 GMT):<br/>
ah ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:52:47 GMT):<br/>
I have an idea
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:52:50 GMT):<br/>
why it doesn't work ;)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:52:52 GMT):<br/>
want to hear?
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:52:58 GMT):<br/>
Sure
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:53:01 GMT):<br/>
so the verification options
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:53:04 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking it's time zone related..
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:53:06 GMT):<br/>
are computed for your certificate right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:53:08 GMT):<br/>
nope
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:53:11 GMT):<br/>
I think it's something else
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:53:23 GMT):<br/>
ok, right
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:54:52 GMT):<br/>
ahh wait
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:54:55 GMT):<br/>
you have 2 certificates
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:55:12 GMT):<br/>
in the signcerts!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:55:15 GMT):<br/>
peer.pem and another one
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:55:18 GMT):<br/>
why do you have 2?
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:55:37 GMT):<br/>
No I don't :/
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:55:38 GMT):<br/>
so peer.pem ruins it all
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:55:45 GMT):<br/>
wait
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:56:04 GMT):<br/>
ah right
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:56:06 GMT):<br/>
sorry my mistake
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:56:09 GMT):<br/>
1 sec then
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:58:16 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:58:18 GMT):<br/>
solved it!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:58:24 GMT):<br/>
```
            Not Before: Jun 13 18:51:00 2017 GMT
            Not After : Jun 13 18:51:00 2018 GMT
```
this is the signing cert
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:58:38 GMT):<br/>
this is the intermediate cert
```
            Not Before: Jun 13 18:54:19 2017 GMT
            Not After : Jun 11 18:54:19 2027 GMT
```
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:58:49 GMT):<br/>
Oh...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:58:49 GMT):<br/>
```
            Not Before: Jun 13 18:50:00 2017 GMT
            Not After : Jun 12 18:50:00 2022 GMT
```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:58:53 GMT):<br/>
this is the root ca cert
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:59:00 GMT):<br/>
so when the cert is validated
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:59:07 GMT):<br/>
the whole chain (I think) is validated
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:59:14 GMT):<br/>
but the options are for the cert only
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:59:24 GMT):<br/>
so 1 second + `18:51:00`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:59:32 GMT):<br/>
is less than the intermediate cert
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:59:37 GMT):<br/>
I think that's the issue....
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:59:51 GMT):<br/>
let me try to make it 5 min + the time and see
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:00:56 GMT):<br/>
5 min works
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:02:04 GMT):<br/>
ah you tried?
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:02:05 GMT):<br/>
So somehow my int cert has a Not Before time that is after the Not Before time of the cert it signs...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:02:36 GMT):<br/>
I wonder how to fix this bug though.... I think maybe we should do something more smart than 1 second
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:02:41 GMT):<br/>
maybe for example iterate over the chain
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:02:45 GMT):<br/>
and compute the minimum
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:02:51 GMT):<br/>
to be the max of not before
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:03:00 GMT):<br/>
and the maximum to be the minimum of not after
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:03:43 GMT):<br/>
That would do it
</p>
<p><strong>farhan3</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:03:55 GMT):<br/>
I'll add 5 minutes for now though :D
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:04:14 GMT):<br/>
haha
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:04:38 GMT):<br/>
I'll open a JIRA and we'll fix it
</p>

Hi，everyone
     I read the source code of fabric and found that every connection can use SSL/TLS. Suppose that in situations where security requirement is high, all connections are configured to use SSL/TLS. Is it too “heavy” for the network of a lot of peers？ Or is there any solution for both performance and communication  confidentiality？

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 08:05:10 GMT):<br/>
Well since fabric, in contrast to web servers , use long-lasting TLS connections there isn't much performance penalty
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 08:05:20 GMT):<br/>
because the expensive crypto stuff are in the handshake
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 08:05:27 GMT):<br/>
after that you have symmetric encryption and decryption
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 08:17:34 GMT):<br/>
I think the right model to compare the performance overhead of TLS in fabric is not to web servers but to stuff like MQTT over TLS, there are reviews / studies on the internet

Is transient field supported in Alpha 1? We are looking to use the transient field in transaction proposal to pass in user role information for access control checks that chaincode needs to perform. Since Tcerts are not supported, this was the work around. If transient field is not supported, we may have to just pass in the role information in the operation signature (not ideal but again as a workaround for now).

Hello,
I am trying to use an external certificate. This PoC y use an OpenSSL server and I generate the intermediate cert and a cert.
In the msp, I put the intermediate cert in intermediatecerts folder and the device certificate in the cacerts folder. 
When I excecute the configtxgen tool, I get this error message:

"2017-06-15 19:07:12.881 CLT [configvalues/msp] TemplateGroupMSPWithAdminRolePrincipal -> CRIT 004 Setting up the MSP manager failed, err The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
panic: Setting up the MSP manager failed, err The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority" and the intermediatecerts folder not found.

Please, someone can help me o suggest me something.

By the way, I am using OpenSuSe and the fabric beta version.

Thanks

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 22:14:45 GMT):<br/>
@guillermo.correa  - you need to have the whole chain (i.e. both the root certificate as well as the intermediate root certificate) in the MSP.  The root certificate should go in `cacerts` and the intermediate should go in `intermediatecerts` . If you want the signed certificate to be  in the admin group, then add that to the `admincerts` folder

@mastersingh24 I'm running it on AWS RHEL instance. This is what i observed. The issue only when you bring up the network and try to connect and invoke a chaincode. I dont get the error after few mins. This may be due to some network is still running processes (some one mentioned clock synchronization  related issue).

Hey Ive done some changes in the crypto-config file and configtx file for customizing my own environment and organizations, Orderer genesis block, channel cofiguration(channel.tx) and anchor peer generation is correctly done, but at the beginning it threw a few warming/errors for certificate generations. I checked the folder I do see some pem files and certs if not all. What is it Im seeing and what couldve caused it?? Any help would be appreciated thanks.

What I found is that if the user is registered and enrolled within the first 4 minutes after building the network then I see the certificate error.  Waiting 5 minutes or more before registering/enrolling the user and the invoke works.  I created jira FAB-4825 for it.

Hi 
I am following the get started tutorial of Hyperledger
I am running the scripts manually instead of using network.sh up
However in the create & join the channel , while running the script to get channel-id.block I am getting the below error.

2017-06-15 20:18:45.664 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 006 Failed to dial orderer.example.com:7050: connection error: desc = "transport: authentication handshake failed: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid"; please retry.Error: Error connecting due to rpc error: code = Internal desc = connection error: desc = "transport: authentication handshake failed: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid"

Can someone please help to resolve this?

<p><strong>jtrayfield</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 17:23:22 GMT):<br/>
is this still accurate re the nonce?  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/stable/protocol-spec/#4-security_1
</p>
<p><strong>jtrayfield</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 17:23:51 GMT):<br/>
In the fabric, replay attack protection uses a hybrid approach. That is, users add in the transaction a nonce that is generated in a different manner depending on whether the transaction is anonymous (followed and signed by a transaction certificate) or not (followed and signed by a long term enrollment certificate). More specifically:

Users submitting a transaction with their enrollment certificate should include in that transaction a nonce that is a function of the nonce they used in the previous transaction they issued with the same certificate (e.g., a counter function or a hash). 
</p>
<p><strong>jtrayfield</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 17:24:26 GMT):<br/>
the nonce in TransactionID seems to be generated at random each time

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Sun, 18 Jun 2017 15:40:04 GMT):<br/>
@SotirisAlfonsos if the orderers all belong to the same organization, you can generate them by having the Orderers CA (from the MSP config) sign the certs for each orderer.
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Sun, 18 Jun 2017 15:53:10 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt hmm i was trying to work without an Orderer CA. I will try this approach. thanks

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 08:31:39 GMT):<br/>
but why can't you just expand the array of `- Hostname:`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 08:31:42 GMT):<br/>
won't that work?
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 08:36:19 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm No it did not work. But in that approach wouldn't we need a ca to validate the certs? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 08:36:51 GMT):<br/>
well cryptogen generates certs that are signed by the CA certs

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 23:26:41 GMT):<br/>
@rickr hey rick.  You can get the public key from the cert and create a verifying key.  Then sign a message with the private key, then ask the verffying key to verify the sig and data
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 23:35:35 GMT):<br/>
Jeff thanks, but was hoping for something less computationally expensive.  Like getting the d value for the private key if that's even possible and comparing that with some values obtainable from the public key. 

Yes, @berserkr  have certificate thus public and private key.

<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 00:05:35 GMT):<br/>
@rickr For RSA-based keys it is easier than ECDSA, follow the steps here for rsa: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/56697/determine-if-private-key-belongs-to-certificate, ecdsa: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/73127/how-can-you-check-if-a-private-key-and-certificate-match-in-openssl-with-ecdsa --- if within your code, you can use openssl bindings perhaps

1) Chaincode must be installed on each individual peer.  Only an administrator from peer's organization can install chaincode.  An administrator is defined as the holder of a certificate which is part of the admincerts for the peer's local MSP
You can find more details at http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4noah.html#installing-chaincode although it looks like the note in the last line about needing to be an admin should be highlighted
 
2)  In order to instantiate chaincode on a channel, the submitter of the transaction must be a member of an organization which is part of the channel (and have write access) and if you don't attach an instantiation policy must also again be an administrator for it's organization.   You can find more details at http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4noah.html#instantiate

@rickr : For elliptic curve , the D value of Private Key is unique and the public key is being computed by doing Group mathematics operation using Cuve base point and D. For that reason , in Go , Private Key object contains public key also.

@ashutosh_kumar I have been working with a partner on an opportunity where there was a stated requirement to integrate with an existing PKI solution, where I was told that the existing solution supported OAuth as the authentication mechanism.  Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Sat, 08 Jul 2017 02:17:14 GMT):<br/>
@tennenjl , oAuth is for authorization. OpenId connect uses openId for authentication and oAuth for authorization. Based on what you described , looks like MSP or elements that comprise MSP  is going to be used  as resource to be protected by oAuth. 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Sat, 08 Jul 2017 02:18:15 GMT):<br/>
It can be integrated outside of fabric. 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Sat, 08 Jul 2017 02:18:15 GMT):<br/>
It can be integrated outside of fabric meaning thereby Fabric will not act as oAuth Authorization Server.

yes, I know it, I'm confused with why it needs so many certificates and how the certificates effect, can give some introduction about this ? thanks@yacovm

Iam going through the official getting-started guide (hyperledger-fabric-rc1). I done it before  and its successful .but now when I run( in windows )  `./byfn.sh -m up -c mychannel`  getting an error ``` Cannot run peer because error when setting up MSP from directory /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp: err CA Certificate is not valid``` i had my crypto files. any help  with this 
</p>
<p><strong>jtrayfield</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 14:08:07 GMT):<br/>
I'm having trouble accessing the MSP.  I copied and pasted this code from msp_test.go:
	conf, err := msp.GetLocalMspConfig("/etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp", nil, "xxx")
	if err != nil {
		logger.Infof("Setup should have succeeded, got err %s instead", err)
		return
	}

but I get this error:

01:59:24.427 [main] main.go:874 INFO : Setup should have succeeded, got err Could not load a valid signer certificate from directory /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp/signcerts, err stat /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp/signcerts: no such file or directory instead

"ls" shows the directory exists.  Any ideas?

@jtrayfield Permissions issue maybe?
</p>
<p><strong>jtrayfield</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:15:28 GMT):<br/>
@farhan3 no, I think it's because the chaincode server must have had chroot() called when it started....

@jaswanth did you generate the crypto material beforehand? You have to run `./byfn.sh -m generate -c mychannel` once before you can run `up` or `down`
</p>
<p><strong>pschnap</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:19:29 GMT):<br/>
you may also have to install the crypto generation programs to get that work, see https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:38:44 GMT):<br/>
did you install via the directions here http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html#binaries ?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:39:18 GMT):<br/>
if so, then you will want to add <whereyouinstalledsamples>/bin to your PATH
</p>
<p><strong>VamsiKrishnak</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:41:08 GMT):<br/>
No, But after configuring fabric it should show. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:44:13 GMT):<br/>
after configuring fabric, meaning you deployed a network and it is not found inside the containers?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:45:22 GMT):<br/>
cryptogen and configtxgen etc are not included in the containers - they are distributed as platform-specific binaries
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:46:10 GMT):<br/>
we are working on developing platform-specific installers (e.g. Homebrew for Mac)

Hello, I'm looking at the bccsp implementation, and was wondering how certificate revocations are handled.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 14:13:15 GMT):<br/>
Like, does the bccsp instance get rebuilt in case the certs change?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 14:13:19 GMT):<br/>
How does it work?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 06:02:23 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 bccsp does not handle directly certificates. Are you referring to MSP? In that case, if the MSPs get reconfigured in a channel then when the committing peer will parse that configuration transaction, it will reload the MSPs
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 06:03:56 GMT):<br/>
for the local MSP on a peer, an administrator needs to change it manually and restart the peer
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 06:04:07 GMT):<br/>
does this answer your question?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 08:35:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it does. Thank you.

Hello all, I was facing some trouble regarding the certificates, 
I am running the java sdk client, and the whole setup that has been mentioned here, 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java
when I regenerate the certificates inside crypto-config using
build/bin/cryptogen generate --config crypto-config.yaml --output=crypto-config
I get the following error:
The ca containers stopped starting due to the following error:
The error the ca-service gives is this:
ca_peerOrg1               | Error: Failed to store certificate: open /etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config/ca.org1.example.com-cert.pem: read-only file system

After receiving this error, I changed inside some things inside the docker-compose file,
```

@Rachitga  - Hard to say what the issue is without your setup, but the "ro" versus "rw" leads me to believe that you might not have change the value of the value of the `--ca.keyfile` option in the command here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/master/src/test/fixture/sdkintegration/docker-compose.yaml#L15

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 14:31:49 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanTan this means that you have not signed the config update TX per the policy required

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 14:31:49 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanTan this means that you have not signed the config update TX per the policy required (In this case I assume the create channel request)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 14:33:04 GMT):<br/>
this is controlled by the channel creation policy specified for the consortium for which the channel is to be created

In Fabric 1.0, I would like to do access control, essentially certain peers should be able to invoke certain chaincode function. The way decribed in the example here: 
```func (t *SampleChaincode) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
    if function == "CreateLoanApplication" {
        username, _ := GetCertAttribute(stub, "username")
        role, _ := GetCertAttribute(stub, "role")
        if role == "Bank_Home_Loan_Admin" {
            return CreateLoanApplication(stub, args)
        } else {
            return nil, errors.New(username + " with role " + role + " does not have access to create a loan application")
        }
 
    }
    return nil, nil
}```https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-ibm-blockchain-chaincode-development-using-golang/index.html

Can I do this in 1.0 as well? I dont find any documentation on Tcerts (transaction certificates). Can anyone please point me out to examples? thanks

<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 03:45:41 GMT):<br/>
Hi @tallharish, TCerts are not supported directly by fabric. I think @smithbk can tell you more on this.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 03:46:42 GMT):<br/>
So far, what you can do with v1 is reasoning about the creator of the proposal. It is accessible via the GetCreator method

I am importing it like this `"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/vendor/github.com/golang/protobuf/proto"`. But the I see the following error on instantiating the chaincode: ```Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error starting container: Failed to generate platform-specific docker build: Error returned from build: 1 "package github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/tracking
	imports github.com/hyperledger/fabric/vendor/github.com/golang/protobuf/proto: use of vendored package not allowed```

	}
	// Map creator to serializedIdentity, and extract the MSP_ID

	si := &msp.SerializedIdentity{}
	err := proto.Unmarshal(creator, si)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err

@tallharish, please, import it without pointing the vendor folder. At the chaincode installation, the peer will figure out the dependencies automagically :)

Hi all , I am trying to create a new channel in balance transfer example from node sdk. I provided an mychanneltx.tx file in the channelConfigPath , i got `channel mychanneltx has created ` output . but when i try to join peers into the channel getting error ```Error: chaincode error (status: 500, message: Cannot create ledger from genesis block, due to LedgerID already exists)``` . Do i need an another genesis block ,if so can anyone suggest how can i create  it dynamically.
</p>
<p><strong>jaswanth</strong> (Mon, 24 Jul 2017 04:10:27 GMT):<br/>
and also I am using couchdb ..after mychanneltx channel created there is no new mychanneltx database .
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 24 Jul 2017 05:08:17 GMT):<br/>
it looks like you are submitting a create channel transaction for a channel name that already exists at the orderers.

Hi - Can I confirm that peers and orderers don't have or need a connection to fabric-ca? Is a connection only made to fabric-ca for issuing credentials (register/enroll) and from an admin to get the latest CRL which they update on the channel. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 24 Jul 2017 15:58:49 GMT):<br/>
yes, the peer and orderer have no means of using the CA

Hi all I'm trying to add a peer to a channel using
`peer channel join -b /etc/hyperledger/configtx/loyyal-genesis.block --logging-level=DEBUG`

It's giving the following error message
_Error: proposal failed (err: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = chaincode error (status: 500, message: "JoinChain" for chainID = testchainid failed because of validation of configuration block, because of Invalid configuration block, missing Application configuration group))_
I think it's coming from https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/d9c320297bd2a4eff2eb253ce84dc431ef860972/core/scc/cscc/configure.go#L180

<p><strong>tennenjl</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:08:25 GMT):<br/>
OK, I will reach out and also see if I can find some of the tests in JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:10:47 GMT):<br/>
sure thing https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4547 this was the tracker for the static scans... IBM ran its own pen testing of Fabric in our offering and Hyperledger is planning on having independent code audit and pen testing by a vendor in the next month or so on top of what we have already done

hi, when starting a CA server with  explicit --ca.certfile  and --ca.keyfile  options, aren't those values suppose to be reflected in the  CA config file? (fabric-ca-server-config.yaml)
</p>
<p><strong>uber.twin</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:46:23 GMT):<br/>
CA section looks like a default, i.e. 
```
ca:
  # Name of this CA
  name:
  # Key file (default: ca-key.pem)
  keyfile: ca-key.pem
  # Certificate file (default: ca-cert.pem)
  certfile: ca-cert.pem
  # Chain file (default: chain-cert.pem)
  chainfile: ca-chain.pem
```

<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 16:22:57 GMT):<br/>
hey all, what cryptography library does fabric leverage?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 16:26:39 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_   the crypto library in fabric is called `bccsp` (blockchain crypto service provider) and it uses the golang crypto library when it is configured in software mode, and it uses pkcs11 with plugin to https://github.com/miekg/pkcs11  when in HSM mode. 
  @vpaprots / @adc  please correct me if I'm wrong

Am I correct in assuming that, since admin roles are determined by doing a byte-for-byte analysis of certs in the admin certs directory, that enrolling with an admin identity in various places won't necessarily allow me to carry out admin role functions, since the provisioned certificate will be different each time?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 20:27:00 GMT):<br/>
That's correct - the admin role currently only applies to the fabric-ca itself when registering / enrolling users

Using the `fabric-ca-cryptogen.sh` script from a (still unmerged?) CR as a starting point, I've been modifying it so I can specify a custom configuration for each CA, though I'm getting errors from the orderer during channel creation: `UTC [cauthdsl] func2 -> ERRO 1b0 Principal deserialization failure (The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority) for identity 0a074f7267...`
</p>

I'm wondering how I would go about debugging this -- e.g. what identity was expected vs actually encountered, etc

The private-public cryptography that Hyperledger Fabric relies on is expected to be cracked within the next ten years using quantum computing (Shor's algorithm). Obviously, the same is true of most internet traffic. However, the difference is that while most internet traffic is only recorded when the NSA chooses to do so and the encrypted data is then only available to the NSA, blockchain by definition distributes and maintains copies of all the encrypted data at multiple nodes. Is there an exit strategy for the point in time when the encryption algorithms are no longer secure?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 09:40:30 GMT):<br/>
well but data is replicated only in the channel

<p><strong>rhudson</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 12:03:19 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the quick answer, now I understand the idea (I am new to Hyperledger). One more question: how does a channel differ from a completely separate blockchain instance? For example, are the hash values from each channel written to some sort of global channel or blockchain? If not, is not the problem that a channel sized based on confidentiality domains is likely to lack the scale to get the decentralized integrity benefits from blockchain?

@aso @adc @elli-androulaki may you take a look at the discussion in the change set please? 
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12077/
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:39:10 GMT):<br/>
As a little bit of background, my the goal of the CR series is to make the policy framework take identities instead of signatures.  

In my investigation @aso pointed me to

https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4252

which I thought had been resolved for the policy framework as a whole, but instead was apparently addressed as a special case of the SCC.  So, the v1 policy framework is in a position where it sometimes de-duplicates signatures, and sometimes does not.

The lack of deduplication in the framework at large was a problem which needs to be fixed, but, addressing it does change the policy semantics (honoring the contract, but breaking compatibility with v1).  Since it is breaking compatibility, it seemed prudent to make the other semantics more consistent.  So, this CR opts for making all 'non-well-formed' errors fatal.  In particular, if the message includes an identity which cannot be deserialized or a signature which cannot be verified, then the signature set is considered not to be well formed and discarded.

I think the real world implications of this compatibility breakage is quite low.  The vast majority of our policy checks are against a single signature which is unaffected by this change, and where signature sets which are well formed (ie, contain only valid signatures for valid identities), there are also no affects.  Still, this is a breaking change, and should require some thought and discussion.

We can... which is what I am pushing for? But since it is not done today, does break compatibility

I do not know.  Had I seen, this would have received a hard -2 from me.

The configtx code also deals with signature sets
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:55:34 GMT):<br/>
but de-duplication isn't equivalent to "if some signature is not verified- the rest are not evaluated and considered"
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:55:45 GMT):<br/>
This is true
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:56:20 GMT):<br/>
As I said, it was a decision that "while we are breaking compatibility, let's make the semantics better"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:56:42 GMT):<br/>
> The configtx code also deals with signature sets 
right, I forgot that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:57:34 GMT):<br/>
if we move the de-duplication from the VSCC to the policy - it doesn't break anything does it?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:57:42 GMT):<br/>
It breaks configtx processing
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:58:00 GMT):<br/>
is it a feasible use case though?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:58:18 GMT):<br/>
I mean - do the tools we have produce such use cases?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:59:35 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:00:42 GMT):<br/>
The default configuration for a channel with 2 or more members requires multiple signatures to change membership (and this is something many people have done)

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:01:49 GMT):<br/>

or do you claim, that if the policy is that only 1 valid sig is enough

> but the question is - how can they sign with signatures that some of them are not validated and some are?

As I pointed out above, if users are doing the 'right thing', their signature sets will be well formed, and you will see no difference from this CR series.

The only way a user should have a bad signature, is if they are doing something like signing the wrong bytes.  And the only way they should have a bad identity is if they try to use a user for an org not in the channel.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:05:27 GMT):<br/>
The only way you really see 'breakage' is if the signature set contains more signatures than necessary, but some of the signatures are wrong, or some of the identities are wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:06:35 GMT):<br/>
The latter seems the most likely case.  For someone doing lazy automation for instance, they might simply sign all config changes with all admins for all orgs.  It's a contrived example, and not a real world use case, but is the only sort of plausible explanation I see for including too many signatures (some of which are not valid in a channel)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 16:16:08 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 13:56:26 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick trying to digest, let me see if I got it. There are 2 issues on the table, namely, how should the new interface handle a signature set:
 - with duplicate identities
 - with incorrect signatures
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 13:56:48 GMT):<br/>
are they the right questions? Any other?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:01:23 GMT):<br/>
And one more implicit one:
- Can this behavior be different than v1 (especially in context that the v1 behavior is inconsistent/buggy)
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:03:27 GMT):<br/>
ok so, wrt `with duplicate identities`, just for the sake of discussion, what would happen if we accepted such a signature set, counting the duplicate identity only once?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:07:22 GMT):<br/>
Nothing earth shatteringly bad:

1. We'd waste some space storing a redundant signature
2. We'd allow a mild DOS attack vector for someone to include a single signature N times then force a complex policy to be evaluated over it many times.
3. We'd mask client bugs which are not following the correct endorsement/signing semantics (this is, I think the most serious problem)
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:09:09 GMT):<br/>
1. agreed
2. is that true, though? wouldn't the policy be evaluated on the (deduplicated) set of identities only? If we architect the deduplication code well, we'd detect the duplicate early on and skip signature verification
3. true, we could log it of course but God know whether anyone will read that
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:10:11 GMT):<br/>
2. Good point, if we are smart, we deduplicate before verifying signature.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:10:59 GMT):<br/>
2. This should be easy to do - I thought we already kinda did this but just a little further down today
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:11:50 GMT):<br/>
Agreed, (2) is a non-issue.  Really, (3) is the strongest motivation.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:13:12 GMT):<br/>
I'll add one more to your list @aso 
- with an identity for an msp ID unknown in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:13:12 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:13:44 GMT):<br/>
I think 3 is the biggest issue for both points
```
- with duplicate identities
- with incorrect signatures
```
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:13:59 GMT):<br/>
I don't really see any security issues otherwise
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:14:07 GMT):<br/>
So it seems like we have some (pre)processing to do
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:15:07 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12077/ implements this pre-processing as "all errors are fatal".  The problem is, this means a policy which evaluates to true in v1, may evaluate to false in v1.1.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:15:36 GMT):<br/>
The security issue, is that a clever person could tailor a transaction to be valid under v1 which is not valid under v1.1 by carefully violating the policy semantics
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:16:07 GMT):<br/>
but but.. we have a version number somewhere right?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:16:15 GMT):<br/>
I think it's mitigated by the fact that the submitter must be authorized on the channel, so this is not a vector for a random attacker.  But, it causes a problem in a mixed mode v1/v1.1 environment
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:17:15 GMT):<br/>
So give me an example of something that will pass with v1 and not with v1.1?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:17:28 GMT):<br/>
Someone gets two endorsements for the same tx from the same endorser
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:17:38 GMT):<br/>
(With an endorsement policy requiring one signature)
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:17:38 GMT):<br/>
(With an endorsement policy requiring one endorsement)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:17:59 GMT):<br/>
Why would this fail in v1.1?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:18:19 GMT):<br/>
If we declare duplicating identities to be a fatal error, rather than ignoring
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:18:42 GMT):<br/>
Ah - right - ok - wanted to make sure 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:18:49 GMT):<br/>
But why does it need to be fatal?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:19:09 GMT):<br/>
For example, can't we just filter them out but not throw a fatal error?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:19:35 GMT):<br/>
The crux is, that today, the only place deduplication is done, is in the VSCC, which means for any other part of the system which verifies signatures, there is no de-duplication.  So, if we change it to even filter them, you can still construct the identical attack
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:19:54 GMT):<br/>
My reasoning was, if we're going to be making an incompatible change that allows this attack, let's go all in and just fix it 'correctly'
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:20:12 GMT):<br/>
actually, I think v1 GA'd without that ugly code @jyellick 
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:20:21 GMT):<br/>
which is good
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:20:44 GMT):<br/>
that ugly code = the deduplication in vscc
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:21:02 GMT):<br/>
Although I hate that code... that actually makes our problem worse.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:21:16 GMT):<br/>
Deduplicating at all will cause this attack vector to open up.
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:21:29 GMT):<br/>
v1 GA'd with a restriction documented
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:21:52 GMT):<br/>
that said that it was illegal to use policies requiring multiple sigs from the same policy principal
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:22:05 GMT):<br/>
and no defensive code around that
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:22:15 GMT):<br/>
to enforce the restriction
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:23:11 GMT):<br/>
Wish I had not missed this discussion.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:23:45 GMT):<br/>
That mitigates things a bit
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:24:25 GMT):<br/>
so basically *IF* we stick to the restriction, any policies requiring multiple sigs is illegal in v1 -> undefined behaviour
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:24:38 GMT):<br/>
and we could enforce one that we like post v1
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:24:59 GMT):<br/>
if on the other hand we think someone might have used that feature, then we need to decide how to handle it
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:25:16 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately it still doesn't quite work.  A policy doesn't have to require multiple sigs from the same policy principal in order for a client to submit them.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:25:49 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick - I think I am missing something
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:26:16 GMT):<br/>
right, sorry, I've tentatively accepted that we shouldn't treat duplicate signatures as terminal errors @jyellick 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:26:31 GMT):<br/>
Are you trying to add a protection in v1.1 to prevent someone from overloading us with a ton of duplicate / bad signatures?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:27:00 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise, I'm not sure why we would need to treat dups as fatal?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:27:16 GMT):<br/>
We simply need to build up the unique / valid list
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:27:21 GMT):<br/>
How about the other three classes?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:27:50 GMT):<br/>
* duplicates

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:28:36 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:28:36 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it should be fatal

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:28:47 GMT):<br/>
You just filter those out of the input list
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:28:53 GMT):<br/>
you mean "should" right?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:29:16 GMT):<br/>
Or are they fatal today
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:29:18 GMT):<br/>
I think we have to reject bad signatures - otherwise anyone can fill the ledger with invalid txes 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:29:34 GMT):<br/>
OK
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:29:35 GMT):<br/>
Well, it wouldn't pass the policy with the bad signature
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:29:38 GMT):<br/>
well it is filled with MVCC invalid Txns now too
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:29:39 GMT):<br/>
no?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:29:44 GMT):<br/>
We would end up with an empty identity set, which doesn't pass
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:29:44 GMT):<br/>
what's the difference?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:29:58 GMT):<br/>
Difference is that at least the submitter mus be authorized on the channel
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:30:05 GMT):<br/>
right, I think the real point is 
* bad signature in otherwise good policy

yes.

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:32:10 GMT):<br/>
I think the cleanest behavior, is to reject.  As really, I see no way any of these should happen without buggy clients.  However, we didn't reject for v1, our mistake, so maybe we have to live with it.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:32:54 GMT):<br/>
there is a 3rd option in theory - make it configurable 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:32:58 GMT):<br/>
(not saying we should)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:33:17 GMT):<br/>
ah actually
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:33:19 GMT):<br/>
it's in VSCC
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:33:20 GMT):<br/>
so no 
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:33:28 GMT):<br/>
Why no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:33:40 GMT):<br/>
you're always thinking configuration via config block Jason
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:33:47 GMT):<br/>
I meant by mistake locally ;)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:33:58 GMT):<br/>
I think we shouldn't go that way
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:34:07 GMT):<br/>
but in theory one can add to the config block this
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:34:09 GMT):<br/>
so, to sum up, how about:
* duplicates -- (proposed we log+ignore)
* cannot be deserialized -- (propose we reject)
* not an MSP ID in this channel -- (propose we log+ignore)
* bad signature -- (propose we reject)
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:34:09 GMT):<br/>
so, to sum up, how about:
1 duplicates -- (proposed we log+ignore)

</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:34:30 GMT):<br/>
I say absolutely not
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:34:38 GMT):<br/>
Because we are breaking semantics if we do that
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:34:44 GMT):<br/>
Today, all 4 of those are non-fatal
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:34:55 GMT):<br/>
If we make any of them fatal, I say we make them all fatal
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:36:53 GMT):<br/>
yeah, you're right on this point
> we are breaking semantics if we do that
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:37:03 GMT):<br/>
In order to not break with the contract in v1.0.0, I think they all have to be non-fatal.  And, if we even get a release where we do not allow mixed-mode with an older release, we can revisit.
</p>

we could bump up the policy version
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:37:38 GMT):<br/>
and maintain backward compatibilty (not saying we should, it's an option though)
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:37:49 GMT):<br/>
We could.  But then you cannot run a mixed v1.0.x v1.1.x environment
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:38:30 GMT):<br/>
(As the v1.0.x clients would error trying to parse the newer policy structure)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:38:32 GMT):<br/>
policy version???
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:38:40 GMT):<br/>
what's that?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:38:41 GMT):<br/>
There is a version in the policy field
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:38:41 GMT):<br/>
There is a version in the policy message
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:38:55 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, couldn't you? a v1.X peer would understand both policies and honor each type; a v1.0 peer would only understand its type
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:38:55 GMT):<br/>

So the v1.0 peer would reject the tx, and the v1.1 would accept it, and the state diverges
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:40:33 GMT):<br/>
in a transition of this kind (which we'll have to go through eventually), all clients would only be entitled to use new features when all peers are running the new version
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:42:00 GMT):<br/>
but at any rate, I don't think we should use the version option
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:42:15 GMT):<br/>
for this kind of behaviour, it seems an overkill

<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:42:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:42:58 GMT):<br/>
We can always have different VSCC
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:43:00 GMT):<br/>
exactly, upgrading fabric and enabling new features should be handled carefully
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:43:18 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately the VSCC today is a bit tangled
</p>

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:43:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:44:50 GMT):<br/>
Also - when it comes to validating blocks, there are two things:

1) New inbound blocks
2) Ledger replay / sync based on state transfer
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:45:08 GMT):<br/>

</p>

agreed; I expect  an update will happen in 2 stages
 - stage 1: updating. The network has peers of version n and n+1. All peers of version n+1 should behave in compat mode
 - stage 2: committing the update. When all peers have been updated to version n+1, they can begin to behave in the "new" mopde

</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:47:05 GMT):<br/>
Actually it may be that the network of peers need to have all n +1 versions supported (no?) cause they may be two or more versions back

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:47:08 GMT):<br/>
Hopefully we can also leverage chaincode version to map back to the point in time policies and VSCC in play at the time

a SYSCC is a per-peer entity

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:47:20 GMT):<br/>
if you upgrade it that'd lead to forks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:47:45 GMT):<br/>
or if done correctly - with changing the `vscc` property in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:47:51 GMT):<br/>

not if you upgrade with the 2 stages I suggested above (I hope)
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:47:52 GMT):<br/>
I would see a similar process as with chaincode upgrade to need to take place
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:47:54 GMT):<br/>
that would lead for peers unable to validate
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:48:50 GMT):<br/>
Okay, so to quickly return to the original point.  The conclusion is -- *treat all signature set errors as non-fatal* -- perhaps re-address in the future once we've sorted upgrade out.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:49:13 GMT):<br/>
so back to the original semantics, Jason?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:49:19 GMT):<br/>
Correct
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:49:30 GMT):<br/>
But we'll optimize the processing?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:49:42 GMT):<br/>
Yes, will still restructure the processing, consolidate the checks as the CR series does
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:49:48 GMT):<br/>
Cool
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:49:51 GMT):<br/>
Will just convert the errors in that path to warnings
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:49:52 GMT):<br/>
We really need that

with the significant difference that we deduplicate identities, right?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:50:13 GMT):<br/>
Right now, the difference between 1 and 6 endorsers is pretty bad
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:50:25 GMT):<br/>
performance wise
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 14:51:51 GMT):<br/>
@aso

> with the significant difference that we deduplicate identities, right?

Yes.  Since we doc-ed that this for endorsement policy, we should be okay.  There is the problem that the configtx did not doc this, and it supports multi-sig sets.  However, I do not think anyone is setting their own admin policies yet, and even if they were, it would require a conspiracy of channel admins to fork the channel, which seems like an acceptable security risk.

<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:08:40 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick @elli-androulaki @mastersingh24 
I checked and - sigh - the ugly vscc dedup code is indeed part of v1 :(
which complicates things
because it does two things
 ```

		serializedIdentity := &msp.SerializedIdentity{}
		if err := proto.Unmarshal(endorsement.Endorser, serializedIdentity); err != nil {
			logger.Errorf("Unmarshal endorser error: %s", err)
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("Unmarshal endorser error: %s", err)
		}

```
so bad identity is fatal

duplicate identity isn't
 ```

			// Endorsement with the same identity has already been added
			logger.Warningf("Ignoring duplicated identity, Mspid: %s, pem:\n%s", serializedIdentity.Mspid, serializedIdentity.IdBytes)
			continue
		}

```
bad identity being fatal is in contradiction with what the rest of the system does...
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:10:10 GMT):<br/>
Indeed @aso, this complicates things considerably... so we do have inconsistent policy behavior in the system.  And if we standardize it either way, we introduce an incompatibility
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:11:22 GMT):<br/>
I'm not too worried about silently discarding duplicate identities
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:12:14 GMT):<br/>
the issue is that v1 rejects endorsements with identities that cannot be deserialized
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:12:39 GMT):<br/>
It's ok to keep that behavior in v1.1 then?
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:13:06 GMT):<br/>
I guess we have no other choice..
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:14:00 GMT):<br/>
otherwise a v1.1 peer and a v1 peer will disagree on the validity of a ledger

if and when we modify that behaviour

</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:18:05 GMT):<br/>
however, currently every cc lists in its lscc entry only the name of its vscc

and not its version
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:18:34 GMT):<br/>
that's fine
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:18:44 GMT):<br/>
we can register new vscc with diffeent name
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:18:44 GMT):<br/>
we can register new vscc with different name
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:18:47 GMT):<br/>
the new VSCC could be called vscc.1

</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:19:02 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:20:23 GMT):<br/>
so, do we agree that we go ahead with the policy framework change we suggested before (=treat all signature set errors as non-fatal) + keep this "feature" in the current version of VSCC?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 09:46:12 GMT):<br/>
please, may you clarify again the reasons why the validation should not fail if an identity does not parse or there is a duplication?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:04:00 GMT):<br/>
my 5 cents, if a client submits something that contains invalid parts, that something should be rejected and the client punished in some way 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:04:32 GMT):<br/>
@adc - If we are able to implement the "new" processing rules in a new VSCC, then I suppose we can change the "rules" to be whatever we want.

If we believe that duplicate identities and non-parseable identities are an attack vector (e.g. someone just loads up a transaction with a large number of duplicate endorsements or bad identities), then failing makes sense.   
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:05:02 GMT):<br/>
the client has the tools to verify the validity of what it is submitting, no?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:05:24 GMT):<br/>
Yes - the client can indeed do this
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:05:36 GMT):<br/>
indeed
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:06:10 GMT):<br/>
so, the VSCC in v1 does not reject always. This is the issue?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:06:31 GMT):<br/>
I'm fine as long as we ensure that transactions submitted under the current rules will be processed under the current rules and transactions submitted when the 1.1 rules are in place will be processed with the 1.1 rules
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:07:13 GMT):<br/>
In v1 I think it only rejects when it can't parse an identity (and of course when the policy is not met)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:07:55 GMT):<br/>
To be honest, we could likely get away with changing the rules given that it's HIGHLY unlikely that we'll see duplicate identities in the existing records
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:08:20 GMT):<br/>
if we finally add versioning to the protobuf messages then, it should become easier to which VSCC to default
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:08:20 GMT):<br/>
I see
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:08:22 GMT):<br/>
BUT - I really do like going down the path of adding a new VSCC to change the rules
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:08:48 GMT):<br/>
VSCC is assigned to chaincode during instantiation
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:09:01 GMT):<br/>
So it's already associated with the CC lifecycle record
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:09:51 GMT):<br/>
Although I'm not sure if we actually serialize the default or just use the default if it's not there
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:10:02 GMT):<br/>
I agree that it would be better to not add another default VSCC
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:11:14 GMT):<br/>
got it, @aso pointed to the code that tells us that duplications are not a problem in v1
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:11:55 GMT):<br/>
I have now the full picture, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:12:44 GMT):<br/>
@adc - while I have you, got time for a few questions on some other topics?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:20:56 GMT):<br/>
One of the *biggest* pain points right now is the chicken and egg problem with admincerts for local MSPs and also in general the issue of "distributing" local MSPs to peers

So a couple of thoughts comes to mind:

1) We could allow a peer to boot with a local MSP that does not contain admincerts (this would be nice because we could then embed the fabric-ca-client in the peer image and peers would then be able to enroll and populate their local MSP with everything except admincerts

2) We would then provide an API to for updating the admincerts  (could also be more broadly for updating the MSP in general which we also need)

3) But this of course presents a problem in that we need to provide some type of authentication mechanism for this API in the case where admincerts is not populated

I've been thinking that we could off a one-time password scheme here but looking for other options
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:20:56 GMT):<br/>
*Question 1* 
One of the *biggest* pain points right now is the chicken and egg problem with admincerts for local MSPs and also in general the issue of "distributing" local MSPs to peers

So a couple of thoughts comes to mind:

1) We could allow a peer to boot with a local MSP that does not contain admincerts (this would be nice because we could then embed the fabric-ca-client in the peer image and peers would then be able to enroll and populate their local MSP with everything except admincerts

2) We would then provide an API to for updating the admincerts  (could also be more broadly for updating the MSP in general which we also need)

3) But this of course presents a problem in that we need to provide some type of authentication mechanism for this API in the case where admincerts is not populated

I've been thinking that we could off a one-time password scheme here but looking for other options
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:21:28 GMT):<br/>
(in the case where admincerts is populated, clearly we can protect the peer admin API with admincerts)
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:32:52 GMT):<br/>
interesting and dangerous at the same time
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:33:25 GMT):<br/>
the one-time password might be a solution but then you already know that the passwords used will be 12345, right?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:34:20 GMT):<br/>
we might say that admincerts do not need to be valid msp identities 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:34:44 GMT):<br/>
so one can put a self signed cert as admincert to authenticate the first time as admin and then it will be replaced
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:35:02 GMT):<br/>
That's another option as well

</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:35:34 GMT):<br/>
if there is an ldap in the system that can be leveraged 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:35:43 GMT):<br/>
I was going to basically allow you to specify the one time password as part of the config and require that it actually be a hash
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:36:00 GMT):<br/>
Right - the other option is to allow non-cert based auth for the API
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:36:07 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:36:11 GMT):<br/>
that might be an option
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:36:21 GMT):<br/>
we can equip the peer with other MSP implementations
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:36:43 GMT):<br/>
And yet another option is to allow you to specify an attribute/role rather than an explicit public cert?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:36:59 GMT):<br/>
OK - I have enough to go on
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:37:07 GMT):<br/>
Will create a JIRA and present some options
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:37:59 GMT):<br/>
yeah, but we need a way to verify that the caller has that role
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:38:10 GMT):<br/>
but why not, in principal at least
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:38:15 GMT):<br/>
;)
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:39:17 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:40:14 GMT):<br/>
*Question 2*

Encrypting the payloads and/or values sent to the orderer

In the case of encrypting the values (and even the keys if desired), I see that we have a dilemma in distributing the encryption key(s)
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:41:23 GMT):<br/>
indeed
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:41:40 GMT):<br/>
The same if we want to encrypt the entire payload that is signed and sent to the orderer as well
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:42:28 GMT):<br/>
yeah, this requires a deep dive
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:42:36 GMT):<br/>
one solution is the one proposed by SideDB
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:42:45 GMT):<br/>
so, hashes are sent to the orderders 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:42:45 GMT):<br/>
so, hashes are sent to the orderers 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:43:17 GMT):<br/>
and then there is the replication among the endorsers of the private values
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:43:26 GMT):<br/>
still not clear what the other committing peers will validate then
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:43:28 GMT):<br/>
Sure - and we can take that a slightly different direction where we don't have secret data as well but still send the hashes only
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:44:37 GMT):<br/>
as a side note, hashes need to be computed with some salt otherwise they might be used to perform some brute force attack if the hashed message does not contain enough entropy
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:45:17 GMT):<br/>
another interesting direction might be of implementing the enigma protocol on top of fabric
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 10:45:30 GMT):<br/>
but that is more complex I would say :)

I'm just speculating now
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 11:05:59 GMT):<br/>
So here was my thought on this one (for the more general solution for sending hashes but actually ending up with data on the public ledger and public state database (as opposed to the private ones in sidedb)):

1)  Basically, when we prepare the response we send to the client rather than actual serializing the ChaincodeAction and including it in the ProposalResponsePayload, we'll actually just include the hash of it

2) Now we'll basically need to store the serialize ChaincodeAction locally at the endorser (as well as gossip it to other members of the channel) (this is the equivalent of how sidedb deals with private RWSets)

3) Client packages up the endorsement response as usual and send to the orderer

4) Peers receive blocks with these transactions in them (we can decide how we'll indicate these types of transactions)

5) Peer checks to see if it has the associated ChaincodeAction data locally and if not requests it from other peer(s) in the channel

6) Now we can of course process this just like normal since we have all the pieces

7) Updating the state store remains the same, but now when we actually serialize the block we can actually inject the ChaincodeAction data back into the structure

8) Block validation rules would mean you have to have this data plus you do the hash and sign the hash to validate the transactions in the block  (or something like that)

Hello, I was wondering how the cryptogen utility names a private key? I've been walking through the sample networks and can't seem to find any reference to the *_sk file names in any corresponding X.509 certificates. How would I match a certificate to its corresponding key? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:00:54 GMT):<br/>
@sklump it matches cryptographically, i.e. with a priv key you can sign the message and only with the matching pub key you can validate it
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:07:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that much is clear. For example, I've generated a first-network via byfn.sh (calling cryptogen) and am in first-network/crypto-config/.
find . -name '*_sk' | grep -iP 'A5.*DD'
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:07:33 GMT):<br/>
gives back
./peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/msp/keystore/a5dd6ee681e48c51595349cf9a765a61c8589dcf7e2bfeefa182e2e550b8fc8c_sk
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:08:08 GMT):<br/>
great, now to find what certificate corresponds to it?
for X in $(find . -name *.pem); do openssl x509 -in $X -noout -text | grep -liP 'A5.*DD'; done
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:08:25 GMT):<br/>
correction for X in $(find . -name \*.pem); do openssl x509 -in $X -noout -text | grep -liP 'A5.*DD'; done
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:08:41 GMT):<br/>
(sorry, the markup takes the star)
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:09:20 GMT):<br/>
Anyway, nothing comes back in openssl x509 showing anything like the name in *_sk and I'd like to know how cryptogen builds it?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:09:35 GMT):<br/>
but cryptogen always generates a key in msp/keystore and corresponding cert in msp/signcerts
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:10:58 GMT):<br/>
So in this case, peer0.org1.example.com-cert.pem matches the key in ./peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/msp/keystore/.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:11:35 GMT):<br/>
I want to add a peer organization - does the name of the private key file matter to the network?

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:13:21 GMT):<br/>
@sklump  1) yes, 2) no
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:19:53 GMT):<br/>

https://github.com/ChoiSD/how-to-Hyperledger-Fabric/blob/master/Docs/Add-Peer-On-Existing-Org.md

 I have modified the first network
• Generated certificates and channel artifacts in the first machine with configtx and crypto-config yaml files (which contains both the org details,the 4 nodes & one Orderer) by running the command ./byfn.sh –m generate
• Updated docker-compose-cli, docker-compose-couch, docker-compose-e2e-template and docker-compose-base yaml files to contain first org, 2 peer nodes and 1 Orderer.
• Started the network (First Org with 2 nodes and Orderer) in the first machine by running the command ./byfn.sh –m up
• Copied the generated certificates and the channel artifacts in to the second machine
• Updated docker-compose-cli, docker-compose-couch, docker-compose-e2e-template and docker-compose-base yaml files to contain second org, 2 peer nodes and without Orderer.
• Did not call CreateChannel function in script.sh file. Commented out.
• Started the network (Second Org with 2 nodes without Orderer) in the second machine by running the command ./byfn.sh –m up
• Got the exception “Error: genesis block file not found open mychannel.block: no such file or directory” during Channel Join Operation. 
Can you please tell me how to resolve this issue?

Good morning everyone !
I have a question.
I'm trying to build a blockchain application with hyperledger fabric.
I used cryptogen to generate the crypto materials for my orderers and my peers, and I wrote my chaincode program and tested it with the command line 'peer' executable.
Now I'm trying to write a client app to query the chaincode with the Node SDK. I don't understand how to use the crypto-material generated with cryptogen in order to authenticate a user, and not being pushed out by the network every time I try to transact with the blockchain.

In the 'query.js' file of the 'fabcar' app example, the crypto material used to authenticate the user is located in the network/creds directory.
There are three files in this directory one private key, one public key and one json file containing a key, but again I don't understand where these crypto-materials are coming from.

Does anyone ever leverage the crypto-material generated with the cryptogen within a Node SDK hyperledger fabric application ?

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 12 Aug 2017 18:27:49 GMT):<br/>
@viampietro @berserkr  -  If you want to use the material generated by cryptogen with the NodeSDK, you can use the https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/Client.html#createUser__anchor method of the SDK which allows you to specify existing key and cert files

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 13 Aug 2017 15:39:31 GMT):<br/>
it's a similar process of doing a channel reconfiguration
</p>

<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 16 Aug 2017 16:13:01 GMT):<br/>
@vdods , the TLS version has been set to 1.2 on Server. Make sure your client is on that level.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 16 Aug 2017 16:16:12 GMT):<br/>
the best way to debug this problem is to start with TLS level. Cipher suite approach will be much more difficult.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=SQJTnZteKSBqyzNAG) @mastersingh24 Okay, a certificates were generated for the admin user and nodes {orderers,peers}. Unfortunately I cant share the openssl commands, I created csr's and the certificates were generated/signed elsewhere. So i created a folder msp and 3 sub-folders (admincerts,cacerts,tlscacerts) and set the path in the MSPDIR under the ordererOrg in configtx.yaml. The contents of the sub-folders corresponded with the certs that were given back to me.

> openssl command for elliptic curve does not seem to be straightforward
here's an example of how I do it, might be useful for others
```
# generate ca private key
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -out $curveParamFile
openssl ecparam -in $curveParamFile -genkey -noout -out $cakeyFile

# generate ca cert
openssl req -config $confFile -key $cakeyFile -new -x509 -days 7300 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out $cacertFile -subj "/O=$orgName/OU=$orgName/CN=CA"

  # generate the signing key for this entity
  keyFile=$kyDir/key-$entity.pem
  openssl ecparam -in $curveParamFile -genkey -noout -out $keyFile

  # generate CSR for the entity
  csrFile=$entityDir/csr.pem
  openssl req -key $keyFile -new -sha256 -out $csrFile -subj "/O=$orgName/OU=$orgName/OU=$entity/CN=$entity"
  
  # issue a certificate for this entity
  certFile=$ceDir/cert-$entity.pem
  openssl ca -config $confFile -extensions usr_cert -days 7300 -md sha256 -in $csrFile -out $certFile -batch -notext
```
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Sun, 20 Aug 2017 06:23:31 GMT):<br/>
@eetti: if you want to parse a cert with openssl:
```
openssl x509 -in $cert -noout -text
```
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 20 Aug 2017 17:06:57 GMT):<br/>
@eetti  - I have not been able to produce the exact issue, but some research shows that the issue was likely with the fact that your private key file was generated with ecparams.  You'll want to use the `-noout` option when generating the EC private key.   Also, FYI - once you get past that issue you'll hit another:  fabric does not support `secp256k1` curves - only the default curves provides by the Go (which are the FIPS curves) are supported - typically p256 and p384.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=Do8Bz6jTL4yQkGi8c) @mastersingh24 That's very true, I created the private key with ecparams. Thanks a lot, I will create new csr's and generate the private key without ecparams. Then make sure I use either prime256v1/secp384r1/secp521r1 .

Hi.. I'm using the byfn.sh scripts to generate the certs which use the cryptogen tool.   When the certs are generated, despite the cert date saying it's valid immediately, it keeps being unusable for 5 min.. has anyone seen this behaviour?  Is this normal?

</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 12:05:32 GMT):<br/>
exactly the same as on your host?
</p>
<p><strong>stanacton</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 12:05:42 GMT):<br/>
yes, but UTC time.  
</p>
<p><strong>stanacton</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 12:05:52 GMT):<br/>
the Cert is in UTC time too

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 12:06:19 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>stanacton</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 12:07:01 GMT):<br/>
yes.  It always set the valid from time/date to when I generated it.

great question.  I don't know.  It is ok for a normal scenario, but I want to be able to spin up networks and pull them down to do Testing..  but if I have to wait 5 min each iteration, then it's a pain.

<p><strong>stanacton</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 12:15:00 GMT):<br/>
I think you're right that it might be the fabric-sdk...  When the install scripts run from the CLI tools container, they can use the Certs fine... it's only when I run the SDK from the host it doesn't work for 5 min.

<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 21:56:38 GMT):<br/>
For the first error , you need to put your self signed cert in the msp/cacerts directory.If you follow the @aso directions , you'll get cert issued by your local CA. In that case , you need to put your local CA cert in msp/cacerts directory.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 21:58:29 GMT):<br/>
what did you use to sign TLS cert ? openssl ? Looks like you are not setting up KeyUsage extension correctly.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 22:45:02 GMT):<br/>
key usage extension defines what purposes this certificate can be used for

for example- client authentication, server authentication, etc. etc.

I checked the cert it has X509v3 Subject Key Identifier and it matches to the root certs authority Key Identifier
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 06:16:02 GMT):<br/>
`CA Certificate did not have the Subject Key Identifier extension` means that your CA cert - whatever it is - does not have this extension
```
        X509v3 extensions:
...
            X509v3 Subject Key Identifier: 
                17:67:42:3D:AA:9E:82:3F:C4:C5:1D:9F:5B:C3:99:D1:B5:9C:48:10
```
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Tue, 22 Aug 2017 06:16:45 GMT):<br/>
@eetti try to inspect your cert with `openssl x509 -in your_cacert_file -noout -text`

Hi all I was directed here for this question. I was wondering if there is any work in place to prevent the owner of a peer, or an attacker who has managed to gain access to a peer, to enter the currently running chaincode container (via docker exec) and simply replacing the existing binary with their own, thus allowing any chaincode to run without other parties' knowledge?

hello，are transaction certs  used in fabric 1.0? can we know who sign a transaction just from the signature  signed by the transaction cert? Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 07:15:55 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=JoatX34uDKBL8Pxcz) @ajp No, a malicious admin is free to tamper with its own peer (and so is an attacker who has gained control of the peer). However by replacing the chaincode you don't gain much *IF* endorsement policies require signatures from more than one organization. The rogue chaincode will produce different results than those produced by honest peers, and so the transaction will not be endorsed.
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 07:17:54 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=TTCyhz3Qpj8Dkqpnx) @qsmen In v1, certificates used by entities that transact are long-term ones and so they can be used to identify the transactor and link their transactions. There are plans to integrate one-time use certificates (aka tcerts) or idemix to resolve these issues.

@wy it's the identity certificate of the admin user, it is used to sign proposals and transactions when you send them to peers. Peers will verify that this certificate belongs to one of the known MSPs. Peer chaincode can retrieve this certificate with stub.GetCreator() and e.g. perform an access control.

@DarshanBc Which certificate are you using? Because the error says "certificate is not for signing", so looks like you are trying to use the wrong certificate.

@Vadim I dont know which is being used what I did is I deleted crypto-config  and /tmp/fabric-client-kvs_peerOrg2 directory and ran this command `cryptogen generate --config=./cryptogen.yaml` after that I a trying to run node app of balance transfer module

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=hN96K7JjRGcDKBH82) @DarshanBc I was getting the same error this morning. i haven't found a resolution yet. My guess is that the tls certs is not created properly. So how do we create tls certs for Fabric CA server.
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 11:52:10 GMT):<br/>
@etti I ceated using cryptogen tool

<p><strong>rhudson</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:45:57 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone, I am trying to set up a Fabric demo with multiple organisations. In my setup each organisation has its own root CA both for signing blockchain messages and for TLS and I have come up against the problem of specifying multiple TLS root CAs to peers. Unlike at the corresponding position in orderer.yaml, there only seems to be the possibility to specify a single value under CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE in core.yaml. So how do I start a peer with multiple TLS root CAs? I am very new to hyperledger, so apologies in advance if I have misunderstood what is going on. Could it also be that the certificates are actually loaded directly from the MSP path and that I have somehow messed up with the file paths?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:48:51 GMT):<br/>
Why would you want a peer with multiple TLS root CAs @rhudson  ? Does your org have 2 TLS root CAs?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:49:21 GMT):<br/>
the TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE applies only to peers in your org
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:49:39 GMT):<br/>
not of other orgs- these are updated at runtime when they join channels that have other orgs
</p>
<p><strong>rhudson</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:57:00 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm, thankyou very much for the rapid response! I have now realised that I had misunderstood how the gossip bootstrapping worked (I have just read the relevant comment in core.yaml) and had a peer in one organisation trying to bootstrap to a peer in another organisation. I got an error about TLS root CAs which is why I thought that was my problem.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:57:23 GMT):<br/>
hmm ok
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:57:38 GMT):<br/>
@eetti  I Think we need to  change ` - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_KEYFILE=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config/0e729224e8b3f31784c8a93c5b8ef6f4c1c91d9e6e577c45c33163609fe40011_sk` in docker-compose.yaml its hard coded so i we change ....._sk to currently generated one it may work I figured but did't try please try and let me know if it works 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:57:49 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand what you're trying to say, but I hope I helped you
</p>
<p><strong>rhudson</strong> (Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:58:53 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm, definitely, you have solved my problem, we can leave it at that unless it would be helpful to anyone else for me to elaborate.

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 20:12:12 GMT):<br/>
@eetti TLS verifies the certificate by hostname, and you are connecting with an IP address instead of a hostname.  Try using the hostname as defined in the TLS cert.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 20:23:36 GMT):<br/>
Or alternatively you can generate the TLS certificates with ip addresses.
If you're using cryptogen - the master branch version already supports that

@jyellick @yacovm I had to set the environment variable for the peer `CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT` to false. I also had to set the hostname for the docker container and I added the address and host ip to the hosts file. Then everything worked. I don't know if I needed to do all this extra config but the chaincode container has now been created with no errors.

@jyellick, idemix msp as of now has different semantics for identity validity function indeed. This is to be changed and https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6044 covers this aspect. We essentially found a way to allow idemix identity validation to be properly assessed via identity structure that would allow us to also run the satisifesPrincipal with the given interface. 

Regarding your old CRs, we need to think if we wish to remove the signatures entirely from policy evaluation function, or convert signatures to "Opts" that would be optionally passing in signatures, timestamps, and/or other parameters. 
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sun, 10 Sep 2017 09:50:08 GMT):<br/>
This would allow us to do policy evaluation and message authentiaction at the same time.

> We essentially found a way to allow idemix identity validation to be properly assessed via identity structure that would allow us to also run the satisifesPrincipal with the given interface. 
So the idea here is that `Validate` and `SatisfiesPrincipal` are redundant checks? (I believe they are in the X.509 case as well?).  I know we already have a cache for identity validation, it seems like maybe it is not such a big deal to perform things 2x if the second time will simply hit the cache?

> Regarding your old CRs, we need to think if we wish to remove the signatures entirely from policy evaluation function,
To me, it seems like a good separation of concerns.  It simplifies the code by removing the complexity of three different types of failure "bad identity", "bad signature", and "wwrong identity", down to simply checking for "wrong identity".

> or convert signatures to "Opts" that would be optionally passing in signatures, timestamps, and/or other parameters.
I'm quite wary of this approach.  As soon as it's not immediately clear how to take a signature set, and validate it against a policy (ie, do we set opt A? how about opt B? etc.) I think we are likely to end up getting it wrong and introducing non-determinism into the validation path.

> This would allow us to do policy evaluation and message authentiaction at the same time.
Is this a goal purely for efficiency? If so, I would again point towards caching techniques as perhaps a better solution so that the code is conceptually simpler.

<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 08:25:30 GMT):<br/>
>So the idea here is that `Validate` and `SatisfiesPrincipal` are redundant checks? 
Not sure what you mean by "redundant checks". 
 - Validate checks that an identity has been constructed given the rules of the MSP it claims to be a member of. 
 - SatisfiesPrincipal checks that the identity conforms to some principal, that can be a member, admin, OU-member, (in the near future) client, peer, (in the far future) owner of certain attributes. It extends identity validate to the extend one could merge the two in one call.
 
> To me, it seems like a good separation of concerns.
Agreed. But, there is a caveat: separation of concerns works only if people know how to combine them to achieve the intended result. And interfaces need to smartly built to disallow people to do at least "easy" mistakes. That's what we are trying to avoid.

> As soon as it's not immediately clear how to take a signature set, and validate it against a policy (ie, do we set opt A? how about opt B? etc.) I think we are likely to end up getting it wrong and introducing non-determinism into the validation path.
I don't think i fully understand this. The validation logic we will be writing, properly using the interfaces. Therefore non-determinism would not be an issue. The interfaces of the MSP though could be used by the chaincodes later in time, and this is where we want to protect them from not doing things right.

Hi everyone, a quick question about the cryptography standards Fabric supports. So far I have only managed to get things working with the two NIST-standard elliptic curves. Attempting to use other elliptic curves leads to an error message that they are not supported. However, the standard NIST curves are widely regarded as suboptimal and might be expected to leave data open to examination by the NSA. Is there any way of using Fabric with other elliptic curves, and, if not, where do I place an appropriate feature request?

Hello guys,
I am trying to deploy an hyperledger fabric instance through a docker orchestrator that doesn't support dots in the containers-names. (peer0.org1.example.com doesn't works)
I already tryed to change only the name of the containers but it seems that this modification raise some certificates errors.
Here is the question: 
Is it possible to avoid setting Domain Names in the crypto-config.yaml when running the cryptogen tool to generate certificates.
(I already try to simply remove the Domain Name in the crypto-config.yaml. The cryptogen tool set the certificate paths and the name as follows: "peers/peer1./..." and "tlsca.-cert.pem")
any advices are welcome 🙂
thanks

<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 10:08:24 GMT):<br/>
@rhudson, Fabric crypto operations are performed by a component called blockchain crypto service provider (BCCSP). The software implementation of BCCSP allows for the two curves that you mentioned, but one could either enhance the existing one to support more/different curves.

For this feature requests we use jira. You can for example create a jira item (as "new feature") here https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=65&view=planning.nodetail, listing fabric-crypto among the affected components.

Perhaps the HSM confusion (in my head at least) is around the fact that BCCSP is a stand-alone package that is only sharing a project space with Fabric. It is not *a part* of fabric, it is *used* by fabric. Yes, BCCSP is tested against softhsm2, but fabric itself has not been tested with it. It seems that there are gaps that need to be closed before one we declare that Fabric supports PKCS11?

Thanks for your answer.
Everything is working fine now.

@gbolo is basically alluding to the answer here (you cannot use statically compile binaries and PKCS#11 together)

hello, question regarding the signing the certificate of one organization's admin and most importantly with TLS enabled. I see that the CN is ca.organization bla bla.. but is it possible to change it at the moment of certificate generation (using cryptogen) into tlsca.organization bla bla? because when I try to issue an identity, Admin doesn't recognize the tlsca as the correct CA but searches for the ca.

Hi all, are ECDSA keys still the only supported key type, or are RSA keys supported yet?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=jZ7imRby28C6xzLwe) @mastersingh24 Apparently, one cannot take an official fabric image and use it with PKCS11. Given that Fabric is advertised as having PKCS11 support, what is a recommended approach to configuring fabric with PKCS11 in production?

Hi all, I'm trying to get fabric-ca-server up and running using a cert/key pair that I've generated myself via openssl. However, I get the following error:
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 22:22:02 GMT):<br/>
`Error: Validation of certificate and key failed: Invalid certificate and/or key in files '/fabric-ca-server/ca.cert.pem' and '/fabric-ca-server/ca.key.pem': Failed parsing EC private key: asn1: structure error: tags don't match (16 vs {class:0 tag:6 length:8 isCompound:false}) {optional:false explicit:false application:false defaultValue:<nil> tag:<nil> stringType:0 timeType:0 set:false omitEmpty:false} pkcs8`
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 22:24:31 GMT):<br/>
However, using `openssl verify`, the cert and key match
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 22:31:13 GMT):<br/>
Nevermind -- the problem was that I had a section `-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----` at the beginning of my key.  I remember reading somewhere that must begin with somethign like "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY".  Deleting this section allows the server to boot.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 22:31:59 GMT):<br/>
Are all keys in Fabric of type prime256v1?  If not, how is the elliptic curve name specified if not by a "BEGIN EC PARAMETERS" section?

@vdods , you can setup your curve type to be one of these kinds : p224 , p256 , p384 and p521 by setting up the key size in csr-json file of fabric ca server : "key": { "algo": "ecdsa", "size": 256 }.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Thu, 21 Sep 2017 18:13:13 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar But once it's set, all keys must be that type?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 21 Sep 2017 18:35:13 GMT):<br/>
yes. if you want to change curve type , you can change setting.

I am just curious, why do you want it to be dynamic.

Hi @mastersingh24 , I am referring to https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6189 and PKCS11 support in general. Does this @divyank s comment in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6161 fairly reflects how one should be able to configure Fabric with PKCS11 (obviously without the last line, which is current behaviour)? Thanks.

Just a summary of what we're trying to do in case it isn't clear:
 - Pull official fabric peer images from docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/fabric-peer/ - Enable BCCSP PKCS11 option  - Mount .so files using docker volumes. These .so files can be HSM libraries or Go plugins.  - Run container  - In both cases (initializing PKCS11 or Go plugins), we see segfaults due to the unsupported -static build

@aleksandar.likic - We use the PKCS11 support with an HSM. One key is to pull your images from https://hub.docker.com/u/ibmblockchain which contain dynamically built images. Or you can build the images yourself.

Does anyone know how we can make use of the certs defined for the fabric network to verify signatures in my chaincode?
1) Are there any built in chaincode functions which i can use to pull the cert/public keys of a particular org/identity?
2) If so, how can i use them for verification?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 11:41:20 GMT):<br/>
@wy - what exactly are you trying to verify in your chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>wy</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 12:11:18 GMT):<br/>
im trying to verify a signature generated on the API layer, using the public keys/certs used in the fabric network

@mastersingh24 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 14:59:59 GMT):<br/>
What are you actually signing outside of what Fabric clients sign?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 15:00:54 GMT):<br/>
If you chose to use the same key that the client uses to sign with, you can get the corresponding public key needed to verify a signature using the GetCreator() function available in chaincode

@yacovm @mastersingh24 i got from the doc is that msp is a role to control the privilege who has right to do something,and each org contains a msp,but i don't understand how the `This provides modularity of membership operations, and interoperability across different membership standards and architectures.`

yes of course

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 09:40:55 GMT):<br/>
so the MSP type that fabric v1.0 has is based on x509 PKI
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 09:41:30 GMT):<br/>
but at some point in the future we'll have a new MSP type- an identity mixer MSP that is for clients only (users) and their transactions are un-linkable. 
</p>

but at some point in the future we'll have a new MSP type- an identity mixer MSP that is for clients only (users) and their transactions are un-linkable. ( @Maria / @manu  please correct me if I'm wrong here)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 09:43:00 GMT):<br/>
Now, the idemix MSP obfuscates the users behind the transactions, by randomly generating a pseudo identity upon each signature and signing the transaction with a zero knowledge proof scheme, that an idemix MSP inside a peer can verify the signature without knowing who is the user behind it. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 09:44:14 GMT):<br/>
So, Fabric code itself doesn't care whether a given identity or a transaction is signed by an x509 certificate or an idemix one - the MSP implementation abstracts out all the security/identity stuff from the fabric code
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 09:45:31 GMT):<br/>
And if you want to implement your own MSP - lets say, an MSP that rolls a fair dice and determines if a signature is valid or not (bad, bad idea! don't do this!) - then all you need is to implement the MSP interface(s) and ensure all peers and orderers have this code in them, and you're all set.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 09:45:35 GMT):<br/>
This is for the modularity part.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 09:47:51 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain ^
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:16:19 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain , in addition to what @yacovm posted above, think about it like this:

1) The MSP design provides the flexibility for multiple organizations to use their own membership services provider(s).  It's also possible for these providers to be shared as well (for example the default X509-based MSP can share a central certificate authority and make use of OU's to uniquely identify / differentiate organizations).  This is different from the v0.6 and earlier versions of Hyperledger Fabric where there was only a single, centralized membership service provider

2) As @yacovm mentioned, the MSP implementation defines a set of standard interfaces which are consumed by the various Fabric components.  Today we only have a single concrete MSP implementation based on standard X509 PKI, but you'll see that there is a second implementation based on a technology called Identity Mixer in the works
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:18:23 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 can we use the e2e_cli to take an example?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:18:56 GMT):<br/>
i know in the e2e_cli it provides the shell to produce the artifacts for the fabric network

I'm getting below error while joining the peer ```Error: proposal failed (err: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Failed to deserialize creator identity, err The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "x509: ECDSA verification failure" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "ca.org.example.com"))```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:51:18 GMT):<br/>
so when you run cryptogen it regenerates also the root CA certs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:51:28 GMT):<br/>
so you can't 
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:53:18 GMT):<br/>
So in my case, I'm killing an existing peer and starting new. But some docker daemon doesnt allow me to create a new peer with same name.
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:53:44 GMT):<br/>
Hence i'm trying to create a new peer with different name but now this issue
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:56:43 GMT):<br/>
is there anyway we can completely remove this existing peer from the docker network without restarting docker daemon
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:57:38 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi you probably should remove the stopped container
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:59:16 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim I did, it had some issue and I think its not removed completely. Now docker doesnt allow me to create with same name
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:59:28 GMT):<br/>
docker ps -a?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:59:52 GMT):<br/>
its not in that as well
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 08:00:44 GMT):<br/>
I get this error ```docker: Error response from daemon: service endpoint with name peer.example.com already exists.``` when I try to start with same name.

<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 08:00:44 GMT):<br/>
I get this error ```docker: Error response from daemon: service endpoint with name peer0.example.com already exists.``` when I try to start with same name.

@Vadim do you think this command ```docker network disconnect --force bridge peer0.example.com``` would help?

<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 08:05:04 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm just to confirm, so there is no way right now to add a new peer with the same original CA ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 08:08:14 GMT):<br/>
not with cryptogen
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 08:08:19 GMT):<br/>
you need to use `openssl` command
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 08:09:15 GMT):<br/>
Okay
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 08:12:13 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @yacovm Do you have it handy by anychance. I need it little urgently.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 08:13:20 GMT):<br/>
no but maybe @aso does
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 08:48:32 GMT):<br/>
@aso We need to create certs for new peer for an existing network. Do you have openssl commands to create certs using existing root CAs. Could you pls share. Would be really helpful
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 08:51:40 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi I think it's also possible to do with CA

@Vadim  Thanks. Do i need to register and enroll this new peer and it'll create certs?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 09:25:02 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi  ```
Now that you have successfully registered a peer identity, you may now enroll the peer given the enrollment ID and secret (i.e. the password from the previous section). This is similar to enrolling the bootstrap identity except that we also demonstrate how to use the “-M” option to populate the Hyperledger Fabric MSP (Membership Service Provider) directory structure.

By using generate.sh I am creating certificates for 2 orgs.. each org has 2 peers. Those certificates work fine with balance transfer example. But when I generate 3 peers for each org and use these certificates in balance transfer project it shows creator identity not found... Am I missing something ?

Curious, is it currently possible to set up a fabric network without using cryptogen? As in use the fabric-ca to handle registration of orderers/peers as well as sdk clients?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:28:35 GMT):<br/>
@Asara  - There is nothing special about the crypto material generated by `cryptogen`.  It's just a convenience tool to get you up and running quickly
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:29:31 GMT):<br/>
You can set up your own fabric-ca's and register and enroll peers, orderers, clients using the fabric-ca-client or any of the SDKs

@mastersingh24 Sorry for the above long paste . please find the  https://pastebin.com/d1invCDd  could you please help me to understand the contents generated by cryptogen for balance-transfer application .I think latest version is different from earlier version of generated artificats .I could see msps multiple times in the organization
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 14 Oct 2017 10:57:48 GMT):<br/>
@vu3mmg  - might be easier if you could let us know what issue you are having?  off the top of my head, I don't see anything different from the standard output from cryptogen

<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Sat, 14 Oct 2017 14:13:04 GMT):<br/>
based on https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5154

<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Sat, 14 Oct 2017 14:13:21 GMT):<br/>
i am not sure which configuration to look at

createChannel,JoinChannel,InstallChainCode are succeeding
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Sat, 14 Oct 2017 14:25:27 GMT):<br/>
but during instantiating the chaincode I am getting the above error
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Sat, 14 Oct 2017 15:00:19 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24  I have no clue how to solve the above
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 14 Oct 2017 18:13:57 GMT):<br/>
@vu3mmg  - Are you just running the sample as is - i.e. no modifications?
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Sun, 15 Oct 2017 00:14:40 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24  I tried to modify  , but the same org structure , crypto config etc ..
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Sun, 15 Oct 2017 00:18:25 GMT):<br/>
is there any special dependency we need to take care . 
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Sun, 15 Oct 2017 02:39:50 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24  i was able to get though the error . Two reasons  - chaincode was getting installed only in one node, instantiate proposal was sent to both the nodes ,  lack of knowledge of  naming and fetching of peers for balance transfer
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 15 Oct 2017 10:07:33 GMT):<br/>
@vu3mmg  - Glad to hear you got through the error.  So your goal was to take the sample and modify it?  Looks like you were trying to add another organization and some additional peers?  Just asking so that we can figure out what to better document
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Sun, 15 Oct 2017 15:25:01 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24  earlier  I had created a remittance settlement app for bank based on old version of balance transfer. I wanted to port it to new hyperledger version . It took some 3-4 days for me to port it .Number of orgs were same ,But I had added some controllers and services  . This application was running between dubai and india  , across data centers. If you could give some insights about MSP , and how   a peer  validates a signature of client  app . (my assumption is it is based on CA's cert ?) It will be helpful.  I have created some simple ladder diagrams , if you could review it ones  , it will be really helpful and I will post it in some blog .

Hey I saw that we can have a number of users included for an organization mentioned in the crypto-config.yaml. So those users crypto-material is generated (equivalent to registering and enrollment) at the beginning along with the the peers crypto material. Hence we can use these users to register and enroll new users dynamically with the SDK where each node app corresponds to a particular user(assigning admin in network-config to a particular user

Hey, in the example of balance transfer what is admins field in config.json file?? Is it the admin user of CA or one of the users(Admin@org1.example.com) created by the crypto-config at the begginning for the organization?? 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 09:44:58 GMT):<br/>
@CodeReaper  - it's the admin user for the CA

I'm getting a very frustrating error `Verify() returned x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid` when the peer checks the admin cert, and found this code:
```
func (msp *bccspmsp) getValidityOptsForCert(cert *x509.Certificate) x509.VerifyOptions {
	// First copy the opts to override the CurrentTime field
	// in order to make the certificate passing the expiration test
	// independently from the real local current time.
	// This is a temporary workaround for FAB-3678

	var tempOpts x509.VerifyOptions
	tempOpts.Roots = msp.opts.Roots
	tempOpts.DNSName = msp.opts.DNSName
	tempOpts.Intermediates = msp.opts.Intermediates
	tempOpts.KeyUsages = msp.opts.KeyUsages
	tempOpts.CurrentTime = cert.NotBefore.Add(time.Second)

	return tempOpts
}

```
which references this Jira ticket https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3678 . However, even though the cert validity options CurrentTime is being set to one second after the NotBefore time for the cert, the time check is still failing. Is anyone else having this problem?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:13:28 GMT):<br/>
E.g. 
```
cert.Subject.CommonName = "peer0-admin"
NotBefore = time.Time{sec:63643868520, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)},
NotAfter = time.Time{sec:63675404520, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)},
opts = x509.VerifyOptions{DNSName:"", Intermediates:(*x509.CertPool)(0xc4201e7710), Roots:(*x509.CertPool)(0xc4201e7680), CurrentTime:time.Time{sec:63643868521, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)}, KeyUsages:[]x509.ExtKeyUsage(nil)}

```
Noting that indeed, NotBefore < CurrentTime < NotAfter -- here, the CurrentTime is the one in the validity opts
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:13:56 GMT):<br/>
so I think this might be because of the CA certs and not the admin cert
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:14:13 GMT):<br/>
can you check the date on the CA certs and the admin certs with `openssl`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:14:20 GMT):<br/>
and post it here?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:15:46 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:17:01 GMT):<br/>
Root CA cert:
```cert.Subject.CommonName = "RootCA",
NotBefore = time.Time{sec:63643349472, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)},
NotAfter = time.Time{sec:64274069472, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)},
opts = x509.VerifyOptions{DNSName:"", Intermediates:(*x509.CertPool)(0xc42028eb70), Roots:(*x509.CertPool)(0xc42028eae0), CurrentTime:time.Time{sec:63643349473, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)}, KeyUsages:[]x509.ExtKeyUsage(nil)}```
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:17:40 GMT):<br/>
intermediate CA cert:
```cert.Subject.CommonName = "localhost",
NotBefore = time.Time{sec:63643868799, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)},
NotAfter = time.Time{sec:63959228799, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)},
opts = x509.VerifyOptions{DNSName:"", Intermediates:(*x509.CertPool)(0xc42028eb70), Roots:(*x509.CertPool)(0xc42028eae0), CurrentTime:time.Time{sec:63643868800, nsec:0, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)}, KeyUsages:[]x509.ExtKeyUsage(nil)}```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:17:50 GMT):<br/>
where is that output from/?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:18:10 GMT):<br/>
In both cases, getValidityOptsForCert slams opts.CurrentTime to one second after the cert's NotBefore time
</p>

brb bringing a calculator
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:18:49 GMT):<br/>
both the root and intermediate CA certs pass the validity checks
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:19:35 GMT):<br/>
as far as I can tell, msp.getValidityOptsForCert should cause the cert time check to always pass
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:19:43 GMT):<br/>
unless the cert itself isn't valid for more than 1 second
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:20:39 GMT):<br/>
The odd thing is, I've had this work before, and I can't seem to replicate that condition
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:21:43 GMT):<br/>
BTW, I'm generating the root CA and intermediate CA certs myself using openssl
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:21:50 GMT):<br/>
so the problem is:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:21:56 GMT):<br/>
the notBefore of the admin
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:21:58 GMT):<br/>
then giving the intermediate cert/key to fabric-ca to run the intermediate CA
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:22:07 GMT):<br/>
oh, wait
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:22:38 GMT):<br/>
aha 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:23:03 GMT):<br/>
so `63643868799 - 63643868520 = 279`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:23:31 GMT):<br/>
so, the intermediate is.. in the future
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:23:39 GMT):<br/>
in relation to the admin
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:23:49 GMT):<br/>
and the verify options is calculated on the leaf, I think
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:23:50 GMT):<br/>
Weird, that shouldn't be happening -- I make them intermediate, then admin
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:23:59 GMT):<br/>
well but look at the time
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:24:06 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:24:11 GMT):<br/>
I wonder how it's getting an earlier time
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:24:15 GMT):<br/>
try to do a sleep
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:24:20 GMT):<br/>
when you generate them
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:24:28 GMT):<br/>
yes, but 279 seconds is a lot
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:24:37 GMT):<br/>
ah it's seconds
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:24:55 GMT):<br/>
I'd believe if they were within a few seconds, but the other way around is weird
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:25:23 GMT):<br/>
yeah. Anyway that's the problem I believe. Let me find the relevant JIRA...
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:25:32 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 08:36:20 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 can you explain why the the peer/orderer node should config local msp?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 08:53:54 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain  -  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msp.html#msp-setup-on-the-peer-orderer-side  explains how the crypto material in the local MSP is used by the peer and orderer nodes

The quick answer is that both peers and orderers need to be able to provide digital signatures as part of the overall transaction flow.  Peers sign endorsement responses and orderers sign blocks.  The local MSP holds the crypto material needed to do this.  Additionally, peers and orderers need to have some type of built-in adminstration and the local MSP is referenced for authorizing / verifying identities used to perform admin actions on the peer and/or orderer node(s)
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:16:53 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24  if I understood correctly , the admission control is the responsibility of local MSP and , peers & Ordererers verify the signatures based on trusted  CA for each of the org ?
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:17:46 GMT):<br/>
If a trusted CA signs a certificate , peer will consider as signature is valid ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:23:24 GMT):<br/>
Let me clarify - admission control for "local / administrative" actions use the local MSP.  
For the peer, this includes install chaincode, join channel and connecting to the event hub.   Peers also use their local MSP (specifically the keystore and signcerts) to sign endorsement responses as well.

For the orderer, the local MSP is used for the initial bootstrap of the orderer (for example to create the genesis block for the system channel) and it also used by the orderer node(s) to sign blocks.

For channel-related actions (for example sending endorsement proposals to peers, sending transactions to the orderer), the MSPs are actually obtained from the configuration of the channels themselves
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:25:34 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24  " the MSPs are actually obtained from the configuration of the channels themselves"  is a bit confusing .  could you please explain a bit
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:30:06 GMT):<br/>
@vu3mmg  - Have you ever looked closely at `configtxgen` or `configtx.yaml`?

<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:30:14 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:30:35 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:33:37 GMT):<br/>
or this is only for the tool ?
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:33:46 GMT):<br/>
configtxgen ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:35:03 GMT):<br/>
When you actually run `configtxgen`, the output is basically a configuration transaction / config block.  If you were to actually look inside the contents of the transaction / block which is generated, you would actually say that it actually contains the serialized MSPs for each organization referenced.  It uses the MSP directory to find the material and "load" it into the block / transaction
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:35:59 GMT):<br/>
So what actually goes to the orderer in create channel actually has the contents of the MSPs in it.  The same holds true for the material used in the JoinChannel call to the peer as well
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:36:24 GMT):<br/>
OK.  for example  crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/example.com/msp contains the certificates which are public

</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:36:38 GMT):<br/>
which needs to be shared across the nodes in the network
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:36:45 GMT):<br/>
is this understanding right
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:37:09 GMT):<br/>
which is encoded into genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:37:20 GMT):<br/>
and genesis block is shared to all
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:37:56 GMT):<br/>
Right - so when a peer joins a channel, the contents of the config block have this information in it
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:38:40 GMT):<br/>
And then if you make config updates to the channel configuration, it is distributed as a config block on the channel and therefore goes to all peers connected to the channel
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:38:50 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:40:27 GMT):<br/>
one more query regarding a comment in balance transfer configtx.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:40:35 GMT):<br/>
"AnchorPeers defines the location of peers which can be used
            # for cross org gossip communication.  Note, this value is only
            # encoded in the genesis block in the Application section context
'"
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:40:50 GMT):<br/>
saw the above comment related to anchor peer
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:42:12 GMT):<br/>
But there was no configuration in the application section of yaml file . Does this means anchor peers written in anchor peer section  , will be added in the application section of genesis.block , even if Application section is empty in yaml file
</p>
<p><strong>vu3mmg</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:42:30 GMT):<br/>
to be honest , i never understood the Application section which is empty in the yaml file

hey, I was going through the crypto material generated by cryptogen, I wanted to ask whether each user (mentioned in the users directory containing crypto material for each organization) can enroll as same as CA admin or the new users registered by the CA???  I'm basically trying to divide node apps for CA and the users, so i want those users also be able to register new ones but I can't seem to enroll those bootstrapped users and get their context.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 10:24:19 GMT):<br/>
@CodeReaper  - the users generated by cryptogen are not registered with the fabric-ca.  However, the signing key pair used for those users (as well as for the MSP for each organization) are provided so that you can spin up a fabric-ca and register and enroll your own users (and still have them belong to the orgs created by cryptogen)

@mastersingh24 Can I register and enroll new users with the help of these auto-created users, doesnt this require for them to register and enroll themselves first?? If not, how can I use these users??
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 21 Oct 2017 17:06:01 GMT):<br/>
@CodeReaper  - You can't use the users created by cryptogen to register new users with the fabric-ca.  You can, however, directly use the users created by cryptogen.  Most people end up using them from the CLI and then spinning up a fabric-ca using the root certs found in the `ca` folder for each of the orgs generated by cryptogen and then registering and enrolling users using one of the SDKs.  It's possible to directly use these users from the SDKs as well (without requiring communication with the fabric-ca).  Each SDK seems to have a slightly different way of importing existing identities
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Sun, 22 Oct 2017 16:24:20 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24  Thanks a lot to clear my confusion. To confirm, I just need to import these users by their key and certificates and I can use their context directly for my invocations??

Hello all, 

I am trying to setup a network across two different servers. The orderer is running on a host (lets call orderer_host), and peer is running on another host (lets call peer_host). After starting the network in orderer_host, I am copying over the crypto config folder from orderer_host to the peer_host.

When I try to update the peer as the anchor node of the organization, I get the below error in the peer log. I have checked that the ports being passed are correct.


`2017-10-23 06:53:44.638 UTC [ConnProducer] NewConnection -> ERRO 31c Failed connecting to orderer_host.orderer.net:7050 , error: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "x509: ECDSA verification failure" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "tlsca.orderer.net")`

Any pointers on what this issue could be?

Is a CA the best level of granularity we can achieve when revoking certificates?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 14:59:28 GMT):<br/>
Looking at the MSP documentation and I read this:
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 14:59:31 GMT):<br/>
> A list of certificate revocation lists (CRLs) each corresponding to exactly one of the listed (intermediate or root) MSP Certificate Authorities; this is an optional parameter.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:00:17 GMT):<br/>
And this is inline with what Gari's changeset yesterday does: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/14773/
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:00:55 GMT):<br/>
But I'm wondering how we'd go about revoking specific certificates.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:10:11 GMT):<br/>
@kostas what do you mean? From what I know you can revoke a specific certificate.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:11:33 GMT):<br/>
a config update can have a CRL list and a CRL is basically a list of "certificate pointers and their issuers"  and then a signature over it
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:20:36 GMT):<br/>
If I am to revoke a serial number, how does the orderer server pick up on this change?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:21:29 GMT):<br/>
As best as I can tell, it just updates the root CA pool.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:22:07 GMT):<br/>
And since we don't blacklist/revoke the CA, the orderer will be unaffected if we wish to revoke a cert issued by a CA.

If I'm wrong, let me know.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:01:53 GMT):<br/>
Ah you mean tls revocation?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:02:52 GMT):<br/>
So i am not in front of a computer but maybe you can specify a revocation list in the tls config?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:03:05 GMT):<br/>
> Ah you mean tls revocation?
Correct.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:04:02 GMT):<br/>
As best as I can tell, the server only operates on a CA-level of granularity. e.g. "Symantec is bad so let's remove them from the trusted list of CAs."
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:04:31 GMT):<br/>
Thats what we do in fabric today but why are you concerned about tls revocation?

Seemed like a logical follow-up question, after I reviewed that CR yesterday.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:06:03 GMT):<br/>
What is the question?

<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:07:05 GMT):<br/>
If Symantec issued a cert to John Doe, I want to blacklist John Doe and have my server (the orderer) drop any connection attempts from him. I don't want to drop all connections from all users that had certs issued by Symantec.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:07:28 GMT):<br/>
(I'm aware of the concept of intermediate CAs but the problem is still there.)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:16:04 GMT):<br/>
@kostas so  checked and what we can do to make this happen is use:
```
	// VerifyPeerCertificate, if not nil, is called after normal
	// certificate verification by either a TLS client or server. It
	// receives the raw ASN.1 certificates provided by the peer and also
	// any verified chains that normal processing found. If it returns a
	// non-nil error, the handshake is aborted and that error results.
	//
	// If normal verification fails then the handshake will abort before
	// considering this callback. If normal verification is disabled by
	// setting InsecureSkipVerify then this callback will be considered but
	// the verifiedChains argument will always be nil.
	VerifyPeerCertificate func(rawCerts [][]byte, verifiedChains [][]*x509.Certificate) error
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:16:07 GMT):<br/>
it's from the TLS config
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:16:21 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it was in go 1.7, at least I don't recall that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:17:55 GMT):<br/>
But the problem is that we don't have TLS CRLs in msp_config proto structure
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:18:56 GMT):<br/>
so, I _ guess _ if the TLS CA and the enrollment CA are the same, you _ could _ piggyback on the CRLs in the MSP config to accomplish that
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:19:16 GMT):<br/>
*gimme a sec to check, not sure I follow
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:21:22 GMT):<br/>
but, it's not well defined, because you'd need to iterate over all MSPs of all channels to make this happen. and lets say that you have an MSP where the identity is revoked and an MSP where the identity isn't revoked
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:21:23 GMT):<br/>
what do you do?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:22:59 GMT):<br/>
I guess - we can be either restrictive or lenient, but there is no way to know which MSP config is more updated, since there is no total order among channels.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:27:19 GMT):<br/>
So walk me through the process. I want to ban cert `foo` issued by cert `bar`. Is a CRL update via config update the very first step on my list?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:32:09 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:32:59 GMT):<br/>
Cool, now the server (the orderer) updates its pool of root CAs. In our case, this pool will remain identical. Yay or nay?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:33:23 GMT):<br/>
It should
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:33:37 GMT):<br/>
As best as I can tell after reviewing the changeset yesterday, the answer is yay, the pool will remain identical.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:33:54 GMT):<br/>
But i am envisionimg that we cache the crls in the SecureServer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:34:10 GMT):<br/>
And override that method i put above
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:35:52 GMT):<br/>
OK, so just to close one thread before spawning another. You and I seem to agree that preventing user `foo` from connecting to the orderer is not possible today, even if we revoke `foo`'s cert.

I'll note that it strikes me as somewhat inconsistent that we won't let users from blacklisted CAs to connect (if mutual TLS is on), while blacklisted users from whitelisted CAs can connect, but I understand this might be a nit and there are practical reasons for not enforcing this.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:49:04 GMT):<br/>
What I'm concerned about is this: a user has established a Deliver stream and they've asked the orderer to keep sending them blocks whenever they're ready. If a config update comes in that blacklists them, as best as I can tell they will keep on receiving blocks.

I am working on securing confidentiality inside a Fabric network. The scenario is based on four organizations within a single channel, sharing endorsement peers among each other to submit transactions to a single smart contract. Version 0.6 had tCerts which ensured that only relevant parties to the transaction can see its contents. I am looking for something similarly transparent for both end users and developers in version 1.0. Currently, the only option I see is to apply encryption at the application level. However, this does not ensure a proper redistribution of encryption keys across the organisation. Any alternatives would be greatly appreciated.

I want set up a network, using openssl to sign the root ca cert, and using this root CA Cert(ROOTCA) to sign serval admin cert. 

My problem is that when creating the genesis block using the command:
`CONFIGTXGEN -profile TwoOrgsOrdererGenesis -outputBlock "$FABRIC_CFG_PATH/genesis.block"`, 

The error message is:
```
2017-11-08 08:15:53.692 GMT [common/configtx/tool] main -> INFO 001 Loading configuration
2017-11-08 08:16:00.908 GMT [configvalues/msp] TemplateGroupMSPWithAdminRolePrincipal -> CRIT 002 Setting up the MSP manager failed, err The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid
```

I have traced in the MSP Module, it return error from function below:
```
func (msp *bccspmsp) Setup(conf1 *m.MSPConfig) error {
	...
	// Setup CAs
	if err := msp.setupCAs(conf); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	...
}
```
and it fails to check the valid period of root ca cert (ROOTCA).
```
func (c *Certificate) isValid(certType int, currentChain []*Certificate, opts *VerifyOptions) error {
	...

	now := opts.CurrentTime
	if now.IsZero() {
		now = time.Now()
	}
	if now.Before(c.NotBefore) || now.After(c.NotAfter) {
		return CertificateInvalidError{c, Expired}
	}

	...
}	
```
The time `now` is smaller (before) `c.NotBefore`.

We checked the issued root ca cert (ROOTCA) is correct ( the valid period is correct, it is okay using openssl verify command )

Does anyone have any idea? Thx.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 13:19:36 GMT):<br/>
@handasontam  - My guess is that this should be working now?  You can't use a CA certificate that is not yet valid.

About China Crypto Standard support

I am trying to do something on  China Crypto Standard Support(SMx) in fabric，here are some problems should be discussed for.

It’s not difficult  in bccsp to support SMx,  it does not take too much time. The real problem I found is that x509 in go standard library does not support SMx natively which is hard imported in bccsp, msp, crytogen, etc.

So if we don’t do something on x509, there is no way to generate SMx key or parse/create SMx certificate. 

My current solution:
(1) Customise crypto standard library in go package to support SMx.  So it must  add custom go standard library in baseimage to support SMx. 

Alternative:
(2) Copy crypto standard library to fabric and do SMx support on it.

The good and the bad:
(1) Fabric can support SMx decently， because crpto/x509 in go packages are support SMx natively. But SMx supported library must be installed in the baseimage.  more over, if native tools like cryptogen, configtxgen you want to use or  you want to run fabric in your native environment, you should compile your native SMx go env.

(2) Copy crypto standard library to fabric and do  SMx support on it. In this way, it doesn’t need do anything in go standard library, so  we don’t need to care about the go env we currently use. But fabric need to modified heavily, because crypto/x509 is imported everywhere in project. And I think tls can’t support SMx, because tls package is also a standard library that uses crypto/x509.So there is nothing we could do to make it support it. 

So which way is better you think? Any alternatives would be appreciated.

may I ask why fabric-ca sets the NotBefore field to current time - 5 minutes? thx

<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 13:01:48 GMT):<br/>
@handasontam We inherit the default backdating of 5 minutes from CFSSL.  There is no specific description in the code, but my assumption is that it is to allow a certificate which was just issued to be valid elsewhere allowing for 5 minutes of clock skew.  Anyway, this is just the default behavior.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 17:30:08 GMT):<br/>
@handasontam  - It's actually pretty common practice to do that for the reason @smithbk  - adjust for clock skew

Oracle ---->>> verification module

JPMorgan ---->>> verification module

1. Oracle as well as JPMorgan has done transactions with verfication module. 
2. Now verification module can have information for both Oracle and JPMorgan.
3. Oracle should not have access for JPMorgan data and vice-versa. 

How can we implement this kind of requirement? Can we implement this by using channels and how we can implement if we have any chances?

Hi all, i'm able to get attribute (`position`) in certificate..  in chaincode ,i'am getting `mspid` as `Org1msp`  as i wanted , but its says `The client identity does not possess the attribute` for the attribute ..any help ?
i got info in enrollment certificate as `cert extensions[......] {"attrs":{"position":"admin"}}`
my chaincode where i used `cid` is
```
func(t *StudentChainCode) Init(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) pb.Response {
	fmt.Println("Student's chaincode is starting up")
	fmt.Println(" - ready for action");
	id, err := cid.GetID(stub);
	fmt.Printf("id obtained %v",id);
	mspid, err := cid.GetMSPID(stub);
	fmt.Printf("mspid obtained %v",mspid);
	val, ok, err := cid.GetAttributeValue(stub, "position");
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("There was an error trying to retrieve the attribute");
	}else if !ok {
		fmt.Println("The client identity does not possess the attribute");
	}else{
		fmt.Printf("value obtained %v",val);
	}
	return shim.Success(nil)
}

Hi all, I have some questions regarding encryption. I wish to encrypt transaction data with multiple client's public keys (multisig) and store the ciphertext into the fabric ledger. Any client is able to decrypt it using their private key. From my understanding, there is no way to use the keys generated by the fabric-ca so that's why I'm thinking of generating additional public/private keys for encryption. Recently, I found out about fabric's encryption chaincode (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/examples/chaincode/go/enccc_example) 
So my question is should I generate the additional keys outside of fabric or can i use the keys generated by fabric-ca in fabric through the encryption chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 07:23:02 GMT):<br/>
@JayJong IIRC the encshim is for AES not for asymmetric encryption

<p><strong>JayJong</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 02:35:06 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk thanks for the clarification, can i use the asymmetric keys in fabric-ca to encrypt my data? 
@yacovm why would fabric come up with an encryption chaincode that works for symmetric encryption and not asymmetric since fabric-ca already creates the asymmetric keys

Hi,Since there is an encryption discussion going on, I have some questions around this topic.Can you please let me understand  1) Whether data in the ledger  is encrypted or not? 2) After a channel is initiated do peers share a channel specific symmetric key for encrypt/decrypt messages? 3) If answer is no to 2 do all peers and orderers exchange their public keys for submitting trxs? 4)I could not find something in the docs mentioning these topics in detail, are there any documentation explaining in detail which encryption practices are used at which stage (invoke, send transaction, receive message, read/write from ledger, enrollment, etc...)? I see some references to certificates in CA which is more basically around enrollment. I was able to run some examples and tests but still not clear on this topic. I appreciate any help...

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 08:24:30 GMT):<br/>
@JayJong you need to generate a sym key and then use it to encrypt the data, the asymm keys are only for signing
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 08:27:04 GMT):<br/>
@malkochoglu 1) no 2) the messages in transit are encrypted with TLS, so the protocol handles key exchange and encryption/decryption 3) no 4) because there is no data-at-rest encryption, only data-in-transit which is TLS

Hi, I want to know how the certificate were distributed between peers, 
as far as I know, each peer should get the cert of other peers for verifying their signature (e.g. when the endorser peer receive the transaction proposal from the invoking peer, it has to verify the digital signature)
However, we only set up local msp when creating the peer. How would they get other's cert? 
Thank you

@handasontam  - 

When a peer joins a channel, it receives the config block(s) for that channel.  The config block for a channel contains the MSPs for all of the orgs which are a member of that  channel.  Each org has a unique MSP - denoted by both the mspid as well as a unique root/intermediate certificate authority.

Endorsement policies for chaincode are typically based on orgs as well (via their mspids).  When a peer endorses a chaincode transaction, as @yacov stated it signs the endorsement and includes it's public key (X509 certificate) and MSPID in the proposal response.

As you know, the client collects, packages and sends the endorsement responses to the orderer which then sends blocks / transactions to the peers for validation and commitment.

Each peer than checks to make sure that all the signatures are valid.  As mentioned, the public keys are included for each signature.  But the peer also checks to make sure that each certificate was actually issued by the MSPID the endorser claims to be part of.   After that, the peer checks to make sure that there are enough signatures from the appropriate MSPIDs (orgs) to meet the endorsement policy

@blw you need to set the name of the key to be the SKI of the certificate.

you can just use cryptogen for that though with temporarily setting the date backwards

Is possible/make sense to have a "PeerOrgs" without an "Admin"? Where is possible to find documentation about the Admin and it capability?

hi, how to edit crypto config yaml file to generate crypto for four organization  and also wants to change the name of organization from org1 to something else i.e instead of org1 I would like to have name like 'Unisef' and also wants to change domain from example.com to "KPLO.com" .so, Is it possible to do this in hyperledger 1.0 ??? because when I tried doing this changes , during user enroll i'm getting error : unable to fine the keyvaulestore. and when I'll again change the organization name to default i.e just 'org1' and domain to 'example.com'. Then everything works fine..?  So what I'm trying to do is that thing is possible or not??? I want my network peer should look like Unisef.KPLO.com instead of org1.example.com?? Pls help

@blw Ben, you can just go to the cryptogen code and put custom date

Hi all

I've noticed that when I run the following code, the signcerts path gets updated to the provided directory, but the keystore path remains at it's initial value. This can cause an `KeyMaterial not found in SigningIdentityInfo` error, because the public keys in the new path might now correspond with the private keys in the old path. Is this expected behavior?

```
conf, err := msp.GetLocalMspConfig(dir, bccspConfig, mspID)
if err != nil {
	return err
}

localMSP := GetLocalMSP()
err = localMSP.Setup(conf)
```

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 17:39:16 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure but why not use: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/msp/msp_test.go#L1012-L1027 ? 
</p>
<p><strong>blw</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 18:01:50 GMT):<br/>
That method is private in the msp package, and the test I'm writing is in mgmt. I can't move the test to the msp package either, because importing mgmt in the msp package causes an import cycle
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 18:53:39 GMT):<br/>
oh... hmmm
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 18:54:23 GMT):<br/>
wait, hold on
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 18:54:35 GMT):<br/>
can't the code be in the msp package, @blw  ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 18:54:40 GMT):<br/>
that'll solve it no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 18:55:32 GMT):<br/>
maybe `Setup` return an error?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 18:55:46 GMT):<br/>
in case of a BCCSP MSP that is
</p>
<p><strong>blw</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 19:15:51 GMT):<br/>
I tried that, but if I move the unit test to the msp package, then I'll have to import mgmt into msp because the code I want to test is in mgmt, and that will also cause an import cycle
</p>
<p><strong>blw</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 19:16:48 GMT):<br/>
Unless you're talking about moving `LoadLocalMsp`, the function I'm testing, to msp?
</p>
<p><strong>blw</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 19:18:30 GMT):<br/>
that would be an interface change though... that might be too big a change to make for this bug
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 19:58:20 GMT):<br/>
no, I'm saying you test it in another way, everything in the `msp` package @blw 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 19:58:20 GMT):<br/>
no, I'm saying you solve the bug it in another way, everything in the `msp` package @blw

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 19:58:35 GMT):<br/>
and then also have the UT there
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 19:58:53 GMT):<br/>
the code you want to test is not actually in mgmt if we think about it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 19:59:09 GMT):<br/>
the signing identity is implemented in the msp package

@mastersingh24 Is it possible to change the Cipher suite for TLS?

Or if anyone else knows if it's possible to change the Cipher suite settings for TLS

@farhan3 from what I see - the golang TLS supports:

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Dec 2017 19:58:30 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we have such a config in the fabric though
</p>
<p><strong>berestet</strong> (Tue, 19 Dec 2017 20:35:47 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm security scanners in our environment are flagging `3DES` ciphers supported by the fabric as a security threat, specifically: ```    ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA       Kx=ECDH        Au=RSA      Enc=3DES-CBC(168)        Mac=SHA1
    DES-CBC3-SHA                 Kx=RSA         Au=RSA      Enc=3DES-CBC(168)        Mac=SHA1```

Doing some research, other golang middleware (e.g. Kubernetes) are hitting similar issues and hence allowing masking of the weak/medium ciphers like `3DES` - as per: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/41038

Can we request fabric take similar approach?

Similar to what Kubernetes is doing, the change would be required here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/core/comm/server.go#L139

```
			grpcServer.tlsConfig = &tls.Config{
				Certificates:           certificates,
				SessionTicketsDisabled: true,
			}
```

The `CipherSuites` option would need to be set (https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#Config):

```
			grpcServer.tlsConfig = &tls.Config{
				Certificates:           certificates,
				SessionTicketsDisabled: true,

</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 07:10:35 GMT):<br/>
that actually makes sense - though I'd recommend the following: default with a secure list of ciphers and permit admin override. Wdyt?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 07:44:39 GMT):<br/>

yes sounds good. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 07:44:43 GMT):<br/>
yes sounds good. from what I remember in TLS - the server selects the cipher suites so we can just do that in 1 place in the code and it ripples to the orderer and to the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 07:44:54 GMT):<br/>
 @mastersingh24 wdyt? ^

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:14:48 GMT):<br/>
I was going to select a set of cipher suites
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:15:23 GMT):<br/>
The set is actually more limited when you combine TLS 1.2 with EC as well

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:20:08 GMT):<br/>
We do this is the NodeSDK today:
```
var defaultCiphers = 'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256' +
	':ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384' +
	':ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256' +
	':ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384';
```

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:22:38 GMT):<br/>
You can also avoid these by using EC keys rather thn RSA  ;)  (https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=j6XxsdyoM9cJbrKis) @berestet

I think that bccsp doesn't generate RSA keys anyway, right?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:23:27 GMT):<br/>
so that means cryptogen *and* fabric-CA don't too
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:23:30 GMT):<br/>
Except we don't use BCCSP for TLS in fabric

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:23:40 GMT):<br/>
in fabric-CA we do....
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:23:51 GMT):<br/>

right

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:24:19 GMT):<br/>
I think for 1.1 we can limit the ciphers to a secure set

I have a question - so, if the TLS is set to use bccsp (in fabric this isn't the case, but it can be, right?)
then I think that the server might pick a cipher suite that isn't supported by TLS, like something with RSA and this would only be discovered at runtime, no?

The private key is used for decryption too (of the PMK)

at least this is my understanding

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 19:07:20 GMT):<br/>
But I think I am just missing what you're saying
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:02:49 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm , the code that you use is for TLS negotiation where encryption/decryption takes place. @mastersingh24 is right in his statement on bccsp.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:08:24 GMT):<br/>
Can you elaborate please?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:27:19 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  - What I was trying to say is that the cipher suite used by TLS will be independent of whether or  not we use BCCSP to load the TLS certificates.  The only mismatch which can happen is if the BCCSP config produces an RSA key pair and the cipher sites are set to an ECDSA-only family
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:27:51 GMT):<br/>
And the same can happen is you use file-based RSA keypair and select the wrong family of cipher suites
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:28:01 GMT):<br/>
But BCCSP does not provide the list of cipher suites
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:28:37 GMT):<br/>
I suppose if the BCCSP impl did not support one of the algorithms required there would be an issue as well
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:28:51 GMT):<br/>
But the cipher choice is independent
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:28:58 GMT):<br/>
What if you configure an rsa cipher suite to be used? and then bccsp will need to do RSA which it does not support no?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:29:51 GMT):<br/>
That's right.  But the same thing would happen is you selected RSA cipher suite and configured EC X509 keypair
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:29:51 GMT):<br/>
That's right.  But the same thing would happen if you selected RSA cipher suite and configured EC X509 keypair and vice versa
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:31:43 GMT):<br/>
I thought you were saying that BCCSP would be determining the list of ciphers.  I guess you were saying it could limit which ciphers on the list could be used at runtime.  And that's true but also true if you used pure file-based key pair as well
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:32:01 GMT):<br/>
You're right. I didn't  think about it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:32:12 GMT):<br/>
so basically, the TLS implementation has a way of knowing which cipher suite to pick
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:32:16 GMT):<br/>
based on the key type
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:32:22 GMT):<br/>
right at the beginning of the handshake
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:32:28 GMT):<br/>
yah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:32:34 GMT):<br/>

@niteshsolanki I ended up responding to you in DM, but yes, through the channel configuration blocks (including the genesis block used to join a channel) the peer learns of the root CAs for all participants and may verify signatures from all identities in the network.

Nevermind. I found the trick in FAB-2854. :)
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:04:33 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm , what should I provide to `cryptogen extend`? A YAML containing the initial structure plus the new ones or just the new ones?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:04:54 GMT):<br/>
just do `cryptogen extend --h`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:04:56 GMT):<br/>
it will tell you
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:05:57 GMT):<br/>
it's not saying much to me :)
```usage: cryptogen extend [<flags>]

Extend existing network

Flags:
  --help                   Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).
  --input="crypto-config"  The input directory in which existing network place
  --config=CONFIG          The configuration template to use
```
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:06:24 GMT):<br/>
oh, I saw.
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:06:25 GMT):<br/>
Sorry
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:06:30 GMT):<br/>
`--input`
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:06:34 GMT):<br/>
need some coffe :)
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:07:01 GMT):<br/>
so in `--config` I provide only the new elements, is it right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:09:31 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:09:37 GMT):<br/>
and the --input is the "old" layout
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:09:49 GMT):<br/>
the old `crypto-config` directory

@yacovm , I'm getting the following error when starting the new peer: `2018-01-18 18:04:04.972 UTC [main] main -> ERRO 001 Cannot run peer because error when setting up MSP of type bccsp from directory /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp: the supplied identity is not valid: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:05:36 GMT):<br/>
oh... really? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:06:15 GMT):<br/>
wait but how is that possible
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:06:21 GMT):<br/>
the existing files shouldn't change
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:06:42 GMT):<br/>
The steps I did:
- Started first-network example: ` ./byfn.sh -m up -s couchdb`
- Waited the script that install/instantiate/query the chaincode (`script.sh`) to end
- Updated the config: `cryptogen extend --input=crypto-config --config=crypto-config-new-peer.yaml`
- Started the new peer: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-newpeer.yaml up -d`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:06:43 GMT):<br/>
I think you did something wron
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:06:56 GMT):<br/>
Then this message appears in the new peer's logs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:07:55 GMT):<br/>
is that only for the new peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:08:00 GMT):<br/>
or also for old peers?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:08:24 GMT):<br/>
I didn't restarted the old ones. Is it needed?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:08:50 GMT):<br/>
I don't think so
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:09:01 GMT):<br/>
but I'm asking if that happens for new peers only
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:09:23 GMT):<br/>
did you perhaps make a mistake in the docker-compose yaml file?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:09:31 GMT):<br/>
I'd bet a copy-paste mistake
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:11:10 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=rrS42TkCDPXNGSi4M) @yacovm I don't see anything similar to this in other peers logs...Just messages related to chaincode execution
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:11:42 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=NR6FqxACgHHp5mdam) @yacovm You mean MSP config? Here is the file:
```services:

<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:12:20 GMT):<br/>
the crypto stuff to the new added peer was generated in `./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer2.org1.example.com/`. Is it correct?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:13:51 GMT):<br/>
seems ok
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:14:03 GMT):<br/>
To me too :)
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:14:48 GMT):<br/>
Any tips?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:17:21 GMT):<br/>
I noticed something strange. The file `cacerts/ca.org1.example.com-cert.pem`  from peer0 and peer1 are identical, but peer2 is not. It's different. I compared using Meld.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:17:54 GMT):<br/>
hmmmmm
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:18:07 GMT):<br/>
when I reviewed the change set, it was the same :O 
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:18:08 GMT):<br/>
admincerts and tlscacerts are identical in all 3 peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:18:11 GMT):<br/>
I tested it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:18:41 GMT):<br/>
what happens if you copy the ca certificate from the old peers to the new?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:19:05 GMT):<br/>
Does it work? I thought the cacert was used to sign peers `signcert` certificate
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:19:17 GMT):<br/>
Only copying is enough?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:19:17 GMT):<br/>
it's used to verify
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:19:23 GMT):<br/>
try it
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:20:14 GMT):<br/>
OK. But just for curiosity, what private key should be used to sign peers `signcert` certificate? Is it the peer private key (`keystore` content)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:21:13 GMT):<br/>
the CA's
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:21:25 GMT):<br/>
Same thing: `2018-01-18 18:21:04.221 UTC [main] main -> ERRO 001 Cannot run peer because error when setting up MSP of type bccsp from directory /etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp: the supplied identity is not valid: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:21:37 GMT):<br/>
I copied the cacert from peer0
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:21:38 GMT):<br/>
hmmm weird... open a JIRA bug
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:22:08 GMT):<br/>
Ok!
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:30:46 GMT):<br/>
I've noticed something: although I'm using `cryptogen 1.1.0-alpha`, which I built locally from git, the `first-network` I'm using is still based on tag `1.0.2`. Does it matter?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:32:57 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it does, as `crypto-config` is generated by `cryptgen` and only read by the containers, but...
</p>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:35:49 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:41:34 GMT):<br/>
When I just generated the crypto-config content and then updated, it's correct. I think `byfn.sh` is messing up something here.
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:41:51 GMT):<br/>
I'll check this carefully before opening a JIRA bug
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:49:09 GMT):<br/>
oh, that's reassuring to hear
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:49:24 GMT):<br/>
That means I wasn't hallucinating when I tried it myself
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:54:22 GMT):<br/>
:joy: 
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:55:43 GMT):<br/>
It's really strange: even though the `which cryptogen` returns the right version (1.1.0-alpha), when called from `byfn.sh generate`, it's generating a different cacert in the new peer.
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:55:52 GMT):<br/>
I can't understand why
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:56:18 GMT):<br/>
But when I commented out this step from `byfn.sh` and executed `cryptogen` manually, it worked flawlessly

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 07:57:42 GMT):<br/>
seems like you're missing a certificate definition
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 07:57:53 GMT):<br/>
`open :` it was supposed to open a certificate file
</p>
<p><strong>Glen</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 15:01:11 GMT):<br/>
yes, not too sure how the peer stated the dev container, which certificate it needs here. Anybody has run the chaincode example successfully?

Hi, in a tool "cryptogen", several "users" can be created along with Admin user.  What is the original purpose of these users usage ?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 08:16:27 GMT):<br/>
@ibmamnt  - The idea was to create some sample users per org which could be used by applications created with the SDKs or with the CLI.  This way you could get up and running and test a network without the need to setup the fabric-ca

@jrosmith ,If one transaction is made between two companyies, the transaction data will be shared by the two organizations ,and others will not be able to see it without approval, this is the privacy protection I meant. Is that feasible by granting or revoking some attributes?

@mastersingh24  Does the servers (Fabric peer orderer)  validate the IP/HOST in client certificate .. like the client will do for the server with mutual TLS?  I would _assume_ not since clients host/ip could frequently change. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:42:26 GMT):<br/>
They dont

</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:44:30 GMT):<br/>
Solely _out of curiosity_  is that standard behavior to not validate that for clients or is that something Fabric disabled ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:47:12 GMT):<br/>
Well there is little meaning in doing this. Imagine you would, so the server can only verify an ip, not a dns name right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:47:56 GMT):<br/>
Also what is the meaning of doing it? 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:50:23 GMT):<br/>
If I had a specific scenario few clients that I wanted a very strict only they are connecting ?   

</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:51:39 GMT):<br/>
Not here for a long debate just wanted to know for sure the behavior .. which lead me to wonder if that is standard

You can just tell TLS in the peer only to trust specific certs

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:56:33 GMT):<br/>
It is not supported yet in fabric but its doable in golang YLS config

<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:00:17 GMT):<br/>
Would the most likely use case of MTLS on the client to generate a single client certificate and distribute that ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:04:43 GMT):<br/>
I wouldnt do that

Hi all, I'm trying to install the balance-transfer fabric example on 3 EC2 AMI instances. I'm struggling with the configuration of the crypto material (using cryptogen) and the configuration of the channel and genesis block. Can someone indicate me where I could find an example of those configuration files in a distributed mode? For instance, I'm wondering what to indicate as domain?

Hello, Fabric Experts. If we want to establish TLS over a peer from a different org, then we need to ask for only the tls cert of the particular peer, right? Is it okay for orgs to give away certificates to other orgs?

No, you give it the TLS root ca cert

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=r3cLsdiPCsdReu4qY) @jyellick Thanks! I went through it. All the docs mention the declaration of an mspID. Can you tell me where I would define an mspID? I'm configtx.yaml to define the profile, organizations and peers. I'm using core.yaml for the peers and orderer.yaml for the orderer. Since mspID is related to the channel, would I declare it as part of the Channel Profile in configtx.yaml?

Hi, I want to include support for post quantum cryptography in hyperledger fabric. I found that the SDK has a CryptoSuite interface. Which component do I have to adopt in order to support PQC? I'm thankful for any advice.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 14:26:51 GMT):<br/>
@nebsterboy  you mean signatures?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 14:27:07 GMT):<br/>
Or encryption?
</p>
<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 14:41:30 GMT):<br/>
At the end I like to supoort PQC for signatures and encryption. As far as I saw, the CryptoSuite interface in the Java SDK has just methods for signing and verifying. Encryption is done at another component?
</p>
<p><strong>tsnyder</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 20:39:24 GMT):<br/>
@nebsterboy - The java sdk supports Java JCA/JCE for signing. This is what is used to provide a PKCS11 interface for Gemalto HSMs. However, the underlying Fabric system currently mainly supports elliptical curve keys for a specific strength. I have seen some support for RSA keys, but not sure where that is at. The keys and certs created from the private keys for each of the organizations, peers, org users, and tls need to be published to the Orderer and embedded within each Peer for channel authorization and access. I know for the PKCS11 implementation, in order for the Peer signing and verification there is a dynamic build of the Orderers and Peers required to bind the specific PKSC11 implementation. One of the IBM Fellows who had prior experience with PKCS11 spent 3-6 months building out the PKSC11 implementation for the Fabric Peer, and a Gemalto engineer spent a couple of months on the Fabric SDK and Fabric CA client in addition. Unless it is a show stopper for you or a serious value add, and you have plenty of time, you might want to rethink. You will probably be into forking basic Fabric code and building dynamic bindings with Go code in order to do it.

<p><strong>tsnyder</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 12:44:34 GMT):<br/>
@nebsterboy - yes to the expected need to change Go Code in the components. I would take a look at any modifications for RSA certificates and keys that are included in the code, and the PKCS11 implementation to get a feel for what you would need to do.
</p>
<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 12:46:47 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>MikeGardiner</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:03:00 GMT):<br/>
@nebsterboy, Which PQC schemes are you interested in? I'm a big fan of building in cryptographic agility, and it's best to start thinking about PQ now but you may not want to make specific bets today without signing with multiple algorithms.  The fact that hyperledger leverages standard APIs like Java JCA/JCE and PKCS#11 should make adopting new algorithms easy at that level but as @tsnyder has said, there are likely to be a number of other changes and all your components will need to understand the new crypto to do verification.  
</p>
<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:34:32 GMT):<br/>
@MikeGardiner right now, I do not know which schemes we want to incorporate. My hope was that there are interfaces, like the CryptoSuite of the SDK, for all components so that providing and also exchanging new schemes is easy.

Hello there. I'm new to Fabric and having read a big part of the doc and papers, I'm still a bit left wanting for more details on the way the membership system is designed and its underlying crypto: how a given client might be granted broadcast access to some channel without being able to read what's in that channel. Is the data in channels encrypted? If so, what scheme is used? Can the access once granted be revoked? If so, what security guarantuee do we have? 
Maybe I've missed a paper or document on these topics? 
Typically if I were to design such a system, I would probably consider attribute based encryption, but I haven't seen much detail about what's being used in Fabric. Maybe I've missed a relevant publication?

Hi @AnomalRoil, let's start from the fact that the genesis block of a channel contains the list of MPS recognized by that channel
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:00:16 GMT):<br/>
the genesis block contains also policies to identifies MSP identities that allowed to read and write to the channel
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:00:48 GMT):<br/>
in order to revoke an identity, a reconfiguration transaction needs to be issued containing updated CRLs
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:01:00 GMT):<br/>
the ledger, by default, is not encrypted
</p>
<p><strong>AnomalRoil</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:05:14 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but who will enforce the MSP policies and how are those enforced?
</p>
<p><strong>AnomalRoil</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:07:16 GMT):<br/>
If the ledger is not encrypted, does it mean that anybody with access to the ledger can see what's going on in all channels?
</p>
<p><strong>AnomalRoil</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:09:37 GMT):<br/>
So all peers need to be trusted by all channels' members?

MSP policies are enforced by the nodes of the network at different levels. For instance, when a client sends a proposal to an endorser, the endorser will check the writer policy to make sure the client is entitled to submit that proposal. The ordering service does something similar.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Wed, 28 Feb 2018 10:56:38 GMT):<br/>
regarding confidentiality, of course, either you trust the nodes of the network or you put in place mechanisms to obfuscated the content of transactions. SideDB is an example of an obfuscation technique

<p><strong>AnomalRoil</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 10:20:12 GMT):<br/>
In fact I hadn't realized, I think, but I guess it means the read-write policy is enforced by the DB engine, not using client's keys or whatsoever, but as any DB would do it already

<p><strong>adc</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 10:29:16 GMT):<br/>
the check is based on signature verification. The client must sign the proposal and the transaction as well

Okay, thanks

<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 13:52:50 GMT):<br/>
I like to exchange the signature scheme used inside fabric to provide an alternative to ecdsa. Any suggestions from you where to start to look inside the code?
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 15:21:58 GMT):<br/>
the first place is the bccsp package 
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 15:22:10 GMT):<br/>
it contains the cryptographic algorithms used by fabric
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 15:23:12 GMT):<br/>
once you have integrated the new signature scheme algorithms, then you have to modify the MSP, see the msp package, to call your scheme rather than ecdsa
</p>
<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 15:25:09 GMT):<br/>

@adc @jaswanth just as the error message suggests, your consortium definition does not include the container agency, so it cannot be part of the new channel at genesis

Hi,
We are trying to implement the SOFTHSM in hyperledger fabric -rc1 version. I able to get “successful admin enroll message” but when try to register as a user then I got below error.   “enrollment.key” has proper value but when it try to convert into a byte code then it is falling.

Hi, I want to implement an alternative crypto scheme. I could , on BCCSP side implement a crypto plugin which I could load the crypto lib outside, while on MSP side, I will have to modify  MSP,  since it doesn’t support plugin mode. 
So I wonder if MSP could designed in  pluggable way as bccsp did in v1.1.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 10:12:43 GMT):<br/>
@dijun, it is a very good point. I think we need that as well
</p>
<p><strong>dijun</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:03:18 GMT):<br/>
So @adc ,I think there are two issues that we must face on。
1. If we define plugin as a msp type, how to determine  which plugin should we use for a specific org, perhaps there are several plugins in the network that each org will use one.
2. And how can we distribute plugin binaries from channel config. Or maybe we just do this offline.  It should also be noted that different platforms could use different plugin binaries which make things a bit more complex.
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 08:47:39 GMT):<br/>
@dijun, very good points. Indeed one way to solve these issue is to resort to ledger to tell us the truth about which plugins a certain channel understands. For instance, on the ledger we might store the code as well. Design document need to be produced to find consensus :)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=Jp5jft9Sb79KFsySy) @martinvaller Is CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE set to TLS Root certificate of the organization where peer belongs to?
</p>
<p><strong>martinvaller</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:19:46 GMT):<br/>
Is it correct?

</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:25:07 GMT):<br/>
I think not, that one is TLS of the peer, what you need is PEM file of the Root CA of ORg0, usually if you follow fabric examples its created under /data folder
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:26:11 GMT):<br/>
in the case of fabric-ca example where intermediate CA is used it is file located under, for example under  /data/org0-ca-chain.pem

<p><strong>martinvaller</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:28:20 GMT):<br/>
I suppose the correct cert is located in crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/ordererorg0/ca
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:28:38 GMT):<br/>
yes, i think you're right
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:29:07 GMT):<br/>
sorry, i think you need under peerOrganizations/peerorg0/ca
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:31:49 GMT):<br/>
basically you need to prefix your command with: CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=<path to msp> CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=<msp id> CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=<root CA cert of org> peer channel create .....
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:32:32 GMT):<br/>
rest of the command you sent: ...-o srv-blockchain:7050 -c ch1 -t 50 -f /home/bc/bcnetwork/conf/channel-artifacts/ch1.tx --tls --cafile /home/bc/bcnetwork/conf/crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/ordererorg0/orderers/srv-blockchain.ordererorg0/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.ordererorg0-cert.pem" i think it looks ok
</p>
<p><strong>martinvaller</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:38:37 GMT):<br/>
the error message is confusing ""grpc: Server.Serve failed to complete security handshake from "10.31.4.53:46576": tls: client didn't provide a certificate" Does it mean that no certificate was not sent at all or does it mean that it was incorrect certificate...
</p>
<p><strong>martinvaller</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:40:23 GMT):<br/>
also, as I understood, in case of tls "grpcs" should be used instead of "grpc". Does the "grpc" in the error message mean that it uses wrong protocol?

Hi, I added a new signature scheme to the software-based BCCSP implementation. Now I ask myself what further steps are necessary to use this scheme in a fabric network. Do I have to modify the MSP implementation to use the new scheme or does the MSP implementation use the signature scheme depending on the key type used in the credentials? In the second case, am I right, that ensuring that the certificates are created with the new scheme is enough?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:31:59 GMT):<br/>
you need a way to store the keys in the MSP @nebsterboy 
</p>
<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:33:10 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm how do I store a key in the MSP? I figured out that I need a KeyImporter to create an Identity object from a certificate.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:33:28 GMT):<br/>
you don't have to use x509 certificates...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:33:33 GMT):<br/>
you can implement your own MSP
</p>
<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:35:50 GMT):<br/>
ah okay, that's an option. Do you think this is less effort than extending the already existing one? (At the moment, I'm also not sure if it really has to be modified.)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:37:08 GMT):<br/>
well it depends
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:37:24 GMT):<br/>
do you plan to put the public key inside the x509 cert?
</p>
<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:39:03 GMT):<br/>
I would say yes or are there other options for a working network at the end?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:42:29 GMT):<br/>
yes of course
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:42:36 GMT):<br/>
you can put a certficate *and* a key alongside it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:42:43 GMT):<br/>
an MSP identity is just bytes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:42:52 GMT):<br/>
with 2 things:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:42:58 GMT):<br/>
1) MSP ID
2) Bytes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:44:31 GMT):<br/>
for bccsp-msp (the standard MSP), 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:44:34 GMT):<br/>
the bytes is just the PEM
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:44:45 GMT):<br/>
so you can instead - put 2 things- the PEM and the public key
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:44:47 GMT):<br/>
makes sense?
</p>
<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:46:10 GMT):<br/>
okay, yes makes sense. What are the advantages in separating the PEM and the public key? If I understand the code right, at the moment the public key is obtained from the PEM, right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:48:43 GMT):<br/>
the advantage of using the pem
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:48:46 GMT):<br/>
is code re-use
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:48:48 GMT):<br/>
for the MSP ;)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:48:57 GMT):<br/>
you just need to switch to use the other key
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:49:17 GMT):<br/>

oh actually you need the issuer to sign both

So far I thought about changing the key of the certificates and providing a corresponding KeyImporter. Since signing and verifying is related to the type of the key (when using the sw-bccsp), I was wondering if the existing bccsp-msp still works with the new signature scheme. Am I missing anything?

The servert.crt has "Subject Alternative Names: srv-blockchain2.org0, srv-blockchain2, IP Address:10.31.4.51" which should be enough or should I define the CN also as an IP address

@martinvaller  The `--cafile` parameter should be set the the root CA which issued the TLS certificate being used by your orderer 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 13:35:40 GMT):<br/>
My guess is that would be `/home/bc/bcnetwork/conf/crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/ordererorg0/orderers/srv-blockchain.ordererorg0/tls/ca.crt`
</p>
<p><strong>martinvaller</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 13:37:51 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but for some reason the keyfile and certfile are not taken into account automatically. When I define them explicitly, the tls related error disappear `--cafile ~/bcnetwork/conf/crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/ordererorg0/orderers/srv-blockchain.ordererorg0/tls/ca.crt --keyfile ~/bcnetwork/conf/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org0/peers/srv-blockchain2.org0/tls/server.key  --certfile ~/bcnetwork/conf/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org0/peers/srv-blockchain2.org0/tls/server.crt`
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 13:39:53 GMT):<br/>
You should not need to set the `--keyfile` or `--certfile` unless you have mutual (client auth) TLS enabled
</p>
<p><strong>martinvaller</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 13:40:10 GMT):<br/>
yes, it is enabled

Whe I'm connecting to the srv-blockchain2 with openssl, then everything looks ok `openssl s_client -connect srv-blockchain2:7051 -CAfile /home/bc/bcnetwork/conf/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org0/peers/srv-blockchain2.org0/tls/ca.crt -cert ~/bcnetwork/conf/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org0/peers/srv-blockchain2.org0/tls/server.crt -key ~/bcnetwork/conf/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org0/peers/srv-blockchain2.org0/tls/server.key`

Could someone give a hint what is wrong? The srv-blockchain2 certificate has `Subject Alternative Names: srv-blockchain2.org0, srv-blockchain2, IP Address:10.31.4.51, IP Address:127.0.0.1`.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=PAWtNLKDJKhFKyWDM) @sh777 Yes and I'm wondering whether the `peer channel list` uses at all the certificates to establish a tls connection. As I change the certificate and key values to non-existant files, the `peer channel list` command does not give an error that these files do not exist but still connects to peer, resulting with `Server.Serve failed to complete security handshake from "127.0.0.1:46420": tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake`

@elli-androulaki @jyellick @JonathanLevi @aso https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/15707/ we can probably remove the -2s and progress this now that we're in 1.2

Good idea.  As a note to the implementors, I know @sykesm is working on making the e2e a bit more re-usable, so it might be a good idea to coordinate with him.  I'll add this as a note to the CR as well

Isn't IdMix available already in 1.1 (without needing to rebuild with the experimental flag) ?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 18:48:30 GMT):<br/>
I think it was merged and did not get disabled. I can check with our guys, but that's what they told me.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 18:49:59 GMT):<br/>
IIRC the SDK support was never fully implemented, the only client side that was ever merged to v1.1 is peer CLI support
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 18:50:17 GMT):<br/>
but @manu or @mdu would know for sure
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 18:50:54 GMT):<br/>
also endorsing with idemix credentials is a bit tricky in v1.1
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 18:51:25 GMT):<br/>
verifying is working, but endorsing means custom ESCC :sick: 
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 19:17:32 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the idemix MSP implementation was merged for v1.1
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 19:17:45 GMT):<br/>
But, since there was no client support, we did not want to advertise an incomplete feature
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 19:18:26 GMT):<br/>
So, when client support is merged in v1.2, we have a full story.  And, if users wish to not upgrade their v1.1 channels to v1.2, they can still take advantage of idemix so long as they use the newer client versions.

<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 12:49:29 GMT):<br/>
State database of any peer shouldn't reveal the asset
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 12:50:33 GMT):<br/>
Also symmetric key won't work because user A is passing asset to user B, so A is invoking

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 12:53:04 GMT):<br/>
You need a PRF though, not a PRNG

<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 12:54:57 GMT):<br/>
@CodeReaper, leveraging asymmetric encryption is certainly an option. If you want to pursuit that one then you can use directly the rsa package (for example) in your chaincode

<p><strong>adc</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 13:32:22 GMT):<br/>
so what you could do is to have the client send, via transient, a seed and then you can use a PRF (SHA2) to produce randomness in a deterministic way

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 13:25:22 GMT):<br/>
attribute cannot be overwritten at enrollment .... you can select which ones you want to have in your cert, but you can't change their value
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 13:25:50 GMT):<br/>
in v1.1, you can update the attributes of a user after registration as long as you have permission

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 15 Apr 2018 13:18:59 GMT):<br/>
You can either code in the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 15 Apr 2018 13:19:06 GMT):<br/>
or create and install an auth handler @mozkarakoc

(auth filter)

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 15 Apr 2018 13:25:53 GMT):<br/>
there is a library `cid`

@yacovm I found a good tutorial for `cid` in medium, thanks! one more thing about auth filter and decorators, if I want to create auth handler, should I rebuild fabric with source? Can i use it with docker?

you don't have to

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 15 Apr 2018 14:28:19 GMT):<br/>
you can compile it as a plugin

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 15 Apr 2018 14:28:24 GMT):<br/>
and then put it in the folder

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=nj67xPwcTDjxKd2i8) @huy.tranibm I know that. But have you taken a look at the number of files inside a peer? or orderer?  There are so many. If these folders are getting generated, there has to be an explanation for each folder - each file. i.e, if we go about these folders to be used by general users. They will ask questions

@Ashish your right there seems to be much confusion between certs for msp and tls and it would save a lot of time. I think its assumed that people will look through the docker-compose.yaml and figure it out on their own, but yes some explanation would save a lot of time.

Hello.  I have a concern - best described with this question.

What happens when a private blockchain certificate expires?```

Here's the scenario. Private blockchain - built on the Hyperledger Fabric technology. At start up you created certificate authorities for each of the network participant organisations and certificates for all of the peers etc.

Sometime later..... these certificates start to expire.

Q : What happens then?

Q : How are the certificates managed and renewed?

Q : How does that affect the blockchain?

​If someone has a great link they can share or even a simple answer that would be brilliant.​

@IanBradbury_Rex  it is simple, you can create a new certificate using old one. This is supported by FabricCA. But if you create a new certificates the result will be the same. Certificate management is responsibility of the client. You can renew the certificates before they expire. By default the livetime of a cert is 10 years, but you can change this value. This will not affect the blockchain in any way. The old data signed with expired certificates is still there and can be validated, because this certificates sign the data, they do not encrypt the data. Even after 100 years you will be able to verify that this transaction was signed by valid certificate from valid Org

<p><strong>gatakka</strong> (Thu, 19 Apr 2018 14:20:18 GMT):<br/>
If you are talking about data encryption, in general case this is done using symmetric cryptography, and there is no expiration there.
</p>
<p><strong>gatakka</strong> (Thu, 19 Apr 2018 14:22:31 GMT):<br/>
So in general, nothing bad will happen. The worst thing to happen is that new requests will be rejected if certificate expire, and you just create a new valid one.

Thanks @gatakka - that puts my mind at ease.

@gatakka, @IanBradbury_Rex , There is a case where you can end up losing encrypted data.  If you encrypt your data with an AES key and intend to share it with other users the normal thing to do in the Elliptic Curve world would actually be, not to create a data encryption key, but rather to create an ephemeral EC key which is then used under an ECIES scheme (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme) to arrive at a data encryption key.  If your recipient loses or changes their private key rather than obtaining a new certificate with the same old key then they would no longer be able to derive that data encryption key anymore.   

So in the case that you might be doing data encryption you will want to look at what sort of key retention would be required.  I'm not aware of any such feature built into fabric, but am just letting you know that there can be cases of data loss if you generate a new key/cert and don't retain old keys.

Yes, you are right, but question was for digital signatures used to sign the blocks. You can always verify them, no expiration. And they can be veryfied using the certificate chain, not one specific certificate.

<p><strong>MikeGardiner</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:22:20 GMT):<br/>
@gatakka, there must be some level of awareness of expiration, and revocation.  Otherwise if your key is compromised then it can be used maliciously.  If that compromise is after the expiration, or after it's been revoked then the transaction should be identified as fraudulent before being accepted 

A 10 year default is also way too long given an impending crypto transition for quantum, and the trend towards frequent rotation of credentials/secrets to reduce their value.

I have a pretty specific question. We are trying to encrypt our data on the chain code but we don’t want to lose our mango queries to query inside an object in CouchDB. Anyone have any ideas? We looked at encCC but here we then loose our mango queries so this is not really an option. Another option we thought about was that we could use Vault from HashiCorp to manage the encryption keys and then encrypt the values but not the keys and then also encrypt the query in the same way to still be able to do the mango queries. If anyone has a better idea feel free explain it.

there is some proposal regarding privacy preserving endorsement
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 14:59:56 GMT):<br/>
How will one define endorsement policy in that case ? Using pseudonym derived from idemix ?

<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 05:04:27 GMT):<br/>
@Jan.Camenisch How is Idemix going to prevent same person impersonating as two different entities while signing (handle the problem of double signing) ?

</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 07:46:41 GMT):<br/>
@SubhraMazumdar There will be a 'principal' to check whether the signature is anonymous or not, and you can write your policy accordingly (see https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/16693/)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 07:52:11 GMT):<br/>
I think what he means is how can you enforce a policy that is signed by multiple members of the same organization (for instance). @manu 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 07:52:19 GMT):<br/>
I think you can't.... from obvious reasons
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 07:54:50 GMT):<br/>
I see. For now we envision idemix being used by clients only, so not for endorsements, but in the future we could also use idemix for endorsement and then there are some things we can do, like anonymously endorsing while guaranteeing that a certain amount of distinct members endorsed it.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 07:56:03 GMT):<br/>
>  like anonymously endorsing while guaranteeing that a certain amount of distinct members endorsed it. 
oh, really? 
how? With attributes?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 07:56:38 GMT):<br/>
Does that mean you do something like a combined signature? 
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 08:03:28 GMT):<br/>
you could add a 'scope-exclusive' pseudonym. For a given scope s, every user can only create one such pseudonym, so if you see two distinct scope-exclusive pseudonyms for the same scope, you know that they are two different signers. But at the same time, for a different scope s', signatures are entirely unlinkable
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 08:04:39 GMT):<br/>
but the scope I guess is generated at runtime, and the peers would need to know the scope before signing, no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 08:04:57 GMT):<br/>
I guess the client generates some random string and passes this as input to the peer's signing ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 08:17:27 GMT):<br/>
@manu ^
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 08:18:49 GMT):<br/>
I don't think you even need that. You could let the scope be whatever the peers are endorsing, that should be unique right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 08:19:22 GMT):<br/>
but then can't a peer choose 2 scopes?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 08:19:40 GMT):<br/>
oh you mean the payload to sign
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 08:19:43 GMT):<br/>
exactly

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=Wgyn5Epv83m7Gb9FW) @manu If the signer is anonymous given if he or she takes help of idemix to do that, how does one ensure breaking of unlinkability in case of dispute ?
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 08:57:22 GMT):<br/>
thats a good question. We're planning to have one or multiple auditors that are able to retrieve the real identity of the signer from an idemix signature
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 08:58:17 GMT):<br/>
But given that each user generates its own secret key, can you elaborate as in how auditors gonna put a check on that ?
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 08:58:22 GMT):<br/>
@manu 
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 09:00:07 GMT):<br/>
So in the idemix credential that a user obtains, there is a number of attributes. One of them will be its enrollment identity, by which he is known to the CA. When making an idemix signature a user then encrypts his enrollment id such that an auditor can decrypt it. He must also prove in zero-knowledge that he did this correctly, such that he cannot cheat and avoid auditing
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 09:03:21 GMT):<br/>
So by that you mean the Ecert is know to CA and so send his encrypted Ecert (with encrypted key of auditor) which must send definitely for audit purpose. Hence this auditor must be able to figure out any sort of malpractice. Am I right in interpreting @manu ?

</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 09:04:07 GMT):<br/>
So somehow auditor is in control of all transactions happening and it has knowledge of everything
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 09:05:07 GMT):<br/>
I am talking from endorsement point of view ..retaining endorser privacy
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 09:23:31 GMT):<br/>
@manu can you elaborate on the work done over here ?
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 09:23:32 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 09:23:49 GMT):<br/>
What is the purpose of MSP principal for anonymity ?
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 10:52:59 GMT):<br/>
You don't send the entire ecert, just the identifier in it, but other then that I think you're interpreting it correctly. If something goes wrong, for example a transaction is endorsed that should not be endorsed, then the auditor can find the identity of the endorser. So indeed, in that scenario the endorser is not anonymous towards the auditor, but you could have multiple auditors such that every endorser could choose one auditor it trusts, and we don't get a single auditor that can see everything. 

The MSP principal for anonymity gives a standard way to check whether a signature is anonymous or not, because as you said, anonymous signatures don't necessarily work for any endorsement policy. This way we can prevent idemix signatures from being used for such policies (until we have the scope-exclusive pseudonyms that i described above)
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 15:53:01 GMT):<br/>
Ok so currently are you thinking about implementing anonymous endorsement in your policy @manu ?
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 15:58:26 GMT):<br/>
well not right now, our priority is first getting everything ready for clients to sign with idemix, having anonymous endorsement is a lower priority
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 15:59:09 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 16:00:39 GMT):<br/>
In which version of fabric is idemix feature going to be integrated @manu ?
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 16:01:15 GMT):<br/>

Hi, i'm looking at decoded block that contains one transaction which was endorsed by one peer and committed to the ledger. I see in endorsement section this(i omit the values for brevity):
"endorsements": [{
									"endorser": "...........",
									"signature": "..........."
								}
How these values (endorser and signature) are calculated?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 13:51:10 GMT):<br/>
@IgorSim  - as you hopefully know, the transaction flow is as follows:

1) Client sends endorsement requests to 1 or more peers
2) Peers send back signed endorsement responses (the signature is detached but each peer signs the actual response payload)
3) Client packages up response and signatures and sends to the orderer
4) The orderer batches transactions and delivers blocks to the peers

So the array or endrosements contains the endorser (which is the X509 certificate bytes in the case of the default MSP) and the signature (which is the signature over the ProposalResponsePayload)

@cbf  Congrats on your announcement of ZKAT (aka privacy preserving asset transfer) at Consensus last month. I am writing to enquire whether details in addition to  ```https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-blockchain-private-confidential-transactions-hyperledger-fabric-zero-knowledge-proof/index.html```  have been published, such as code from your consensus demo or a more technical description of your zkat implementation, describing the audit feature implementation etc.

I am currently developing a signature application and thus simulating the transaction flow steps in Fabric . What is the payload size that one must consider in order to do so ?

@SubhraMazumdar  - depends on what you are trying to measure ... if you expect your payloads to be relatively small (e.g. a function call with a few parameters) then just use byte or kilobyte sized messages.  Assuming bandwidth is not an issue, size will not make much difference when talking about small messages.

Hi, is there a way to exchange the TLS implementation used by hyperledger fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:59:42 GMT):<br/>
@nebsterboy , can you please elaborate ? 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:00:10 GMT):<br/>
you mean replacing by some other implementation ? 
</p>
<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 06:27:50 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar yes, exactly. Assuming I want to use an TLS implementation that supports Post-Quantum Crypto. Is it easy to extend the current system? Am I right that hyperledger relies on the golang crypto/tls package as the TLS implementation?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:54:41 GMT):<br/>
you are right @nebsterboy , hyperledger relies on golang tls package for TLS implementation. We do not have BYOP(Bring your own provider)
</p>
<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:55:37 GMT):<br/>
This means, it is necessary to extend the golang tls package in order to provide additional cipher suites?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:58:06 GMT):<br/>
Not necessarily. If some implementation implements cipher suite that you are after , we can use that instead of golang tls package.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:58:59 GMT):<br/>
support for cipher suite is bigger problem to solve.
</p>
<p><strong>nebsterboy</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 17:26:44 GMT):<br/>
okay. Is there a central point where the golang tls package is specified as tls implementation so that this can be changed easily?

Hi , How to encrypt  data and store it in chaincode, I have to also decrypt the data in chaincode to calculate? There are TWO METHODS CryptoSuit_ESDSA_AES and CryptoSuit_PKCS11, which one I have to use? I have a single channel application. Here I have to encrypt data before any transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>Tony</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 11:32:16 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 15:27:34 GMT):<br/>
@Tony , are you using node sdk ? 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 15:32:52 GMT):<br/>
you use CryptoSuit_PKCS11 for HSMs.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 15:33:25 GMT):<br/>
for software based solution , you should use CryptoSuit_ESDSA_AES.
</p>
<p><strong>Tony</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 05:23:37 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar yes I am using node sdk, for CryptoSuit_ESDSA_AES for encrypt and decrypt function it showing yet to implement, https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/CryptoSuite_ECDSA_AES.html

I have a - hopefully simple - question about the identity mixer.
If I understood what I read (which is debatable) it appears that the identities within an MSP are anonymized.
So if I had two orgs, each with their own CA, each of which uses a mixer it appears that it is still be possible to tell which org a TX is from. 
Is that correct or have I got hold of the wrong end of the stick here?

<p><strong>manu</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 13:10:55 GMT):<br/>
Correct, so you should issue all idemix identities from a single CA if want the identities from the different orgs to be indistinguishable. In the future, we could imagine implementing https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3134025 to have anonymity even with multiple CAs.
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 13:12:04 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately with real (competing) orgs that's not likely to happen. But now I can figure out how to explain why it's not a panacea at least. Thanks for the help.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 13:13:18 GMT):<br/>

@aatkddny I think Ash means data that is really really fat
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 10:42:29 GMT):<br/>
if you have data that its size is managable 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 10:42:53 GMT):<br/>
then you can just put it inside the blockchain like you want, and perhaps as private data with application level salt
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 10:43:01 GMT):<br/>
so that the hashes won't be invertable 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 10:44:03 GMT):<br/>
now.... as for your other question yesterday - I am wondering - in your use case, why actually can't you just give users one big MSP 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 10:44:06 GMT):<br/>
and make that an idemix MSP
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 10:44:24 GMT):<br/>
and the rest of the orgs would be orgs with only peers and they'll use x509 certificates
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 10:44:32 GMT):<br/>
is that a no-no in your use case?
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:00:03 GMT):<br/>
Imagine two competing orgs. 
Each has a fabric instance in their own cloud infrastructure. 
Each manages their own access by hooking up their CA server to their own internal AD (using LDAP or some home grown glue code) to automate management. 
Try getting them to agree to merge that so someone else handles identity. 
Then expand that problem to many competitors. 
Yes in theory we could federate access through something like Ping and hash org/user, but that's a hack. And getting buy in won't be a simple task. 

Not having read the whole document I'm also not sure whether it's possible to search for all transactions by a user if they are anonymized. Which in an audit for potential malfeasance would be - shall we say - desirable. But that's a secondary concern. The ability to anonymize which two of n organizations in a multi-organization channel are transacting is what drove my question.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:01:55 GMT):<br/>
I think for auditing there is a way - @manu ^ 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:02:26 GMT):<br/>
so when you say each has a fabric instance-  what do you mean?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:02:39 GMT):<br/>
each organization has its own peers or also an orderer instance? @aatkddny 
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:03:26 GMT):<br/>
Probably not an orderer - unless we figure out how to permission management such that they can't enroll new members. But yes they'll have their own peers.
</p>

I still don't understand, to be honest... why do you _ have _ to issue all the user credentials from the CAs of the companies?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:06:40 GMT):<br/>
can't you make a single CA for only users?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:06:50 GMT):<br/>
and have it hosted by the same company that hosts the orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:07:34 GMT):<br/>
if you trust the orderer not to fork your blockchain by cutting different orgs to different peers, can't you trust it for user issuance? (I'm asking, no idea what is your assumptions)

can you elaborate on what you mean by anonymize ? you're not allowed to see who endorsed the transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:10:02 GMT):<br/>
I'll answer the last first - the other one may get TLDR.

Hypothetical for emphasis - IBM wouldn't like it known by Oracle that they were talking to buy (say) some software startup called X-Drive. 
If we record transaction details without obscuring that IBM are talking to X-Drive and Oracle find out, do some DD and then decide they want in and make a better offer IBM aren't going to be very happy.
Extend that analogy to our use case.

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:14:24 GMT):<br/>
well but in that case - can't you just have only a single chaincode to endorse - either on X-Drive or IBM's peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:15:02 GMT):<br/>
then, you can make IBM and X-drive be in a private data collection
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:15:28 GMT):<br/>
anyone looking at the public blockchain, only sees that the endorsement is from either IBM or X-Drive, and doesn't see the content
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:18:56 GMT):<br/>
The first one - I'm trying to distill the problem. 
Our clients want to manage authentication. They tend to be large organizations with their own internal IT systems. Mostly AD based. They want to control all aspects of identity management whenever possible. Our regular systems federate for authentication and only manage authorization internally. Hiving a portion of that off to something 1. Controlled by another and 2. Shared isn't seen as desirable.

That turns a channel proliferation problem into a chaincode proliferation one. Given the problems I've seen standing multiple chaincode instances up in cloud providers I'll stick with the channel problem I know.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:21:13 GMT):<br/>
you are correct on the last comment
</p>

BTDT. Srsly...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:21:59 GMT):<br/>
so are you going to use (n choose 2) channels?
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:23:17 GMT):<br/>
I have no choice until the org level stuff goes GA. Then I can revisit. That still leaves me with the "can HL manage a lot of channels problem" but I can kick that can down the road a bit.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:23:35 GMT):<br/>
I can just give you a formula
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:23:42 GMT):<br/>
you input your stuff in the formula and get an answer
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:24:44 GMT):<br/>
for scaling out you mean?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:24:49 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:26:33 GMT):<br/>
Basically, memory-wise - lets assume that a given peer is member of `k` channels, and each channel has blocks that are on average `B` bytes size.
So, that peer stores in its memory an upper bound of `peer.gossip.maxBlockCountToStore` `*` `k` `*` `B` 


https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L161
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:28:12 GMT):<br/>
there are other caches in the memory of the peer but I think that's the biggest one
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:28:22 GMT):<br/>
No wonder my docker instance is struggling. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:28:55 GMT):<br/>
oh actually there is another one, but it is only relevant for leader peers - and it might be twice the size of `maxBlockCountToStore` by default
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:29:04 GMT):<br/>
but half of it is a re-use of a reference
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:29:17 GMT):<br/>
so it's still the same asymptotically 
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:29:34 GMT):<br/>
And that's with 20 or so channels rather than the 10k or so we project as an upper bound. Is there a consequence to cutting `maxBlockCountToStore`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:29:59 GMT):<br/>
how many peers do you have in each org?
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:30:00 GMT):<br/>
Better - can it be reconfigured dynamically.
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:30:06 GMT):<br/>
2
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:30:14 GMT):<br/>
The minimum for failover.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:30:28 GMT):<br/>
if it's 2 then set it to like 2 or something
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:30:44 GMT):<br/>
as long as yours peers are always in sync
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:30:48 GMT):<br/>
it should work

</p>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:31:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:33:49 GMT):<br/>
so that's for peer to peer gossip inside an org? multiple orgs - each with 2 peers - doesn't affect the number
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:34:12 GMT):<br/>
there is no gossip of blocks outside of orgs, sadly. I'd like to add it in v1.3
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:34:41 GMT):<br/>
there is a different point-to-point sync between orgs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:34:46 GMT):<br/>
but it's much slower
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:35:28 GMT):<br/>
but another issue you'll have is....
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:35:34 GMT):<br/>
if you have a zillion channels....
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:35:42 GMT):<br/>
that's a zillion gRPC connections
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:35:47 GMT):<br/>
from each org
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:35:52 GMT):<br/>
to the orderers ;)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:36:14 GMT):<br/>
so you'll need to scale out the orderers too

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:37:08 GMT):<br/>
but it all depends also on the throughput i guess
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:37:10 GMT):<br/>
wait - each channel has a grpc connection to the orderer? i thought that was one per peer and then a butt load from peer:chaincode container.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:37:26 GMT):<br/>
so, it goes like this:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:37:36 GMT):<br/>
for each channel, for each org, there is a designated peer leader
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:37:49 GMT):<br/>
that peer creates a gRPC connection to some orderer instance
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:38:20 GMT):<br/>
so if you have `k` channels and lets say 2 orgs in each channel as you said - that's `2k` connections 
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:40:38 GMT):<br/>
a connection per channel. that has to be to combat some throughput limitation otherwise it seems incredibly wasteful.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:41:20 GMT):<br/>
it's not as easy as you think....
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:41:26 GMT):<br/>
each channel has its own TLS root CAs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:41:45 GMT):<br/>
you can't just combine them and then multiplex the connections
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:41:45 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:41:53 GMT):<br/>
otherwise you're exposed to attacks
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:45:19 GMT):<br/>
each channel has its own TLS? I thought - clearly wrongly - you established the link peer-orderer using the crypto for those only. i assumed you'd publish - orderer side - only to the peers links that have access to that channel. shows what assuming does.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:46:10 GMT):<br/>
a channel has an entire configuration of all security stuff
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:46:27 GMT):<br/>
i'll give you an example
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:47:04 GMT):<br/>
if you have a channel `C1` it may be used by orderers of orgs `O1, O2, O3` but at the same time, a channel `C2` might be used by orderers of orgs `O2, O3, O4`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:47:21 GMT):<br/>
clearly, `O4` isn't in the TLS CA certificate of the channel `C1`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:48:07 GMT):<br/>
therefore if you create a connection from a peer to the orderers of channel `C1` you have to explicitly tell the TLS certificate pool to only trust TLS certificates issued by TLS CAs of `O1, O2, O3`
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:50:09 GMT):<br/>
i see where you are going with this.
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:51:08 GMT):<br/>
yuck. so there's an upper bound in the peer to channels
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:51:10 GMT):<br/>
we can optimize... in the future
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:51:23 GMT):<br/>
but the problem is that currently - the orderer endpoints are configured in the config block globally
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:51:26 GMT):<br/>
and not per channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:51:55 GMT):<br/>
once we move that to be per channel then we can just optimize and create the TLS connection with a single root TLS CA certificate set - of that org
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:51:59 GMT):<br/>
and then it'll be solved :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:52:15 GMT):<br/>
There is a JIRA for that and I hope we'll do it in v1.3
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:52:42 GMT):<br/>
just so long as it isn't a breaking change. :D
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:53:02 GMT):<br/>

Hi everyone.Has anyone tried generating certificates using fabric-ca rather than cryptogen and using them to run balance-transfer
For me the orderer is rejecting the channel creation request.

Can anyone help ,me

Hi, I am trying to invoke chaincode using a certificate which was created using fabric-ca. The peers reject the TxProposal saying
`the identity must be a client, a peer or an orderer identity to be valid, not a combination of them. OUs: [[0xc427fe7b00]], MSP: [MyMSP]
`
When I parse the certificate manually with third party software, it shows just one OU called "user". Why do I get this weird HEX string in the error message? Can anyone help me out please? The error is thrown here in the source code: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/msp/mspimplvalidate.go#L206

<p><strong>NilsPe</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 16:23:22 GMT):<br/>
Looking into the code, this error is supposed to return bogus OUs. At least I can see that just one OU is detected.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 16:32:50 GMT):<br/>
you need to get cert from fabric ca as setting OU to peer.
</p>
<p><strong>NilsPe</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 16:43:37 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your answer. Does it really need to read "peer" even though I want a certificate for a user (doing txs..)?
</p>
<p><strong>NilsPe</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 17:07:29 GMT):<br/>
Okay, found it. I had the mistake even in my first post. The default OU for users is not "user" but "client". After issuing "client" certificates it works. I feel this needs some more documentation... Cheers

The `Channel` configuration (line 304) includes `Policies` and `Capabilities`, but no `Consortium` keyword, and it seems it is required
</p>

Adding `Consortium: SampleConsortium` make it works, I wonder why it is not in the sample file

can someone exactly tell me what adminprincipal: role.admin/member means?
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 19:23:03 GMT):<br/>
is refering to which role should have the principal to be recognized as an admin on the peer or something like that?
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 04:27:21 GMT):<br/>
Today `cryptogen` doesn't support generating crypto material for custom user names (and instead takes a count). Support for this could be particularly useful for demos, or at least make demos look more meaningful. Is there any reason I should not add a task for this on Jira?
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sat, 01 Sep 2018 16:15:18 GMT):<br/>
I am making some polcies testing and I have no way to get transactions done if is not with a member identity. When I create policies where an admin must sign I always get an ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE response

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 14:26:19 GMT):<br/>
@albert.lacambra  - Why would you want to have endorsement policies which use Admins?   That's not really the purpose of the Admin role.
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:13:20 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=w97pibf4h9WXHGdEX) @mastersingh24 @mastersingh24 well, is more about testing. The original org1, org2 examples accepts a sinature of member or one for admins and several docs speaks about the order how the polcies should be set (first admin and then member since admin is also a mebmer)
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:13:54 GMT):<br/>
I just wanted to see exactly how the whole configuration works to have full control on it and not rely on example configs
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:14:53 GMT):<br/>
However, given at the current point I have the feeling that CC polcies should be just set to PEER that are those who actually signs the endorsments
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:15:48 GMT):<br/>
what I would like to know now is which other actions should be taken now by admins and clients. The admin role is currently the one used to install / instantiate and upgrade chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:17:25 GMT):<br/>
which other administrative tasks can be done by him? what kind of actions can take a principal with role client? where is this ehole configurable? I have received today some answer of Yacov Manevich on the newsletter and I am reading agina the membership documents.
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:18:23 GMT):<br/>
to me is clear how validation works, but not that clear how do I configure stuff and which are the expected actions to be done by each role
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:18:33 GMT):<br/>
maybe is just like that:
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:18:45 GMT):<br/>
ADMIN role: manage chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:18:57 GMT):<br/>
PEER role: signs endorsments 
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:19:09 GMT):<br/>
CLIENT role: send proposals to peer
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:19:30 GMT):<br/>
MEMBER role: should be maybe obsolete?
</p>
<p><strong>albert.lacambra</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:19:40 GMT):<br/>
thanks for your time :)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 16:46:50 GMT):<br/>
Some of this depends on the version you are on and of course the capabilities which you have enabled on a per channel basis.
But assuming you start with v1.2 and later, then in general you'd likely use the NodeOUIdentifier feature of MSPs and use Admin, Peer and Client roles.  Your endorsement policies would use the Peer role, clients would use the Client role and of course admins would use Admin.  But things can get a bit tricky in setting up the channel policies such that you have MSPs which include Peer and Client roles in your channel access policies

is there any way to create new peer admin if I lost certificate and _sk file for the previous one? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 20:35:51 GMT):<br/>
@gravity yeah you just need to issue a new certificate and private key
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 20:36:01 GMT):<br/>
and then add the certificate to the peer's file system under `msp/admins`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 20:36:18 GMT):<br/>
but.... it might be also good to issue a CRL update to revoke that certificate

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 20:36:25 GMT):<br/>
unless it expired

@yacovm Hi
really need your help 

I'm playing with the `fabric-ca` from fabric-samples
therein scripts ad admin user (which is used to create channels and install chaincodes) is registered on ca server and later enrolled to create a channel and here everything works well
but when I', trying to enroll this admin on ca with the same credentials using fabric-sdk, I'm told that identity is not an admin. but if I manually load cert and a keystore files from disks and create an enrollment object - everything is fine.
as for me, this is not very handy to load cert and a keystore file directly from disk and it would be better to enroll admin on ca when it's needed
is there any way to do this? am I missing something? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 09:49:20 GMT):<br/>
ask in #fabric-ca

@mastersingh24 , transactions in fabric are based on account, not utxo.  There is no privacy at all. With idemixer, client can transaction anonymously? Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 21 Sep 2018 08:48:48 GMT):<br/>
@qsmen  - by using Identity Mixer, clients can create pseudo-anonymous and unlinkable identities

Hello. Am I right that a peer retrieves attribute `hf.Type` from signer certificate during validating endorsement policies? But cryptogen doesn't add any attribute to peers certificates by default. And if my endorsement policy says "any peer from organization 1", all transactions will fail. Can I add this attribute with cryptogen?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 13:45:33 GMT):<br/>
@krabradosty  - the peer does not do anything with the attributes created by Fabric CA as they are not required.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 13:46:17 GMT):<br/>
Put another way, MSPs and policies have nothing to do with the attributes created by the Fabric CA as the Fabric CA is not required for operation
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 13:47:05 GMT):<br/>
Have a read through https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/membership/membership.html
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 13:57:03 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 It that case how do peers during validating endorsement policy distinguish signature of peers from any other members (client, admin)?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 17:30:05 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=WQbFzRDifgXGCvqLS) @krabradosty You need to use the NodeOU identifiers capability - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/msp.html#identity-classification

If you are using the Fabric CA, then it does actually add an `OU={hf.type}` in the issued certificates.
If you are using `cryptogen`, you can do this by setting `EnableNodeOUs=true` in your config file

Is it possible to incorporate RSA based signature scheme in Fabric given that only ECDSA is supported ?
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:15:04 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 @manu @Jan.Camenisch @adc 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:17:48 GMT):<br/>
theoretically it might work, but we've never tested it at all
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 19:17:31 GMT):<br/>
@SubhraMazumdar , RSA is not supported on PKCS11 , but is supported on Software.
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 05:53:18 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 if I want to integrate a module in Fabric based on RSA signature , how should I go about working on it ?

My scheme is RSA based and since it is not supported, shall I change it to an ECDSA based scheme ?

A linkable ring signature which can be used by endorsers while they are endorsing the transaction
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:12:28 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:13:58 GMT):<br/>
why would you want a *linkable* ring signature? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:14:02 GMT):<br/>
:thinking: 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:14:17 GMT):<br/>
to speed things up?
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:14:42 GMT):<br/>
The motivation for this is that I see that in some cases it would make sense if validators were not aware who endorsed a transaction..and to prevent any double signing, I zeroed in on linkable ring signature scheme
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:15:49 GMT):<br/>
but, if you use the x509 based MSP then the public keys are derived from linkable certificates no?
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:16:57 GMT):<br/>
Can you clarify ? I didnt get the point on linkable certificates relation with linkable ring signature ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:20:57 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, how do you know the endorser's public key is related to fabric
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:21:02 GMT):<br/>
and that the client didn't make it up?
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:24:19 GMT):<br/>
Is that possible ? Client cannot demand endorsement from any arbitrary entity who is not part of the channel in Fabric...an endorsement policy is specified at channel instantiation phase (can add dynamically now as stated in v1.3)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:25:02 GMT):<br/>
You have a ring signature, right? 
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:25:07 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:25:12 GMT):<br/>
do you agree that to verify the signature you need the public keys of the ring?
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:25:18 GMT):<br/>
yes true
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:25:28 GMT):<br/>
so the public keys, they reside in an x509 certificate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:25:34 GMT):<br/>
but it's linkable
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:26:00 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:26:13 GMT):<br/>
wait, hold on -  you're saying that the peers would know the public key list upfront?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:26:26 GMT):<br/>
so that they won't need the certificates inside the endorsement?
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:26:53 GMT):<br/>
yes my list of endorsers is known to everyone..it can be done some x% of total decide to vote...which x% vote that remains hidden
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:27:07 GMT):<br/>
how is it known to everyone?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:27:12 GMT):<br/>
is it hardcoded or something? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:27:34 GMT):<br/>
is this a research project?
</p>
<p><strong>SubhraMazumdar</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:27:55 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for using the term everyone...while i set up the channel...endorsement set is fixed
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:28:26 GMT):<br/>
yeah obviously it's by everyone in the channel and not by everyone in the US or everyone in Asia

@SubhraMazumdar , Ring signature are asymptotic in nature and mostly based on factorization , so why are you basing your solution based on the above ? 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 01:09:07 GMT):<br/>
Group theoretic based zero knowledge proof seems better option to me where you need to find a generator of group.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 01:11:26 GMT):<br/>
There are number of variants of Zero Knowledge proof implementation and it seemed to be more secured compared to Ring Signature per literature.

You can always use PKCS11 with an HSM.
Else not really sure what you are looking for?  You can also lock down file permissions, encrypt your directory, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 22:41:09 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=hLkSiRPW8KRDeCRQt) @AnirudhC KeyStore is secure whether it is pkcs12 or Java Key store. You can put your private key and signer certs there. Like @mastersingh24 said , you can use HSM as an alternative. You can do field level and disk level encryption also. A lots of choices.

Hi! 
Where do the certificates get stored when new users are created using a fabric CA server?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 10:03:25 GMT):<br/>
@AbhinayB  - Private keys are always stored local to the client which enrolls.  Where it is stored depends on which method you use to enroll, i.e. fabric-ca-client, one of the SDKs or by using the Fabric CA APIs directly.  When the client enrolls, a copy of the public key is stored in the Fabric CA database but is also sent to the client in the response to the enroll call and then stored locally alongside the private key

@mastersingh24 , just out of curiosity: why the fabric-ca-server sends the public key to the client if the client generated the private key and thus knows the public key?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 03 Nov 2018 13:13:28 GMT):<br/>
@Jgnuid  - Fabric CA sends back a X.509 certificate not just a plain EC public key

Hi all

I made a patch for China  standard crypto support in fabric. You can apply the patch in your project if you want to get this feature.

Note that this is only support for release version(1.1.x / 1.2.x / 1.3.x),  otherwise you should fix the conflict when you apply this patch.

Customized cryptogen is alse provided, called cryptogensm.  make cryptogensm in your project to make use of it.

Feel free to try it at https://github.com/flyinox/fabric-sm-patch

Because of the deep coupling with x509 which will be modified to support China crypto standards, making a patch is a good tradeoff to work with.
So I wonder if that is possible to add this patch file to fabric, so everyone who want to get use of it can simply apply it. In this way, anyone not interesting with it can be barely affected.

Any feedback or suggestion will be appreciated.

hi experts, consider additive homogeneous encryption scheme， like Paillier scheme.  How do endorsers check if a user's  balance  is bigger than zero when the balance is encrypted? if no check, when more money than the balance is tranfered, the balance may be negative, say -a,  that means the balance will be very big ,say (n-a).  How to check if the balance is legal?

@qsmen you mean homomorphic , not homogenous... right?

@qsmen I was under the impression that in homomorphic encryption
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 00:47:34 GMT):<br/>
you cannot check anything if you don't have the private key
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 00:47:42 GMT):<br/>
otherwise it breaks semantic security of the scheme
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Nov 2018 00:47:42 GMT):<br/>

Not sure if this is the right place to ask this, so redirect me if required.

In a Fabric deployment, is it possible/does it make sense for this: 3 peers exist in a channel with MSPID's OrgA, OrgB, OrgC, and I want a client of some OrgD to be able to invoke transactions in this.

Essentially, to be a client in a network, does the client's org have to run a peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 11:49:16 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 of course it makes sense.... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 11:49:26 GMT):<br/>
it's actually the recommended use case, I'd say
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 11:49:31 GMT):<br/>
that clients have their own MSP and CA
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 11:50:12 GMT):<br/>
Think about it - if you're a customer of a bank, you have credentials to enter the bank, but not to enter the bank's administrative systems

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=Jxmvv6bufdaXjF6of) @yacovm @yacovm But, theoretically, clients of OrgD (i guess that translates to enrolled users with CA from OrgD) should be able to transact with network even if OrgD doesn't have peer, as long as OrgD is part of the network (MSP is defined and is part of channel configuration). Is that correct?

Hi! I would like to use homomorphic encryption with Hyperledger. Is there any way that I can use HELib (https://github.com/shaih/HElib)? Can I use it like a plug in? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:49:38 GMT):<br/>
@mervecankus you mean in the chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:49:44 GMT):<br/>
or on the client side?
</p>
<p><strong>mervecankus</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:57:23 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm in the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:57:55 GMT):<br/>
then you need somehow to include your HElib stuff in the chaincode when you package it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:58:01 GMT):<br/>
i think that ideally
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:58:09 GMT):<br/>
you will just compile locally the `.a` file
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:58:24 GMT):<br/>
and then you can call the C++ code from Go
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:58:47 GMT):<br/>

Hey, I added a new signature scheme by providing a new Signer and Verifier. So far I seems to work. However, the scheme is stateful and so that I now want to update the key after a signing operation.
I found out that the fileBasedKeyStore provide a storing method for keys. I though about giving a reference to a fileBaseKeyStore within the SignerOpts to the Sign-method of my new Signer.
Can somebody tell me where these SignerOpts are set?
Or is there a better way to update the private key?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 09:14:57 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 09:15:16 GMT):<br/>
you can do that in ZK with sigma protocols, no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 09:16:22 GMT):<br/>
oh i see they describe several ways
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 09:16:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 09:19:53 GMT):<br/>

This is indeed much shorter than the standard range proofs that are linear in the bit size
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 09:28:59 GMT):<br/>
still support homomorphic encryption?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 09:31:27 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 10:53:19 GMT):<br/>
so it can support the normal transactions in ciphertext
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 11:10:54 GMT):<br/>
The bulletproof is based on Perderson committment, should be related to ECC. Because it can be used in transaction in Elements blockchain project, it should support additive homomorphic encryption. However, I never know a homomorphic encryption based on ECC.
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 11:33:56 GMT):<br/>
what puzzled me is that several blockchain projects based on fabric use Paillier as the encryption algorithm

@qsmen , Pailier is based on homomorphic encryption and multiplicative homomorphism is possible due to biliner maps. The group corresponding to Bilinear map might be part of ECC finite field , so that might be connection between homomorphic encryption and ECC.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=4k4Nqmkgg5WQqtFr9) @qsmen Pedersen commitment can be done without ECC too. Besides range proof, you can use bulletproofs to prove arbitrary statements too, eg. I can commit to a value and prove that the value committed to is greater than 5 and less than 10. This has applications in anonymous credentials.  
</p>
<p><strong>AVetter</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 09:09:43 GMT):<br/>
The fabric-shim-crypto node module uses a random IV if none is provided ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/blob/release-1.4/fabric-shim-crypto/lib/enc-sign.js#L42 ). But does this not make the chaincode execution non deterministic and therefore the transaction can not be endorsed? 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 14:13:27 GMT):<br/>
You are correct ... this only works in the single endorser case (i.e. development).  Otherwise you must pass the IV in via transient parameter

@satyarth1  - we'd have to see more info from the peer logs ... you should be able to see the logs in the console although you'll have to scroll back
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 09:47:36 GMT):<br/>
You can also try to dump the logs from the peer container using docker log s command as well

hi @yacovm 
what is the recommended expiration time for the certificates for peers and orderers? is it a good practice to leave expiry time 1 year and re-enroll them before they expire? 
and what it takes to re-enroll a peer whet it's certificate gets expired?
thanks in advance
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:28:28 GMT):<br/>
the practice is up to the CA and the policies
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:28:43 GMT):<br/>
some vendors rotate once per 3 months
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:29:03 GMT):<br/>
you need to restart the node to make it load a new TLS certificate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:29:27 GMT):<br/>
in the future *maybe* you'll be able to do that while it is online
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:30:40 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm is it the same for an enrollment certificate? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:31:19 GMT):<br/>
I guess for both
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:31:25 GMT):<br/>
oh wait
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:31:36 GMT):<br/>
I was talking about dynamically updating the TLS cert
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:31:46 GMT):<br/>
the endorllement is going to be harder to dynamically update
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:34:31 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm 
so for now, to re-enroll a peer (or orderer), we should issue `reenroll` using `fabric-ca-client`, place new certificate to the msp directory and restart a peer (or orderer), right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:39:51 GMT):<br/>
i don't know fabric-CA client :) 
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:42:44 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm 
I mean, that the general idea of updating enrollment certificates is the same compared to tls certificates, isn't it?
or should I better ask this question in #fabric-ca ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:43:06 GMT):<br/>
ask there 
</p>

Hey guys! How can we prevent the need for the crypto-config folder to be present for the fabric-client SDK and instead go through the fabric-ca for these certs?
I can assume we don't want all certificates in 1 place on the server

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=myhtD4XbtELjksjMY) I am sorry, I think this question is better suited for #fabric-ca 
But I'll rephrase it anyways, for development we have a crypto-config folder with all certificates. This is not done for production and therefor we should get the certificates from the CA instead. The question is how you switch from using the crypto-config to the fabric-ca
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 09:56:59 GMT):<br/>
@Legiit  - Have a look at 

- https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/msp.html#how-to-generate-msp-certificates-and-their-signing-keys to understand the local MSP structure and what is required for peer and ordering nodes

- https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/users-guide.html#enrolling-a-peer-identity shows how to use the fabric-ca-client to obtain the base information needed for the local MSPs

- https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/msp.html#channel-msp-setup explains what is needed in the "org msp" folders used in channel creation

The "trickiest" thing to deal with is making sure that you register and enroll and "org admin" as you'll need to add the org admin's public cert into the `admincerts` folder of your local and org MSPs

@adc Hello, I was refered to you by @dave.enyeart as you are the lead of the idemix project. I have a developer who has a PHD in math who works with my firm and we were thinking about contributing the Nodejs implementation of idemix to the project.  I was wondering what the procedure for allowing her to contribute is?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 30 Mar 2019 08:28:59 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Antimttr  - in order to contribute, you don't need anything more than an LFID and of course I assume your company will give her permission to contribute to open source.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 30 Mar 2019 08:31:13 GMT):<br/>
In terms of producing a NodeJS implementation of IdeMix, it would go in the Node SDK project .... 
So if you / she can create a JIRA (not sure if there is one already) and provide a basic sketch of the implementation, that's really all that would be needed (other than starting work on the code)  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Sat, 30 Mar 2019 21:11:13 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24  hi, yes there is one i think https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABN-689
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Sat, 30 Mar 2019 21:12:14 GMT):<br/>
how would we provide the sketch? just post it in comments?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sun, 31 Mar 2019 02:29:37 GMT):<br/>
@Antimttr Yes you can update the jira Description with an outline of your implementation thoughts.  If longer than a page or so you could alternatively write down your design thoughts in a google doc and put the link in the jira Description. That will also allow for inline comments and discussion.  Thanks for the help!

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 09:18:06 GMT):<br/>
@awattez  -   

- You must be an admin of the peer in order to install chaincode.  Peer admin(s) is/are defined in the peer's local MSP (i.e. the admin public cert(s) is/are placed in the admincerts folder of the local MSP).
- Instantiating chaincode is scoped at the channel level.  You must be an admin of an org which is a member of the channel.  There is no way to prevent an admin of one org from invoking an instantiate operation on another org's peer (assuming that org is also part of the channel).

just seems convoluted that you would have an orderer org completely dissasociated from peer orgs

@mastersingh24 @adc @dave.enyeart  Hi, I have an initial draft of the idemix for nodejs sdk design document ready to post. How can I get a jira account to make a comment on https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABN-689 ? I tried logging in with my linux foundation credentials but those did not work. Please advise, thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Sun, 14 Apr 2019 16:27:58 GMT):<br/>
ok i think i got it now, was able to login
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Sun, 14 Apr 2019 16:28:06 GMT):<br/>
had to create a new account for some reason
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Sun, 14 Apr 2019 16:30:14 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart about how long should we wait for comments before beginning implementation?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Sun, 14 Apr 2019 16:32:27 GMT):<br/>
or is there some sort of design approval process that it needs to go through?

Hello, i'm looking for a diagram showing how identity mixer is use in MSP on fabric. The official document is not clear about it
</p>
<p><strong>levanto</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:33:33 GMT):<br/>
```
cannot use signingIdentity (type "vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/msp".SigningIdentity) as type "vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/token".SigningIdentity in argument to client.NewClient:
	"vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/msp".SigningIdentity does not implement "vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/token".SigningIdentity (wrong type for GetPublicVersion method)
		have GetPublicVersion() "vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/msp".Identity
		want GetPublicVersion() "vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/token".Identitygo

``` 
</p>
<p><strong>levanto</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:33:37 GMT):<br/>
 Hello, i do have a question.
I am looking at the token package from fabric core master branch. In trying to create a new tokenClient, i am having trouble getting the SigningIdentity required as a parameter in the newClient function. Anyone who can help?
Let me send a snippet. 
</p>
<p><strong>levanto</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:33:57 GMT):<br/>
 The reason why i use the msp.SigningIdentity is because i use the GetSigningIdentity method provided in the same package. However, seems the newClient method needs the token.SigningIdentity type. Help.
How can i make msp.SigningIdentity interface implement the token.SigningIdentity?

Hi everybody! Is it possible to find any example of a configtx.yml crypto-config.yml or cryptogen documentation which implement one organization multiple MSP for a channel configuration ?
</p>
<p><strong>awattez</strong> (Sun, 28 Apr 2019 17:44:52 GMT):<br/>
Each time we have one organization -> one MSP 
</p>
<p><strong>awattez</strong> (Sun, 28 Apr 2019 17:45:44 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible to generate multiple MSP for one organization and configure channel setup with that
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 28 Apr 2019 18:42:21 GMT):<br/>
@awattez  - each MSP is separate and identified by MSPID.  If a single entity ("org") decides to have two different MSPs, there is no method to tie them to a single org; they will just appear as two different orgs within the channel config

Is there anyone that could guide me on how to update a client side application using the java fabric SDK connect to an IBP enterprise service when Mutual TLS is enabled?
</p>
<p><strong>casstait</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 06:14:32 GMT):<br/>
For example, when mutual TLS is disabled on the IBP service, the code currently written works as expected, however when mutual TLS is enabled on the IBP service, I receive an error: Response: {"result":"","errors":[{"code":0,"message":"Registration of 'casstest' failed in affiliation validation: : scode: 401, local code: 44, local msg: Caller does not have authority to act on affiliation 'PeerOrg1', remote code: 20, remote msg: Authorization failure"} ],"messages":[],"success":false}. I used the following tutorial as a guide: https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/hyperledger-fabric-java-sdk-for-tls-enabled-fabric-network/. 
1. Does the client application generate the private key and it then enroll the certificate to the CA? OR
2. Do you submit a request to the x-tlsCAName in a connection profile that returns a cert/key?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 May 2019 11:00:28 GMT):<br/>
A couple of things:
- IdeMix credentials CAN be tied back to the issuer (but that won't reveal the actual "identity")
- While the CA issues an IdeMix "enrollment" credential (which can be linked back to the identity), this credential is actually not used to submit transactions.  What actually happens is that the client generates a fresh credential from the enrollment credential and uses that to submit transactions.

</p>
<p><strong>balamcyril</strong> (Mon, 27 May 2019 13:23:56 GMT):<br/>
In fabric-sdk-java implementation of this algorithm, i don't see when the user is generate a fresh credential before sending the transaction to the peer or orderer.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 May 2019 14:21:29 GMT):<br/>
I modified by answer a bit to make it more clear ... the scheme uses BLS signatures with zero-knowledge proofs of possession of the credential / attributes without actually revealing the credential itself
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 27 May 2019 14:22:24 GMT):<br/>
the proofs are un-linkable as a new proof is generated each time
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 18:25:48 GMT):<br/>
Will cryptogen also generate tls certificates?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 18:26:06 GMT):<br/>
or do those always have to be generated by hand
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 20:33:49 GMT):<br/>
also creates them, yes. 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:29:00 GMT):<br/>
just curious what key is used for the bls signature? is it a fresh key each time and that accompanies a fresh proof? if this is documented somewhere feel free just to point me at that.

cryptogen question. hopefully this is simple and i just don't know what i'm doing.

trying to generate crypto for a raft based setup in k8s. we've been running without it using kafka- it's an internal one for testing.

i have a simple single org listed below
```
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# "OrdererOrgs" - Definition of organization(s) managing the orderer nodes
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OrdererOrgs:
  - Name: sampleorg
    Domain: sampleorg
    Specs:
      - Hostname: raft0
      - Hostname: raft1
      - Hostname: raft2
      
PeerOrgs:
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # sampleorg configuration certificates
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Name: sampleorg
    Domain: sampleorg
    Template:
      Count: 2
    Users:
      Count: 1
``` 

everything is peachy until i try to start a peer when the logs give me this: 
```
2019-06-18 23:57:54.691 UTC [grpc] createTransport -> DEBU 029 grpc: addrConn.createTransport failed to connect to {peer0-sampleorg:7051 0  <nil>}. Err :connection error: desc = "transport: authentication handshake failed: x509: certificate is valid for peer0.sampleorg, peer0, not peer0-sampleorg". Reconnecting...
```
Is there a simple way to change the output from cryptogen so the certs refer to `-` rather than `.` or am I going to be spending some quality time with openssl?
I remember I had to change it all to get k8s to work. Something about a . in one of the fields being disallowed (it was quite a while ago, so I'm hazy on which).

trying to get 1.4.1 working with raft. that involves exploring certificates - which i've avoided like the plague till now. mostly because my understanding of the process is - to be charitable - limited.
this is all internal. using cryptogen to create some self-signed certs. these seem to be of the form `host.domain`
the problem is that my deployments use `host-domain` for the name and so when i fire up a peer i get stuff like this:
```
2019-06-18 23:57:54.691 UTC [grpc] createTransport -> 
DEBU 029 grpc: addrConn.createTransport failed to connect to {peer0-sampleorg:7051 0  <nil>}. 
Err :connection error: desc = "transport: authentication handshake failed: x509: certificate is valid for peer0.sampleorg, peer0, not peer0-sampleorg". Reconnecting...
```

is there a way to fudge cryptogen to get host-domain instead of host.domain, or am i going to be spending quality time with openssl and the help flag therein? 
or better - from my perspective - have i totally misread the message and the fix is something simple?

i can't see a way to set a hostname in a deployment on k8s without switching to a stateful set (and that's out of scope here). 
anyone do this yet?

<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 15:12:47 GMT):<br/>
Interesting. 
I was looking at {ORG}/ca/ca-{ORG}-cert.pem and .../tlsca/tlsca.{ORG}-cert.pem as well as {ORG}/peers/peer0.{ORG}/msp/cacerts/ca.{ORG}-cert.pem. 

It's absent in all cases there but present in the server.crt at your path. 
Which explains the mismatch at least. It also seems my thought that the certs were copied from there was totally wrong. 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 15:29:53 GMT):<br/>
Yeah ... the `tls` folder for each node (peer, orderer) has the actual certificates that should be used for TLS

how to solve "no subject alternative dns name matching org1.example.com". by google or baidu, the solution to the error above is to close the tls. If enabling tls, how to solve it? Thank you.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 05 Jul 2019 09:33:26 GMT):<br/>
If TLS is enabled, then the peer and orderer endpoints will all require TLS and your clients / applications will need to connect via TLS as well

Hello, what is the procedure to update admin certificates AFTER they are expired.  Currently I'm in this situation, and I'm unable to make config update, to upgrade chaincode or any other admin task
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:48:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:48:35 GMT):<br/>
I don't think there is one
</p>
<p><strong>gatakka</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:54:48 GMT):<br/>
then what is the purpose of the admin certificate in MSP folder?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:56:41 GMT):<br/>
you have channel MSPs, and local MSP
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:56:49 GMT):<br/>
the local MSP authenticates channel-less operations
</p>

maybe we should/can do a similar thing for admin certs :thinking_face:

or for CA certs too

Certificate Management should take place outside of Fabric and putting certificate expiration warning in Fabric logs is not that reliable solution IMO.

Hi ,
I reading about Idemix and have some doubts.Hope you could help.Thanks in advance.

1) How is the basic transaction flow different from using the Idemix MSP?
2) How is the identity and integrity of a transaction ensured in case of Idemix MSP?
3) client/idemix MSP signing and verification part:What is the input to the Idemix MSP credential verification 
part? Where and how is it done?

I need to change the signature scheme (ECDSA to Schnorr blind signature), how can I do it??
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 19:38:14 GMT):<br/>
What is your use case ? What the rational behind using Schnorr Signature ? Schnorr is also based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Fabric does not support Schnorr Signature by itself , although there is support for Blind Signture in Fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 19:40:49 GMT):<br/>
where do we have blind signatures in Fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 19:41:05 GMT):<br/>
idemix.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 19:42:22 GMT):<br/>
Blind Signature is very loose term and one can have its own interpretation.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 19:43:02 GMT):<br/>
That is the reason , one has to be careful in using Blind Signature.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 19:43:07 GMT):<br/>
i thought blind signature is that you sign not knowing what you sign?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 19:43:19 GMT):<br/>
and then the other party un-blinds it to get a valid signature
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 19:58:46 GMT):<br/>
Blinding can be on signing parameter also, not necessarily only on content of message. Usually , it is implemented using Challenge Response model.

hi Team ,

Fabric- v1.4.3
Cannot run peer because error when setting up MSP of type bccsp from directory /var/hyperledger/crypto/org1/admin/msp: administrators must be declared when no admin ou classification is set
Any idea for the above error. msp exists in admin folder.

Hello. Does Fabric have needs (and plans) for delegatable anonymous credentials? Has anyone considered  this CCS 17 paper https://acmccs.github.io/papers/p683-camenischA.pdf? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 16:37:15 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh do you mean to hide the issuer of the identity ?
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 16:41:32 GMT):<br/>
The identity of the **intermediate issuers from the verifier**, yes. 
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 16:42:16 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 16:43:59 GMT):<br/>
So I would ask @adc or @elli-androulaki  if there are plans for implementing this in the context of idemix. As I'm sure you're well aware, all these NIZKs are done via Fabric's idemix support. 
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 16:47:02 GMT):<br/>
There is an implementation of this that might beome part of Hyperledger Ursa . And then Idemix should be able to consume it. Here is the implementation https://github.com/lovesh/signature-schemes/tree/delegatable/delg_cred_cdd
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 16:47:34 GMT):<br/>
I plan to propose this implementation in form of a PR to Ursa
</p>

I have the admin cert provided to 'admin' OU. is this creating the problem, as the error states, identity must be a client, a peer, or an orderer to be valid. Should we issue an admin cert with orderer OU?
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 10:44:24 GMT):<br/>
Do we need to have seperate admins for peers and orderers other than the org's admin?

<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 08:46:46 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I overcame this problem by changing the profile sectionand  recreating the genesis block. But could not figureout the actual problem in the previous configtx.yaml file. 
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 08:47:47 GMT):<br/>
if you don't mind can you post both the old one and the current modififed one configtx.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 08:49:03 GMT):<br/>
i assume you have created orderers as part of individual org right rather than creating a logical separate org only for orderers?
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 09:02:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I have orderers as part of orgs. I will share the new one and I just overwritten the old file while copying the new one :expressionless: 
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 09:02:25 GMT):<br/>
by mistake
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 09:03:30 GMT):<br/>
so org admins were enough to take care the further tasks right ? 
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 09:05:49 GMT):<br/>
yeah org admins are enough, but I am still not sure whether having node admins is the best practice. But at first it would be messy to have lot of certs. And my profile section and orderer sections are based on your confixtx file.

this is the new one right?
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 09:09:14 GMT):<br/>
yep, this is the new one. In my configuration I have given read permission to several roles just to make sure it works as orderers, peers, clients have different roles and needs read and write access. Then I realised it is better to have different logical org for orderers so that we can have more control over the permissions.
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 09:12:10 GMT):<br/>
yeah that's what Jyellick was telling about to have a separate logical org only for orderers to have more control . but i was thinking in real time it would be the individual orgs having their own orderers as who would be the logical org 
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 09:19:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes. First I still need to get better understanding of how permission works in practice. With the current knowledge, in the current scenario I have to open all the permissions to all the roles just to make sure I don't deny anything from reading or writing at different stages. For example, When it comes to Orderer org, we only need to think about orderers and give single set of permissions for orderer activities. and we can have different set of permissions for peers and clients. If we have all components like orderers, peers, clients in a single org (even though they belong to the same org) the readers, writers  we specify are organisation wide where as different nodes needs different set of readers and writers. 
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 09:20:37 GMT):<br/>
I hope I have explained what I wanted to explain.

</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 09:30:24 GMT):<br/>
yes. I also have one more doubt. In the docs, we need to specify which orderer node is part of what channel. But from your previous configtx  the application channels doesn't even have orderer org. How does it work?
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 09:47:08 GMT):<br/>
it is a part of genesis block definition  under profile section
 but for individual different channels having distinct set of orderers i am working on that -- will update you

Hi Guys, I am in a perplexed dilemma, I have a running production env with cryptogen generated certs for PeerOrg and OrdererOrg. I want to migrate the peer certs with Fabric-CA generated certs without creating a new channel and new genesis.block is it possible? 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 10:49:56 GMT):<br/>
You can start fabric-ca-server using an existing root signing key pair.  cryptogen outputs the root key pair in the `ca` directory for each organization

from where does the client get loaded before it comes here? does the peer store the identities in any of its own storage(like state database)?
My understanding is that the creator (be it idemix or x509 type) passes his identity(byte[])  and from the identity bytes the creator passes, the function unmarshalls, gets the attributes and returns it back.

Hi @mastersingh24 , sorry for the cross posting. Thank you for your answer in this stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58279511/how-to-distinguish-client-and-peer-certificate-generated-by-cryptogen-in-hyper/58282441 . I could not comment there so asking here. The MSP OU admin is for the entire organisation or for the entire unit within that CA, right?  My doubts are:  We have node certficates, for example: peer and orderer certificate for peer and orderer node. Do we also have something like admin for a peer or a set of peers? Because, to my knowledge the admin is for the org not for a particular peer or orderer. I would like to get more knowledge on this. 

Second and a different doubt: When proposing a config change or something in a channel how to meet the signature requirement for endorsements? Do we have to sign the transaction with one admin and copy that file into another org's peer out of the band manually and sign it by the second org's admin? 

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 15 Oct 2019 19:52:25 GMT):<br/>
It is possible to use NodeOUs to define separate admins for individual peers (you can simply set a different OU identifier in the local MSP of each peer) but generally you would not do that.

Orderers don't really have the concept of an admin for the orderer node ... it's the orderer organization.  And it's generally recommended that you use separate orgs to manage your peer(s) and orderer(s).

For config changes ... correct ... if you need multiple signatures you will need to pass the config update transaction out of band to collect signatures (of course there are several vendors offerings which provides this capability as well)

Hi @mastersingh24 ,

I am getting this error when updating the channel configuration with the msp generated by fabric-ca using the root cert generated by cryptogen. Just to recall my objective, I am trying to replace the cryptogen generated certs with fabric-ca generated certs for the Peer Org called "Example". 


```shell
"Error: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST -- error applying config update to existing channel 'invoice-channel': error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: policy for [Value]  /Channel/Application/ExampleMSP/MSP not satisfied: signature set did not satisfy policy"
```


The following are the steps I took,
1.) Generated Peer certs using the root cert generated by cryptogen. 

2.) Change the file path from cryptogen generated MSP to Fabric-CA generated MSP
OLD Declaration:
``` yaml
    - &Example
        Name: ExampleMSP
        ID: ExampleMSP
        MSPDir: crypto-config/peerOrganizations/stp.example.com/msp
        AnchorPeers:

```

        AnchorPeers:
            - Host: peer0.stp.example.com/msp
```
3.) Update the channel Configuration

```shell
export ORDERER_CA=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem
export CHANNEL_NAME=example-channel

peer channel fetch config config_block.pb -o orderer.example.com:7050 -c $CHANNEL_NAME --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA

configtxlator proto_decode --input config_block.pb --type common.Block | jq .data.data[0].payload.data.config > config.json

jq -s '.[0] * {"channel_group":{"groups":{"Application":{"groups": {"ExampleMSP":.[1]}}}}}' config.json Example.json > modified_config.json

configtxlator proto_encode --input config.json --type common.Config --output config.pb

configtxlator proto_encode --input Example_update_in_envelope.json --type common.Envelope --output Example_update_in_envelope.pb

peer channel signconfigtx -f Example_update_in_envelope.pb

peer channel update -f Example_update_in_envelope.pb -c $CHANNEL_NAME -o orderer.example.com:7050 --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA

Hello all. We are willing to use certificates issued by a trusted CA, however our trusted CA has a RSA chain. They said they could still issue ECDSA certificates signed by their RSA chain. Would Fabric accept/work with this cenario?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 19:29:17 GMT):<br/>
Fabric nodes (orderers, peers) cannot accept RSA signatures of enrollment CAs 
</p>
<p><strong>caduellery</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 19:34:57 GMT):<br/>
ok, I understand that for TLS we can use RSA certificates. However, the case is the use of ECDSA certificates issued by an RSA CA ... in this case the certificates used by nodes (peers, orderers) would be of type ECDSA, but their chain would be of type RSA ... would that be possible?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 20:15:41 GMT):<br/>
no

Hi all, we have been trying to use a PKI service of AWS called ACM-PCA, to be able to use the cid library in the chaincode we have been trying to add attributes to the certificates through the extra x.509 extension with object identifier "1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.1" like fabric-ca adds them. But we have noticed that this AWS service doesn't support CSR's with extra extensions. 
Are there other ways to add these attributes? Or can someone recommend other PKI cloud services to use for enrollment certificates for production and where we can add these extensions to use the attributes in the chaincode?
Thanks in advance!

Hi all. I am getting the following error and could not go any further as the orderers are not forming quorum due to TLS bad certificate. ``` 2019-12-05 10:22:51.416 UTC [orderer.consensus.etcdraft] confirmSuspicion -> ERRO 28bf0 Failed pulling the last config block: retry attempts exhausted channel=orderersyschannel node=2

</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 19:36:42 GMT):<br/>
The problem we are facing is that the security and cloud areas of the company want to use a PKI as a service instead of setting up one themselves...

Hi all, is it recommended to use fabric-ca in production or to use other CA/PKI services?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 18:41:40 GMT):<br/>
Not sure what you mean by "recommended" ... it can be used for production but you can of course use other CAs as mandated by say your company policy.
If you want to take advantage to the various node and identity roles in your channel and endorsement policy, it's definitely easier to do do with the Fabric CA as  it will issues certificates with an OU matching the role/type, but of course this can be done via proper CSRs with other CAs as well.
For TLS, personally I prefer using other CAs, but Fabric CA is fine for that as well

Is configuring LDAP an option for you?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 18:53:26 GMT):<br/>
what are you trying to do with attributes?
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 19:09:25 GMT):<br/>
We want to use the chaincode cid library to be able to give certain permissions to certain users (certificates). For example, if not all users of an organization should be able to issue certain tokens, we can add an "issue=true" attribute in the certificate and retrieve and check for the attribute in the chaincode using the cid library...
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 19:10:45 GMT):<br/>
But an LDAP doesn't replace a PKI, or does it also issue certificates?
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 19:12:14 GMT):<br/>
And we could use an existing LDAP, but we should still need a PKI, no? Or does an LDAP also has capabilities to issue certificates normally?
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 19:14:57 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your answer, I think it would indeed be the easiest to convince the security people to run fabric-ca for the enrollment certs and use an existing TLS PKI for tls certs. Thanks a lot!
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 19:58:05 GMT):<br/>
If you have to use an external CA, you might want to try using an "OU" in the DN for your users.  You can't use CID, but it's trivial to extract OUs from the X509 certificate in your chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 20:37:17 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thanks, that could work. Extra extensions are usually not suported by external CA's then?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 20:38:00 GMT):<br/>
most definitely unknown OIDs (which is what our extension is).

<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 20:41:00 GMT):<br/>
Ok, got it! Thanks a lot for the possible solutions and explanations! And do you know if there exists some known OID or standard X509 attributes where Fabric could implement this instead of in the custom OID it uses now, so we could make a request in JIRA perhaps to think about changing this in future versions...
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 20:45:38 GMT):<br/>
you could try to use one of the extensions defined in PKCS#9 and then change the OID in the CID code to match ...  the only one that comes to mind is http://oidref.com/2.5.29.9

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:08:32 GMT):<br/>
Can you explain exactly what you are trying to do?
Third-party CAs such as Verisign, LetsEncrypt, etc are not going to issue you an intermediate root CA you can use with Fabric CA for signing certificates.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 03 Jan 2020 20:10:00 GMT):<br/>
LetsEncrypt only issues SSL/TLS certificates.  It will not issue intermediate root certificates and it will not issue key usages other than those required by SSL/TLS
</p>
<p><strong>mrudav.shukla</strong> (Sat, 04 Jan 2020 04:55:00 GMT):<br/>
Ok. I might be getting it wrong. Consider two Organisations on a fabric network OrgA and OrgB. OrgA has two CAs one for Encryption and the other for Authentication. 

When I start the CA server (any of it) I have two options: 
1. Directly submit the start command: In which case it will create its own root-ca cert
2. Initialise it first, provide a root CA cert in the config file and then start the CA. 

I am trying to do #2.

@mastersingh24 Based on our conversation and your proposed solutions here I created a pull request for the cid library to have a function to check for a certain OU value in the certificate. Like you said it is trivial extracting the OUs from the cert, but I think it is still a small handy function to have in the cid library to not need to repeat the code in every chaincode or manage another package for it. Could you review my PR when you have some time, please? https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/pull/17

Ok. So I am sure I’ve got it wrong. Root Certificates being the top of the chain would need to be self signed. If I get a certificate from established public-ca that would make my ca an intermediate ca. And this would be out of scope and might not be needed at all since Fabric is a permissioned-network and all the root CAs involved in the network would be known beforehand. Please correct me if I’m still getting it wrong.

This statement is true but highly unlikely that this will happen ... unless your company is already doing this ... 

You could acquire your TLS certificates (not root but actual certificates) from a public CA (e.g. Verising, DigiCert, Lets Encrypt, etc)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 06 Jan 2020 15:42:03 GMT):<br/>
For enrollment certificates, it makes sense to have your own top-level root certificate (which indeed means it would be self-signed)

Yup. Totally makes sense. Thanks for clearing out.

I have a CA container running within Pod in an amazon EKS cluster. I am exposing this using service type load balancer.  It has TLS enabled. Now, since this pod is exposed using amazon’s load balancer, this load balancer will need to have an SSL cert. My question is, should this SSL cert be the certificate of the CA and be explicitly imported into amazon’s ACM or this load balancer would have a different SSL cert?

It really does not matter in the case of the CA.  You just need to make sure that you provide CA clients with the appropriate crypto material (meaning the root/intermediate certificate which issues the TLS cert for the load balancer)

Since the admin identity is bootstrapped when we start the CA server, what would be the way to pass the CSR while bootstrapping? Asking this because, while I am able to bootstrap the CA with self-signed certificate with proper Certificate Subject, the Certificate Subject of the admin, retrieved after enrolling the admin using fabric ca client, does not match with that of the CA's.
</p>
<p><strong>mrudav.shukla</strong> (Sat, 18 Jan 2020 03:53:42 GMT):<br/>
I believe we should be able to send a CSR for admin while enrolling.

I am creating three org network which has 2 normal organisations and 1 orderer organisation. I am using raft ordering service with 3 nodes. Apart from this each organisation has two certificate authorities, one for transport certs and other for enrolment certs. I’ve registered and enrolled organisation admin and 2 peers for each of the two organisations. Registered 1 admin and 3 orderer peers in orderer organisation. Next, I started the peers for both the organisations with necessary files and environment variables embedded in its docker image.

After this, I collected certs necessary for generating genesis block and channel creating transaction. These are admincerts, cacerts and tlscacerts. Next, I generated genesis block and channel creation using configtxgen and started all the three raft nodes. I transferred channel transaction to the peers container and tried creating the channel. However, I get this following error:

`error validating channel creation transaction for new channel ’testchannel’, could not succesfully apply update to template configuration: error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: policy for [Group]  /Channel/Application not satisfied: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Admins' sub-policies to be satisfied
`
Referred to this answer on SO: https://stackoverflow.com/a/57662645/4110629 and it seems #3 ordering logs matches to mine. I checked the identity within admincerts folder of the peer with openssl command and it does show OU as admin. Additionally, attribute within the certificate shows admin type as well. Also, went into this organisation’s opened fabric-ca-server.db in sqlite shell and checked the identity. It shows admin as well.

This problem is common for either of the two organisations peer.

Is there anything I missing here?

Got the error. It was a silly mistake. When doing admin operations, I had to set msp config path of the admin rather than that of peer msp. Normally, we do this by creating a cli container and setting the admin msp path in it.  Here, I was directly using the peer rather than cli container to create the channel.

Normally, we do this by creating a cli container and setting the admin msp path in it.  Here, I was directly using the peer rather than cli container to create the channel.  And this would also mean that every time I'll have to reset peer msp config path after admin operations. So if we're not using the cli container and rather using peer container to do the admin tasks, are there any other repercussions apart from switching the msp config path?

Do their exist any guides on performing each of the steps cryptogen would perform in a production network to generate all of the crypto material?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 17:32:03 GMT):<br/>
I think i have a general list of steps from discussions in here last year:
```
1. Generate CA key and x509 Cert
2. Generate TLS Key and cert (assuming TLS in use)
3. Create a new docker instance using certs
4. Run docker fabric-ca
5. Generate enrollment for peers
6. Generate enrollment for admin
``` 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 17:35:51 GMT):<br/>
steps 1&2 being performed w/openssl and steps 5&6 being performed with fabric-ca-client
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 18:29:39 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible to also use fabric-ca-server to perform steps 1 and 2? or is this unneccissary?

Hi all, we have a question about using TLS. We know that for the digital identities in Fabric eliptic curve should be used, but is the same true for the TLS communication or can we use RSA for it?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 14:41:34 GMT):<br/>
you can use RSA TLS.

Hi all, when using client side TLS and a fully qualified path of the file that contains the certificate chain of the CA that issued TLS server certificate is required, what is the structure and content of this file exactly?
In the case of having a root and an intermediate CA, does the file just need to contain both certificates? And if yes, does the order of the certificates matter or doesn't it matter if the intermediate ca cert is first or the root ca cert?

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
xxxxxxxx...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 04 Mar 2020 22:11:44 GMT):<br/>
but unlike the orderer there is no place in the peer configurations to put tlsca root org certificates
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 04 Mar 2020 22:12:22 GMT):<br/>
in the orderer you use ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ROOTCAS
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 04 Mar 2020 22:12:31 GMT):<br/>
does this exist for peers as well?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 04 Mar 2020 22:14:00 GMT):<br/>
keep in mind each organization has its own tlsca certificate

you're supposed to get the other org's tlsca cert from the channel config block? but that doesnt make sense since it wasnt part of the information i gave in configtx.yaml 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 04 Mar 2020 22:20:26 GMT):<br/>
it only used the org msp not the org tlsmsp

Hi, I have Fabric deployed in an Azure cloud with nginx ingress front ending my fabric services.  When I try to access the fabric ca using curl or via a browser calling the https://hostname/cainfo endpoint with --insecure flag for curl, the request receives data back from the ca server.  When I run the fabcar enrollAdmin sample using a connection profile to point it to my Ingress CA Server endpoint, the request fails with `Error: [FabricCAClientService.js]: Failed to enroll admin, error:%o message=Calling enrollment endpoint failed with error [Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 1.2.3.4:7054], stack=Error: Calling enrollment endpoint failed with error [Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 1.2.3.4:7054]`. Where 1.2.3.4 = the Ingress public ip address.  The Ingress controller is listening on ports 80 and 443 and I have my ingress yaml annotated with `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: 'true'`. I am not sure why it is returning with the ingress exposed IP Addr with the service and container port (7054).  Thanks for any tips on what I may be doing wrong.

<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 18:23:02 GMT):<br/>
Hi quick question, what components of fabric actually read the config.yaml file present in local MSPs?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:04:06 GMT):<br/>
does anyone know of documentation for config.yaml thats stuck in the MPS? I am wondering how I use chaincerts in such a file.
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:04:15 GMT):<br/>
Example from first-network: ```
NodeOUs:
  Enable: true
  ClientOUIdentifier:
    Certificate: cacerts/ca.org1.example.com-cert.pem
    OrganizationalUnitIdentifier: client
  PeerOUIdentifier:
    Certificate: cacerts/ca.org1.example.com-cert.pem
    OrganizationalUnitIdentifier: peer

``` 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:05:22 GMT):<br/>
so with this there is a CACert specified.. but what if we're using an ICA? The chain cert isnt found in the MSP its in my organization's CA directory 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:05:48 GMT):<br/>
or would is there a way to specify both CAcert and Intermediatecert?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:54:01 GMT):<br/>
@Antimttr I would guess this is for the "leaf" CA, meaning the last i-CA in the chain
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:54:30 GMT):<br/>
think about it - given an MSP and any CA certificate, we can locate it by any graph traversal algorithm
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:55:06 GMT):<br/>
and in Fabric, only "leaf" CAs can issue node certificates 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:55:25 GMT):<br/>
so any certificate that is related to an OU needs to be a leaf one, I would think
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:55:37 GMT):<br/>
I could be wrong, but I am too lazy to check the code at this point
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:56:56 GMT):<br/>
it's somewhere in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/msp/mspimplvalidate.go#L172 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:58:18 GMT):<br/>
so i think what you're saying is it doesn't matter if i have a chain cert, all i need to do is specify the cert of the CA which issued the identity
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:58:50 GMT):<br/>
which works for me since its a lot more straight forward
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:59:39 GMT):<br/>
do you know of any default config.yaml which specifies nodeOUs? 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:59:58 GMT):<br/>
@BrettLogan  mentioned that even if you dont include one in your local MSP one is still used by default

<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:01:01 GMT):<br/>
this is all coming up because after we talked yetserday I went ahead and rebooted the network, and i updated the configtx.yaml of my channel included a bunch of the  policies I found in the first-network configtx.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:01:40 GMT):<br/>
and when I joined the channel with org1's peers they all failed because the orderer claimed it didn't know who they were by MSP

<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:02:10 GMT):<br/>
and I got a bunch of this in my peer log: ` for channel mychannel : implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Readers' sub-policies to be satisfied`

<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:04:40 GMT):<br/>
but still its a bunch of warnings and errors in my peer log which wasn't happening before I added the channel policies: ```

</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:05:11 GMT):<br/>
then eventually the block provider shuts down
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:05:54 GMT):<br/>
now when i started digging into the NodeOU's I discovered that the guide i was using to generate my crypto material: https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operations_guide.html 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:05:59 GMT):<br/>
didn't use any nodeou's
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:06:04 GMT):<br/>
i guess it was too old or something?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:06:26 GMT):<br/>
so basically i didnt have any config.yaml files anywhere in my MSP structure
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:07:11 GMT):<br/>
so I assume there is some default going on but even like my admin signing cert specifies an OU=user
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:07:24 GMT):<br/>
which is counter intuitive but its in line with the guide I followed:
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:08:04 GMT):<br/>
for instance this is from fabric-ca op guide, the part where it registers the admin identity for org1: ```
export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/ca/crypto/ca-cert.pem
export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/ca/admin
fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://rca-org1-admin:rca-org1-adminpw@0.0.0.0:7054
fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name peer1-org1 --id.secret peer1PW --id.type peer -u https://0.0.0.0:7054
fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name peer2-org1 --id.secret peer2PW --id.type peer -u https://0.0.0.0:7054
fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name admin-org1 --id.secret org1AdminPW --id.type user -u https://0.0.0.0:7054
fabric-ca-client register -d --id.name user-org1 --id.secret org1UserPW --id.type user -u https://0.0.0.0:7054
``` 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:08:17 GMT):<br/>
you can see here it's specifying --id.type user
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:08:29 GMT):<br/>
and when I eventually enrolled the admin it ended up having an OU=user
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:08:38 GMT):<br/>
which isn't one of the NodeOU types I've seen anywhere
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:08:44 GMT):<br/>
but apparently those are just labels
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:08:51 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:48:05 GMT):<br/>
So following the Fabric-ca Ops guide they have you use the following attributes for registering an Orderer admin: `{"abac.init":"true","admin":"true","hf.Affiliation":"","hf.EnrollmentID":"admin-orderer","hf.Type":"admin"}}`
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:48:18 GMT):<br/>
my question is, should these attributes also be used in registering admins for peer organizations?

Hi all! Does Fabric support ECDSA certificates with brainpool curves? The key was generated with `openssl ecparam -name brainpoolP512r1 -genkey -noout -out` and the certificate was signed with  ecdsa-with-SHA256. We are getting "Failed to initialize local MSP: getCertFromPem error: failed to parse x509 cert: x509: failed to parse ECDSA parameters as named curve" and are in doubt if the real cause is the brainpool curve of the key...

I replied to your question on Hyperledger Fabric Mailing list. This was my reply : Fabric out of the box Elliptic Curve support is based on golang support and golang support NIST Curves. The difference between NIST Curve and Brainpool curves are domain parameters.Domain parameters for NIST Curves and Brainpool curves are different , hence Brainpool curve will not work in Fabric.

Hi all, we are looking on how to store private keys from the peers and orderer and I would like to know if there is any significant latency difference between having the keystore on the peer itself or having the keys in an HSM in the same cloud provider as the peers?
Thanks in advance for any information or any experience that can be shared with using HSM for the private keys of the Fabric components.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Thu, 09 Jul 2020 15:12:28 GMT):<br/>
All cloud provider implements  Network HSM , hence there is latency for sure. You need to work with your Cloud HSM provider for latency optimization.

But all of this still isn't going to get you full FIPS certification. There are still some operations, like TLS operations that are still not compliant. The only way to solve this one is to use something like RedHat's UBI images with their FIPS certified openssl libraries

Hey All, can anyone point me towards any resources on how BCCSP works and how I might go about extending it? (or writing an alternative? I notice in the core.yaml example - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-2.2/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L297 there seems to be talk of a default BCCSP provider, how would I swap this out?)
</p>
<p><strong>tomappleyard</strong> (Mon, 16 Nov 2020 17:58:41 GMT):<br/>
So there's an answer attached to this - see, https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ca?msg=YhqbxzuXtiDFkQkgy (similar question)

Hi all, we are encountering some problems when trying to use AWS CloudHSM with Fabric. We have a CloudHSM cluster set up, built the peer and orderer images from the source with the pkcs11 tag and have configured the orderer.yaml and core.yaml files to use the PKCS11 crypto provider with the label and CryptoUser:CryptoUserPassword as pin. The CloudHSM client is installed and configured and the CloudHSM pkcs11 library is installed and mounted to the container, so everything seems ok, but it doesn't seem to work. The error we get is: 
```
�[31m2021-02-22 11:43:49.159 -05 0004 ERRO�[0m [main] �[31;1mInitCmd�[0m -> Cannot run peer because error when setting up MSP of type bccsp from directory /msp: could not initialize BCCSP Factories: Failed initializing PKCS11.BCCSP: Could not initialize BCCSP PKCS11 [pkcs11: instantiation failed for /opt/cloudhsm/lib/libcloudhsm_pkcs11.so]
```
Does anyone know what could be wrong or if for AWS CloudHSM the configurations should be different from the configurations for SoftHSM?
Thanks a lot in advance!
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:56:54 GMT):<br/>
What version of Fabric are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:15:13 GMT):<br/>
Hi @BrettLogan , thanks for taking the time to look into this and respond.
We are using v2.3.0
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:16:58 GMT):<br/>
can you enable debug logging, the more granular PKCS11 logging is available in 2.3.0
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:18:31 GMT):<br/>
I got the FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC on DEBUG already, is there another parameter for PKCS11 logs?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:19:46 GMT):<br/>
There is nothing preceding that message?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:19:59 GMT):<br/>
Let me run the HSM tests and remind myself what I am looking for

"Before using BCCSP, please call InitFactories()."

<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:22:52 GMT):<br/>
Is that helpful or should I look for another message?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:22:58 GMT):<br/>
That message is expected
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:23:21 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I will look some more above in the logs
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:23:41 GMT):<br/>
Are you dumping the AWS HSM Client logs to your log utility?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:23:45 GMT):<br/>
They are at `/opt/cloudhsm/run/cloudhsm_client.log`
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:24:14 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:24:14 GMT):<br/>
good idea, we are not doing that yet I think
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:24:32 GMT):<br/>
I will look into that and let you know if we find something there
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:24:40 GMT):<br/>
That would be the next place we would go if we were debugging this
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:24:57 GMT):<br/>
Great tip!
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:25:10 GMT):<br/>
Thanks a lot, we will look there first
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:25:29 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately most of the logging in PKCS11 is held by the client fully and the error reported back to our library is really vague
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:25:40 GMT):<br/>
If you find an error there and I can be of help let me know
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:35:01 GMT):<br/>
Ok, let's hope we can figure it out with the logs there, thanks a lot for guiding us there and I will let you know how it goes.

Hi @BrettLogan , in the logs of the HSM client, we are not seeing anything more than the client authorizing and then after 15 minuts it seems there is a connection shutdown, probably because of inactivity I think.

```

So I think Fabric is not even getting to the HSM client.

We were investigating some more PR's (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/364) that were done in Fabric concerning AWS CloudHSM, and we see that in v1.4 `AltId' got added to the bccsp parameters especially to solve something with AWS CloudHSM and in the docs there is also a section explaining this in v1.4:
```
If you are using AWS HSM there is an additional step required:

Add the parameter, AltId to the pkcs11 section of the bccsp block. When AWS HSM is being used, this parameter is used to assign a unique value for the Subject Key Identifier (SKI). Create a long secure string outside of Fabric and assign it to the AltId parameter. For example:
```
But from what I can see this  was merged to v1.4 alone (and not to master and so never got into v2.x either. So I am wondering if v2.3  is even able to work with AWS CloudHSM... Do you know anything about this?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 10:03:18 GMT):<br/>
We added this functionality specifically for AWS, as AWS doesn't directly support the PKCS11_COPY command, though I thought it landed in all releases. Once I get in front of my computer this morning I'll take a look

Hi @BrettLogan, I hope you are doing great, I am working to do a PR to include the fix for AWS CloudHSM into master now. But we tried to get v1.4 work with our HSM and we get the same error, without seeing any logs from the HSM client telling us something, it looks like Fabric is just not recognizing the pkcs11 library.

hi all, I have a peculiar idea. I am trying to use a group signature rather than ecdsa-with-sha256 for the cryptograhpic algorithm used for CA-issued certificates.

Can the crypto algorithm be modified in the fabric? If possible, I would be very grateful if you let me know where to modify and build the fabric.
