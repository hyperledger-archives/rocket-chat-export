{"msg":"Hi - Does Fabric provide any way of encrypting/securing the content stored in the ledger/world state?\n\nThe case I'm interested in is that if Peer A is part of Chain A and Chain B, it is storing the ledger and world state of both chains in the same database, just different directories (in the case of LevelDB). If an application on Chain A is storing confidential information in the chain, is there any built-in way to secure/encrypt the data so that there is more security than just \"the data is in a different directory\".\n \nFrom the docs I've read, I don't see something like this. If that is the case, then one solution would be that the application should encrypt the data before writing it to the chain. However, the chaincode may need to decrypt the data in order to perform some business logic. If that is the case, then does Fabric provide some key management that is available to both the application and the chaincode where they could retrieve keys for encrypting/decrypting confidential data. Or are there plans for such a key management feature for the future.","username":"farhan3","ts":"2017-04-03T15:49:54.944Z"}

The allows all orgs to share the same root CA but now we can distinguish them based on the combination of the root cert and OU.  This does of course imply that the central CA has controls in place to ensure that it does not issue certificates for one org with the OU intended to represent another org\n\n7) Recall that for all of this to work, the orgs must be included in the configuration transactions submitted to the ordering service and that there are policies which define how may signatures are require for the configuration transaction to be valid (which in turn means that multiple organizations will inspect the config transaction before signing it)\n\n\n](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=P3d2pxqq5DBJcF5a4) @passkit ","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-05-06T12:55:30.771Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=P3d2pxqq5DBJcF5a4","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=P3d2pxqq5DBJcF5a4","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

In Fabric v1 we allow for instantiation of membership service providers that follow standard PKI certificate hierarchy. That is, each MSP would consider a set of root CAs, and (optionally) intermediate CAs to validate MSP members (certificates) against. Ideally each MSP would correspond to the membership rules of a certain organisation. More details on the MSPs and their use you may find in /docs/source/msp.rst.\n\nNow to have more sophisticated logic implemented within an MSP (e.g., certain prioritisation among CAs) you may need to implement it yourself complying with the interface of the MSP.","username":"elli-androulaki","ts":"2017-05-13T18:02:04.602Z"}

And I'm trying to understand how each of certs can possibly be revoked or updated.\n\nFirst, if a Peer/Orderer MSP signcert needs to be revoked, it can be done by sending an updated channel tx that blacklists the cert. The other Peers, will then no longer accept communications from the blacklisted Peer. \n\nSecond, if the Admin cert needs to be revoked, the MSPs of the Peers using that Admin cert will need to be updated. This will be done by removing the admin cert from the admincerts dir in the MSPs. How would this be accomplished for \"normal\" user certs since they are not copied into the MSP dirs?\n\nNext comes TLS certs - here is where I don't have the answer. If a TLS cert needs to be revoked, how will this be done? I've read around a bit and normally this would be done through Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). But I don't think fabric supports either (please correct me if I'm wrong). ","username":"farhan3","ts":"2017-05-29T22:06:55.240Z"}

{"msg":"As a little bit of background, my the goal of the CR series is to make the policy framework take identities instead of signatures.  \n\nIn my investigation @aso pointed me to\n\nhttps://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4252\n\nwhich I thought had been resolved for the policy framework as a whole, but instead was apparently addressed as a special case of the SCC.  So, the v1 policy framework is in a position where it sometimes de-duplicates signatures, and sometimes does not.\n\nThe lack of deduplication in the framework at large was a problem which needs to be fixed, but, addressing it does change the policy semantics (honoring the contract, but breaking compatibility with v1).  Since it is breaking compatibility, it seemed prudent to make the other semantics more consistent.  So, this CR opts for making all 'non-well-formed' errors fatal.  In particular, if the message includes an identity which cannot be deserialized or a signature which cannot be verified, then the signature set is considered not to be well formed and discarded.\n\nI think the real world implications of this compatibility breakage is quite low.  The vast majority of our policy checks are against a single signature which is unaffected by this change, and where signature sets which are well formed (ie, contain only valid signatures for valid identities), there are also no affects.  Still, this is a breaking change, and should require some thought and discussion.","username":"jyellick","ts":"2017-08-01T15:39:10.586Z"}

{"msg":"Hi everyone, I am trying to set up a Fabric demo with multiple organisations. In my setup each organisation has its own root CA both for signing blockchain messages and for TLS and I have come up against the problem of specifying multiple TLS root CAs to peers. Unlike at the corresponding position in orderer.yaml, there only seems to be the possibility to specify a single value under CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE in core.yaml. So how do I start a peer with multiple TLS root CAs? I am very new to hyperledger, so apologies in advance if I have misunderstood what is going on. Could it also be that the certificates are actually loaded directly from the MSP path and that I have somehow messed up with the file paths?","username":"rhudson","ts":"2017-09-01T13:45:57.489Z"}

{"msg":"@jyellick, idemix msp as of now has different semantics for identity validity function indeed. This is to be changed and https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6044 covers this aspect. We essentially found a way to allow idemix identity validation to be properly assessed via identity structure that would allow us to also run the satisifesPrincipal with the given interface. \n\nRegarding your old CRs, we need to think if we wish to remove the signatures entirely from policy evaluation function, or convert signatures to \"Opts\" that would be optionally passing in signatures, timestamps, and/or other parameters.

{"msg":"> We essentially found a way to allow idemix identity validation to be properly assessed via identity structure that would allow us to also run the satisifesPrincipal with the given interface. \nSo the idea here is that `Validate` and `SatisfiesPrincipal` are redundant checks? (I believe they are in the X.509 case as well?).  I know we already have a cache for identity validation, it seems like maybe it is not such a big deal to perform things 2x if the second time will simply hit the cache?\n\n> Regarding your old CRs, we need to think if we wish to remove the signatures entirely from policy evaluation function,\nTo me, it seems like a good separation of concerns.  It simplifies the code by removing the complexity of three different types of failure \"bad identity\", \"bad signature\", and \"wwrong identity\", down to simply checking for \"wrong identity\".\n\n> or convert signatures to \"Opts\" that would be optionally passing in signatures, timestamps, and/or other parameters.\nI'm quite wary of this approach.  As soon as it's not immediately clear how to take a signature set, and validate it against a policy (ie, do we set opt A? how about opt B? etc.) I think we are likely to end up getting it wrong and introducing non-determinism into the validation path.\n\n> This would allow us to do policy evaluation and message authentiaction at the same time.\nIs this a goal purely for efficiency? If so, I would again point towards caching techniques as perhaps a better solution so that the code is conceptually simpler.","username":"jyellick","ts":"2017-09-10T20:28:36.422Z"}
{"msg":">So the idea here is that `Validate` and `SatisfiesPrincipal` are redundant checks? \nNot sure what you mean by \"redundant checks\". \n - Validate checks that an identity has been constructed given the rules of the MSP it claims to be a member of. \n - SatisfiesPrincipal checks that the identity conforms to some principal, that can be a member, admin, OU-member, (in the near future) client, peer, (in the far future) owner of certain attributes. It extends identity validate to the extend one could merge the two in one call.\n \n> To me, it seems like a good separation of concerns.\nAgreed. But, there is a caveat: separation of concerns works only if people know how to combine them to achieve the intended result. And interfaces need to smartly built to disallow people to do at least \"easy\" mistakes. That's what we are trying to avoid.\n\n> As soon as it's not immediately clear how to take a signature set, and validate it against a policy (ie, do we set opt A? how about opt B? etc.) I think we are likely to end up getting it wrong and introducing non-determinism into the validation path.\nI don't think i fully understand this. The validation logic we will be writing, properly using the interfaces. Therefore non-determinism would not be an issue. The interfaces of the MSP though could be used by the chaincodes later in time, and this is where we want to protect them from not doing things right.

It's also possible for these providers to be shared as well (for example the default X509-based MSP can share a central certificate authority and make use of OU's to uniquely identify / differentiate organizations).  This is different from the v0.6 and earlier versions of Hyperledger Fabric where there was only a single, centralized membership service provider\n\n2) As @yacovm mentioned, the MSP implementation defines a set of standard interfaces which are consumed by the various Fabric components.  Today we only have a single concrete MSP implementation based on standard X509 PKI, but you'll see that there is a second implementation based on a technology called Identity Mixer in the works","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-10-05T12:16:19.110Z"}

Peers sign endorsement responses and orderers sign blocks.  The local MSP holds the crypto material needed to do this.

{"msg":"About China Crypto Standard support\n\nI am trying to do something on  China Crypto Standard Support(SMx) in fabric，here are some problems should be discussed for.\n\nIt’s not difficult  in bccsp to support SMx,  it does not take too much time. The real problem I found is that x509 in go standard library does not support SMx natively which is hard imported in bccsp, msp, crytogen, etc.\n\nSo if we don’t do something on x509, there is no way to generate SMx key or parse/create SMx certificate. \n\nMy current solution:\n(1) Customise crypto standard library in go package to support SMx.  So it must  add custom go standard library in baseimage to support SMx. \n\nAlternative:\n(2) Copy crypto standard library to fabric and do SMx support on it.\n\nThe good and the bad:\n(1) Fabric can support SMx decently， because crpto/x509 in go packages are support SMx natively. But SMx supported library must be installed in the baseimage.  more over, if native tools like cryptogen, configtxgen you want to use or  you want to run fabric in your native environment, you should compile your native SMx go env.\n\n(2) Copy crypto standard library to fabric and do  SMx support on it. In this way, it doesn’t need do anything in go standard library, so  we don’t need to care about the go env we currently use. But fabric need to modified heavily, because crypto/x509 is imported everywhere in project. And I think tls can’t support SMx, because tls package is also a standard library that uses crypto/x509.So there is nothing we could do to make it support it. \n\nSo which way is better you think?

{"msg":"@nebsterboy - The java sdk supports Java JCA/JCE for signing. This is what is used to provide a PKCS11 interface for Gemalto HSMs. However, the underlying Fabric system currently mainly supports elliptical curve keys for a specific strength. I have seen some support for RSA keys, but not sure where that is at. The keys and certs created from the private keys for each of the organizations, peers, org users, and tls need to be published to the Orderer and embedded within each Peer for channel authorization and access. I know for the PKCS11 implementation, in order for the Peer signing and verification there is a dynamic build of the Orderers and Peers required to bind the specific PKSC11 implementation. One of the IBM Fellows who had prior experience with PKCS11 spent 3-6 months building out the PKSC11 implementation for the Fabric Peer, and a Gemalto engineer spent a couple of months on the Fabric SDK and Fabric CA client in addition. Unless it is a show stopper for you or a serious value add, and you have plenty of time, you might want to rethink. You will probably be into forking basic Fabric code and building dynamic bindings with Go code in order to do it.","username":"tsnyder","ts":"2018-02-23T20:39:24.140Z"}

{"msg":"@gatakka, @IanBradbury_Rex , There is a case where you can end up losing encrypted data.  If you encrypt your data with an AES key and intend to share it with other users the normal thing to do in the Elliptic Curve world would actually be, not to create a data encryption key, but rather to create an ephemeral EC key which is then used under an ECIES scheme (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme) to arrive at a data encryption key.  If your recipient loses or changes their private key rather than obtaining a new certificate with the same old key then they would no longer be able to derive that data encryption key anymore.   \n\nSo in the case that you might be doing data encryption you will want to look at what sort of key retention would be required.  I'm not aware of any such feature built into fabric, but am just letting you know that there can be cases of data loss if you generate a new key/cert and don't retain old keys.

If something goes wrong, for example a transaction is endorsed that should not be endorsed, then the auditor can find the identity of the endorser. So indeed, in that scenario the endorser is not anonymous towards the auditor, but you could have multiple auditors such that every endorser could choose one auditor it trusts, and we don't get a single auditor that can see everything. \n\nThe MSP principal for anonymity gives a standard way to check whether a signature is anonymous or not, because as you said, anonymous signatures don't necessarily work for any endorsement policy.

Your endorsement policies would use the Peer role, clients would use the Client role and of course admins would use Admin.  But things can get a bit tricky in setting up the channel policies such that you have MSPs which include Peer and Client roles in your channel access policies","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2018-09-02T16:46:50.735Z"}

I could not comment there so asking here. The MSP OU admin is for the entire organisation or for the entire unit within that CA, right?  My doubts are:  We have node certficates, for example: peer and orderer certificate for peer and orderer node. Do we also have something like admin for a peer or a set of peers? Because, to my knowledge the admin is for the org not for a particular peer or orderer. I would like to get more knowledge on this. \n\nSecond and a different doubt: When proposing a config change or something in a channel how to meet the signature requirement for endorsements? Do we have to sign the transaction with one admin and copy that file into another org's peer out of the band manually and sign it by the second org's admin? \n","username":"indirajith","ts":"2019-10-15T11:52:17.507Z"}

And it's generally recommended that you use separate orgs to manage your peer(s) and orderer(s).\n\nFor config changes ... correct ... if you need multiple signatures you will need to pass the config update transaction out of band to collect signatures (of course there are several vendors offerings which provides this capability as well)","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2019-10-15T19:52:25.726Z"}

Next, I started the peers for both the organisations with necessary files and environment variables embedded in its docker image.\n\nAfter this, I collected certs necessary for generating genesis block and channel creating transaction. These are admincerts, cacerts and tlscacerts. Next, I generated genesis block and channel creation using configtxgen and started all the three raft nodes. I transferred channel transaction to the peers container and tried creating the channel.
