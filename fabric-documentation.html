hi
</p>
<p><strong>bmos299</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 17:12:53 GMT):<br/>
cleaning up the docs seems to need three pieces.. 1. an agreed upon toc (like mkdocs.yml)  2. the technologies (rtd with sphinx, etc) with help from a designer that is expert in this area.  3. tech writers assigned items from the mkdocs and a technical partner ....is just my take
</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 17:24:11 GMT):<br/>
yes - barry is absolutely right
</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 17:25:02 GMT):<br/>
#2 may take investment and time
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 17:49:59 GMT):<br/>
so, IMNSHO, DEVELOPERS are responsible for documenting the code, especially how to use it etc
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 17:50:23 GMT):<br/>
does not need to be pretty or grammatically perfect, but they need to be committing doc changes as the code evolves
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 17:51:07 GMT):<br/>
what the tech writers should be looking to do is cleaning up the mess;-) and making the docs more UX friendly
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 17:51:40 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:06:57 GMT):<br/>
#2 was vetted last year, and approved with distinction. It matches Sawtooth Lake, and we are limited to the "themes" that are provided by ReadTheDocs. ... I don't think #2 is a problem or a priority. ... It already uses a Sphinx theme. 
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:07:41 GMT):<br/>
That said, yeah the heading emphasis has some limitations - an ideal world would have a UX person on this consistently.
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:12:21 GMT):<br/>
RTD is "free" with GitHub account; so we don't get customization of look and feel, or a 'vanity' URL, for example. This was decided/agreed upon last year.
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:13:33 GMT):<br/>
#1 - The TOC that we had for v0.6 didn't get complaints, so I think if we can make the content organized more clearly by ROLES, that will help the perception/reception.
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:17:08 GMT):<br/>
here's sawtooth lake, which uses our theme. ... notice the simple/short/collapsed TOC - subtopics don't expand UNTIL you click on one. ... @rameshthoomu and I could look at this possibility for us. 
</p>

<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:17:28 GMT):<br/>
Sawtooth Lake doc: http://intelledger.github.io/
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:19:29 GMT):<br/>
#3, sounds good, but that's not the open source method, where "community" takes ownership of work items. The current process is Nick and I (and any others) create CRs for new doc and doc changes, and assign those to Reviewers. Reviewers include Maintainers, who vote on the content being in or out. To my knowledge there is no mechanism to assign a specific developer to a doc CR, using Gerrit. 
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:20:28 GMT):<br/>
i.e. the current review process is more a request for the named folks to Review, Comment, and also vote if a Maintainer.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:22:12 GMT):<br/>
We need to have a splash page which could lead to the RTD site
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:22:13 GMT):<br/>
What @cbf says above, his .02, is how it actually works, when we have only a few writers for many developers and designers. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:22:19 GMT):<br/>
we can use GitHub Pages for this
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:22:39 GMT):<br/>
we need some design help, and some html/css mad skillz
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:22:52 GMT):<br/>
I can do some but my time is limited
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:23:18 GMT):<br/>
Splash page nice, the Corda one is nice: https://www.corda.net/ ... notice that this is a splash page for all of corda however, not just corda docs. ... "Documentation" link at top.
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:24:04 GMT):<br/>
I have HTML/css, but not javascript. And then I'm not doing content. This yells out for an FT UX resource (experienced).
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:33:18 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=MTQtBJnBkzRvQnvRL) @cbf ... right this is how it traditionally works, with a few writers per a lot of developers and testers. Back in the old days each functional dev. team would have one or more writers, and the writers would then be more expert on that area of doc/tech.
</p>

I took Chris' patch, https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5615/ and built a new RTD and made a 'Home' tab.  Ramesh will make this a toggle as we move to Sphinx.  http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:35:57 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>bmos299</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:36:38 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=JyESaK25Yxv63NpoA) @bmos299 ... This is sphinx. @rameshthoomu  can anything be done to make the "Introduction" and "Chaincode Developer" etc. Headings more prominent ... even a red color and/or larger / underlined? ... I don't know if the themes in RTD are fixed or if can be tweaked - do you know?
</p>
<p><strong>bmos299</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:38:24 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski and I were chatting.  If someone creates a new document, meaning they have to update the mkdocs.yml for RTD, then we require they run private RTD which we will provide instructions how to setup.  If they are just changing an existing doc, the needs isn't really there as they won't break anything. 
</p>
<p><strong>bmos299</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:38:47 GMT):<br/>
@joshhus we are not using the sphinx theme right now.  @rameshthoomu is working on that.
</p>
<p><strong>bmos299</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:39:51 GMT):<br/>
the issue, from the past, was the .md needs to be converted to .rst for Sphinx.  Hopefully, this goes smoothly.  I think the splash page is where the the high level, business type info goes.
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 18:41:52 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=FiAurZTocH5n4JrLs) @bmos299 Right, and we don't need to to get the same RTD build. Perhaps you guys are talking about doing something else/more/different.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=FiAurZTocH5n4JrLs) @bmos299 Right, and we don't need to use Sphinx proper to get the same RTD build. Perhaps you guys are talking about doing something else/more/different by adding Sphinx.
</p>

<p><strong>bmos299</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 22:14:54 GMT):<br/>
@joshhus you there?
</p>
<p><strong>bmos299</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 22:17:27 GMT):<br/>
@joshhus i don't see the need for private builds being all that common.  If someone changes mkdocs.yml, we give instructions for them to make sure the docs still build.  This seems pretty straight forward?  For this particular instance, we are doing a pretty major structural overhaul, that is why I am using my repo as a sandbox.
</p>
<p><strong>bmos299</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 22:33:10 GMT):<br/>
@joshhus we will add automated building the rtd to the backlog to ensure the build is successful and the display renders properly.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 22:45:20 GMT):<br/>

ok 5555 was merged
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 22:45:46 GMT):<br/>
I think the next CR should be the TOC sidebar changes
</p>
<p><strong>joshhus</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 23:49:38 GMT):<br/>
Seems Chris wants to continue with the current process - no private builds. I'm fine with that, I think private builds will confuse things even more for reviews and votes. My opinion. Let's get the content updated ASAP for v1.0 that's the top priority. Then we can look at alternative build things later. The primary issue here for short term is not build. It is content development, review, and voting in.

part - when i look at corda and kafka documentation the ux experience is much better.   sphinx seems to be one option that can help provide a better experience.  i am not a expert on this space  is there something different that sphinx that should be consider?

Here, http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/#curl-the-application-source-code-and-sdk-modules for npm install to succeed for Mac, Xcode is required.

@markparz FWIW, I am also not convinced wew need a new style for the RTD 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:30:31 GMT):<br/>
a splash page should suffice

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:36:38 GMT):<br/>
@arvindupadhyaya good point, though for just about any development activities you would need that. We could add to pre-requisites
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:36:49 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski ^^
</p>
<p><strong>arvindupadhyaya</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:37:29 GMT):<br/>
yes.. it should be added to the pre-requisites list here http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/#prerequisites-and-setup
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:38:45 GMT):<br/>
hi @arvindupadhyaya - thank you.  I realized after I upgraded to Sierra that you need X Code for git and other tooling.  I will also add some versioning dependencies for node, npm and docker
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:39:07 GMT):<br/>
did you catch anything else missing from the instructions?

@nickgaski  my npm install step was failing since I didn't have Xcode. After installation of Xcode I had to remove the node_modules and re-install by `rm -rf node_modules && npm i`
</p>
<p><strong>arvindupadhyaya</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:42:27 GMT):<br/>
this point can be added as a troubleshooting tip
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:43:24 GMT):<br/>
I concur.  Everything run smoothly after you executed `npm install` with X Code?  Also out of curiosity, can you share your versions for node, npm and docker please
</p>
<p><strong>arvindupadhyaya</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:44:52 GMT):<br/>
I was initially on node version 5.0.0.. I was getting a warning with npm install 
</p>
<p><strong>arvindupadhyaya</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:45:32 GMT):<br/>
currently my node version `v6.9.5` npm is `3.10.10` and docker is `1.13.0`
</p>
<p><strong>arvindupadhyaya</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:46:31 GMT):<br/>
I used `nvm` to quickly switch between my existing version of node to `v6.9.5`
</p>
<p><strong>arvindupadhyaya</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:46:54 GMT):<br/>
everything is working smoothly now
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:51:13 GMT):<br/>
great.  those are the versions that we are seeing success with on a repeated basis 
</p>

Hi everyone,
 
Based off the results from the hackathon documentation discussions, just this past week, and a common drumbeat of feedback I am reaching out and requesting your assistance. During the discussions we had talked about the direction of the Fabric documentation, which I would like to propose and get any feedback on the layout/direction and identification of any gaps here. If you would also like to take some pieces, that would be fantastic.
 
Please provide feedback to this email or via rocketchat #fabric-documentation.
 
The plan we devised in SF and over the last few days is as follows:
 
Creation of a HL Fabric website / splash page--> that leads to documentation for both a developer and a business person.... plan to work on some mock ups this week & next (so contact me @markparz on rocketchat #fabric-documentation channel or privately)
 
 
The proposed layout of documentation index to replace/revamp the current info at : http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

(pointers at the top)
   - Rocket chat
   - Stack overflow
   - Linux Email Distribution lists
Key Concepts  - ~Paragraph at length

    Overview and why blockchain - High level overview of the architecture, pluggable framework, permissioned
    Use cases - ??? Possibly link to relevant requirements-WG page
    Glossary of terms
    Transaction data model - like Corda's... definition of the transactions, what is the data & why is it important these elements work together
    Security Model - Plugin model to use their own membership providers & crypto (high level, not fabric CA), immutable pluggable ledger
    Multi channel - data isolation, concurrency
    Chaincode (smartcontract) - what it means in an executable environment
    Consensus - not BFT (process of endorsement, ordering & validation) enable tx to not worry about non-determinism. You can insert human centric interactions into the workflow.


Getting started

    What is included
    Getting setup
        Software requirement - pre-reqs
        Installing Docker Images
    Running Demos
        Running Asset transfer within CLI

        CLI for developers
        Node.js SDK ( need to do breakout of this section in more detail)           
        Java SDK ( need to do breakout of this section in more detail)
        Python SDK -> @Baohua, hoping you can help with this section
    Starting the network (bootstrap)    
    Recipe book for best practices/templates - Next steps

Tutorials

    Learn docker compose files (marrying configuration/compose files)
    Learn Chaincode
        Example 2: describing in detail the snippets of code and the purpose of the code for the sample - Better biz example would be good if possible (Anyone have one? ) - Library books or Art auction app ?
    Application (marble?) how to use SDK thru app
    Hyperledger Fabric youtube.com channel &videos
    Administration and operations
    Debugging and Logging

Architecture (Detail level)

    Peer
        Endorsing
        Committing
        Policies -  (peer/endorser/comitter) - describe what - policies, signing, committing
    Ordering transactions (consensus)
    Security  (fabric-ca items)
    What is chaincode and endorsement (point to tutorials)
    Transaction flow (show things like flow diagrams of the transactions)

@markparz - I would also like to see the following topics which are either currently either undocumented, or difficult to find authoritative advice:
 - Production considerations: deployment options (private network & cloud), security, resilience considerations (particularly fabric-ca and orderers), backup, audit, maintenance/upgrades
 - Operational considerations: adding / retiring peers, updating chaincode

@nickgaski @joshhus @simsc @markparz @cbf.  For the short term, with documentation gerrit patch sets, make sure to include the url: fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest.  This is a short-term staging environment.  I have given Nick, Josh, Mark, Ramesh all collaborator access.   You simple need to do a push to master:  git push -f https://bmos299/fabric master.  The url will automatically be updated, assuming you don't break the build. Nick is the only one who should change mkdocs.yml.   I don't anticipate merge conflicts.  @ramesh is working on a long-term solution using Nexus moving forward.

@markparz & @passkit may i suggest for the "Creation of a HL Fabric website / splash page--> that leads to documentation for both a developer and a business person" that there's also documentation for a sys admin/dev ops person? So there'd be three links: for business, developers & sys admin.

@schwentker2 & @passkit LOVE the idea.... what sort of topics would you foresee ? I'm guessing like "my peer's ledger isn't updating"... check these things, debugging a peer, reading the log, etc... Let's build a table of contents together or at minimum a list of topics.

Hi @bmos299 in this section, I ran into a issue with mac for the `npm install` part in which I needed to install Xcode. Please add that as a pre-req. Also if the error points out its an Xcode issue, the node_modules folder should be removed completely and re-installed using `rm -rf node_modules && npm i`

Hi @bmos299 in this section http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asset_setup/#curl-the-application-source-code-and-sdk-modules, I ran into a issue with mac for the `npm install` part in which I needed to install Xcode. Please add that as a pre-req. Also if the error points out its an Xcode issue, the node_modules folder should be removed completely and re-installed using `rm -rf node_modules && npm i`

Talking with Nick Gaski- the plan for documentation this week is to get - key concepts which includes overview, why fabric, use cases, glossary, and the models (which we need to come up with a better title for).  Getting started is done- so we could use comments on getting started.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 13:33:10 GMT):<br/>
Under architecture, they want to get ledger and Python piece done (python is under interfaces)
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 13:33:30 GMT):<br/>
The team has a staging environment at this location that should be seen by the community:  http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 13:33:50 GMT):<br/>
At this point it would be helpful if people could comment on use cases and glossary as it stands now

Is the Chaincode-setup.md page up to date? I'm having issues; it seems "deploy" may have been renamed "instantiate," and also it wants an endorser, which I'm not sure how to create.

<p><strong>jwolpert</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 13:36:25 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, there isn't much point in the distinction anymore. Peers are Peers...they can endorse and they can commit. 
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 13:40:04 GMT):<br/>
thanks @jwolpert what about accessibility to endorsers from a client that sends the initial transaction proposal which needs to get to all/enough endorsers. will the endorsers forward the proposal to the others or how does that work? 
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 14:51:06 GMT):<br/>
@murrekat - the application will hold the endorsement policy, because it will bear responsibility for interpreting the proposal responses which return from the endorsers. As such, at proposal time, it knows which peers to target for endorsement.  If the policy is fulfilled, you forward this "proposal response" on to the ordering service.  Then at validation phase, the peers will double check to make sure that a. enough signatures are present & b. these signatures are authentic and arrived from the correct entities.  Then the real magic happens at ledger phase where a versioning check takes place... essentially is the world state (the version of the keys that was used during simulation) still the same?  If so, then the write set is appended and the world state & versions are updated.  Does this help?
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:18:52 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski thanks! yes that helped. I am aware of the flow, just not clear in the docs i have checked have accessible the endorsers are. especially when it might be that the client must use a peer as proxy to reach the orderer(s) i thought it might be the same in case the client just has access to a single endorser. but you mean that a client MUST have access to all endorsers directly?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:32:28 GMT):<br/>
it's a good question.  I believe that the client is able to target all peers for that specific chaincode, and then receive and aggregate back the responses.  Let me give you back a concrete answer for "does your endorsing peer act as a proxy for proposals and responses?"  I'm fairly certain the answer is no.  Also, the tx does not pass back through the peers on the way to OS.  The application will parse the responses and then use the SDK to send a grpc call to the Ordering Service with the payload
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:48:47 GMT):<br/>
it's mentioned that if a client does not have direct access to the ordering service it can use a proxy (a trusted peer)...let me give link
</p>

http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arch-deep-dive/#23-the-submitting-client-collects-an-endorsement-for-a-transaction-and-broadcasts-it-through-ordering-service
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:49:29 GMT):<br/>
last para
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:51:38 GMT):<br/>
based on this and what you say the clients all have direct access to all (required per endorsement policy) endorsers which might be split off from the committer part of the peers, and the client might or might not have direct access to the orderers so it can thus use and of the endorser peers (assuming just one is picked)
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:53:35 GMT):<br/>
unless it changed for v1.0...?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:57:52 GMT):<br/>
no anything with endorser, committer, ordering service is all v1.0 nomenclature.  so yes, it appears you are correct that in certain scenarios if a client does not direct access to an OS, it will broadcast the tx through a peer of its choice who will then forward on to the OS.  I suppose this makes sense once you start getting into deeper areas of abstraction and access control

I like the green thing - note there's a blockchain color palette now - see Kayla BLue and BLockchain seem to go together intuitively ... The BOLD HL text is too bold though, back it off a bit, and increase the text below it, and decide on some capitalization consistency. ... as for the descriptive text in the other screenshot, that's been upgraded substantially, fyi. ... e.g. I don't think we're an implementation of blockchain technology, we're more fundamental -- we're a fabric that enables implementations of blockchain technology. e.g. Bitcoin is an implementation.

HLF 1.0 deprecated the table interface for ChaincodeStub in favor of rich query-language DB.  Where is the documentation on that?  I can't find anything relevant in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/protocol-spec.md which presumably would have that info.

i just tried the multi-channel docs (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/channel-setup.md) and ran into errors when i run create channel command in the cli container `CORE_PEER_COMMITTER_LEDGER_ORDERER=orderer:5005 peer channel create -c myc1`

I'm wondering if title of Getting started is really "QuickStart"?

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 03:04:24 GMT):<br/>
In most of the open source projects I've been looking at- "education" was called "tutorial" (Kubernetes is a good example here) 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 03:06:21 GMT):<br/>
I would like to know @cbf opinion, but I think "Administration and operation" might be titled better "configurations"?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 03:07:58 GMT):<br/>
For Tutorials section- I thought we had put the SDK information here- this is what people will program most to, yes? Seems like the better place versus under architecture
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 03:09:21 GMT):<br/>
Under peer- seems like policies should right after endorser
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 03:10:49 GMT):<br/>
I don't know when fabric-composer goes into incubation- I'm wondering where we might provide a pointer to it?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 03:12:10 GMT):<br/>
Also, we do get asked about events specifically a lot.  I'm wondering if right after the SDK sections at the same level we have events?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 03:13:12 GMT):<br/>
Maybe instead of the title gossip- we should use communication protocols and then go into depth in the material itself
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 03:15:33 GMT):<br/>
scratch that- administration and operation is a better set of terms
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 03:21:23 GMT):<br/>
@murrekatt I suggest asking your question on fabric-peer-endorser-comitter

Hello all, I currently maintain the documentation for chaintool as github markdown, was contemplating migrating it to readthedocs
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 27 Feb 2017 13:52:53 GMT):<br/>
In its current form its these three pages: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaintool
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 27 Feb 2017 13:53:04 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 27 Feb 2017 13:53:36 GMT):<br/>
though I may do some refactoring as I update the docs for 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 27 Feb 2017 13:53:46 GMT):<br/>
Any thoughts/advice?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 27 Feb 2017 13:54:08 GMT):<br/>
I could just go create a readthedocs setup, but figured I should ask in case there is a more cohesive way to do it

Hi all -- is there a v1 component architecture diagram already somewhere? http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components/ references one but as wip it isn't availablet yet. Before I reinvent the wheel on this one and generate, is there one somewhere else I can pull from?

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 21:06:11 GMT):<br/>
I have a simple question: have we settled on using chaincode rather than chain-code?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 21:06:34 GMT):<br/>
I believe chaincode is the term most commonly used but I saw several occurences of chain-code
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 02:36:08 GMT):<br/>
Yea
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 02:36:49 GMT):<br/>
If you see a - it should be fixed

<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 16:46:49 GMT):<br/>
hey @warong - we changed some styling and formatting features for our docs and currently v0.6 does not build in our Read The Docs output.  However you can navigate through the github library - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/v0.6 - and track down individual markdown files that you might need
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:08:06 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski @markparz @joshhus @bmos299 @weeds some feedback on the latest rev of the docs follows
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:08:29 GMT):<br/>
1. index page not listed in TOC
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:08:55 GMT):<br/>
should be titled 'Introduction'
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:08:55 GMT):<br/>
should be titled 'Introduction' rather than 'Welcome to Fabric'
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:09:20 GMT):<br/>
2. the index page is a bit too market-y for my tastes. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:12:15 GMT):<br/>
3. the 'What's Offered' page is just weird - there should simply be one top-level TOC entry that breaks out when clicked into sections (like the 'Getting Setup' page)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:12:58 GMT):<br/>
I really find it weird that the TOC section titles are not reflected in the docs themselves in the navigation, I really think that is odd
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:13:43 GMT):<br/>
so, I would change 'Getting Setup' to 'Getting Started' and include the 'What's offered content in the Getting Started page as the first sub-section
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:14:48 GMT):<br/>
4. Same with the Key Concepts section
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:15:19 GMT):<br/>
why is this not one page (the Fabric Model page)? and just one line in the TOC?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:16:05 GMT):<br/>
5. Use cases should not be a sub-section of Key Concepts, it should be its own top-level entry in TOC
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:17:16 GMT):<br/>
6. I really don't like 'Education' - the docs themselves are 'education'
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:17:26 GMT):<br/>
Demos are not education
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:18:46 GMT):<br/>
we should NOT be teaching people how to Docker Compose or anything that isn't us. We should have a reference section that points people at related informational content - like how to use docker-compose or whatever
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:20:34 GMT):<br/>
7. the 'Configuration Considerations' section should be renamed 'Operations Guide' as that is what it is
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:21:18 GMT):<br/>
8. can we please be consistent about how we label v1.0 - it is v1.0 not v1 or V1 or V1.0
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:22:24 GMT):<br/>
9. Troubleshooting and Faqs should be two sections, not one
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:22:39 GMT):<br/>
and I think the content needs to be revisited
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:23:38 GMT):<br/>
10. ok, now I am pissed... we relegated contributor guide etc to the Appendix section - bzzzt 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:23:47 GMT):<br/>
that whole section needs to be rethought
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:24:08 GMT):<br/>
sorry that I have been out of the loop, but this needs some serious work still
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 13:35:19 GMT):<br/>
@jwolpert Hi John- you had stepped into help me so see above ^^

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 15:54:27 GMT):<br/>
so here is some feedback from me:
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 15:54:30 GMT):<br/>
1. Navigation panel
It is missing a pointer to the Welcome page
It's weird that the section headers in green are not clickable
Overall, I feel like this should map more closely to the pages.

2. Welcome page
As Chris said, it reads too much like marketing material.
I think the paragaphs are too long and this page goes into too many details
Not every concept needs to be introduced up front. It is better to start with the very basics and let people dig further to find out more details.
The sentence "If you're still reading, you clearly have some knowledge and an interest in distributed ledger technology..." is very odd. Most people won't fall into that category and yet you would hope they read the whole page (once it is shrunk to a more reasonable size)

3. What's offered
This title doesn't ring right. This sounds like a brochure for a product. I'd suggest something like "What will it take?" or "What's in a basic setup?", something like that.
I think that instead of referring to the "SOLO" Ordering Service which raises the question "what's that?" this would read better as "a basic Ordering Service" or if you really want to name it: a basic Ordering Service called "SOLO".
Kill the second paragraph. This is not the place to explain all this.

4. Getting Setup
On Windows if npm install fails due to missing VCBuild.exe, user should do 'npm install --global windows-build-tools' as Administrator as explained in https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools or check https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation for other options

Unfortunately while the above helped me I still haven't managed to get the whole node stuff to work but that's a different story...

Create the initial channel - this whole section isn't really useful at this point because the reader has already gone through everything and the channel was created. This fails to point out that one would have to reset the whole network then (docker-compose down+up).

Trouble shooting

"This occurs because you are attempting to create a channel named myc1, and this channel already exists! There are two options. Try issuing the peer channel create command with a different channel name - myc2."

The text after that is essentially a repeat of the CLI section above. Just delete the repeat and change the above with:

Try issuing the peer channel create command with a different channel name - myc2 as described in the CLI section above OR, if you want your channel called - myc1 -, remove your docker containers and then follow the same commands in the Manually create and join peers to a new channel topic.

Helpful Docker tips - I agree with Chris, just put a link to the docker doc

5. Key Concepts

Overview - chaincode links to glossary section instead of the model one
Assets - "using the included Fabric Composer tool." It is not included. I suggest changing to something like "using a tool such as Fabric Composer".

It seems to me that this section is too detailed at this point in the documentation and it's too much to read if what I want is to get going. I just got my environment set up and the next thing I want to do is to try to modify the example to start doing my own thing. I would expect a section explaining that most of the development will focus on two key areas: chaincode and client side/SDK and how to go at starting to do that.

Once people get started with that they can then dig up for more information as they try to do more and more complicated stuff.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:29:56 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski  - we are not mentioning the e2ecli as a sample in the docs are we?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:31:16 GMT):<br/>
yes I'd like it to become the new getting started material
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:31:24 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:34:04 GMT):<br/>
hmm - ok - need to think about how we deal with versioning for the scripts.  For the Docker images we should be all set (as by default you should get the ones published to dockerhub).  We might need to think about publishing a ZIP file of the other contents
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:34:18 GMT):<br/>
e.g. compose files, etc
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:35:00 GMT):<br/>
because if we make changes to the master branch, it's possible that things in e2e might change and then that would break the existing alpha 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:35:49 GMT):<br/>
also - who has the ability to publish the fabric-sdk-node readthedocs?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:39:27 GMT):<br/>
is there specific content you want out of the SDK repo?  If so we can poach the .md files and put them in our source directory.  If not then we will have to create a separate build and separate URL for the SDK docs.  
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:58:05 GMT):<br/>
we have this http://fabric-sdk-node.readthedocs.io/en/master/   already
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:58:33 GMT):<br/>
I guess we should decide how we want to handle the SDK docs
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:59:15 GMT):<br/>
and this https://www.npmjs.com/package/fabric-client  points to https://www.npmjs.com/package/fabric-client
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:59:59 GMT):<br/>
in an idea world, I'd actually like to have the API docs published rather than people have to build them locally

Hoping this is the right channel...I made a modification to https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric.md -- changed the date that the project moved out of incubation.  Now when I look at the page, I see the markdown syntax instead of the formatted page.  Any idea what I did wrong?  I only changed a single character.

Hi, If I want to set up Hyperledger V1.0 latest, can you please tell me from where should I start? I need to write chain code and deploy it and I want invoke them using nodesdk, I'm looking at doing this outside of vagrant.
</p>
<p><strong>subbu165</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 15:49:52 GMT):<br/>
is this the one for V1.0? https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asset_setup.html, but the version is never mentioned there
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:57:38 GMT):<br/>
@subbu165 yes, that's the right doc for v1.0
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:58:49 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt I saw the same thing earlier and fixed it. We use a plugin to handle the markdown and it's flaky unfortunately
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:59:01 GMT):<br/>
sometimes it stops rendering properly
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:59:40 GMT):<br/>
then it's a matter of luck to get it back on its feet - it typically takes to edit - add a blank line, a space, or remove on, save back - and maybe it's back

@nickgaski What is the status of Getting Started?  I assumed this page http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asset_setup.html (which has the instructions from hackfest timeframe) was going to be replaced with content from the e2e example from alpha timeframe: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/end-to-end.rst . Is that a true statement?  People are asking where to start...

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 18:54:17 GMT):<br/>
you can simply choose you config in the examples section and then remove the comment on doNotDecompose
</p>

Look for a doco link on how developer can set up dev environment ? Particularly one that explains running with Vagrant. We used to have that but I now find 404 .. thx

<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 23 Mar 2017 17:13:34 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric  if you look at Contributing the link there is just a 404 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 23 Mar 2017 17:15:27 GMT):<br/>

Hi I worked with http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asset_setup.html documentation and I have questions as I tried some test and it show that the image which is being in this documentation is older version of V1. As the images dont support install and instantiate chaincode instruction. And in my few test case with the docker image provided that document shows that the global state is inconsistent. So could anybody share or update the steps in the hyperledger documentation which work with current version of V1 docker image. 
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 23 Mar 2017 18:26:12 GMT):<br/>
If someone need the steps and operation performed on test, I can share with anyone who need it.
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 23 Mar 2017 18:27:35 GMT):<br/>
I hope that have been addressed with the new version of V1 so Could anyone update the documentation on above link that would be great help so I can work or test out more cases.

fixed e2e - Nick is on it, and patch set will be in today. There were some issues that were hell to get through, missing files, etc. (You can ask Bobbie)
e2e moved up to replace the getting started - Will be in today
Chaincode Development 
Chaincode migration

Is there a way to disable reading from Hyperledger for a period of time?
</p>
<p><strong>rrader</strong> (Sun, 26 Mar 2017 14:48:54 GMT):<br/>
I need this to allow only to write in hyperledger for a period of time, after this to allow only reading from hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 15:54:25 GMT):<br/>
@rrader I assume when you say "hyperledger" you really mean "hyperledger fabric"
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 15:54:36 GMT):<br/>
there are several frameworks so beware
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 15:55:06 GMT):<br/>
I don't know what level of control you want but you could handle this in your chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 15:56:04 GMT):<br/>
you will need to maintain a state that tells you whether you are in readonly mode or writeonly mode
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 15:56:34 GMT):<br/>
you can then switch between the two by invoking your chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 15:57:24 GMT):<br/>
but this may not be what you want, you need to be more specific

Thank you in advance.

Hi @ersudiplama please see `fabroc/examples/e2e_cli/end-to-end.rxt` for direction on how to do that.
 And the #fabric-questions channel is more suitable for these questions.

Hi,

Please let us know if there is some discrepancy in the  "What happened behind the scenes" section on "chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ledger" page and "docker-compose.yaml" file ?

As per chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ledger" page :-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

we have a channel consisting of four peers, and two organizations.
PEER0 and PEER3 belong to Org0; PEER1 and PEER2 belong to Org1
Recall that these relationships are defined in the configtx.yaml

As per "docker-compose.yaml" file :-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

peer0:
environment:
- CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org0MSP

peer1:
environment:
- CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org0MSP

peer2:
environment:
- CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP

peer3:
environment:
- CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP


>>> Differences between both sources, we noticed are as below :-

"chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ledger" > PEER0 and PEER3 belong to Org0; PEER1 and PEER2 belong to Org1
"docker-compose.yaml" > PEER0 and PEER1 belong to Org0; PEER2 and PEER3 belong to Org1

Nick and I are discussing with Gari some of our documentation and where it needs help and maybe we get input at the Hackfest. If you think about it, we need  write an chaincode... application, create a channel, join a channel, install/instnatiate.. and write to different ledgers.  We should then explain basics of MSP relation to all of this.  We need a good javascript program apart from this end to end cli thing we have.  If we have that? any scripts we have should become a true official nodejs.sdk sample, so that get clone is not required... Is this the right direction?   We have all these pieces, but the flow is not good in the documentation today which is confusing people.

@nickgaski : I have put together a patch file for moving .md to .rst in the docs directory (https://gist.github.com/tkuhrt/de72dfde5f4970c633b2503fbdf5be85).  Can you help me understand the best way to test or verify these changes before I attempt to work through the process of committing them.

<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:58:27 GMT):<br/>
hi @tkuhrt - the best way to test/verify would be to create yourself an instance of read the docs from your personal github repo.  It will compile all of the documentation with the same layout and incorporate your changes.  That said, there are a handful of issues I noticed with your preliminary PS.  
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:59:07 GMT):<br/>
I used a link checking tool and found 65 broken links in our docs!!!  
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:59:15 GMT):<br/>
I have a proposal though 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:59:46 GMT):<br/>
Nick, teach me...I want to learn how to build the docs and run this link checking tool that you speak of.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:00:09 GMT):<br/>
And happy for any advise on moving this forward.
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:00:42 GMT):<br/>
ok lets get you an instance of read the docs first.  Let me direct message you

<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:36:07 GMT):<br/>
Is there any steps to run and demo custom chaincode through cli so we can test the node js application for interacting with custom blockchain network 
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:38:06 GMT):<br/>
Do we have any documentation for deploying the custom chaincode to V1?  As I am not being able to access cli after above steps
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:38:22 GMT):<br/>

hey @ersudiplama if you'd like you can go into your docker-compose.yaml and throw a sleep flag on the cli container
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:41:30 GMT):<br/>
that way it won't exit on you
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:45:49 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski thank you, i will and let you know
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:45:58 GMT):<br/>
i will try *

Hi @nickgaski, i tired it and cli is working. But when I try to create new channel using previous tutorial and it didnt work. Could any one provide steps to create custom channel and deploy custom chaincode to the custom channel as I am trying to build my own application using the V1 hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:32:56 GMT):<br/>
yea if you scroll down towards the latter half of the getting started, we expose all of the CLI commands for create and join
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:33:16 GMT):<br/>
you can use the same channel.tx artifact but just give the channel a unique name
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 21:14:47 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski thanks i will try and give my feedback if i have some problems

It would be nice to have a detailled doc on protocols used between components, as asked by the security team of enterprises for an integration in the IS
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 13:49:21 GMT):<br/>
@LoupTheron - can you elaborate a little more on specifically what you're after..  The txflow document gives a fairly nice outline of the information flow beginning at client and ending at commitment.  In terms of protocol, the fabric communication layer is protobuffers over gRPC. 
</p>
<p><strong>LoupTheron</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 14:08:19 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski Sure, so: What protocols are used to get the TCert, ECert between the peers and the CA ? There is also Kafka messaging along the protobuf right ? Can you give me more details on it ?
</p>
<p><strong>LoupTheron</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 14:10:43 GMT):<br/>
Also, there a revocation process of the certificates ? How is managed the CRL ?
</p>
<p><strong>LoupTheron</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 14:23:20 GMT):<br/>
Another question if I may, when will be the beta launched ? As I can see it as be delayed, we are still in the alpha version

@markparz is there any insight as to when v1 may come?  The delta between the current head and v1-0-0alpha is already huge and breaking changes are introduced almost daily.  It may not be long until commercial pressures force us to look elsewhere for a stable solution.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 11:04:44 GMT):<br/>
@passkit, the current target is June but meeting that deadline is not the priority, we will only release v1 if it's solid enough
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 11:05:08 GMT):<br/>
in the meantime you can expect several other intermediate releases - beta

@nickgaski @tkuhrt I'm interested in fixing the broken links in the docs if that helps
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:19:06 GMT):<br/>
well, at least take a first pass
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:21:57 GMT):<br/>
@lehors happy to have some help. Issue number FAB-3201. 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:22:41 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I saw it, but it's assigned to you so I didn't want to hijack it :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:28:28 GMT):<br/>
otherwise I'm wondering about all these absolute links all over the doc, I would think we want to use relative links as much as possible
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:29:10 GMT):<br/>
Hijack away. :) Happy to continue working on it too. Just need to make sure we don't duplicate. I was wondering about creating tasks as a way to separate work. 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:30:46 GMT):<br/>
for full disclosure, I was editor of the html spec so I'm pretty anal about html docs :)
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:30:48 GMT):<br/>
The absolute paths to source code is definitely an issue. Also, links to .txt files in the docs directory don't really work. If you have a solve for moving to relative links, let me know. 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:31:36 GMT):<br/>
our docs aren't valid html and it'd be nice to fix that at some point but I realize that this isn't for today
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:31:51 GMT):<br/>
so I'll settle on fixing what's outrageously broken for now
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:44:12 GMT):<br/>
the problem is that I don't think it's possible to use relative links that will work both on readthedocs and github
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:44:59 GMT):<br/>
the only way to make the links in github work is to have absolute links to readthedocs
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:45:57 GMT):<br/>
that's because the links have to point to the html file and in github we only have the rst file
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:47:35 GMT):<br/>
and that means every time we move to a new version which involves some documentation change impacting filenames we break the older doc
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:50:51 GMT):<br/>
and by the way of full disclosure: I have an aversion for things like for blahblah look _here_
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:51:16 GMT):<br/>
having "here" as the anchor for a link is a BIG NO NO in my book
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:51:53 GMT):<br/>
let's get every relative link that we can and then deal with the absolute paths once we clean up this initial portion.  Arnaud you can easily change those titles to something more intuitive than "here"
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:52:25 GMT):<br/>
fwiw this would have been a nice candidate for "good first bug"
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:54:27 GMT):<br/>
to the risk of sounding like an old fart I even posted a blog on that topic several years ago: https://lehors.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/linking-the-proper-way/
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:55:53 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski what do you mean by "let's get every relative link that we can" exactly?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:56:28 GMT):<br/>
if we put a link a la <foo.html> in the rst file it will be broken when rst file is rendered on github
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:56:49 GMT):<br/>
so, I would think we're stuck with having an absolute link to readthedocs in this case
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:57:21 GMT):<br/>
so anyone clicking on a link while browsing an rst file on github will land on the readthedocs html file
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:58:05 GMT):<br/>
that makes sense Arnaud.  I just meant that we can solve a lot of these by changing the tagging and removing the ``.md`` suffix on a lot of these paths 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:58:50 GMT):<br/>
I was hoping we could do away with foo instead of foo.html but apparently readthedocs doesn't automatically redirect
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 13:59:07 GMT):<br/>
did I miss something?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:16:16 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski does links to foo.rst get changed foo.html as part of sphinx-build?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:16:16 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski does links to foo.rst get changed to foo.html as part of sphinx-build?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:16:16 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski do links to foo.rst get changed to foo.html as part of sphinx-build?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:18:03 GMT):<br/>
sorry, I'm new to this sphinx stuff
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:18:53 GMT):<br/>
it appears they do
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:25:05 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I just realized that
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:25:41 GMT):<br/>
so then we should be good using links a la <foo.rst>, they will work in github and get translated to something that works on readthedocs
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:25:59 GMT):<br/>
I actually see now that we already have some links like that
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:26:02 GMT):<br/>
that's good news :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:34:39 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately that's not quite the case apparently
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:36:19 GMT):<br/>
all the links to rst files in CONTRIBUTING are left as such and therefore are broken on readthedocs
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:36:45 GMT):<br/>
this is apparent in http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html#working-with-a-local-clone-and-gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:47:42 GMT):<br/>
and more troubling sphinx linkcheck doesn't report them :(
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:11:15 GMT):<br/>
I would also like to know where how the doc gets built and published to readthedocs
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:11:15 GMT):<br/>
I would also like to know where how the doc gets built and published to readthedocs is documented
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:11:45 GMT):<br/>
I imagine it's part of the ci process but the Makefile gives no indication as to what exact command is run
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:12:10 GMT):<br/>
the help target doesn't really help because it gives all possible options and not the one that is actually used
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:12:31 GMT):<br/>
ping me Arnaud 
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:12:38 GMT):<br/>
I'll walk you through it
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:17:10 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski could you type it in here, please? otherwise the next person will ask again
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:18:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm happy to take what you type, clean it up if needed, and stick it somewhere into the source so the next person won't have to ask :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:18:55 GMT):<br/>
or if you prefer we can talk and I'll do the typing
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:21:57 GMT):<br/>
no I can do that, it's no problem.  Does the "contributing" doc make the most sense?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:22:55 GMT):<br/>
we can figure out where to put it in the source...  Now for the docs
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:23:12 GMT):<br/>
we build against index.rst
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:23:51 GMT):<br/>
as far as I'm concerned I think a README in the docs directory, next to the Makefile would do
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:24:02 GMT):<br/>
so if you wanted to add something into the Table of Contents you would simply modify that file in the same manner as all of the other topics.  It's very self-explanatory once you look at it 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:24:30 GMT):<br/>
yes, I figured that much
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:24:40 GMT):<br/>
what make command gets run for the build?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:24:59 GMT):<br/>
it has a hook for any new content that goes into docs/source
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:25:31 GMT):<br/>
you can easily build your own staging repo, I expect that's what most folks would like to do
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:25:50 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:25:56 GMT):<br/>
it's very easy.
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:26:02 GMT):<br/>
fork fabric on github
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:26:20 GMT):<br/>
from your fork, go to `settings` in the upper right portion of the screen
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:26:45 GMT):<br/>
click `Integration & services`
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:27:02 GMT):<br/>
click `Add service` dropdown
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:27:09 GMT):<br/>
and scroll down to ReadTheDocs
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:27:36 GMT):<br/>
Next, go to readthedocs.org
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:27:41 GMT):<br/>
and sign up for an account
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:28:16 GMT):<br/>
one of the first prompts will say link to github.  Elect this 
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:28:21 GMT):<br/>
then click import a project
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:28:40 GMT):<br/>
navigate through the options to your fork (e.g. lehors/fabric)
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:29:20 GMT):<br/>
it will ask for a name for this project.  Choose something intuitive.  Your name will preface the URL.  So for example, nickgaski.readthedocs.io/en/latest
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:29:47 GMT):<br/>
now anytime you add code (doc) to your fork, this URL will automatically get updated with your changes.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:29:51 GMT):<br/>
oh, I see... so when you wrote "it has a hook for any new content that goes into docs/source", "it" meant readthedocs, right?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:30:05 GMT):<br/>
If you like the content and formatting, then push to gerrit.  Yes that is what I meant
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:30:33 GMT):<br/>
I see, interesting
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:30:47 GMT):<br/>
do you know how it does the build though?

for the mechanics, I would ask @rameshthoomu .  He's the CI savant 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:32:37 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 19:13:29 GMT):<br/>
@lehors I will prepare readme how RTD build process go through .. I have one prepared for `mkdcos` but the `sphinx` setup little different.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 19:14:18 GMT):<br/>
`sphinx` supports `github`.. so when you submit your document changes to `github`, RTD (readthedocs) webhook pick that change and build it for you.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 19:36:55 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski @lehors here are the quick steps to achieve this in local machine without depending on RTD (be in fabric directory)

```
1) sudo pip install Sphinx
2) sudo pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
3) cd fabric/docs/source/build (Be in this directory.. Makefile sits in this)
4)  make html
5) sudo apt-get install apache2 (If don't want to use RTD for your experimental stuff and stick to apache webserver)
6) sudo cp -r * /var/www/html/
7) open html files with `IP/gossip.html` (ex)
```

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 19:44:09 GMT):<br/>
thanks @rameshthoomu !! that's exactly what I was looking for :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 19:44:24 GMT):<br/>
we ought to document that somewhere
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 19:44:49 GMT):<br/>
I'm glad to see I wasn't far actually :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 19:50:01 GMT):<br/>
one should really be able to browse the html locally, without going through an http server 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 19:50:33 GMT):<br/>
that's only true if we can have relative links though
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:10:51 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski @tkuhrt when it comes to links to source file (.txt, .rst, etc.) we can either link to the file on github or on gerrit, which one should we take?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:11:19 GMT):<br/>
I feel like gerrit is the only true source but it sucks for repository browsing
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:12:43 GMT):<br/>
so, I think we should use the gerrit one but I think I could be convinced to use github instead
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:13:19 GMT):<br/>
For the .rst ones, you should be able to convert those to something like :doc:`descriptive text <filename>`.  See https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8325/2/docs/source/dev-setup/build.rst for an example.  For the source files, I believe we have been linking to the github version.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:14:46 GMT):<br/>
I don't know how to link to gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:15:05 GMT):<br/>
At least not starting at gerrit.hyperledger.org and looking for a particular file.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:15:20 GMT):<br/>
yeah, it's a pain to get there but there is a way...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:15:34 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/gitweb?p=fabric.git;a=blob;f=docs/source/MAINTAINERS.rst;hb=HEAD
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:16:09 GMT):<br/>
you have to go to the top of the project and click on "tree"
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:16:18 GMT):<br/>
you get there: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/gitweb?p=fabric.git;a=tree
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:16:24 GMT):<br/>
and you can browse from there
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:16:55 GMT):<br/>
I read the piece about the links you're talking about, that would seem to be the better fix indeed
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:19:30 GMT):<br/>
Not a fan of the gerrit links.  For each one, I would need to go into gerrit to find it versus just looking at my source directory.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:19:49 GMT):<br/>
That makes it harder for a maintainer of the docs.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:20:50 GMT):<br/>
Now if it could find a way to make it truly relative, that would be ideal.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:22:08 GMT):<br/>
there is at least one place where we actually want to link to the rst source file
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:22:34 GMT):<br/>
it's in the section on how to propose a new maintainer - which is done by submitting a change to the MAINTAINERS.rst file
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:22:45 GMT):<br/>
in this case we ought to link to the gerrit file
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:23:04 GMT):<br/>
because that's the one you want to modify, not the read-only mirrored github one
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:24:49 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, unfortunately github doesn't understand the :doc: syntax
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:25:33 GMT):<br/>
did you see this? https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/dev-setup/build.rst
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:26:01 GMT):<br/>
I guess this may be something we have live with
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:26:01 GMT):<br/>
I guess this may be something we have to live with
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:48:32 GMT):<br/>
Ugh.
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:02:33 GMT):<br/>
do not link to gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:02:56 GMT):<br/>
why?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:03:17 GMT):<br/>
I've actually convinced myself that's the right thing to do...
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:03:33 GMT):<br/>
I am unequivocally against linking to gerrit.  I don't understand why we would ever choose gerrit over github for display purposes?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:04:11 GMT):<br/>
even when we point to the file one must submit a CR against?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:05:21 GMT):<br/>
admittedly anyone at the point of proposing a new maintainer would know how to get to the actual source 
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:05:33 GMT):<br/>
So here is my two cents.  First, you can't edit the gerrit file directly, can you ?  Secondly, we have the maintainers.rst building correctly in ReadTheDocs.  Thirdly, what you just wrote
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:07:55 GMT):<br/>
I don't get the point about not editing the gerrit file I have to say but that's fine
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:08:40 GMT):<br/>
I guess my real point here is - if I ever want to read something, gerrit is the last place I want to read it from :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:08:58 GMT):<br/>
lol
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:09:07 GMT):<br/>
I can't quite argue with that :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:09:28 GMT):<br/>
but this isn't about reading the file as much as pointing to it
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:10:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm talking about the section where we actually tell people they must submit a patch to the MAINTAINERS.rst file
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:10:43 GMT):<br/>
should we then point to the html file if it's just for display purposes?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:11:56 GMT):<br/>
yes.  Like you said, if anyone is going to nominate a maintainer then they will be able to navigate into docs/source and edit the rst file and then push
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:12:20 GMT):<br/>
ok, deal :)
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:12:37 GMT):<br/>

@hshimo - you're seeing this error because the binary for configtxgen is looking for an unsupported config type.  I suspect that you compiled the binaries yourself from the master branch at some point in time.  At any rate, can you try the following.  `network_setup.sh down` and then `network_setup.sh restart`.  If that also fails, then we will need to truly start from scratch and whack your docker images.

@rameshthoomu when will the link be corrected? I generally point colleagues to the getting started page as af irst step. It doesn't engender confidence when the public getting started is broken (apologies for the tone-- this isn't directed at you personally, just at the frequency of breaks like this).
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 16:19:46 GMT):<br/>
@mrkiouak - I wouldn't say that we are thrilled about this either.  In the meantime, you can access all of the artifacts and binaries here - https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/fabric-binaries-x86_64/3/
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 16:22:59 GMT):<br/>
@here - this is a comparable approach for Getting Started as well -https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/end-to-end.rst - It doesn't expose the cryptogen tool, however it does run against master images and new configuration protocols.  No need to pull alpha images, simply do a `make docker` for this approach

Guys - I know there were some issue with getting started doc
http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_startedv2.html
but stuck on create channel

If I follow the instruction as given in the doc
```CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="OrdererMSP" peer channel create -o orderer.example.com:7050 -c mychannel -f channel.tx```
then i get this error
no such file or directory, err /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/signcerts

But when i fix CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH to /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp (which seems to be the right path)
then i get this error
```2017-05-02 23:18:41.904 UTC [logging] InitFromViper -> DEBU 001 Setting default logging level to DEBUG for command 'channel'
2017-05-02 23:18:41.905 UTC [msp] GetLocalMSP -> DEBU 002 Returning existing local MSP

Error connecting: rpc error: code = 14 desc = grpc: RPC failed fast due to transport failure
Error: rpc error: code = 14 desc = grpc: RPC failed fast due to transport failure```

Any clues ? Stuck from long time. Have asked this question in #fabric channel as well as don't know the right place. Thanks.

I'm getting similar errors on starting the network
</p>
<p><strong>tmath</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 00:33:28 GMT):<br/>
it seems that the script is expecting the code to be in /opt/gopath/ but there's nothing in the doc about installing it there

<p><strong>MadhavAchar</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 07:30:27 GMT):<br/>
@foravneet @tmath I had the exact same problem yesterday. For some reason all was fixed on my local machine when I used the release in the fabric-binaries folder as opposed to the one in fabric-binaries-x86_64. My development machine is a Mac. I believe we also switched from go 1.8 to 1.7.5. I'm not sure if that also helped in some way.

hello I just had a student class installing all hyperledger fabric 1.0 on their laptops and we found two problems that occured several times following the 'getting started guide'.  First in the 'network_setup.sh' line 86 ... export ORDERER_CFG_PATH=$PWD seems to be wrong? It works by using export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$PWD and then the step export ARCH_TAG=$(uname -m) did not work as expected, since the variable was not (always) avialable in the docker file it helped to write the variable value (ARCH_TAG=x86_64) in a '.env' file in the same directory. So this variant worked.

hi @highway - the ORDERER_CFG_PATH variable has been addressed; that problem should not have been present if the scripts and artifacts were curled from the provided path.  Your observation about ARCH_TAG is indeed a good one.  If we simply pass ARCH_TAG=x86_64 as a preface to our docker-compose command, everything works as expected.  Let me do a bit of investigating, but many thanks for sharing your thoughts

@here Moderators - A lot of people were having issues just getting the getting started to work. Do you think you can start a temp channel (can be deleted once docs are stable) so getting started questions are not lost in other questions here? Also if you can define a way to collect & publish tech FAQs just on getting started, that people can contribute to as they are resolving their issues , might be very useful to not stumble upon same issues that others in community have solved already.

@michele - we use the middle integer in this context to represent the version of the world state.  A write transaction is simply a key and a value - NOT a world state version.  If the key/vals are validated, then we update the world state

Hi @tkuhrt anyway possible :) are there any particular parts you are most interested in writing and/or reviewing, identifying gaps? Anything & everything helps for sure....  Happy to have you, the more the merrier for sure!

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 20:44:20 GMT):<br/>
Okay...didn't understand whether a group was forming around this and there was going to be a meeting or if you were just looking for feedback on this channel. I think it would be useful to separate our documentation into a section for Operations and a separate one for Developers.  We need to make sure that the people who just want to set up a system for creating blockchain applications, without having to download and build the code, can do so.

Some changes underway with the docs with the help of Anthony O'Dowd from the Blockchain Labs in Hursley. A new introductory section -- very high level, introducing people to the concept of blockchain and then some on Hyperledger Fabric as a particular iteration of blockchain. Then, a reworking of Key Concepts. And then finally, some new introductory high level stuff in Getting Started. Here's an image of what we've sketched out. Comment! Help out!

Hello everybody. I wonder if there is a description of the generated crypto-config directory. So what is the function of the different certificates and why this directory structure maybe for the default crypto-config generated by ./network_setup.sh up. Is it in the documentation? Sorry if I overlooked it.

Hi all,
</p>
<p><strong>BlkchnDev</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 06:57:15 GMT):<br/>
can anyone let me know what is orderer? I know that we have peer nodes & membership services in a blockchain network
</p>
<p><strong>highway</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 07:01:39 GMT):<br/>
@BlkchnDev   the ordering service is documented here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/6f9b4272f4e3a6d843866402fa4325f39124e044/orderer/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>BlkchnDev</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 07:21:13 GMT):<br/>
Yeah i have seen those @highway . But to make it clear I want to know if anyone can explain in terms of the blockchain network components. If you see the docker images needed to setup a blockchain network, you need - peer image, membership service image. Hence I want to know in that perspective, where does orderer come into  picture in the scenario.

@markparz @nickgaski There is a really good thread on the mailgroup.  Sorin had a great post on the [Hyperledger-fabric] Proposal: the "alpha2 challenge"  thread.  Here is the update that pertains to doc and test.  For docs:  I would love to see the docs migrate to an SDK oriented

I know for docs we have chatted about a similar flow
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 13:31:50 GMT):<br/>
@highway - let me repost something from @mastersingh24 that you will find very helpful
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 13:32:05 GMT):<br/>
1. MSP (membership service provider) - this is a concept which allows for 2 things:
- ability to use different types of membership providers. the default (and only one currently implemented) is an X509 provider
- it allows for "identities" to be issued by different providers (e.g. if you have multiple companies participating in the blockchain, each company could manage/provide their own certificate authority for issuing certificates)

2. Based on 1), fabric peers / ordering nodes are not required to obtain their X509 material from fabric-ca but of course we provide fabric-ca for people with their own CAs to use

3. MSPs are used in 2 ways (and I admit this is confusing)
- "LocalMSP" - think of local MSPs as "structures" which hold the cryptographic identity information for clients, peers and ordering nodes. They will contain the root CA which issued the identity as well as the signing certificate key pair for the client, peer, orderer. For example, when a peer starts up, it will populate its localMSP from the file artifacts reference in core.yaml and will use this information to actually sign endorsements (among other things)

- "VerifyingMSPs" - similar to a "localMSP" except they DO NOT contain a signing identity (i.e. no reference to a private key for a signing keypair).

(you'll note that one of the fields of an MSP is actually a revocation list and in the case of X509 provides this will be an X509 CRL

4. When channels are created, you actually specify which organizations are allowed to participate in that channel. Each organization will be associated with an MSP (and it would be a "verifying" MSP). When the genesis / config block for a channel is created, it will contain the list of organizations (each of which has its MSP info)

5. When a peer joins a channel, you give it the genesis / config block for the channel. The peer will parse that information and will have a map of channels with one of the properties of each channel being the list of MSPs for the channel

6. So let's say we have a channel (call it channelA) which has 3 orgs - Org1, Org2, Org3. Let's say that chaincode get's deployed with a policy that requires signatures from 2 out of the 3 orgs

7. So a client submits an endorsement proposal to peers from from at least 2 out of the 3 orgs, gots the proposal responses back, creates an transaction and submits it to the ordering service. A couple of things happened along the way:

- each peer has the list of per channel MSPs and will actually check to make sure that the client who submitted the proposal is allowed to do so by verifying the signature of the proposal (the client signed it using its local MSP) and making sure that the client's certificate was issued by an MSP that's associated with the channel (there's more detail to how this works, but should be good enough for now)

- when the client submits the transaction to the orderer, the same basic thing happens - signature is checked and orderer node checks to make sure that the certificate is valid / issue by one of the MSPs for the channel

8. Let's say a Peer is connected to channelA and receives a block of transactions. Let's say it got a block which had the transaction submitted in step 7) above. The peer now needs to make sure that the endorsement policy for the transaction has been met (the endorsement policy is assocaited with the chaincode against which endorsement was requested). From step 6), we said that this requires signatures from 2 out of the 3 orgs and from step 5) the peer knows which orgs (and MSPs) are part of the channel. So the peer can make sure that there are enough valid signatures which meet the policy

9. OK - so finally - let's say that a peer (we'll call it org1Peer1) from Org1 was compromised. For simplicity, let's say that Org1 is only part of channelA. So we need to be able to tell all peers which have joined channelA that the certificate for org1Peer1 has been revoked. All peers need to receive and process this information at the same time (this is to ensure that the committing logic is deterministic). So we need to update the MSP for Org1 and propogate that information to all peers connected to channelA. Recall that one fof the fields for an MSP structure is a revocation list, so what needs to happen is that an update transaction is submitted to the ordering service for channelA which updates Org1's MSP to know have a CRL containing the certificate for org1Peer1
</p>

@here - this above post will do wonders in clearing up any confusion you may have with regards to MSPs in relation to the overall network, channels and tx flow.  Thanks to Gari for the beyond thorough explanation

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=nvNm5MX3nrFEgKjm2) @tkuhrt Yea, I agree totally, and I also think it's a good thought to start forming a group, and we can section out some things... right now I'm focused on https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2308 which is sort of that operational aspect. As well as taking a step back and working with @joe-alewine and Anthony O'Dowd on https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3830. @nickgaski is working on getting a staging site up for easier reviews. We were thinking of hitting key concepts next. Anthony has a bunch of material he is piece mealing together to build a high level overview then drilling down to some more detail. Which of these Jira items would you like to help with, or is there another piece? I'd love to dig deeper on some of these operational aspects in the planning guide. Just been doing sections at a time. 
</p>

hey arnaud.  As you may have noticed, we still have some outdated and placeholder docs in our library.  I think a good ticket would be to eliminate the unused documents and scrub current docs (regardless of whether they are in the TOC) for inaccurate information.  I will defer to @bmos299 for anything regarding performance.  However, I imagine we should be very careful about publishing these numbers until they are thoroughly vetted

What is the reason for having two different sets of instructions?  Which one should new people follow?  Which one is closest to working on latest master?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 14:56:57 GMT):<br/>
hey dave.  I will push an alpha2 version today.  The getting started uses the baked alpha images.  The examples/e2e_cli asks the user to run a `make docker` and `make release-all`.  However, my README never got merged into that repository, so it's a little confusing what's going on with the new config stuff (e.g. consortiums, anchorPeer transactions, etc...). 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 14:58:08 GMT):<br/>
what will get updated for alpha2?  the end-to-end.rst or getting_started.html or both?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 14:58:50 GMT):<br/>
both.  They will be mirrors  
</p>

I'm aware.  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8981/1/examples/e2e_cli/end-to-end.rst - This is the piece I have been begging for a merge since May 4
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:00:38 GMT):<br/>
ok, they are not mirrors currently.  end-to-end.rst has the `Run the end-to-end test with Docker` section that automatically runs things, getting_started does not.  Will they be in sync once you are done?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:00:48 GMT):<br/>
yep 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:02:07 GMT):<br/>
ok, so is the best set of instructions for people to run today these ones: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8981/1/examples/e2e_cli/end-to-end.rst 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:02:23 GMT):<br/>
or do you still need to make significant updates on top of that?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:02:48 GMT):<br/>
yes those should work.  I'm doing it right now and will confirm 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:03:20 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:32:55 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski I think we should discuss what to do with all the doc files that are not actually used but still in the tree
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:33:30 GMT):<br/>
the problem is that even though they aren't part of the build and readthedoc people go to them by browsing github
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:34:49 GMT):<br/>
I think we need to either segregate them to some different directory named something like "attic" with a note explaining these files aren't currently used or remove them from the source tree altogether
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:35:27 GMT):<br/>
I'd rather do the latter but could go with the former if you think we're going to use them eventually
</p>

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:45:34 GMT):<br/>
@bmos299 now that the tree has been tagged for alpha2 I guess we could just remove them. We could get them back via the tag. We just need to get that documented so we can find them in the future if needed.
</p>
<p><strong>bmos299</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 19:00:38 GMT):<br/>
@lehors agreed.  There are also ways to tag the version of the doc itself.  I think we are both saying we just dont want to see unused files cluttering the directories, but yet if we need something (for regression reasons) in the future, the file(s) are accessible.

@joe-alewine : Nice document introducing the concepts of blockchain.  A few thoughts:(https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=2ejv4JLbiouDtZ2Mu) 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 20:50:33 GMT):<br/>
1. In the section that states "* This property of immutability makes it simple to determine the provenance of information because participants can be sure that information has not been changed after the fact.", it would be nice to talk about how blocks link back to previous blocks to allow the network to more quickly understand if the data has been modified.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 20:51:31 GMT):<br/>
2. I was once told that contractions (they're, it's) make it harder for people where English is not their first language to understand.  Not sure if that is true, but I always try to write my documents without contractions.
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 21:26:45 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt Thanks for your comments! Your first suggestion seems reasonable and would be relatively simple. As for your second suggestion, I haven't heard that, but I suppose it's possible. I tend to make decisions about contractions in terms of flow and rhythm. Sometimes you need another syllable and sometimes you don't, that kind of thing.

Where can I find trust worthy document to setup environment? The document has been very messy and wrong, so I couldn't setup the docker environment.

v1.0.0-alpha2 is released yesterday, but is following documents correct? (or for v0.6?)

@hshimo - have you run through this piece yet - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/end-to-end.rst ?  I agree that the dev environment piece is without doubt way too complicated.  Moreover, it contains some outdated and unnecessary information.  To put it simply, do the following:  download Go, download docker, set your GOPATH, clone fabric into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger` .  Check out that piece though

@guoger The former one is outdated and it is for v0.6
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 08:42:37 GMT):<br/>
@reoim10 I see. The old one can actually be merged into new link under `v0.6`, instead of rotting at a separate link. More importantly, we *should* deprecate the old doc by stating _v0.6_ explicitly there. Furthermore, I found some sections in the old doc still valuable, e.g. Protocol Spec, which I failed to find in the new doc.
</p>

@reoim10 @guoger - for what it's worth.  If you access the main landing page for they fabric docs - http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ - and look in the bottom left of the screen.  There is an option to toggle between `latest` and `v0.6`.  I agree that the outdated stuff (especially openblockchain) should be deprecated 
</p>

Hi. How to edit membersrvc file to add our own users in fabric v0.6 with/ without using bluxmix as a service?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 13:32:13 GMT):<br/>
bootstrap script for GS https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9525/
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 13:32:21 GMT):<br/>
you would have user do:
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 13:32:54 GMT):<br/>
'curl -sS https://<URL path to bootstrap.sh in git> | bash'
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 13:33:26 GMT):<br/>
and it would download the correct tarbal, extract and leave the user in the correct directory... then it would download all the requisite docker images.
</p>
<p><strong>BlkchnDev</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 04:47:34 GMT):<br/>
can anyone let me know - How to edit membersrvc file to add our own users in fabric v0.6 with/ without using bluxmix as a service?

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:23:38 GMT):<br/>
the v0.6 service in bluemix was really just to start getting a sense of what you could do with fabric
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:23:54 GMT):<br/>
but all the configuration is built-in and can't be changed
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:24:38 GMT):<br/>
you need to do your own install - you can do that on pretty much any machine
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:24:54 GMT):<br/>
and then you will have full access to the configuration file
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:25:06 GMT):<br/>
beware that development on 0.6 has stopped
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:25:39 GMT):<br/>
1.0 alpha2 is being released and it would be worth for you to investigate using this instead

</p>

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:04:56 GMT):<br/>

etc etc etc

https://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:06:30 GMT):<br/>
now, it has come a long way but it started out as an annotated shell script
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:07:18 GMT):<br/>
Chris, I agree that people are lazy. We do want to make sure that someone understands what they have just done by executing network_setup.sh. A picture would be nice at a minimum. Words and a picture would be better. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:08:13 GMT):<br/>
here's the meat https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-dev/devstack/tree/stack.sh
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:08:30 GMT):<br/>
of course, @tkuhrt, not suggesting otherwise
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:08:48 GMT):<br/>
but we don't have to force them to type in (or cut and paste) a bunch of commands
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:08:51 GMT):<br/>
blech
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:10:09 GMT):<br/>
IMO, we can and should provide such an annotated script, and rather than then decompose and have them run each command, we can make it clear that what we are doing is EXPLAINING what just happened when they ran network_setup.sh
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:10:18 GMT):<br/>
(or will happen if they run it)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:11:27 GMT):<br/>
all I am really suggesting is that rather than having the doc say: "now run this command: blah.sh" with these args
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:12:34 GMT):<br/>
that we merely say: "the next step in network_setup.sh on line 100 creates the certificates for our network"

Hey guys

<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:15:21 GMT):<br/>
On the Getting started page (http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) it is stated that the documentation is valid for alpha2, but the link for the bootstrap script points to master.
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:15:36 GMT):<br/>
Might be better to point it to the actual release's bootstrap script :)
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:17:34 GMT):<br/>
Hm.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:17:36 GMT):<br/>
Agree, Chris. The flow is run the script followed by decomposition of the script and what just happened. The other thing I would like to see is that the script leave things in a state where you can then use the network. Yesterday when I ran the script, it did leave it running but not in the background where I could then run commands to query and add to the blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:17:43 GMT):<br/>
Looks like the bootstrap script is actually not in the alpha2 release's code

<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:12:22 GMT):<br/>
@Asara - not to split hairs, but the disclaimer is simply stating that the instructions work against the alpha2 docker images and the artifacts/scripts/utilities that are extracted from the tarball.  You are correct that the bootstraph.sh script lives in master, but it's simply a bash script that bundles our artifacts and downloads the docker images 
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:29:56 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski Understood, just worried that the script changes before alpha3/beta whatever, and then things break.  But it is a baseless fear :)
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:32:52 GMT):<br/>

One more question I have
</p>
<p><strong>BlkchnDev</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 09:29:31 GMT):<br/>
 Need to know how to configure the service.credentials.json file for HFC SDK(from windows machine) to interact with blockchain in the own blockchain network setup using docker images in linux machine(not by using bluemix)

Question: I was looking for a community calendar that perhaps showed when the documentation meetings take place....
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 16:22:20 GMT):<br/>
can someone @here send me an invite, or point me in the right direction?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=bFxabpXaFmMYoA797) @nickgaski We tried to setup Fabric by following end-to-end.rst, but it seems it downloads latest source code, currently alpha3. I want to setup stable or fixed version of Fabric otherwise it will break the setup procedure.

@here A reminder that we're having the regular Documentation Workgroup call on Friday:  Details here: https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-fabric/2017-May/001051.html
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 19:43:54 GMT):<br/>
There are some very interesting proposals to review, on Fabric Personae, Writing Your First Application, and Creating Your First Network
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 19:44:47 GMT):<br/>
You can read these proposals in advance of the meeting - they are linked from the agenda, and shared here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-n-iLEM1iXrWk9WWERhaHVyeWc
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 19:45:52 GMT):<br/>
It would be excellent if you can review and post comments to mailing list, or attend the meeting.  I realize US folks may be having an extended weekend due to a public holiday on Monday, but mailing list is ideal anyhow
</p>
<p><strong>seanbarclay</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 20:10:24 GMT):<br/>
Hey @odowdaibm - so Lucie on my team had created a proposal for an updated site navigation along with user flows. Would you like to include them?

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 21:33:36 GMT):<br/>
eg what @markparz did here https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9211/
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 21:34:31 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm note https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9775/ - we should have done this from the outset so we can track downloads
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 21:34:45 GMT):<br/>
it will also tell us what platforms, which is important detail
</p>
<p><strong>seanbarclay</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 22:36:18 GMT):<br/>
@cbf - i think that's definitely one solution. However, my concern is it can bloat the repo over time. for instance, if we get into animations of the architecture or page comps in photoshop/sketch, would you want large binary files on a GH repo (not to mention the versions)?

as an alternative, does linux provide anything we can leverage here for the community? 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 23:02:01 GMT):<br/>
@seanbarclay we need to have it versioned
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 23:02:19 GMT):<br/>
until GitHUb starts complaining, not my problem how large it is
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 23:02:41 GMT):<br/>
just stick it in git please
</p>

I am following the "getting started" docs: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html

I get error msg like "warning: fail to get default registry endpoint from daemon (got permission denied while trying to connect to ...."

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 12:56:57 GMT):<br/>
@seanbarclay ok, what is this? when we were discussing earlier, I must have assumed you were referring to actual documentation artifacts (images etc)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 12:57:16 GMT):<br/>
for posting discussion documents, google drive is fine
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 12:57:41 GMT):<br/>
also, without context, I have no idea what I am looking at
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 12:58:52 GMT):<br/>
the documentation feedback is good stuff, though
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 12:59:05 GMT):<br/>

thanks for this @seanbarclay feedback looks really interesting  
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 13:38:55 GMT):<br/>
I will read through it now, and capture the key points for the community
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 13:39:42 GMT):<br/>
It would be good to capture in the minutes for today's call, as certain items are coming up repeatedly, and we're trying to factor into prioirty list
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 13:39:53 GMT):<br/>
Same is true for structure/TOC, that has come up alot
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 13:39:59 GMT):<br/>
speak later, and thanks
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 13:55:46 GMT):<br/>
Actually @seanbarclay , I'm going to ask you to go through this feedback as a proxy for those users on the call.  I will capture as part of the minutes, and that way the community will see it.  Hope that's OK.  Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:12:08 GMT):<br/>
if there are actionable items in the feedback, I strongly suggest that we track these in JIRA individually as improvements to documentation (or bugs if that is appropriate)

Hi @cbf thanks for comment - I'm conscious that we need to get actions from doc WG linked into JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:35:02 GMT):<br/>
I'm also conscious that we need a way for people who are not plugged into JIRA to contribute
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:35:17 GMT):<br/>
(either through education, or relevant communication)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:51:02 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm no reason for people not plugged into JIRA to avoid getting plugged in
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:51:08 GMT):<br/>
you just need LF ID
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:51:44 GMT):<br/>
best not to have discussion scattered
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:52:39 GMT):<br/>
sadly, will miss the call - have a conflict
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:53:26 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm also note that JIRA already has a number of items in-flight and best that we not be split-brain about improving the docs
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:53:33 GMT):<br/>
absolutely - yes I agree
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:53:53 GMT):<br/>
it might be the case @cbf, that we need a short piece of education on using it.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:54:09 GMT):<br/>
get in line;-)
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:54:16 GMT):<br/>
Many folks are used to GitHub and issues, but JIRA and Gerrit can be a little more daunting

</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:54:56 GMT):<br/>
anyway, its note that we need to get plugged in, and I've taken an action item toimprove that linkage
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:55:26 GMT):<br/>
there are links to JIRA and Gerrit edumacation
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:56:09 GMT):<br/>
excellent - ty
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:56:34 GMT):<br/>
I think key thing then is to get WG Action items into JIRA items, so that we have linkage and tracking etc etc
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:56:38 GMT):<br/>
best not to reinvent the wheel
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 14:57:12 GMT):<br/>
OK, have a good weekend, when it starts. laters

<p><strong>Yuvaraj_Ravi</strong> (Sun, 28 May 2017 18:49:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi, Can someone let me know the following details? What is the amount of time taken by orderer to create a block assuming it has sufficient amount of transactions? if it depends on different consensus mechanism, what is the latency for different mechanisms?
</p>
<p><strong>jsong1230</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 13:05:43 GMT):<br/>
swarm
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 14:06:39 GMT):<br/>
@Yuvaraj_Ravi the time taken depends on the settings which affect block 'cutting', and the implementation of the orderer service.  Currently only 'solo' and 'kafka' are available.  Solo is for dev purposes only, so only kafka is recommended for production use.  The latency is highly dependent on a multitude of factors, eg. TX payload size, network latency, etc.  Work is under way to gather performance related information.  You may be able to get a clearer answer by posting your question to the #fabric-consensus channel.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:24:51 GMT):<br/>
hey @odowdaibm how can I help with GS?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:25:24 GMT):<br/>
I see fairly straight-forward "separate out pre-requisites as this can be reused elsewhere" 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:25:41 GMT):<br/>
happy to start there
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:45:11 GMT):<br/>
@here and @cbf  I've incorporated everyone's comments into the Writing Your First Application proposal.  There's an update on the mailing list here: https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-fabric/2017-May/001091.html and the updated proposal is at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-n-iLEM1iXrZkNpSXNxQ0FZczg  I think it looks good now, so I'm looking for volunteers to get started on this. 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:46:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes @cbf, we'd like to have a really simple install for the network.  We created a 1 liner to create a network under a JIRA request recently - we use that in Composer.  Could we use that here please?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:46:56 GMT):<br/>
@sstone1 can you recall the JIRA for this please Simon?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:47:47 GMT):<br/>
I also need a volunteer to write a very simple application as described in the proposal using the node.js SDK
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:50:42 GMT):<br/>
I presume that first sdk sample will be node?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:50:59 GMT):<br/>
oh duh
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:51:01 GMT):<br/>
lol
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:51:09 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:51:15 GMT):<br/>
cmon
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:51:18 GMT):<br/>
ok, I will work on prereqs and network install
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:51:29 GMT):<br/>
I typed before I read
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:51:47 GMT):<br/>
Simon may be back on in a bit, we have a nice one of these for composer
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:51:49 GMT):<br/>
was reading the proposal ppt
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:51:50 GMT):<br/>
but you get it
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:51:57 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:52:04 GMT):<br/>
OK, all read OK to you -quite a few updates
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:52:09 GMT):<br/>
oh you have a network setup ?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:52:15 GMT):<br/>
we do
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:52:21 GMT):<br/>
why does everyone need one of those - sigh
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:52:26 GMT):<br/>
I was going ot basically steal that
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:52:29 GMT):<br/>
it works fine
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:52:36 GMT):<br/>
that's why we raised the JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:52:46 GMT):<br/>
Simon has the number, we're contributing it down
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:52:56 GMT):<br/>
so I'd just like to expedite this
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:53:06 GMT):<br/>
and use in the WYFA
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:53:13 GMT):<br/>
hope you're OK with thtaht
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:53:13 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:53:24 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to see it
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:53:30 GMT):<br/>
we now have at least three of these
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:53:43 GMT):<br/>
we definitely created a JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 17:53:57 GMT):<br/>

@odowdaibm @cbf @nickgaski @joe-alewine Based on the release criteria and such I'm going thru the yaml files and opening bugs based on what I see to help clarify things at least as I see them... Just opened https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4274 for orderer.yaml ...... Anyone else that wants to comment please do so, I'll post the issue numbers as I get thru my initial pass. 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 19:33:25 GMT):<br/>
Before I go do this...has anyone created a bug to clean up all the different links for Hyperledger Fabric SDK documentation?

<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 20:02:57 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:28:12 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark Hi. Glad you've been following along with the minutes. Anthony does those and they're invaluable. I haven't gotten a calendar invite this week, either. Nevertheless I can give you the info. It's at 11am EST, as I said, and here's the link: https://ibm.zoom.us/my/ajodowd
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:29:17 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:30:04 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski I remember you were creating a glossary somewhere...
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:30:21 GMT):<br/>
in that do you define "consortium"? 
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:31:45 GMT):<br/>
Also, any one know difference between 'leading peer' and 'anchor peer'?
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:39:13 GMT):<br/>
@joe-alewine perfect. thank you! I will be joining tomorrow.  I'm interested in participating in the docs-wg
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:39:33 GMT):<br/>
alongside the ci work I'm doing in fabric...
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:43:41 GMT):<br/>
@bobbiejc - so funny you should ask.  I just pushed a CR to add consortium today.  I think we can keep it simple and say that a consortium is a grouping of MSP principals that forms the basis for a channel.  A channel cannot exist outside the purview of a consortium.  Moreover, it is the consortium that will decide upon the channel policies 
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:43:58 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark Awesome! And you're welcome! The more the merrier. If you've been following along you should know more or less what the agenda is likely to be. We're working on a Writing Your First App doc. The proposal for that is reasonably solid so hopefully we'll be able to start writing the actual doc soon. The design team is going to present the work they've been doing on branding. There's also a Getting Started/Network config thing being worked on

</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:46:32 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski and then you need to define "MSP Principals"
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:46:46 GMT):<br/>
and 'channel policies'
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:46:47 GMT):<br/>
;-)
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:47:12 GMT):<br/>
oh and @bobbiejc - anchor peer is the discovery mechanism that peers use when joining a channel.  It allows one org's peers to become aware of the rest of the channel's peers, thus facilitating gossip.  The notion of leading peer is also gossip related, however it's different.  The leading peer simply receives the blocks from the ordering node and disseminates to the rest of the its org's peers on that channel.  These are confusing because the anchor peer and leading peer can be the same, but they are not necessarily the same 
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:47:44 GMT):<br/>
uh oh --- i had myself convinced anchor peer was for gossip and that leader peers were for channels..
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:48:09 GMT):<br/>
yea you're not wrong
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:48:20 GMT):<br/>
why do we need both?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:48:33 GMT):<br/>
the leading peer will change
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:49:05 GMT):<br/>
it's an election of sorts.  @yacovm - can you clarify?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:49:05 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:49:20 GMT):<br/>
I sure can
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:49:23 GMT):<br/>
clarify about what?
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:49:25 GMT):<br/>
it also means that for a single org "POC" we aren't really getting a good representation for how the algorithms work?
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:49:51 GMT):<br/>
i know, Blockchain network, single org doesn't make sense, but a lot of 'getting started" will build their first network internally
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:50:08 GMT):<br/>
leading vs. anchor and why we need both?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:50:15 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:53:20 GMT):<br/>
so:
Leader peer is a peer that is defined per channel, and org, (meaning, for each org there are leader peers regardless of other orgs, and also for each channel there is a leader peer for that channel).
Its role is to connect to the ordering service and pull blocks.

Anchor peer is/are endpoint(s), definitions that exists in the configuration block. 
But there should be real peers with these endpoints. 
They are found in the config block so that when peers join a channel, they would reach out to these endpoints and connect to peers that are (hopefully) already in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:53:30 GMT):<br/>
for example- if we have 2 orgs - A and B and they share a channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:53:47 GMT):<br/>
we'll have (hopefully) 2 anchor peers: peerA and peerB (each in org A and B)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:53:47 GMT):<br/>
we'll have (hopefully) 2 anchor peers: peerA and peerB (each in org A and B )
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:54:05 GMT):<br/>
when a peer joins the channel it will connect to both anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:54:16 GMT):<br/>
and this way the membership of the channel is established
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:54:25 GMT):<br/>
and all peers in the channel, even though from different orgs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:54:27 GMT):<br/>
know each other.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:54:42 GMT):<br/>
@bobbiejc  and @nickgaski  any further questions? (feel free to ask)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:54:51 GMT):<br/>
ah right
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:55:05 GMT):<br/>
the leader peer is elected between the peers in the org, that participate in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:55:33 GMT):<br/>
there are all kinds of "rules" for the election but in short - the peer with the lowest "ID" wins as long as it is there for a long time
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:55:43 GMT):<br/>
@joe-alewine although I'm not new to open-source projects, I am relatively new to Hyperledger.  One of my tactics that allows me to learn the ins and outs of a new project/community is to first get involved with the documentation working group.  it allows me to be valuable right out of the gate, while learning as I read and apply the documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:55:47 GMT):<br/>
when this peer dies, re-election takes place
</p>
<p><strong>webdaford</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:55:54 GMT):<br/>
if there are two orgs each with its own leader peer and there is one for the channel as well, then are there 3 leader peers?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:56:14 GMT):<br/>
^ no
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:56:39 GMT):<br/>
an example- if we have channel X with orgs A and B and channel Y with orgs A and B
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:56:56 GMT):<br/>
then there will be at least 2 leader peers - one for A and one for B
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:57:01 GMT):<br/>
but they may be more - 4 
</p>
<p><strong>webdaford</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:57:43 GMT):<br/>
so there could be 3?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:57:55 GMT):<br/>
could be yeah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:58:01 GMT):<br/>
2 for orgA and 1 for orgB 
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:58:03 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark Sounds like a good strategy to me. Have you gone through our current docs? http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:58:36 GMT):<br/>
I'm making my way through them as we speak...
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:58:38 GMT):<br/>
hey yacov.  I realize if the leading peer goes down then a new one can be elected.  What happens if the anchor peer goes down?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:59:47 GMT):<br/>
well if all anchor peers die, then new peers that have joined the channel after they all died
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 15:59:53 GMT):<br/>
can't find the peers in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 16:00:15 GMT):<br/>
if they are configured to use leader election they would declare themselves "alone" and declare themselves leaders
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 16:00:22 GMT):<br/>
and connect to the ordering service themselves
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 16:01:47 GMT):<br/>
@jtclark Cool. Look forward to hearing your thoughts on where they are and what you think we should be focusing on :thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 16:02:59 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 20:37:07 GMT):<br/>
@markparz is there a running jira for "getting started"
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 20:37:25 GMT):<br/>
i think i found a typo in install and configure
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 20:38:09 GMT):<br/>
i'm working through this now again fresh
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 20:38:12 GMT):<br/>
I don't think there is, however @nickgaski is working on some updates... so we need to create one for sure
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 20:38:35 GMT):<br/>

Hi All, is there already a JIRA item to cover changes in the documentation? I found inconsistencies here and there and I would like to fix them. Thanks :)
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 11:16:24 GMT):<br/>
Hi @nickgaski, shall we coordinate in some way to update the documentation? There are so many things missing. Like: 1) which are the permissions needed to perform a certain operation, 2) which are the protobuf messages exchanged and the meaning of the fields, and so on

 let me open a new getting started JIRA ticket.  @adc - thanks angelo; we definitely need to document the certificates and permissions.  I worked with Jeff Garratt for a while yesterday and have a much better understanding of where and when the admin certs are used and so on.  However we definitely need your expertise on that.  Protobuffers are a little low level in the code for me.  Shall I open a few JIRA issues and we can coordinate?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 13:20:19 GMT):<br/>
I have a suggestion..  why don't we create separate jira items for separate areas of the doc.  i.e https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4237?jql=project%20%3D%20FAB%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20component%20%3D%20fabric-docs%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20Documentation%20ORDER%20BY%20issuetype%20DESC%2C%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 13:20:48 GMT):<br/>
this one seems to be created for "Getting Started" and "Channel Configuration".   So i can add to this my comments about "Getting Started"
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 13:21:34 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski I am happy to help with the writing, but i think we need someone to coordinate the writing.   so feel free to toss some 'writing' or 'editing' back my way
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 13:32:20 GMT):<br/>
@bobbiejc - thanks for all the feedback.  I think at this point we need to determine what we can realistically accomplish by the end of June, make the necessary JIRA tickets, and then begin soliciting help for the super technical stuff.  I'm going to open a few additional tickets today for stuff that is still missing and/or inadequate 
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 13:32:54 GMT):<br/>
and thanks for offering to help; I always need help
</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 13:38:11 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 13:59:38 GMT):<br/>
and then from there, if there is a place where you can't address in depth to extent you would want, create a new jira iem

</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 16:35:10 GMT):<br/>
@markparz you mentioned creating an epic on jira for some of these doc items. I was going to go ahead and create a jira for writing this "writing your first blockchain app" first draft and assign it to myself, but I'll hold off if you want to fold that into a larger effort
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 17:01:39 GMT):<br/>
I'm wondering if that should be an epic.... then subtask with persona write up, basic network start up, application writing, CC writing
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 17:01:42 GMT):<br/>
that was my thought
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 17:01:55 GMT):<br/>
Lucie could grab the persona piece
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 17:02:08 GMT):<br/>
while Nick or work the network piece a
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 17:02:27 GMT):<br/>
or others... 
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 17:02:30 GMT):<br/>
just my thought
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 21:46:35 GMT):<br/>
ok all, go read this page:  https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-app-dev-env-setup.html

<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 21:46:50 GMT):<br/>
excellent job describing hyperledger-fabric and network topology...
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 21:47:01 GMT):<br/>
good basic understanding -- would be a good pre-read to 'getting started'
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 00:27:24 GMT):<br/>
@joe-alewine @markparz guys, it REALLY DOES NOT MATTER if it is an epic or a sub-task - just create it, assign it and do it.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 00:27:37 GMT):<br/>
you can always change the type of issue it is
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 00:29:57 GMT):<br/>
Just suggested to and will open epic since several folks are taking pieces no biggie we are working our tails off on all this
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 18:21:56 GMT):<br/>
@markparz I was thinking about 'getting started' after reading the blurb i posted above from the sdk, and I think it would be really beneficial to make that first introduction *significantly* simpler
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 18:22:33 GMT):<br/>
you don't need 2 peers per organizations, and 2 organizations in a consortium with an orderer.... why not the bare minimum to get started writing some chaincode and seeing how it all fits together
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 18:23:07 GMT):<br/>
so 1 peer, 1 orderer.  then expand to 2 peers and 1 orderer at the end.
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 18:23:59 GMT):<br/>
because the changing of the environment variables is a pain, and then the logic for doing that in the script has 4 peers, 0,1,2,3, but those then toggle between organizations -- which is fine, but really not necessary for me to kick the tires...
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 18:24:04 GMT):<br/>
(the first time)
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 18:24:11 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski 
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 18:24:29 GMT):<br/>
and I think the very next thing I wanted to do was modify the chaincode... 
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 18:24:40 GMT):<br/>
and finally, call that from some 'hello world nodejs application'
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Sat, 03 Jun 2017 18:25:22 GMT):<br/>
I want to do this within the span of an afternoon..; 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 11:09:43 GMT):<br/>
@bobbiejc @markparz @odowdaibm Bobbie, that's what we're doing for the "writing your first blockchain app" which is the new getting started for Ade (app developer persona)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 11:10:31 GMT):<br/>
There will be a separate GS for the operator persona that will be more complex and closer to the current e2e_cli example, I suspect
</p>

@nickgaski it's in the Blockchain explorer documentation and used to be in the Composer docs (not sure if it still is). It's a Fabric Docs link that's why I thought this was the appropriate place to complain :) Thanks!

hi @odowdaibm just want to let you know that for the node SDK documentation I'm building a list of short, focused tutorials (as any good library or SDK would have). it'll be using the balance-transfer sample web app as the reference to tell the story and to use it to tease out the code snippets accompanying the texts in each tutorial

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 19:35:09 GMT):<br/>
it's basically circling around the capabilities of the SDK, so it's quite different than the "Build Your First Application" content that you guys are working on (which by the way I think is sourly needed so nice work getting that going!)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 19:35:38 GMT):<br/>
but still want to make sure you guys are aware of this since they may be some small overlap
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 19:40:29 GMT):<br/>
and of course as I mentioned to you before, I'd be happy to contribute to the BYFA effort as needed

@jim, why would your samples/GS be different? We should have one seamless set of docs

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 02:30:36 GMT):<br/>
@cbf the node.js community are used to seeing "prettyfied" doc pages like https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io, so we'll have to have a really strong reason to jettison that for the drab RTD pages
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 03:51:14 GMT):<br/>
as for the content of the tutorials and why two separate samples: the "BYFA" content is focused on having lowest possible obstacle to entry, while the node SDK's series of tutorials need to be comprehensive in describing to developers how to use all the features. the balance-transfer sample is designed to be a web applications (but with UI, only REST APIs) to act as a repertoire of code samples for writing node.js based web apps using the node SDK, which is mostly what developers are doing. it's inherently more complex than "Your First Application"

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 10:25:18 GMT):<br/>
@cbf @jimthematrix :

1) We definitely should be sharing the same fabric configurations where possible
2) I agree with Jim - we cannot use RTD for the Node SDK docs - I thought we covered this several months back

for the tutorials? I can certainly understand the API docs being jsdoc but why the tutorial?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 10:26:29 GMT):<br/>
ah - yeah - agreed

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 10:26:33 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 10:27:09 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 10:27:15 GMT):<br/>
we also need the javadoc hosted, but that can be fornext week's release
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 10:27:26 GMT):<br/>
I guess we'll need to think about on it as we progress post beta
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 10:27:28 GMT):<br/>
yes, but Jim is working on separate tutorials
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 10:27:37 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 10:27:47 GMT):<br/>
they should be consistent

<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 12:54:35 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix I'd be in favour of something a bit more like jekyll which would allow this kind of approach.  RTD is ok for now, while we get content right, but it's not that pretty
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 12:55:03 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger Composer use it, and it's pretty nice
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 12:55:32 GMT):<br/>
it is a little more markdown biased though, and I know that might be a source of frustration for some.  Personally, I like markdown
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 12:56:56 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm that will need to be a post 1.0 thought, though I really think that RTD is fine and we need to stop churn that doesn't add value

Hello, all. An initial draft of Writing Your First Application has been written and put up in staging and on gerrit. 

Here it is staged so people can look at it (note: images are temporary, also this version does not reflect most recent version or changes): http://fabricstaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html

In gerrit (this version reflects changes/patch sets): https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10231/

If you look at the staged version and want to make comments, please take a look at gerrit to make sure your comments have not been addressed
</p>

<p><strong>seanbarclay</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:40:39 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 - can you provide context on your comment above:

_2) I agree with Jim - we cannot use RTD for the Node SDK docs - I thought we covered this several months back - but we should link to the SDK docs_

is that because it's using JSDOCS? 
</p>
<p><strong>seanbarclay</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:41:07 GMT):<br/>
using JSDOCS with the Node SDK docs
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:41:37 GMT):<br/>
@seanbarclay  - this is sexy:    https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/
</p>
<p><strong>seanbarclay</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:41:53 GMT):<br/>
totes
</p>
<p><strong>seanbarclay</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:42:24 GMT):<br/>
yeah i thought they were using jsdocs to compile and render
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:42:49 GMT):<br/>
and yeah - it uses jsdoc and I tried 15 plugins to render to RST for Sphinx and they were all terrible
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:43:21 GMT):<br/>
jsdoc to markdown is OK - but the default jsdoc templates are much better looking and more usable
</p>
<p><strong>seanbarclay</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:43:38 GMT):<br/>
right- that would be my suggestion- use MD
</p>
<p><strong>seanbarclay</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:43:52 GMT):<br/>
i played with that for the composer gang a while back
</p>
<p><strong>seanbarclay</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:43:57 GMT):<br/>
https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/jsdoc/index.html
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:44:39 GMT):<br/>
I think we should keep using gitpages and jsdoc  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:45:01 GMT):<br/>
We should likely do something similar for the Javadoc as well
</p>
<p><strong>seanbarclay</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:45:04 GMT):<br/>
long as we can find the goods- i'm good
</p>

Indeed

@gkd720 Some images had to be scrubbed because they ended up being IBM specific images and therefore not appropriate for Hyperledger documentation. There are new images being created as we speak for a number of documents-in-progress

Hey guys
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:43:39 GMT):<br/>
Is there a way to peg documentation to release versions? 
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:44:15 GMT):<br/>
Right now under readthedocs there is latest and 0.6.  Any way to have versions for alpha2/beta/beta2 (if that comes out)?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:44:28 GMT):<br/>
yes, when we cut a branch for 1.0.0 we will in
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:44:28 GMT):<br/>
yes, when we cut a branch for 1.0.0 we will pin
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:44:55 GMT):<br/>
so until 1.0.0 comes out, the docs are going to just be a moving target?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:45:24 GMT):<br/>
if the docs were more stable/complete that might make sense but we are rapidly evolving the getting started and writing first app experience and that is all for the latest release
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:45:53 GMT):<br/>
Example code etc wasn't working until I upgraded to beta today.  So it just feels like I was wasting time because the sdk docs were tracking beta, but the infra stuff was all pegged to alpha2
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:46:16 GMT):<br/>
yes, to be clear, nothing will change except to make it more relevant and consistent with beta
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:46:35 GMT):<br/>
there are no more code changes but bug fixes until post 1.0 so it isn't exactly a moving target
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:47:06 GMT):<br/>
Ran into the same issue, posted in fabric-sdk-node. Example code was not working with 1.0-alpha2 but now works with 1.0-beta, been working with the example code for the past few days but beta was released today
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:47:15 GMT):<br/>
that was point in time because we found a last minute bug in the docs and the sdk published first
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:47:28 GMT):<br/>
are all the docs and example code up to date with the beta now?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:47:36 GMT):<br/>
yes, they should be
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:48:09 GMT):<br/>
though there may be some pockets of inconsistency we may have missed
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:48:15 GMT):<br/>
Would it be terrible to tag the current docs as beta, just so people can reference it and know it works (assuming latest docs will change etc)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:49:09 GMT):<br/>
if you want to have alpha2 docs, you can pull the code from GH and build the locally by checking out the tag you want and then cd docs/ and make html
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:49:52 GMT):<br/>
I don't need the alpha2 docs, its just for some level of consistency.  But if the docs are up to date for beta, its all good for me
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 21:44:09 GMT):<br/>
TBH, the docs weren't supposed to be updated before the release - someone pushed a merge prematurely
</p>

I went through the steps manually a few days ago, and that worked without incident, so that's still an option for playing with this stuff. And the "./network_setup.sh down" worked too.

I've been going through the documentation, and things are starting to clear up, so I couldn't wait to go through the "Best Practices" (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices.html). But it's not there yet. Is there any ETA? And would this be the document that would describe a typical sequence to plan out and develop an application, decide how many clients, peers, orderers, etc. there should be, what machines they should run on (I'm assuming the demo in "getting started" having all functions in a Docker container is just an easy way to exhibit functionality?), etc? Thanks.

<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:36:56 GMT):<br/>
hi @gkd720 there are a couple of items that would be awesome to have you look at. First is extremely early start of a doc, that is networking planning... and operational considerations. We might thrash and split into other docs... https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8593/10/docs/source/planning_guide.rst 
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:37:19 GMT):<br/>
The second is https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10231/13/docs/source/write_first_app.rst regarding app development... writing my first application
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:37:49 GMT):<br/>
these are  in gerrit and feel free to add any comments in the review or post here with me and @joe-alewine noted
</p>
<p><strong>gkd720</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 18:11:07 GMT):<br/>
@markparz Thanks. Yes, those documents are more of what I had in mind to learn from. They're already sparking more questions. Should I ask them here as they come up, group into a list of questions, ask in the "general" channel? I might consider trying to set up a network/application on my own from what I know from the "Getting started" documentation, as I would expect this to generate a (probably huge) list of questions. 
</p>
<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 18:51:17 GMT):<br/>
you can ask them here, and as they become bigger doc issues we can open jira items

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sun, 18 Jun 2017 02:11:40 GMT):<br/>
and I have also submitted the following CR that adds setup for the basic network that the app will use (well, assuming we agree to adopt it) https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10743/
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sun, 18 Jun 2017 02:13:12 GMT):<br/>
this CR basically refactors Matt White's basic network setup for Composer (as used in the WYFA) but a) adds it to Fabric and b) simplifies it considerably (the Composer setup is unnecessarily complexified by virtue of trying to work for different versions of Fabric)

I don't know why it says "Cannot Merge", though this version is obviously not getting merged so I'm not sure it matters.

+1 for using SO so it's easier to search, we have so many questions that get asked over and over again in the channels. so we should basically start redirecting folks to SO if they ask technical questions on the channel?

wrt to peer to peer communication, CA info is referenced from the channel specific configuration (i.e. the MSPConfig structure)

Hi there -- whoever is in charge of http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io -- could you please add version info to the generated docs, as well as time and date generated?  Ideally the version would be something like v1.0.0-beta or v1.0.0-rc1, and would be specify the git commit it came from (or git tag, which hopefully would be the same as the version name).  The time and date that the docs were generated would also be useful.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 21:13:57 GMT):<br/>
"latest" is not terribly helpful, especially if there's no indication of the time/date it was generated :)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 22:20:59 GMT):<br/>
@vdods - funny you should mention that.  You'll notice that there are now 3 versions of the docs:

- latest
- master
- 1.0.0-beta
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 22:21:07 GMT):<br/>
latest = master

<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 22:27:10 GMT):<br/>

A common theme in my experience with the many components of HLF is that there is very little indication of the larger context -- it's sort of assumed that the reader already knows the larger context, but that's not necessarily true for an outsider or newcomer.  An example is that I didn't know about the "version" capability of readthedocs.org.  Another example is what the return values of ChaincodeStubInterface methods that return byte[] are -- how to interpret them -- what format, how to use them, and how to learn more about the relevant concepts (e.g. x509 certs).

Hello!
I am studying e2e_cli example and I possibly have found two inaccuracies in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/end-to-end.rst
1. *Create channel* section. Seems like value of flag *--cafile* -`/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/cacerts/ca.example.com-cert.pem` is not more valid. According to `script.sh` it should be `/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem`
Also in all other commands, where is used `--cafile` should be changed value.
2. *peer chaincode instantiate* section. According to *help* of this command, flag `-p /path/to/chaincode` is not more supported (this is very logical, as we provide name of chaincode). After removing this flag, everything perfectly works.

If I am right, I can do pull request by myself, and it will be just merged.
p.s. Thanks for such detailed and well written documentation!!!

Hi everyone...Just wanted to give my feedback about the documentation. I find some of the topic like membership services, orderer little confusing. A good visual diagram would be useful.

@nehalshah50 thanks... it would help if you could provide specific feedback in the form of a JIRA report  (s) seeking improvement. Specifically, it would help if you could elaborate a bit on what is confusing about these topics

Let me ask about prerequisites for Writing Your First Application.
When executing "npm install" to set up fabric-sdk-node, I got an error message like "Error: Can't find Python executable "python", you can set the PYTHON env variable.".
After installing python 2.7, "npm install" finished successfully.
Does anyone have the same problem? If anyone has the same problem, I will submit an issue to JIRA to add "python 2.7" to prerequisites.

There is no proper documentation in terms of what one should do when they have to create their own network with their own specifications
And how to connect to it using the SDKs
The only thing explained properly is how to set up the examples already coded

hey all, noticed an issue on https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/FabricCAClient.html#register__anchor, it lists the arguments as `register(enrollmentID, enrollmentSecret, role, affiliation, maxEnrollments, attrs, signingIdentity)`, but when looking at the SDK and the actual `FabricCaClientImpl.js` its documented as:

```
	 * Register the member and return an enrollment secret.
	 * @param {Object} req Registration request with the following fields:
	 * <br> - enrollmentID {string}. ID which will be used for enrollment
	 * <br> - enrollmentSecret {string}. Optional enrollment secret to set for the registered user.
	 *   If not provided, the server will generate one.
	 * <br> - role {string}. An arbitrary string representing a role value for the user
	 * <br> - affiliation {string}. Affiliation with which this user will be associated, like a company or an organization
	 * <br> - maxEnrollments {number}. The maximum number of times this user will be permitted to enroll
	 * <br> - attrs {{@link KeyValueAttribute}[]}. Array of key/value attributes to assign to the user.
	 * @param registrar {User}. The identity of the registrar (i.e. who is performing the registration)
	 * @returns {Promise} The enrollment secret to use when this user enrolls

Hi, Do anyone have any documentations related to multi host networking between hyper-ledger peers ? if so can someone share that doc? As I tried with docker swarm and other stuff where it throws alot of errors or the peers don't communicate with each other. 
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=bp47Bj4RnT6uzHqkM) @ersudiplama we've done this a bunch. I think you make a good point that we haven't got a specific documentation section that describes how to do this
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:29:23 GMT):<br/>
@cbf Thank you for mentioning that. We have achieved the multi host networking between peers residing at different physical machines using docker swarm but we are not sure that as the best option or not.  
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:29:55 GMT):<br/>
While trying to get multi host networking between peers, we had a lot of unknown errors ( unknown to us) but when we used new images of fabric, it worked well ( with some error for some time). So if anyone have some documentation which explains about options and standards which we can follow for achieving that. Then it would add great value in creating distribute blockchian network between peers residing at different servers or physical machine.
Thank you in advance

FYI - hi Anthony we took your advice to visualize the first app UI for users. I have created a Jira ticket for gathering comments/feedback from you and Joe before going any further: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5302
there’s a pdf attached to this ticket.
You can also see a prototype in invision and leave comment there as well: https://ibm.invisionapp.com/share/CMCJJ7HZP
This is still an early stage of the UI/wires, there are some phrases may need your help to modify properly. Thank you. @joe-alewine  @odowdaibm  ^^

Hi Everyone, The first-network sample in Fabric example creates user User1 and Admin. I wanted to understand how to use these users from Nodejs application. It creates keystore, signercerts,admincerts and cacerts. How should we use these certs to login to the network to invoke or execute the query. In the wallet folder for fabcar, we have three files but here we have the keystore which is priv key and signercerts is the public key, how should we create the other file (like PeerAdmin in fabcar/cred) or do we need that file for the Nodejs application.

 http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4noah.html Documentation explains that other owners will have to sign the package using the command peer chaincode signpackage ccpack.out signedccpack.out. The documentation does not explain where they should run this command and what environment variables we have to setup before execute the command. How does the peer command know which certificates to use to sign the package. It does not provide details on how to use the signed package file signedccpack.out in later steps. If you look at the instructions for installing or instantiating the chaincode, I don't see any references to the signedccpack.out file.

Hi @DarshanBc - please make sure you install the node modules (i.e. run `npm install`) from directly within the /fabcar sub-directory.  Also please check that you have python 2.7 installed on your machine.  We see incompatibility with 3.x versions.  Get rid of your node modules (`rm -rf node_modules`), make sure you revert the python version and then try installing again.  Feel free to direct message me and I will help you sort

@subbu165 FWIW, you can build a release-specific version of the docs by cloning the repo, checking out the release and running `make html` in the docs directory

http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fabric-FAQ.html?highlight=Security  For the question how I ensure data privacy ? In the response, it mentions you can set visibility settings. Can you please explain whether it is really supported in v1.0 and also how to set this settings and what is the API for it. Do we have any sample programs to play with the settings.  "Second, within a channel you can restrict the input data to chaincode to the set of endorsers only, by using visibility settings. The visibility setting will determine whether input and output chaincode data is included in the submitted transaction, versus just output data. "
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 03:18:02 GMT):<br/>
It would helpful to have document that explains the production/security considerations when implementing the network on premise. 
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 03:24:42 GMT):<br/>
For example: Data in-transit is not encrypted via TLS by default, we will have to enable it for all the peers and orderers. So I would assume that for production environment, you will have to enable it. On the main page we example hyperledger fabric is enterprise ready network security but we don't have any documentation that make the case on how it is enterprise ready. So it would helpful to have a security. 
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 03:26:22 GMT):<br/>
When you search on Security, you find one page on Security Model but it has very limited information. It is difficult to conclude how the security works.

@jimthematrix - let me figure out who owns the build.  It's as simple as just deleting the project from RTD, but we need to hone in on the creator.  
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 18:55:51 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix IMO, we really should align tooling and use RTD
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 18:57:21 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 13:37:28 GMT):<br/>
@cbf that's the current setup already, hosted off of github.io and linked from RTD. I don't see a benefit to host the website on nexus, we would need 1) web server to serve up the HTML, 2) CI integration so pushing commits to the repo would automatically trigger the update to the web site. github.io provides both for free
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 14:11:09 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix no, I think you misunderstand. I think that we should use a consistent approach for our documentation. That means for fabric using RST and RTD for tutorials and other prose, and linking to  language specific API documentation (jsdoc, javadoc, godoc, etc) from that
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 14:11:22 GMT):<br/>
I don't think that we should be using a different scheme
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 14:11:56 GMT):<br/>
because we will soon be translating and we cannot be all over the map with how we deliver docs so that the translation process can be consistently applied across projects
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 14:12:03 GMT):<br/>
and also so that the release process is consistent
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 14:13:15 GMT):<br/>
this also makes it easier for people to engage in helping to write the documentation without having to use different skills/tools across the various repos
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 18:00:16 GMT):<br/>
@cbf ah ok that makes sense, we have one prose (intro page) and one tutorial so far (creating channel), both specific to node.js SDK, that we can move out of jsdoc into RST/RTD, we should move them out of fabric-sdk-node and into fabric/docs

What is the progress to upgrade from Fabric v1.0 to v1.1. Will the Fabric v1.1 documentation provide guidance how to upgrade Fabric network. What is the sequence to upgrade ? 1) Should we stop the container for the Orderer first and restart the container with v1.1 image and use the same MSP configuration.

Hi, There is a project on github aiming to do code analysis. Knowing code's function is very important for developers outside of the Fabric team. So why not the Fabric team give some documents describing the function of the code in more details? Thank you.

<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 20:48:42 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski great question. so, this is more for the community, but I'm thinking of doing a gap analysis document on our CI pipeline
</p>
<p><strong>jtclark</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 20:50:09 GMT):<br/>
something that documents in a high-level document what the bugs are, where the bottlenecks are, and the process. this could be an evolving document that explores what we've fixed (after fixes have been implemented)... just to give contributors a way of understanding the current state of CI in HL.

@gauthampamu - that would be a good JIRA to open.  I like to think we have what you're after, but it's somewhat scattered across the fabric/examples and SDK repos.  Take a quick look here - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release/examples/configtxupdate and here - https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-channel-create.html.  Seems as if we need to aggregate a bit of info and provide some better tutorials.  This would make for a good video in my opinion

In FAQ of the document how to I ensure the data privacy has this answer

```
within a channel you can restrict the input data to chaincode to the set of endorsers only, by using visibility settings. The visibility setting will determine whether input and output chaincode data is included in the submitted transaction, versus just output data. 
```

Can somebody explain this

Hi, while going thru byfn, (following the Hyperledger fabric documentation), and creating a channel request, I got the following error:
</p>
<p><strong>Sanjay_Nishank</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 10:02:30 GMT):<br/>
Error: Error connecting to orderer.example.com:7050 due to open ./crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem: no such file or directory
</p>
<p><strong>Sanjay_Nishank</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 10:03:12 GMT):<br/>
Is there any problem with the .pem file? should I point to any other location? Does someone here have any suggestion on this?

<p><strong>Sanjay_Nishank</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 10:05:01 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 15:25:47 GMT):<br/>
@Sanjay_Nishank - the error is suggestive of a failure to properly mount the certificate libraries on your peer.  Are you running on windows?

ok, weird it should definitely work then.  send me a direct message and I'll help you sort

<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 18:08:18 GMT):<br/>
I have question on transaction lifecycle. Documentation says peer verifies when transaction proposal are sent to the peer. I have a question on this last verification 4....   How does the peer verify the operation performed on the channel ensures it has the permission to  write to channel...   Endorsing peers verify signature & execute the transaction
The endorsing peers verify (1) that the transaction proposal is well formed, (2) it has not been submitted already in the past (replay-attack protection), (3) the signature is valid (using MSP), and (4) that the submitter (Client A, in the example) is properly authorized to perform the proposed operation on that channel (namely, each endorsing peer ensures that the submitter satisfies the channel’s Writers policy). https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/txflow.html
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 18:09:23 GMT):<br/>
Let says you submit transaction to peer X for channel B and Peer x has not joined the channel, where does the transaction fail. Will it fail during endorsement or will it fail when it submit the responses from the peers to the orderer.

<p><strong>markparz</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 17:28:01 GMT):<br/>
Hi ya everyone.... based off previous conversations, I here are a few focus areas for v1.1 in regards to documentation.... In addition to the new features of course, more context needs to be added here:
1- Policies - at the multiple levels
2- Adding a peer / org
3- Adding fab CA & connect to LDAP
4- Adding ordering nodes
5- Revamp of the Glossary 

I think we'd be hard pressed to contain all this, but I suggest we make a run at 1,2 & 5 to start. @joe-alewine  is starting 1 and @nickgaski is working on 2.... I believe there are Jira items open on all already, but we need to double check... lots of jira clean up that needs to happen.

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 17:16:26 GMT):<br/>
@albe-rosado questions like this are better suited for #fabric in the future.

couchdb is a state database, all of the transactions are still stored on the ledger. for example, say i have ItemA that I want to commit to the ledger. i submit my invoke to the chaincode, the transaction flow commits successfully, and now the ledger is aware of the existence of ItemA. when i query for ItemA, i will get its latest state from couchdb. 

now lets say my chaincode has a function that allows me to delete ItemA and i invoke that function. the next time i query for ItemA, i will get an error telling me that it is not found. that is because the key pointing to the state of ItemA has been deleted from couchdb.

the ledger still has the history of ItemA's existence and all changes to it state (and queries if you decide to create blocks on query) are still stored on the ledger, including the fact that there was a request to delete it. 

ItemA is removed from the current state of the ledger (couchdb), but the fact that at one point it existed is still stored (ledger)

Posting here per @dave.enyeart  
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 15:37:47 GMT):<br/>
Is it safe to assume that for Fabric we have not published any docs which are only applicable to  v1.1 ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 15:43:14 GMT):<br/>
I think this is what we'll need to do:

- hold off on merging any 1.1 specific doc

- need to update the docs in the release branch.  since we really only publish from master today, I've been a bit lazy about updating release branch with docs.  I'll create a JIRA to take care of this

- organize the RTD version scheme to work the way we want (I'm on it)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 16:06:32 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 It appears that readthedocs 'latest' is coming from 'master' branch. The content in readthedocs 'stable' appears to be from 1.0 timeframe so I can only assume that is coming from 'release' branch.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 16:06:56 GMT):<br/>
There hasn't been much 1.1 content going to doc yet, but there are some examples such as attribute based access control: http://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html#attribute-based-access-control
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 16:15:12 GMT):<br/>
Right - I'm going to need to handle the fabric-ca docs as well 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 16:15:31 GMT):<br/>
I'm on it - since it's easier to do at the same time as figuring it out  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 20:11:38 GMT):<br/>
right, the docs should be release branch and we should have a staging publication of the master branch docs for preview
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 20:12:13 GMT):<br/>
we should definitely NOT be holding docs back
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 20:12:24 GMT):<br/>
if anything, we need docs to be merged with the code
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 20:45:39 GMT):<br/>
I just need the 1.1 docs held back so that I can properly update release to be in sync with master.  after that, we'll be all good
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 20:45:47 GMT):<br/>
Right now, we have a bit of a mess
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 20:46:48 GMT):<br/>
On the other hand, there have not been a ton of doc updates either  ;)

@mastersingh24 @nickgaski  Are the gates open now for 1.1 doc to go into fabric master?  I assume any changes will go into readthedocs 'latest' but not readthedocs 'stable'?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sun, 15 Oct 2017 13:05:19 GMT):<br/>
I ask because @jimthematrix has a change ready: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/14479/
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 12:26:52 GMT):<br/>
Yep - we are good to go.  If people can make sure to mark in the JIRA that it's a new 1.1 doc versus a fix to a doc (by indicating 1.1 and 1.0.4) that would be great
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 13:17:59 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Can you provide some more guidance on the workflow, i.e. should new 1.1 doc be delivered to master (which goes to rtd 'latest') and doc fixes be delivered to both master (rtd 'latest') and release (rtd 'stable')?  Or will the person cutting 3rd digit releases automatically copy master changes to release branch?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:28:32 GMT):<br/>
It's easiest if you push fixes to both master and release, but definitely push to master and make sure to tag the JIRA so that as part of a fix pack release we can pick up any doc fixes

One of the answers says that `BAD_REQUEST` may be returned from `peer channel create` if the submitter does not have channel creation rights (admin authority for an org).

Hey all, been trying to run the fabric-ca by creating the binary (as per https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html)
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 16:51:26 GMT):<br/>
In this documentation it states that the minimum version of golang required is 1.9, but using go get downloads from the 'release branch' (which is set as the default on git), which requires 1.7 in order to build.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 16:58:12 GMT):<br/>
@Asara you are looking at a readthedocs 'latest' link.  This is for new 1.1 content (uses golang 1.9).   For the release branch of 1.0.x (uses golang 1.7), you want the 'stable' docs from readthedocs.
</p>

@philviana is this a problem in the doc or the script itself? The reason I'm asking, I'm wondering if we need to fix a code issue in the script, or if this is something to be updated in the doc itself. We've been doing FAQ type of things and issues in stack overflow. I will ask @nickgaski tomorrow as well, as I'm not sure which example this is.... Great catch either way!

<p><strong>philviana</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 14:15:28 GMT):<br/>
@markparz It's a problem in the docs. The scripts works fine when invoked by the other scripts, but fails when the manual steps are run because the documentation wasn't explicit about commenting out the line that invokes the script. I connected with @nickgaski yesterday on this. Thanks!

@here - new content has been merged in the BYFN section that enables node.js chaincode.  You will find this content on the `latest` branch of docs, which is the default view when you visit ReadTheDocs.  Here's the caveat... you must build your Fabric images from the master branch in order for this new functionality to work.  If you are operating against the `stable` documentation branch then everything will work as described.  We are working to flip flop the initial doc view to the `stable` branch.  Feel free to message this channel or DM me if you need help running the node chaincode.  Happy Friday

@nickgaski  -  I actually just changed RTD in terms of which versions we publish and which is the default:

1) We now publish:
- release  - this is the release branch
- v1.0.3 - this is the v1.0.3 tag
- master - master branch
- latest - points to master

2) The default is "release"

We cannot use "stable" because stable will always point to the latest tagged release

@mastersingh24 I like the new RTD structure, this will enable for example having a 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 version of the docs. I didn't realize it could be based on a tag.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 14:53:37 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 14:58:39 GMT):<br/>
we could make sure that we tag the api's and tutorials wth a version number ? 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 14:59:24 GMT):<br/>
that would be the fallback, let's see if the infrastructure might offer anything
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:38:02 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  - unfortunately (or maybe fortunately ;) ) Git Pages is pretty simplistic - i.e. it only publishes from the master branch.
So I think we just need to take a simplistic approach in the repo (  https://github.com/fabric-sdk-node/fabric-sdk-node.github.io )
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:39:04 GMT):<br/>
We can just create a simple structure:
index.html - list available versions with links
v1.0.x  - push 1.0.x docs to this folder
v1.1.x  - push 1.1.x docs to this folder
;)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:41:38 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 I assume v1.1.x docs be a superset of v1.0.x (rather than a delta) right? 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:43:24 GMT):<br/>
Basically, we build the full set of docs for every release and they each go in their own folder.  So each version folder is completely self-contained
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:43:33 GMT):<br/>
So I guess the answer is "yes"  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:43:46 GMT):<br/>
ok, that's a lot of baggage to keep in master over time, but i guess it is what it is
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:44:14 GMT):<br/>
We use a separate repo for the docs anyway
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:45:52 GMT):<br/>
would this apply for all the doc tabs? Modules, Classes, Tutorials, Global?

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:46:32 GMT):<br/>
@bretharrison using inline tags to differentiate may not always work, and it requires a lot of diligence/discipline. i think doing the publish to separate folders as Gari suggested sounds like the best option

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:46:42 GMT):<br/>
Think of it this way - we'll have a landing page which allows you to select the SDK version you want and then takes you to the full doc set for that version
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:50:26 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart @mastersingh24 do either of you want to open an improvement for this? we can then fill in the details with sub tasks (code, and CI work)

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:51:18 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix  - sure - makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:57:58 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix @bretharrison I imagine it will take some time to get the doc fixed up... in the interim for the connection profile tutorial, could you simply indicate at the top that it requires 1.1? So that we can merge it and point people to it for 1.1 preview?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 16:04:21 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  - of course I am an optimist, but this could be done in less than an hour manually  ;)

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 16:05:11 GMT):<br/>

How Consensus Algorithm is involved in Hyperledger Fabric ?
What's the scope of it ?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 13:31:29 GMT):<br/>
@UtkarshSingh - http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/fabric_model.html#consensus .  Consensus in Fabric v1.x is not confined to a specific algorithm.  Rather, it encompasses the complete lifecycle of a transaction: proposal -> endorsement -> ordering -> validation.  The current default for the ordering implementation is a kafka zookeeper ensemble.  This is really just a messaging queue that orders transactions on a per channel basis.  
</p>
<p><strong>meridian</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 14:10:45 GMT):<br/>
quick question- is there any plan on making "swappable" the DB embedded in fabric? So if i wanted to switch from LevelDB to lets say LMDB I could? 
</p>
<p><strong>meridian</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 14:14:39 GMT):<br/>
obvious it would need porting to Go
</p>
<p><strong>meridian</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 14:14:50 GMT):<br/>
guess i answered my own question lol
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 18:21:56 GMT):<br/>
@meridian : DB is already swappable to CouchDB. I assume you could have a look at the source code to see how that is done if you want to do the same does leveldb. 
</p>
<p><strong>meridian</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 18:22:44 GMT):<br/>

I changed very little in the code - mostly removed comments.
</p>
<p><strong>philviana</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 21:45:39 GMT):<br/>
My code is behaving similarly to sacc except when I try to query.
</p>
<p><strong>philviana</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 21:46:53 GMT):<br/>
I always get "Asset not found". I'd like to know why for sure, but the error brings me to a different question: is there a way for me to navigate the transactions and look at the merkle tree from the CLI? For example, that would help me determine whether PutState is failing or GetState

<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 10:16:12 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski As, other consensus algorithms like, Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, are computationally secure algorithms (that's the backbone of security of those system architectures, even if any peer cheats). How, Hyperledger Fabric's consensus works to provide that security.
1. Is it efficient, as compared to Proof of Work & Proof of Stake ?
2. Is it also vulnerable to "51% attack" ?
3. What if the endorsers and validators cheat ??

One extra question I wanna ask :-
1. Hyperledger Fabric is using Gossip Dissemination Protocol, is it the backbone of its Consensus algorithm ?
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 10:18:43 GMT):<br/>
@philviana you need to use "chaincode upgrade" command for it. Try this http://hyperledger-fabric-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4noah.html#upgrade

@UtkarshSingh The plan is for Fabric to eventually use some sort of PBFT (there's an outline proposal here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.06921.pdf), but for now the protection against "cheaters" is the fact that the network is permissioned. Let's say you're throwing a party. If there's going to be a ton of people you don't know, you might very well lock certain doors and put certain things away. But if it's just you and some friends, you probably wouldn't. That's the concept here. As networks scale eventually you will need PBFT to prevent against bad actors or peers that get hacked into. For now, the transaction flow itself -- as well as the assumption that you will only be inviting organizations that you trust into the network -- *is* the fault tolerant mechanism.

<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 10:59:09 GMT):<br/>
You must have noticed that chaincode is a program written in GO language,
You can modify it in two way :
1. In Dynamically changing the chaincode, use upgrade command
 2. If you wanna restart the everything, better make changes directly to the chaincodes in GO lang, and install the upgraded files to every peer

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=wAdpbBtcHxmrXpYh4)  @joe-alewine hey, I got this, regarding consensus of Hyperledger Fabric:

Hyperledger Fabric provides three ordering mechanisms: SOLO, Kafka, and Simplified Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT), the latter of which has not yet been implemented in Fabric v1.0.

SOLO is the Hyperledger Fabric ordering mechanism most typically used by developers experimenting with Hyperledger Fabric networks.SOLO involves a single ordering node.

Kafka is the Hyperledger Fabric ordering mechanism that is recommended for production use. This ordering mechanism utilizes Apache Kafka, an open source stream processing platform that provides a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. In this case, the data consists of endorsed transactions and RW sets. The Kafka mechanism provides a crash fault-tolerant solution to ordering.

SBFT stands for Simplified Byzantine Fault Tolerance. This ordering mechanism is both crash fault-tolerant and byzantine fault-tolerant, meaning that it can reach agreement even in the presence of malicious or faulty nodes. The Hyperledger Fabric community has not yet implemented this mechanism, but it is on their roadmap.
These three ordering mechanisms provide alternate methodologies for agreeing on the order of transactions.

Hope it will help you. Read in edX, official course provided by the Hyperledger team.
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:45:09 GMT):<br/>
For all the beginners out there, like me. I would strongly recommend you all to go through a course, titled,   Blockchain for Business - An Introduction to Hyperledger Technologies, on edX
It will help you in building and visualizing the concepts.

I somehow get confused on how to use hyperledger fabric in real world application
for example, I want to apply permissioned blockchian in my institute having 100 users. Do I need to make 100 peers ?
Or, I can make 5 peers, give 20 users per peer ?

<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 14:53:18 GMT):<br/>
@UtkarshSingh - the peer has a direct correlation to a CA or intermediate CA that is defined in the scope of the network or in the scope of an application channel.  You can use this CA to generate enrollment certificates for users to access peers and the channels the Org belongs to 
</p>
<p><strong>MuhammadSalah</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 19:11:40 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski can you please do a sample for interacting with CA?
Issuing certs, and managing them to access peers, and invoke a chaincode?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=xnFytRExnf9mC9Wpa) @nickgaski Can I give privileges to some users ?
For example, 2 are Admin, they have access of different chaincodes. Whereas, peers may have some chaincode installed in it. whose access should only be given to Admin only
Since, as you said, any user can have access to any peers. So, How can I restrict other users (non-admin) to not use those chaincodes(meant only for admin)?

@UtkarshSingh - you can implement attribute based access control, such that a specific attribute in a user's enrollment certificate allows them call certain functions within a chaincode.  The CA admin or registrar for the organization can register individual users with various attributes.  Each organization will have a peer admin user, and it's this certificate that must be passed in order to perform peer-specific operations (install, instantiate, join).

@here just wanted to draw everyone attention to the work being done under the title FabricTOC at this repo: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC

This work has been the subject of the regular Friday Documentation Workgroup calls -- and has been mentioned in the hyperledger fabric mailing list -- but it's important for us to get as much feedback as possible. To allow collaboration easier than can be done in the main repo, this work is being maintained primarily by @odowdaibm and myself. Anyone who wants to make an edit can make one and then submit it to be merged by Anthony or myself. 

To get an idea where we're going with this, you can see the WIP TOC here: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/AdminGuide/AdminGuide.md

And these are the two docs we've gotten farthest down the line. Here's one on Identity and MSPs: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/AdminGuide/KeyConcepts/IdentityandMembership/IdentityandMembership.md

And here's a more general intro doc: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/AdminGuide/KeyConcepts/Network/Network.md

Much of our focus right now is on Peers, which can be found here: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/AdminGuide/KeyConcepts/Peers/Peers.md

As I said, we welcome all comments and suggestions!

@paul.sitoh In general, the folders under "core" designate the configuration and management of components at an internal level. So in the case of core/peer, this is the lower level organization of the peer process, for example "peer node start". It's also where the peer channels are maintained. 

The higher level folders -- for example, that top level "peer" folder -- are about the entry points to the peer (as in "peer chaincode" and "peer node").

@here just wanted to draw everyone's attention once again to the work being done under the title "FabricTOC" at this repo: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC

This work has been the subject of the regular Friday Documentation Workgroup calls -- and has been mentioned in the hyperledger fabric mailing list -- but it's important for us to get as much feedback as possible from as many people as possible. To allow collaboration easier than can be done in the main repo, this work is being maintained primarily by @odowdaibm and myself with the current plan to merge docs over as they are completed. Anyone who wants to make an edit can make one in the FabricTOC repo and then submit a pull request for Anthony and myself to review.

To get an idea where we're going with this, you can see the WIP TOC here (with proposals on where and how to include the documentation that currently resides in read the docs): https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/Guide/Guide.md

And these are the two docs we've gotten farthest down the line. Here's one on Identity and MSPs: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/Guide/KeyConcepts/IdentityandMembership/IdentityandMembership.md

A version of this is currently in review to fold into read the docs: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/15933/

And here's a more general intro doc: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/Guide/KeyConcepts/Network/Network.md

Much of our focus right now is on Peers, which can be found here: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/Guide/KeyConcepts/Peers/Peers.md

As I said, we welcome all comments and suggestions about this TOC and any of the documents within in (whatever their stage of development). Healthy debate is important and nothing has been set in stone. For example, it has been proposed to move the docs back to markdown after several months of them being in rst. @cbf has offered to take that task on, but even if you can automate much of that process there's always a lot of cleanup to do.  

And of course if you see a topic or a doc you want to contribute to, we welcome that too!

hi, how to edit crypto config yaml file to generate crypto for four organization and also wants to change the name of organization from org1 to something else i.e instead of org1 I would like to have name like 'Unisef' and also wants to change domain from example.com to "KPLO.com" .so, Is it possible to do this in hyperledger 1.0 ??? because when I tried doing this changes , during user enroll i'm getting error : unable to fine the keyvaulestore. and when I'll again change the organization name to default i.e just 'org1' and domain to 'example.com'. Then everything works fine..? So what I'm trying to do is that thing is possible or not??? I want my network peer should look like Unisef.KPLO.com instead of org1.example.com?? Pls help?? Where I'll get documentation for this . In official documents They have not explained about this things.

@rjones This repo was setup to allow easier collaboration on the creation and staging of documentation that will be moved into the hyperledger docs. It is not a new repo for docs in themselves, and anything written in FabricTOC will still be subject to community approval to get into the official docs. 

This is obviously not an ideal setup, but reflects the realities of how difficult it is to collaborate in the current structure. Fwiw, @odowdaibm and I have been working in this repo with the knowledge and approval of @tkuhrt

Hi.  Just curious do minor doc updates go through Gerrit/Jira?  I added the DCO (failed first as I did n't do it) but unclear if its passed now.  Can a GH pro double check if this is good or not?  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/90 (can't tell if DCO error is resolved or still happening as there are no timestamps to compare on the history there)
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 29 Dec 2017 14:38:49 GMT):<br/>
@ronald.petty : documentation changes should be made through a pull request through Gerrit. It will require a Jira bug. See https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/Gerrit/changes.html and https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/Gerrit/gerrit.html

Hi. I am running a Hyperledger instance in Bluemix and I instantiated the `fabcar` example on my channel. I am pretty sure I was able to enroll the admin user and create the new `user1` user (respectively, `enrollAdmin.js` and `registerUser.js` files in fabcar), but I get the error below when I try to invoke the chaincode:

```[phil@oc4270681710 fabcar]$ node  invoke.js 
/home/phil/go_workspace/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/fabcar/node_modules/fabric-client/lib/Remote.js:146
				throw new Error('PEM encoded certificate is required.');
				^

Any idea why this happens? I found a developerWorks question that points to needing fabric-ca to be running locally (which is obviously not the case...)
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 01:07:31 GMT):<br/>
@philviana - this is actually a good one to debug.  Did you send the enroll call to your CA on the IBM Bluemix Service?  If so, and the certs were returned to the local `hfc-key-store` then this should still function as expected.  Let's go through it tomorrow?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 01:08:52 GMT):<br/>
obviously it will fail if you're using locally generated x509 certificates from the containers in the docker compose 
</p>

<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 01:10:08 GMT):<br/>
To expand... you would need to open your service credentials from your IBP instance and replace the CA admin username and password in the fabcar `enrollAdmin.js` program 
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 01:10:50 GMT):<br/>
admin and adminpw won't correspond to your IBP instance.  Let's work one on one through this tomorrow; it's worth making it work because the application code is very simple and consumable

@nickgaski Thanks for your reply. Yes, I'd like to go through it tomorrow. I did enroll to Bluemix and got the user context into the `hfc-key-store` folder. I also replaced the CA admin and password in `enrollAdmin.js`.

I did some more debugging between my message and your reply and I think I may have a lead - let me know if it makes sense: since I'm connecting to Bluemix using gRPCs, when the peer variable is created in `invoke.js` it actually has a null `pem` variable in it. I noticed that the original code uses gRPC and not gRPCs - perhaps the PEM is not needed then?

By looking at the call stack, it seems that invoke.js instantiates a peer with `newPeer(url, opts)` from `Client.js`, not passing an `opts` parameter. It turns out that the `opts` parameter is necessary to read the PEM in `Remote.js`. Since `pem == null` I get the failure. Code from Remote.js:

```    constructor(url, opts) {                                                    
        var pem = null;                                                         
        var ssl_target_name_override = '';                                      
        var default_authority = '';                                             
                                                                                
        if (opts && opts.pem) {                                                 
            pem = opts.pem;                                                     
        }

@nickgaski Thanks for your reply. Yes, I'd like to go through it tomorrow. I did enroll to Bluemix and got the user context into the `hfc-key-store` folder. I also replaced the CA admin and password in `enrollAdmin.js`.

I did some more debugging between my message and your reply and I think I may have a lead - let me know if it makes sense: since I'm connecting to Bluemix using gRPCs, when the peer variable is created in `invoke.js` it actually has a null `pem` variable in it. I noticed that the original code uses gRPC and not gRPCs - perhaps the PEM is not needed then?

By looking at the call stack, it seems that invoke.js instantiates a peer with `newPeer(url, opts)` from `Client.js`, not passing an `opts` parameter. It turns out that the `opts` parameter is necessary to read the PEM in `Remote.js`. Since `pem == null` I get the failure. Code from Remote.js:

```
    constructor(url, opts) {                                                    
        var pem = null;                                                         
        var ssl_target_name_override = '';                                      
        var default_authority = '';                                             
                                                                                
        if (opts && opts.pem) {                                                 
            pem = opts.pem;                                                     
        }
```

@nickgaski Thanks for your reply. Yes, I'd like to go through it tomorrow if you're available :) I did enroll to Bluemix and got the user context into the `hfc-key-store/` folder. I also replaced the CA admin and password in `enrollAdmin.js`.

I did some more debugging between my original message and your reply and I think I may have a lead - let me know if it makes sense: since I'm connecting to Bluemix using gRPCs, when the peer variable is created in `invoke.js` it actually has a null `pem` variable in it (that goes in the constructor). I noticed that the original fabcar code uses gRPC and not gRPCs - perhaps the PEM is not needed then and that's why the original fabcar code doesn't fail with the same message.

By looking at the call stack, it seems that `invoke.js` instantiates a peer with `newPeer(url, opts)` from `Client.js`, not passing an `opts` parameter. It turns out that the `opts` parameter is necessary to read the PEM in `Remote.js`. Since `pem == null` and gRPCs is used (not gRPC) I get the failure. See the code from Remote.js:

```
    constructor(url, opts) {                                                    
        var pem = null;                                                         
        var ssl_target_name_override = '';                                      
        var default_authority = '';                                             
                                                                                
        if (opts && opts.pem) {                                                 
            pem = opts.pem;                                                     
        }
```

So I guess a possible solution is to pass the PEM in the opts of the `fabric_client.newPeer()` call in `invoke.js`.

Looking now. thx
</p>
<p><strong>philviana</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 19:44:14 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski Did some more digging. Something doesn't seem right... Per the instructions, I created the `extractCerts.js` file and ran it. It was able to retrieve the PEM but it stored it as a JSON containing the PEM contents. I expected them certificate to be delimited by `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `END CERTIFICATE` but instead I see this:

```{"pem":"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\nMIIElDCCA3ygAwIBAgIQAf2j ... ... ... ZWVbd4=\r\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\r\n"}```
</p>
<p><strong>philviana</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 20:11:23 GMT):<br/>
Also, on line 95 of `Remote.js` I can see that the `pem` object is correct (same contents as the PEM file), but then on line 146 the pem object is null, meaning the parsing/instantiation of the Endpoint cause the PEM to be lost.

https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/1d3facbfd952bac63db4b44c6c6a649c0d8ac9ab/fabric-client/lib/Remote.js#L95
</p>
<p><strong>philviana</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 20:45:59 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski I realized what was wrong... The PEM was not being passed properly in the orderer instantiation. Thanks for the help! I was able to invoke and query using Bluemix.
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:08:42 GMT):<br/>
@philviana - we should update the devworks article; can you ping one of the authors with your fix.  And are you saying that the transactionProposal to the orderer was not passing the cert properly?
</p>
<p><strong>philviana</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:13:53 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski: About the orderer: I misplaced the addition of the `pem`, so it was a user error. About the update: I'll reach out to them. The current fabcar code no longer has the `var opts = { ... }` structure.

Is there any write-up/documentation that describes the various authorizations that are possible with Fabric? What I mean, is the current documentation is extremely lean on what does using a role of Admin allow you to do and what determines those permissions?
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 15:35:46 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal A doc like that (along with a number of similar conceptual docs) is in the works. We have a CR out for a doc on Identity and Membership that touches on some of that. It hasn't been merged yet but if you want to take a look here's a staged copy: https://github.com/joealewine/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/Guide/KeyConcepts/IdentityandMembership/IdentityandMembership.md

Hi @joe-alewine That's a great document, really well done, but not really what I'm looking for.  I'm more interested in authorization, i.e., who can do what and how is that defined/determined.
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 15:07:01 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal Yeah it sounds like you're looking for a conceptual doc that's more explicitly about policies -- ie, Explicit Policies and Implicit Metapolicies, and also how mod policies work. That's been in the works for a while but we haven't quite gotten there yet. 

We do have a tutorial that touches on how these policies work and can be changed, though (it's an extension of BYFN). http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/channel_update.html

<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 18:48:01 GMT):<br/>
@cbf In the short term I don't there's any big necessity to switch over to markdown wholesale -- we can take that one doc at a time (as we add to or combine docs). 

The bigger need I think is to create a separate repo, and if possible do something you first brought up, which is to move to NACRs in that repo. That's going to be the biggest value add I think. 

Figuring out how to integrate fabric-ca and fabric-sdk is going to take some time. Anthony and I haven't really discussed that as yet, except to observe in passing that the fabric-ca stuff will probably make the most sense in the CA reference section.

@joe-alewine @scottz a few comments and nits on the Couchdb doc at http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/couchdb_as_state_database.html
1. Period missing after "with the index definition formatted in JSON following the CouchDB index JSON syntax
2. “Any index in the chaincode’s META-INF/statedb/couchdb/indexes directory will be packaged up and installed with the chaincode on a peer” ---It is not clear what this sentence tries to convey. Does “with” here means “at the same time”? this sentence seems to indicate that the index is installed on a peer (incorrect) which is clarified in a correct way in next sentence.
3. “... the index will automatically be deployed to the peer’s channel state database” more precisely, it is deployed to the peer’s chaincode-channel state database
4. “For CouchDB installations outside of the docker images supplied with Fabric, the local.ini file must be edited….” it’d be helpful to provide the location of local.ini file.
5. “In fact, there is no guarantee the result set is stable between chaincode execution and commit time for rich queries, ”----this info probably merits a separate “! note” box.

Hi, I guess Fabric Node.js SDK now works with node v7.x, and v6.x is not supported. The reason I think so is that the balance-transfer sample (v1.1.0-alpha) didn't work with node v6.x. If my understanding is correct, could somebody please update the Prerequisites document? http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html#node-js-runtime-and-npm

<p><strong>paul.sitoh</strong> (Fri, 16 Feb 2018 11:48:37 GMT):<br/>
Anyone know where I can get hold of documentation for setting Kafka? Or let me rephrase anyone know where I can get hold of documentation that is slightly more detailed that this http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/kafka.html?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 16 Feb 2018 15:00:27 GMT):<br/>
@paul.sitoh There is a plethora of documentation for Kafka https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/ I especially recommend at a minimum going through https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#quickstart 

There are also many sources of Kafka documentation from assorted service providers, that are all readily found with a standard Google search.

@paul.sitoh The fabric orderer network may simply be seen as a Kafka application.  I think you'll find plenty of documentation for deploying Kafka applications in assorted environments.  The fabric documentation deliberately does not discuss detailed Kafka deployment scenarios, as we could not hope to cover all potential deployment types, and the information would be redundant and difficult to maintain.

@mastersingh24 @cbf I believe you have investigated versioning options in readthedocs.  Could you give a quick summary of what you've learned as good practices?  For example are the rtd versions based strictly on our fabric tags?   That is, does the v1.1.0 rtd docs have to match up exactly with the fabric commit at v1.1.0 tag?  Or could we for example keep improving the v1.1.0 docs after fabric v1.1.0 is tagged and released?  (ignore for now that we may move docs to a separate repository)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 17 Feb 2018 12:16:59 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  @cbf 
With RTD you can use branches and/or tags as your versioning scheme.  And you have the option to specify which branch "latest" should point at.

We currently use a combination of tags and branches ... I think we can eliminate using tags if we do the following:

1) rename "release" branch to "release-1.0.x"
2) create branch "release-1.1.x" for v1.1.x release

only publish docs for the "release-M.M.X" and "master" branches and publish docs for alpha,beta,rc tags if necessary (to ensure that incompatible doc changes in master do not confuse people)

If this scheme were in place now, we'd have:

release-1.0.x
v1.1.0-alpha
master

once we release v.1.1.x, we'd have

release-1.0.x
release-1.1.x
master


</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 17 Feb 2018 12:19:49 GMT):<br/>
ok, so we can continue to improve the 1.1 docs after GA, but it will require dual maintenance on both v1.1 and master branches
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 17 Feb 2018 12:20:59 GMT):<br/>
so use branches primarily, but allow short term tags such as v1.1.0-alpha
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 17 Feb 2018 12:21:12 GMT):<br/>
correct - if we need to make changes to existing docs, they'd need to go to master and release branches
new functions would generally only go to master
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 17 Feb 2018 12:21:43 GMT):<br/>
sounds good to me
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 17 Feb 2018 12:21:58 GMT):<br/>
Yeah - I think that provides the most flexibility to keep rolling updates of docs

@odowdaibm take a look at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/18233/ - Gari mentioned that the fabric-ca team had scripted generation of the command docs. This makes infinite sense as it will be easier to manage as the help text or commands change (e.g. no need to update multiple places)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 01:18:21 GMT):<br/>
I think that what we should do is this, versus hand-crafted docs. What we should do over time (post 1.1) is to update the help text to be as helpful as possible on their own
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 14:56:51 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:00:48 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:06:28 GMT):<br/>
right I here you, and added comments to JIRA. Does this mean that writer now has a more complex update process? To me it seems the challenge is generating contents, not the mechanics of it.

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:19:04 GMT):<br/>
my concern is coherence
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:19:53 GMT):<br/>
over time, I would like to see the process I outlined become pure generated content by incorporating the usage info into the help text.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:20:22 GMT):<br/>
This will also allow us to localize both the help text and the docs consistently
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:21:04 GMT):<br/>
so yes, for a short while a little more complicated (but not really... it took me 5 mins to adapt @jyellick work)

@cbf - we have several different developers trying to complete by end of the weekend.   given the timeline would you be able to do this for different pieces for v1.1 and the team can do this going forward in v1.2
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:54:17 GMT):<br/>
again, I hear you @cbf, but wouldn't coherence come from the JIRAs identifying the changes in concepts, tasks, and reference material that need to be made whenever any feature is added.  Listen, Im not against it, and I think it can have a place, but I think that we need to see how it can work when we have the example text in place

Fabric-ca doc also a detailed section for each command that goes in depth into each command. I think this is what Anthony is trying to do. So , I think there is a place for both what Chris has done and what Anthony's team is documenting. In fabric-ca, script produces two docs (one for client and server) , links to these docs is placed in the readme doc. And the readme doc has sections that use each of these commands (like enrolling a user, revoking a user)

How does it work?
Configtxgen consumes a file - configtx.yaml - that contains the definitions for the sample network. There are three members - one Orderer Org (OrdererOrg) and two Peer Orgs (Org1 & Org2) each managing and maintaining two peer nodes. This file also specifies a consortium - SampleConsortium - consisting of our two Peer Orgs. Pay specific attention to the “Profiles” section at the top of this file. You will notice that we have two unique headers. One for the orderer genesis block - TwoOrgsOrdererGenesis - and one for our channel - TwoOrgsChannel.

These headers are important, as we will pass them in as arguments when we create our artifacts.



This file also contains two additional specifications that are worth noting. Firstly, we specify the anchor peers for each Peer Org (peer0.org1.example.com & peer0.org2.example.com). Secondly, we point to the location of the MSP directory for each member, in turn allowing us to store the root certificates for each Org in the orderer genesis block. This is a critical concept. Now any network entity communicating with the ordering service can have its digital signature verified.

It took me a little while to figure out because it's a bit more difficult when linking to an rst doc in markdown, but I did figure it out eventually. The Identity and Membership docs do it the "wrong" way and when we go back through those after the release I'll fix the links as well

@Nabilel 1 Peers are owned/managed/provisioned by Organizations. You can have as many peers as you want, and you could establish someone as the sole Admin for each peer. What are you trying to achieve?

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:02:25 GMT):<br/>
for publishing documentation on RTD, what we have now is a bit of a mess, and some of the published docs are redundant
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:03:34 GMT):<br/>
it appears that if you are following semantic versioning (we are) then it should be able to automatically pick from the tags the most stable release and publish that as stable (assuming it is an interim release) 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:03:55 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to consider that we use the following doc tags
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:06:10 GMT):<br/>
for each major or minor release and its subsequent patches (a branch) we publish the most recent tag as release-1.0 or release-1.1 etc for the master branch, we should tag stable releases (preview, alpha, rc, etc) and publish these as 'stable' and finally, latest would point to master.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:06:50 GMT):<br/>
so, the 1.0.6 tag would be published as release-1.0
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:07:01 GMT):<br/>
the 1.1.0-rc1 tag as stable
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:07:12 GMT):<br/>
and master as latest
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:07:49 GMT):<br/>
thoughts? @mastersingh24 @dave.enyeart @odowdaibm 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 21:20:48 GMT):<br/>
So the mapping for RTD is either tags or branches ....
So I'd suggest we have the following:

- release-1.0.x - we rename the release branch to this and just publish this branch
- release-1.1.x  - we create this for 1.1.x and publish this branch
- master - we could publish this branch as well

we would make the latest M.M release the default docs


stable / latest can be confusing .... I think just publishing our release branches is perfect as we can then have rolling docs updates per M.M release.
</p>
<p><strong>george19120</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 03:38:18 GMT):<br/>
@joe-alewine the requirement document lists function/stability/performance/. function is what hyperledger fabric can do. for example,it can be used as a distute ledeger to record something.
stability is how many times hyperledger fabric will can not work in a day or month or year. for example,it can not be Consensus.performance is how many transactions hyperledger fabric can do in a typical scene.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=5xvNtvCYhW7D6xkXj) @cbf Thanks! I think we definitely need a per MINOR build, but I don't think PATCH is necessary or desirable!  MAJOR, as you say, is too infrequent.  MINOR means that there's too many docs, but more importantly, MINOR should be semantically the same which implies the same docs. For example, I should just be able to read 1.1 docs and it include 1.1.0, 1.1.1... 1.1.x -- this creates real coherence for users.

<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 06:16:18 GMT):<br/>
I also think that there should be a default -- latest, and should be the highest semantic version available that is stable. i.e. right now it would be 1.0, and become 1.1 as soon as we release 1.1
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 14:01:03 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm I think we are saying the same thing... if you'll revisit, I am suggesting that the RTD tag would be one of 'latest' (master branch), 'release-1.0.x' (latest patch release of 1.0.x series), 'release-1.1.x' (latest patch release for 1.1.x series), and 'stable' (for the latest stable build of the master branch) - there would NOT be a published RTD with a tag of 1.1.3 for instance
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 14:01:29 GMT):<br/>
splendid! @cbf 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 14:01:58 GMT):<br/>
so there wouldn't be docs release when patch was released 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 14:02:36 GMT):<br/>
as for default, I think that should be the release-1.1.x once we have formally released 1.1.0
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 14:02:40 GMT):<br/>
not latest
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 14:02:44 GMT):<br/>

What is the meaning of endorsement in Hyperledger fabric? 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 17:23:16 GMT):<br/>
an endorsed proposal is a transaction proposal that has been simulated by a peer node, and has had it's read/write set signed in the response to the proposer.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 17:27:23 GMT):<br/>
when the client collects sufficient number of endorsed transaction proposal responses, and those responses match (read/write sets) then the lot are bundled up and submitted to the ordering service for inclusion in a block to be broadcast to the peers in the channel. The receiving peer nodes will then validate the transaction against the endorsement policy and if validated, will commit to the ledger and state db. See the transaction flow doc for complete details http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/v1.1.0-rc1/txflow.html

For `fabric` and `fabric-ca`:
- use `master` branch for new 1.2 code, but remember that we will require written motivation and design for anything significant starting in 1.2 (either in Jira Description for small items, or a linked google doc or slides for larger items).
- use `release-1.1` branch for any doc improvements or critical fixes that need to be made prior to 1.1 GA release
- every time you merge something, think about whether it needs to be cherry picked to the other branch, and make sure the Jira Fix Version includes both releases (v1.1 and v1.2 for master).
For the other projects
- there is not much 1.2 activity yet, so we’ll let 1.1 finalize in `master` before creating the release branches.

I’ve updated fabric-ca readthedocs to have `latest` (still points to master), `release-1.0`, `release-1.1`, `v1.1.0-rc1`.
This is consistent with fabric now.
Any fixes to docs in `release-1.0` or `release-1.1` branches will automatically get reflected in rtd.
After we release 1.1, we’ll remove `v1.1.0-rc1` from both fabric and fabric-ca.
Note that fabric also has `master` which is a dup of `latest`.  I’m thinking we could remove `master`.  Most of the links I’ve found point to `latest` rather than `master`.

<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 05:59:51 GMT):<br/>
Once you have these fundamental data (identities and configurations) you can now start creating compoonents, - starting with orderers, and adding peers
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 05:59:56 GMT):<br/>
to build the network
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 06:00:22 GMT):<br/>
the peer command helps you interact with those peers, likewise the orderer command
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 06:00:57 GMT):<br/>
the configtxlator tool allows you to view any configuration, including the initial and any previous

Fianlly, chaintool is a tool that helps you build chaincode (smart contracts) that are deployed to the peers, and accessed via the Fabric SDK API

thanks a lot @odowdaibm 
</p>
<p><strong>Ammu</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 06:28:36 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm what is the use of order, peer, channel ? what it means in practical way?
</p>
<p><strong>eramitg</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:17:11 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for this meeting!!
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:17:17 GMT):<br/>
Thanks !

<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:18:56 GMT):<br/>
@here Excellent call this morning - I've create JIRA https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8914 for us all to start working Orderer concept topic
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:19:53 GMT):<br/>
Thanks to @luo @eramitg @Yogendrasrivastava @tausifbadu for your thoughts, help etc! Please add them to the JIRA

<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:20:09 GMT):<br/>
I will create the skeleton for Orderer concept topic now
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:20:20 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm Do you think something from my article can go into official documentation?
https://www.skcript.com/svr/understanding-hyperledger-fabric-s-architecture/
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:21:51 GMT):<br/>
Hi @varun-raj Would you like to contribute to one of the existing topics?
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:22:04 GMT):<br/>
Sure I'll. 
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:22:22 GMT):<br/>
Mostly I'm trying write articles on the missing guides that people are trying to find
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:22:52 GMT):<br/>
Great, at the moment, we have people working on a n udated ledger topic, and we've juststarted one on orderers, as a result of this morning's emeeting
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:23:06 GMT):<br/>
Like there are no articles on how to use the fabric node SDK and how to handle authentication with JWT etc
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:23:24 GMT):<br/>
So, that's very interesting!
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:23:33 GMT):<br/>
Have you seen this topic? 
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:23:42 GMT):<br/>
Oh that's great :) I'll try to share my contributions on something related to me so that its more precise and proper 
</p>

http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/write_first_app.html
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:23:55 GMT):<br/>
This one? https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8914
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:24:21 GMT):<br/>
I really recommend that you read that topic -- it will show you how to use the Fabric SDK in a very simple way
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:24:44 GMT):<br/>
Cool will check this out
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:25:11 GMT):<br/>
Please do read it, and let me know what you think
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:26:30 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, this looks really good. Now I think we need to write something about how to handle multi user authentication, like wallet based mechanism. 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:26:53 GMT):<br/>
OK, very interesting
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:27:17 GMT):<br/>
If you think about it, this application would normally expose an API to (say) a mobile device
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:27:30 GMT):<br/>
In our production application, we're using JWT tokens and card (inspired from composer) to handle authentication
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:27:47 GMT):<br/>
this app has a certificate that is know to the blockchain network via one of the CA's
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:28:16 GMT):<br/>
I think in your scenari, you've got (maybe) a mobile device with a security token that connects to the fabcar app, and oyu need to authenticate that?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:28:41 GMT):<br/>
right, so you're really interested in how to do identity mapping, authentication etc etc
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:29:34 GMT):<br/>
Or, are you saying that you'd like that app to use different identities?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:29:40 GMT):<br/>
the fabcar one?
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:30:21 GMT):<br/>
Yeah the certificates are stored in the crypto store right. But we cant have it always there due to security issue. Thus we're uploading it when the user logs in and will check it with fabric ca and set the context 
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:30:29 GMT):<br/>
When the user logs out we'll delete the keys 
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:30:44 GMT):<br/>
It's like a Restful API
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:30:56 GMT):<br/>
OK, I see
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:30:57 GMT):<br/>
Each org will have its own api server to access the network 
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:31:08 GMT):<br/>
Not fabcar, our own application 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:31:27 GMT):<br/>
so you want different end users to effectively have a different certificate when they access the ledger via this blockchain App -- the one behind the RESTful API?
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:31:37 GMT):<br/>
Yep 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:31:39 GMT):<br/>
yes, sorry, I meant the moral equvalnet of fabcar
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:31:50 GMT):<br/>
One org will have multiple users to access the network kinds
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:31:58 GMT):<br/>
OK, so do you think you need to do that?
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:32:10 GMT):<br/>
Which you mean?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:32:38 GMT):<br/>
I'm not trying to design your app for you ;) but I think the identities that (say) your mobile users use, is different to your app's identity
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:33:06 GMT):<br/>
If you think about it in terms of trust, then your app provides the trust to those mobile devices
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:33:22 GMT):<br/>
The nodejs client right?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:33:25 GMT):<br/>
and your app is trusted by the blockchain becuase of the certificate it has, and the rights it gets from ythat certificate
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:33:37 GMT):<br/>
yes, the nodejs client that uses the fabric SDK
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:34:01 GMT):<br/>
now your mobile apps that connect to that via REST are probably sending a different kind of securty token
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:34:15 GMT):<br/>
True that. So there is one set of certificates for nodejs client and one for users 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:34:21 GMT):<br/>
it might be a cert, of SAML or user/password etc etc
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:34:28 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=j9ZrSYJB9r9BggpQ5) @odowdaibm Yeah 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:34:30 GMT):<br/>
right one set for the differe users
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:34:58 GMT):<br/>
all your nodejs app really needs to do is be oconfident that the end user is who they say they are, then it can use it's identity to write information to the blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:35:30 GMT):<br/>
and you can do that by authenticating them in your nodejs app using whatever security mechanism
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:36:10 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, thats why we authenticate with the certificates that are generated by Fabric CA for the specific users to validate. 
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:36:32 GMT):<br/>
We dont use username/password to identify the users. Instead we directly use the certificate pair
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:37:08 GMT):<br/>
And almost all our client's organization will set the nodejs client in the intranet thus nothing is exposed to public 
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:37:31 GMT):<br/>
I think it's something similar to how composer does it
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:37:57 GMT):<br/>
Composer has a REST server sample that uses a standard node package to o this
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:38:10 GMT):<br/>
exactly right
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:38:18 GMT):<br/>
I think that's a much better security architecture
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:38:28 GMT):<br/>
and actually simpler too
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:38:30 GMT):<br/>
Yeah
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:38:49 GMT):<br/>
We dont have to store the keys all the time, only when the user is logged in and wants to use the system
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:38:50 GMT):<br/>
I hope that helps.
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:39:09 GMT):<br/>
And if we can store the keys in temp storage like RAM, it'll be much more secured 
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:39:33 GMT):<br/>
I'm exploring the skip persistent part, not sure how it works though
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:39:44 GMT):<br/>
well, you separate the keys, into those used by the end users, and the HLF one used by your nodejs Fabric SDK app, it's much easier
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:39:55 GMT):<br/>
Yes yes
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:39:57 GMT):<br/>
Exactly 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:40:09 GMT):<br/>
good, well good luck with that
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:40:26 GMT):<br/>
I think it wouldbe good to have a small topic on this, in a new section on Writing Applications?
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:40:33 GMT):<br/>
By which we can achieve multi-user and role-based validations as well 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:40:35 GMT):<br/>
we could cover this kind of discussion
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:40:44 GMT):<br/>
exactly, it allows you to d o all that
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:40:50 GMT):<br/>
Yeah make sense :) I'll be happy to do that :D
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:41:01 GMT):<br/>
you can have differnet HLF certs in the node app that are used depending on the end user role
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:41:10 GMT):<br/>
and just do the mapping in the nodejs app
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:41:10 GMT):<br/>
We define the roles in attributes thus we can fetch it from chaincode also 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:41:14 GMT):<br/>
it's much cleaner that way
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:41:18 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:41:32 GMT):<br/>
We can do the mapping with chaincode itself :D
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:41:36 GMT):<br/>
I think this would be an excellent short topic
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:41:40 GMT):<br/>
with CID package of go 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:41:47 GMT):<br/>
well, think carefully about that
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:41:56 GMT):<br/>
Why so?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:41:59 GMT):<br/>
you can do that checking against the roles in the nodejs certs
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:42:22 GMT):<br/>
don't make it relate to those end users
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:42:29 GMT):<br/>
do it based on the roles in the middle tier
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:42:29 GMT):<br/>
But if someone gets access to the nodejs client its easier for that to change it right
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:42:41 GMT):<br/>
exactly, that's all fine
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:42:51 GMT):<br/>
and more over our clients for multiple users from the same org to have different roles
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:43:02 GMT):<br/>
yes, absolutely, introduce different roles
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:43:21 GMT):<br/>
and have different HLF certs for those, that get sleected in the nodejs app accoring to end user roles
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:43:41 GMT):<br/>
you can absolutely encode access logic in the chaincode, just be careful to not make it too brittle
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:43:51 GMT):<br/>
You mean the certs that are used by the applicaiton? 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:43:53 GMT):<br/>
you don't want to be changing the chaincode all the time
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:44:09 GMT):<br/>
it's usually a good idea to keep access control and application logic separate from each other
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:44:13 GMT):<br/>
Oh that's right 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:44:30 GMT):<br/>
no, the certs used by the nodejs app -- those are what you'll refer to in the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:44:42 GMT):<br/>
or rather the roles and other information
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:45:24 GMT):<br/>
but make sure that you don't make that too depend on the on the cert in such a way that if the cert changes you have to update your chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:45:24 GMT):<br/>
but make sure that you don't make that too dependent on the on the cert in such a way that if the cert changes you have to update your chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:45:39 GMT):<br/>
I mean when we register an user we're defining the roles as one of the attributes. If they are about to promoted or depromoted, we give them a different certificate 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:46:02 GMT):<br/>
yes, and in your chaincode, you'll do different things dependent on that
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:46:21 GMT):<br/>
The chaincode just check if the current user is of which role. Thus if they use the new certificate they'll be of different role
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:46:36 GMT):<br/>
just be careful to not have to change the logic if the cert changes, and try to separate logic from access control, as much as you cn
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:46:36 GMT):<br/>
just be careful to not have to change the logic if the cert changes, and try to separate logic from access control, as much as you can
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:46:49 GMT):<br/>
yes, if you're ust role checking that's great!
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:46:52 GMT):<br/>
Cool yeah that make sense 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:46:59 GMT):<br/>
perfect, I think we agree 100%
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:47:00 GMT):<br/>
Yeah yeah only role checking
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:47:08 GMT):<br/>
great, I think you're all good
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:47:19 GMT):<br/>
Let's think about a JIRA and topic on this subject
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:47:27 GMT):<br/>
We need to disable few functions for few roles, thus we check and just throw and error and stop propogating 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:47:29 GMT):<br/>
Do you think it would be helpful?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:47:41 GMT):<br/>
(yes, that's right)
</p>
<p><strong>varun-raj</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:47:42 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I think people are getting stuck at application part a lot
</p>

When looking at the docs under - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/index.html - then certain topics listed under "Welcome..." are repeated again as top-level items below. For example, "Architecture reference" and "command reference". This seems strange, especially since they contain the same material. (but they are not in the same order). Also when I open the first "Architecture..." then its subcategories appear, but the second "Architecture.." below somehow appears opens as well with the categories. This seems strange.  Is this by design? or just an oversight?

@cca88 We have a jira item open for that: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8798

Do you have any suggestion for how to improve this within the context of ReadTheDocs?
</p>
<p><strong>cca88</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 19:59:19 GMT):<br/>
@joe-alewine - I see, the issue has been recognized, thanks. I would simply have the top line (Welcome to...) not open to any subitems, it would only be that one welcome page which includes in its lowest parts the same menu of links again. Nothing would be lost. As it is, the submenu duplication  seems to confuse not only myself, but also the others under FAB8798.
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 22:07:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it is confusing and something we'd like to change. We welcome input from any RTD experts who can help us out (as the new TOC does have advantages we don't want to lose)

The members of the Fabric Documentation WG would appreciate an answer to the following:
Given the following Topology3: 
1.	There are 9 orgs in a specific HLF network, org1 through org9;
2.	There is a consortium c12, covering org1 and org2; 
3.	There is a consortium c34, covering org3 and org4;
4.	There is a consortium C123456 covering consortium c12 and c34 and org 5 and org 6; 
5.	There is a consortium c789 covering org7, org8 and org9; 
6.	There is a consortium c123456789, covering consortium c123456 and consortium C789;
7.	There is a consortium c123456789, covering org1, org2, arg3, org4, org5, org6, org7, org8 and org9.
Which of these 7 facts are out of scope in HLF? Thanks in advance.

Hi. If you're making changes to the documentation, like this: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/19681/ (to choose a recent example) please don't add a link to your staging repo to the commit message. Add it as a comment. Also: [ci-skip] does nothing. Also: All of the docs builds show up on the logs server. For this particular change, it is here: https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-rtd-verify-master/399/html/ this will make it easier for people - you don't need to maintain a distinct RTD repo, for instance.

What do you want to see? What should be higher on the list? What should be lower? What should be on this "top 40" list that currently isn't? What's on the list that shouldn't be?

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 08:27:50 GMT):<br/>
I would recommend to give the extension of the Glossary a high priority. The sooner people apply the same concepts and terms in their communication and the same meaning, the sooner misunderstanding diminishes. I am happy to see that Consortium and Organization have been added and that Ledger has been given a substantial update. I would recommend that we include in the concept definition where applicable a short description of the why for the business. E.g with the current definition of Consortium people may ask the following: if all members of a channel must be in the same consortium and there is no inter-channel communication, make clear why there is the concept of consortium. Furthermore in the discussions in the Fabric-doc WG the assertion was made  by a highly respected member that an organzation may only have a client application, hence no peer and no orderer. This is not consistent with the current definition of Consortium.   
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 08:31:18 GMT):<br/>
Wrt the definition of Ledger. I believe we need more precision. The blockchain component of a ledger is immutable, the world state component is mutable.

<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 14:56:05 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen The idea there is that technically orderers are also organizations (though they're not part of a consortium). But all of the organizations in a channel must be part of a consortium

<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 14:58:38 GMT):<br/>
The problem is that we call orderers "organizations". It would probably be preferable if we didn't do that, but we do
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 14:59:05 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=Wv7bw4PEYvxPrA7sc) @joe-alewine 

I thought that, although all organizations that are to be part of a channel at its creation time must be part of a consortium, one could update an existing channel to add organizations that are not defined to a consortium.   Is my thought correct?
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 16:37:09 GMT):<br/>
@silliman - you're correct.  that's exactly what the adding an org tutorial demonstrates.  The new org - `org3` - has no presence in the system config block, only the channel.

@nickgaski - Hi Nick, thanks for your explanation. I have tried to answer the question, WHY this functionality is in HLF. My assumption is that an org that enters the network via a consortium only needs the permission of that consortium, while a-non-consortium org needs the permission of every consortium. Is that assumption correct?

@jyellick Hi Jason. Thanks for your offer. For the record, I am not the author of the statement "All members of a channel must be in the same consortium." But I am happy that this statement has been made such that we now can find out exactly how the relationship is between channels, organizations and consortia. Let me summarize what I have learned so far: make a clear distinction between the system channel and the application channels. Let me ask the following question: suppose that all organizations and all consortia in a HLF network agree to have one application channel for all peers of all orgs, inside and outside a consortium but of course inside the HLF network, is that permitted?  Any subset of the organizations (inside and outside a consortium in a HLF network) can have a second,separate application channel? A subset of said subset can have a third application channel. You have probably a much better formulation of what that relationship is. I am sure my colleagues in the documentation WG and myself really appreciate your help.  Kind regards  Sjir

@SjirNijssen 
> suppose that all organizations and all consortia in a HLF network agree to have one application channel for all peers of all orgs, inside and outside a consortium but of course inside the HLF network, is that permitted?
A channel could be created by some subset of a consortium, and that channel's membership could be extended to include all other organizations. (Note, this would be a reconfiguration of a channel after its creation).

>  Any subset of the organizations (inside and outside a consortium in a HLF network) can have a second,separate application channel? Any subset of the organizations (inside and outside a consortium in a HLF network) can have a second,separate application channel? A subset of said subset can have a third application channel.
Yes, in a similar fashion to the first, these configurations could be achieved

> You have probably a much better formulation of what that relationship is.

Yes, let me see if I can articulate this concisely.  The orderer system channel defines consortiums  When a channel is created, its initial membership must be only those organizations from within the consortium identified within the channel creation transaction.  Once a channel has been created, the membership of the channel may be changed arbitrarily (to add other orgs from the consortium, or orgs from outside the consortium).  So, initial channel creation restricts the membership to be a subset of a consortium.  After creation, the channel membership may be arbitrary (assuming of course, the initial membership approves the modifications)

@jyellick Thanks Jason. Let me try a set of scenario's to test my understanding of your response. Suppose we set up a new HLF network, called BYSN (Build Your Second Network). BYSN has the following organizations A, B, C, D, E, F and G. C and D are part of consortium CD; E, F and G are part of consortium EFG. I believe that all of the following channels are permitted: 1. Channel CnlA, for all the peers and all client apps of org A. 2. Channel CnlA-1, a channel for only a subset of the peers and client applications of A. 3. Channel CnlA-2, a channel with a subset of the peers and client applications of A, partly overlapping with the elements in CnlA-1 and partly having different elements. 4. Channel CnlAB, for all the peers and all the client applications of A and B. 5. Channel CnlB for all the peers and all the client applications of org B. 6. CnlBC-1 with a subset of the peers and client applications of org B and with a subset of the peers and client applications of org C. 7. CnlBC-2, with a subset of the peers and client application of org B and a subset of the peers and client applications of org C, partly overlapping with elements of CnlBC-1 and partly having elements not being in CnlBC-1. 8. CnlCD, a channel with all the peers and client applications from org C and similar of org D. 9. CnlEF, a channel for all the peers and all the client applications of both org E and org F. 10. CnlEFG with all the peers and client applications of all of org E, F and G. 11. CnlABCDEFG, a channel with all the peers and all the client applications of org A, B, C, D, E, F and G. My preliminary conclusion is that all these channels are permitted. Is that right, and where not, can you please say why not. Thanks for your attention. Sjir

What consortium are A and B a part of?

Also, theoretically, any channel configuration is achievable through reconfiguration.  So it might help to clarify whether you are discussing the channel's initial configuration or some further reconfiguration.

@jyellick Hi Jason, thanks for your answer. If not all of them are possible at creation time, I would propose we document, which are not possible at initial channel creation time and why not, with sufficient examples. I am willing to put in the necessary time, and save your time, if you could direct me to the documents (incl FABs or code) where I can find the rules. Wrt the consortium of A and B, is it a necessity for an organziation to belong to a consortium? Otherwise assume A and B are elements of consortium AB.

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 17:31:43 GMT):<br/>
I agree.  FWIW, a phantom read conflict occurs when the chaincode does a range query whose result changes between execution and commit.  E.g., the chaincode looks for "all people named Rick" then does some write.  At commit time, there is a new person named Rick who would have appeared in the query. This is a phantom read.

@jyellick Hi Jason, interesting phenomenon called phantom. I try to understand why this has another name than a distributed concurrency update problem. Maybe I misunderstand the example: I assume it would be the following: give everybody a raise of 3 % with the name Rick. If the endorser reads 3 different personkeys having as first name Rick and the committer reads 4 with first name Rick, why does this get a special name? 
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 18:03:33 GMT):<br/>

We're attempting to establish a visual vocabulary by adding images we've been using to describe components (or, in some cases, concepts) in the docs to the glossary. We welcome all feedback:

Some of the images could be smaller as they're simple, but others are more complex and need to be large (or somewhat large).

Given the great new Ledger topic I'd like to add World State to the Fabric glossary. I wanted to socialize this proposal to get some feedback 
```Current State
See World state


World State
Also known as “current state”, the world state is a component of the HyperLedger Fabric ledger subsystem which describes the state of the ledger at a given point in time. It is the database of the ledger.  The world state represents the latest values for all keys ever included in its chain transaction log. The world state makes it easy for a program to get the current value of these states, rather than having to calculate them by traversing the entire transaction log.  The world state can change frequently, as states can be created, updated and deleted. Peers commit the latest values to ledger world state for each valid transaction included in a processed block. Chaincode executes transaction proposals against world state data.
```

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 15:57:24 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko Pam, I gladly support this proposal. May I suggest we reconsider a part of it, the statement: The world state can change frequently, as states can be created, updated and deleted. I believe it would be more correct to say the following: The world state can change frequently, to be more precise every time a block is added to the chain with at least one valid update transaction. Regards  Sjir
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 16:24:18 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko I might rephrase to say: 

```Current State
See World state


World State
Also known as the “current state”, the world state represents the latest values for all keys included in its chain transaction log. The world state makes it easy for a program to get the current value of these keys rather than having to calculate them by traversing the entire transaction log. The world state will change every time the value of a key changes (for example, when the ownership of a car -- the "key" -- goes from one person to another -- the "value") or when a new key is added (a car is created). As a result, the world state is critical to a transaction flow, since the current state of a key-value pair must be known before it can be changed. Peers commit the latest values to ledger world state for each valid transaction included in a processed block.
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 16:29:00 GMT):<br/>
@rjones No worries. Rebased: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/19547/
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 17:45:49 GMT):<br/>
@joe-alewine Would it not be more complete to extend the "modify" to cover insert (a new key enters the chain, and this the world state) and delete? Sjir
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 17:48:44 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen I didn't say anything about deleting a key, but I did mention that keys can be inserted when I said `or when a new key is added (a car is created)`. I don't think it's a good idea to cover too much about the nature of key-value pairs or the ways in which they can be modified here -- there's a key-value pair glossary term for that, or at least there should be ;). We just want people to have a good sense of what the world/current state reflects
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 17:55:34 GMT):<br/>
@joe-alewine Indeed, you included the insert. Excuse me for overlooking that.

@varun-raj  May I suggest to take a look at the recently added topic:  http://fabricdocs1.readthedocs.io/en/issue-fab-8689/ledger/ledger.html     Your use of the terms ledger, state data and blockchain is at variance with the use in the HLF documentation recently extended.

<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:06:56 GMT):<br/>
Here is my proposal for the definition of Smart Contract in the Fabric Glossary - feedback/comments are welcome - ```A smart contract represents the business logic agreed to by members of the network which is expressed in the form of chaincode and provides controlled access to the ledger. A Smart contract is invoked by a client application external to the blockchain network when it needs to interact with the ledger.  Smart contract chaincode runs on :ref:`Peer` nodes. ```

<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 15:25:16 GMT):<br/>
@eramitg Hi, right now as far as I can tell, the only information about Fabric protocols is by examining the protobuf definitions provided in the source code.  This makes it really difficult to try and understand the protocols.  Ideally what would be nice is a something that makes it really easy to understand the content of each message type and the effect each message type has.  Something like: https://blockchain-fabric.blogspot.com/2017/04/hyperledger-fabric-v10-block-structure.html  only for protocol messages instead of ledger blocks, and then with an indication of when/why to use a specific message.

Hey all. Today in the #training-and-education-wg call, there were a couple of links shared:
http://fabricdocs1.readthedocs.io/en/issue-fab-8689/ledger/ledger.html
-and-
https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-docs-build-x86_64/223/html/key_concepts.html

It is getting extremely confusing for people to be given access to so many different links that are all different copies of the same thing. Especially since http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ should be the place where we want people to be looking. Is there anyway that we could stage stuff under http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/staging/ or some similar manner so that no matter what people are always ending up at http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 18:21:38 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt the doc staging to the logs server was done to eliminate the need for developers to push unmerged changes to RTD for review. Nobody should be using those for anything other than review - they are ephemeral links. I say this to fill you in on the "why" not to say "this is the one true way"
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 18:22:34 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, @ry. It is getting confusing for people to know where they should look.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 18:25:12 GMT):<br/>
Confusion is understandable. I _feel_ for unmerged changes, the logs server is probably easiest. I'm not sure how we would handle publishing un-merged changes to RTD. I'm sure it could be worked out, if people would rather use RTD.

According to my knowledge, With Fabric CA v1.0.x, you cannot modify attributes.
With Fabric CA v1.1.x (which is currently in release candidate status) you can.

I'm not sure I'm right or not, If you can help me to confirm this thing. It'll be great help for me!

@SjirNijssen I've started writing a tutorial for SideDB and am grappling with the terminology as we speak, so your terminology proposal in the Fabric-scrum channel is very timely. I will be sure to include you in any terminology discussions we have. Nothing cast in stone, but I'd let to set a stake in the ground so we can all proceed forward with start of a unified set of terms

hi, in fabric the term chaincode is used instead of smartcontract. But I think the chaincode can function as a smart contract. However, the example in fabric release document hehaves not like any smartcontract, more like an api. In bitcoin the scripts hehave like a smartconstract. In ethereum, the smart constracts behave like smartcontract. I suggest in fabric document there should be some example chaincodes hehaving more like a smartcontract

What should be the query for fetching whole data of a channel, in couchDB?
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Tue, 05 Jun 2018 13:17:50 GMT):<br/>
@hrt031293 What do you mean, "whole data"? When a peer joins, it will get the ledger --- which includes channel config information --- either from the leading peer in its own organization or from the ordering service on that channel. The peers also communicate with each other via gossip

Here are the peer channel commands: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/commands/peerchannel.html

</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:34:26 GMT):<br/>
@rickr Yep. As things get merged they become available in the `master` or `latest` branch, which will become the `release-1.2` branch when we release
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:35:04 GMT):<br/>
None of the private data docs have been merged yet, but the concept and architecture docs will get merged, at a minimum
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:36:19 GMT):<br/>
Great -- The reason for asking is the SDKs probably want to reference that in their release notes. 
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:39:48 GMT):<br/>
Gotcha, yeah. You'll want to reference the `release-1.2` branch, as that will be stable to that release. So something like:

http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/private-data/private-data.html (for the concept doc)

Hello everyone, when a new organization or rather a peer is added to the channel, who specifies the ledger and which ledger is used for this new peer?

<p><strong>Dark_Knight</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 11:20:45 GMT):<br/>
Hello Everyone,

I was reading the documents for Hyperledger fabric to add a new organization and a peer to the network. I could not get the answer as which peer ledger from the same channel will be used for this new joining peer and where is it specified which ledger to use?

Also, how to make sure that the batching process in Ordering service is deterministic?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:07:11 GMT):<br/>
@Dark_Knight Every peer on a channel maintains the ledger for that channel. These ledgers are all the same. So logically, you can think of there as being a channel ledger, which is maintained by every peer on the channel

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=k2SAuPL2hKG27LKYA) @joe-alewine but when adding a new peer don't we have to specify which ledger peer from the existing ones will be used for the new peer or is it randomly selected(assuming that no peer tampers with the local ledger and it is the same)

<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:13:26 GMT):<br/>
A peer is joined to a channel and that channel has a ledger, so there's no specification needed

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=WsGLQs2GyTjQ5KNZq) @joe-alewine Thanks for your reply. Can I also say then that it is the channel property that does not allow for a peer to tamper with its local ledger (since it will make the channel ledger inconsistent) and hence, same ledger is maintained on all the peers 
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:23:52 GMT):<br/>
@Dark_Knight That's a reasonable way to say it, sure. It is, however, possible to tamper with the ledger. It's just that, because of the way transactions are sequenced (each block contains a hash of the block before it), such tampering is rendered obvious.

As a practical matter, all of the peers on a channel are *ordered* to write certain transactions in a certain order and a certain way on their ledger. That's how consistency is maintained across a channel
</p>

Hey guys, I am new to hyperledger fabric and wanted to know something. Let's say our organization uses hyperledger fabric to develop an application that interacts with other organizations and transactions happen between them using our app. So, my question is, will other organizations dealing with our organization need to install hyperledger fabric on their own network, or will our organization will be making channels and deploying chaincodes on these channels and updating ledgers.

can we say same thing for hyperledger composer
?

@cagdasozt - There's some high level information around assets here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fabric_model.html?highlight=asset to get you started. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 13:23:07 GMT):<br/>
@cagdasozt @pandrejko I would like to add that the concept of state in Fabric is, in my opinion, much broader that only describing the state of monetary assets. For ease of understanding it may be used but Fabric is, happily,  not restricted to monetary assets.

Hi guys, I am investigating how identities work in fabric-ca sample and I have some doubts. in setup-fabric.sh function `registerPeerIdentities` in line 75 users are registered for all peer orgs and when switching to user identity using function `switchToUserIdentity` from env.sh line 263 I see `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/etc/hyperledger/fabric/orgs/$ORG/user`. My question is how user data got there? What distinguished them during registration from admin so they are exactly in that directory? Thanks in advance

I've created https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11461 and indicated what I think needs to be improved.  Please add your thoughts there.  Any chance some progress could be made in v1.3 timeframe?  In the Jira I point to an open stack overflow question that highlights the confusion... I was going to try to answer by pointing to some doc pages but I could not find very direct answers in the docs.

A note from the Read the Docs team: 

```We wanted to make you aware that on Saturday August 18 at approximately 10:00am PDT (1:00pm EDT, 17:00 UTC), Read the Docs will be having a scheduled downtime of approximately 4 hours. During this time, we will be moving our service to our new home on Microsoft Azure.

To ensure the stability and performance of our system, we are performing this upgrade during the weekend which is our period of lowest usage.

During this maintenance window, documentation will still be serving but new documentation builds will not trigger and the Read the Docs dashboard will not be available. New builds and webhooks will begin processing once the maintenance is over.

For more details, see our blog post: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__blog.readthedocs.com_azure-2Dmigration_&d=DwICAA&c=jf_iaSHvJObTbx-siA1ZOg&r=g2TmmAGPlDZEnJj18lhpjA&m=UgRn7TkWbHJG7hu-WPgjGkMtFEp5p6f260wnOsx5Rt4&s=od-YiRJAoGfiAqwQkgTElMUs8In1B1MxraLxV6rj2sM&e=

According to release 1.2 doc, any org admin of the channel can run "peer chaincode instantiate -n sacc -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":["john","0"]}' -P "AND ('Org1.member','Org2.member' ....". However, the fact is that only the admin who package the chaincode can instanticate the chaincode.

Hi expers here, In fabric doc 1.2, when packaging a chaincode, an instantiate policy can be dfined. especailly it is pointed out that instantiation policy can be defined as endorsement policies. Now my question is how to construct a proposal  with an instantiatiion policy that need two signatures? and from the sourcecode analysis, this may be wrong again. only one creator is used in defining instantiation policy.  
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 21:26:52 GMT):<br/>
@qsmen Did you see this information https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endorsement-policies.html?highlight=endorsement%20policy#specifying-endorsement-policies-for-a-chaincode  

```This command deploys chaincode mycc with the policy AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member') which would require that a member of both Org1 and Org2 sign the transaction.```

@pandrejko @joe-alewine I've created a doc task that I think is important, and likely small if we just point to the existing reference info: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11804
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:34:51 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart As I put in the jira, feels like the best place for this would be the Access Control doc https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/access_control.html. Agreed?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 16:25:27 GMT):<br/>
@joe-alewine  That access control topic deals with access to functions on a channel and is more of an administrative thing, therefore that topic makes sense in the operations guide.  The newly proposed topic deals with access control within chaincode logic, in fact at the key/value level, which is a very different thing.  Unfortunately I don't think we have a good topic on chaincode to put this in, beyond the chaincode tutorial https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/chaincode4ade.html.  So perhaps for now mention it in the chaincode tutorial as another set of APIs available to chaincode authors, and link to the client identity library readme similar to how we link to the core chaincode api interface.  And in  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/access_control.html you can simply put a notice that for access control within chaincode, see the chaincode tutorial topic that describes it.

https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ledger/ledger.html#transactions
I'm reading this section , but don't really understand below part,
Can someone explain.
`That’s because each endorsement effectively encodes its organization’s particular transaction response – meaning that there’s no need to include any transaction response that doesn’t match sufficient endorsements as it will be rejected as invalid, and not update the world state.`

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 19:34:34 GMT):<br/>
@Ryan2  - Endorsers each sign the proposal response they send back to the client ... so when the client packages up the transaction to send to the orderer, it only needs to include a single endorsement response and enough endorsements to meet the policy.  An endorsement is really just a signature over the proposal response ... so essentially you end up with the endorsement proposal and enough detached signature (endorsements) to meet the policy.  All peers which endorse will generate identical proposal responses ... therefore it need only be included once in the transaction sent to the orderer.   Endorsements are checked by verifying the signature.  The signature is created by signing the hash of the proposal response.

Hi,
on this document, https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endorsement-policies.html#endorsement-policy-syntax
stated that ` ROLE represents one of the four accepted roles: member, admin, client, and peer.`
`'Org0.admin': any administrator of the Org0 MSP
'Org1.member': any member of the Org1 MSP
'Org1.client': any client of the Org1 MSP
'Org1.peer': any peer of the Org1 MSP`

Can I ask, orderer will be `member` role or `peer` role,
Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 14:18:49 GMT):<br/>
@Ryan2 Orderers are also technically "orgs", so the same rules apply (though they won't have clients or peers --- at least I wouldn't think so!) 
</p>
<p><strong>Ryan2</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 14:35:53 GMT):<br/>
so when I generate crypto material for orderer nodes, I will assign `member` role for those node? is that true (due to you said that orderer doese have clients or peers ?)

@akshay.sood Like in Bitcoin, the real identity of the user is not shared, Idemixgen is used to mask the identity. The proof that will be provided to the peers will only indicate that you are authenticated and you have the required permissions to execute the chaincode. The peer will not be able to determine your personal information like Name, Email, etc. which are present in your identity certificate.
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 20:23:21 GMT):<br/>

I am working on an effort to setup a customized use case that mimics fabric-samples/balance-transfer in release v1.1.0 - that features fabric-ca-server/client with fabric-sdk-node programming model. The sample works great. When I customize the sample with my PoC use case [4 orgs, 4 CAs, 1 orderer with customized crypto and domain names] - all is well and network comes up with with express webserver. However user registration for each org fails and this is because the fabric-ca-client-kv* contents are not created in the root sample folder or their backing storage defined in yaml files for each org [/tmp]. This only happens with customized network and crypto but not our-of-box sample. Sample works even if the fabric-ca-client-kv* contents are deleted and re-run. So do I have to do anything specific that I am not doing - in terms of missed step? We may have an opportunity to improve documentation or do we have a documentation defect here - potentially? Current I am blocked on this issue - how do I get the fabric-ca-client-kv* contents created to succeed with my PoC and what steps do I need to perform? Can you please guide me and tell me if this question needs to be posted elsewhere or an issue created? Thank you

Folks, considering the pivotal role channel configuration plays in the orchestration of a Fabric network, there seemed to be a lack of documentation. The only one is this https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/configtx.html, which is so focused on protobuf which is find for configtx developer. May I suggest that there be a section explaining the overall architecture of a channel, and another section on how it relates to say configtx.yaml, and a section on tools (configtxgen) and maybe the detail source architecture for dev all under one category call channel configuration. Main thing is separate the concerns of operations from developers. 
</p>
<p><strong>paul.sitoh</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 07:48:19 GMT):<br/>
This is especially so if Hyperledger is to start certification and the lack of documentation is going make potential candidates feel that certification process is, too put it crude term, a money making scam rather than a way of certifying knowledge!

@joe-alewine yes but it is unclear to whom the topic is aimed at. Operators or Dev. It talks about protobuf and does operator need to know that?

I think the certification programs are only going to put more pressure on doc teams for better "role-based" navigation of content ( big time ) !

At the moment, to gain any knowledge of Fabric and its supporting tools such as configtxgen, I have to study the source code or run my own smoke tests to get a sense of how it is working.

<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 16:15:24 GMT):<br/>
Given the resources we have (both from the perspective of personnel and RTD), it's simply not practical for us to switch to role-based documentation. We don't have the time to write three or four times as much documentation, nor do we have a way to organize it in the TOC. 

The topics --- especially the newer topics --- are carefully written with a model of progressive disclosure (i.e., more general information first, followed by more granular information). 

The notion that someone would run the source code to figure out what configtxgen does is bizarre to me. There are at least a dozen references to configtxgen and what it does in the documentation.

Fabric uses access control lists (ACLs) to manage access to resources by associating a policy — which specifies a rule that evaluates to true or false, given a set of identities — with the resource. Fabric contains a number of default ACLs. In this document, we’ll talk about how they’re formatted and how the defaults can be overridden.
```

https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/access_control.html
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 16:38:26 GMT):<br/>
We are planning more extensive documentation on policies, but for now this should give you an overview
</p>
<p><strong>paul.sitoh</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 09:15:58 GMT):<br/>
@joe-alewine I guess, this might be a bit complex to explain in your documentation. But it might be useful when explaining ACL to distinguish between ACL as applied to a registered identity token (i.e. keys) that is associalted with an individual or ACL as applied to a peer (i.e. whoever has access to the peer is afforded the ACL and not restricted to individual). 
I don't know about you, ACL is a topic that often generates lots of confusion.

Hi all, I found a mistake in endorsement_policies.rst, and opened a issue to fix it. This is my first time to contribute in Hyperledger, and not familiar with the process. Any one can help me to review? Thank you very much. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-12453
</p>
<p><strong>sheetal-hlf</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 10:44:26 GMT):<br/>
Hi All, in Endorsement policies section(https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endorsement-policies.html), four accepted roles: member, admin, client, and peer; are mentioned.

I have used org "admin" to create channel, install/instantiate smart contract and "member" (dynamically added users via fabric-ca) to endorse the transactions.

Could anyone please explain where and how the "client" and "peer" roles would be used? 
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 15:46:30 GMT):<br/>
The `client` role will often be used by an application (which shouldn't have a member, admin, or peer identity). The `peer` role is used when, for example, the peer signs something (such as an transaction proposal). You don't want your peer admin attaching their signature. You want the peer's signature

</p>
<p><strong>sheetal-hlf</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 10:23:37 GMT):<br/>
the transaction proposal is sent to the targets (peers) by the client which holds the member's identity; hence the member signs the transaction proposal
</p>
<p><strong>sheetal-hlf</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 10:24:17 GMT):<br/>
also we would like to know which member submitted the transaction for say auditing purpose

<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 12:35:05 GMT):<br/>
Any user attaches their signcert to any action (such as endorsing) which can be used to identify them (outside of an Idemix usage, obviously)

Hi, I have a general question about network design. Let's assume that I have one channel with two organisations in it. Is it possible that each of organisations hosts its own orderer?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=RLDWN7hBnuvjoueWP) @joe-alewine Hi @joe-alewine, thanks for response, so if I would have kafka ordering service with 4 orderers they cannot be hosted by diferent organizations?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=ueBy6ZSNiNWJSHHJC) @StefanKosc Currently, the ordering service cluster would be hosted by a single organization. RAFT will bring the capability to distribute the nodes.

@joe-alewine hi, I saw your reponse to my review - thank you for accepting my suggestions - but I'm confused about that one sentence:
We can use the ``queryCar`` transaction to can query against any car, using its key (e.g. ``CAR0``) and get whatever make, model, color, and owner correspond to that car.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Dec 2018 20:11:49 GMT):<br/>
what does it mean to "get [something] correspond to that car"??
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Dec 2018 20:12:18 GMT):<br/>
I must be missing something so I'm sorry I'm being dense but I can't sense of this sentence

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Dec 2018 20:14:18 GMT):<br/>
isn't the intent to say it can be used to retrieve any attribute of the car?

I suppose we could have made that more explicit, but it seemed clear enough 
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Tue, 11 Dec 2018 20:22:13 GMT):<br/>
And with `queryCar` we're only querying a single key, as opposed to `queryAllCars` which queries a range

@joe-alewine @pandrejko - in an effort to refresh my Fabric knowledge, I thought it would fun to run through BYFN manually.  Everything was running smoothly until instantiate.  I kept getting back `proposal responses do not match`.  Good debug there, makes a lot of sense.  But now I'm asking myself, how the heck can they not match.  It's a trivial piece of chaincode using a/b for keys and ints for the value.  The byfn script worked, so what is different here.  Rather than start over I go to query `peer0.org2` and am greeted with ```Error: endorsement failure during query. response: status:500 message:"cannot retrieve package for chaincode mycc/1.0, error open /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/mycc.1.0: no such file or directory"```.   And there's my problem, I never installed the chaincode on the second peer.  My suggestion would be to explicitly inform the user to install the chaincode on the second Org's peer that is specified in the EP, immediately after instantiation, then tell them why.  You do have this sentence ```If you want additional peers to interact with ledger, then you will need to join them to the channel, and install the same name, version and language of the chaincode source onto the appropriate peer’s filesystem``` , but do you really expect a user to interpret that as go export all the env variables for an Org2 peer and then install the cc because we just instantiated with a two party policy.

<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 13 Dec 2018 21:14:30 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Pam.  It would also be good to add some content regarding instantiation and the role of instantiation policies.  My understanding from back in the day was that instantiation followed the same flow as the enumerated endorsement (i.e Org1peer0 & Org2peer0 would each return a proposal response to the client and they would each spin up a cc container if something like `"AND ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer')"` was passed).  This does not appear to be the case anymore bc I only notice a single container starting for the peer bootstrapped in the CLI container

@lightcap  Code commits --- whether more traditional commits or doc commits --- are done through the gerrit review process. A good first step is to check out jira: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13463?jql=project%20%3D%20FAB%20AND%20component%20%3D%20fabric-docs (this is a list of issues opened against the documentation). If you want to make a commit, it should first be tied to a jira issue. 

Then, you'll need to set up gerrit. First, by getting a Linux foundation ID. Then, by setting up your SSH keys. Here's some documentation on the process: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/Gerrit/gerrit.html

Hi all.  I think there may be an error in the install documentation for MacOSX (https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/v0.19/installing/installing-prereqs.html#macos).
It indicates you should install the latest node LTS version (nvm install --lts && nvm use --lts) however this results in Node v10 being installed, which I believe is still unsupported.  The docs *do* indicate you need 8.9 or greater, and that Node 9 is not supported, but I think that creates confusion around the status of v10 (which I believe is still unsupported.)

@silliman @joe-alewine thanks both I had found this in the meantime but I appreciate your response... pardon my ignorance but when developing do you continually build and rebuild the docker images and run a test case or do you have a more effective way of working?

Ran into an issue following the private data tutorial when installing chaincode to the second peer in org1.

*Install chaincode on all peers* task 2 says _Use the CLI to switch the active peer to the second peer in Org1 and install the chaincode. Copy and paste the following entire block of commands into the CLI container and run them._

Using the peer address `export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1.org1.example.com:7051` in the tutorial will result in a connection error, as peer1 is listening on port 8051 not 7051.

Running instead `export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1.org1.example.com:8051` solves the issue.

@calebfroese please can you raise a bug in JIRA and ping me the number? I didn’t spot that I needed to update that tutorial when I changed the ports recently. 
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 12:56:40 GMT):<br/>
@calebfroese nevermind, raised https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14509 :-)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 14:52:04 GMT):<br/>
@sstone1 it's a little tricky... most people will get the latest tagged samples which is v1.4.0, and they will need the already existing doc.  if we merge a doc update in release-1.4 it will show up in the production fabric docs
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 14:54:23 GMT):<br/>
i'm not thinking of a good answer yet... we could roll back the port updates in release-1.4, or mention in the doc different instructions for v1.4.0 vs v1.4.1
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 14:54:42 GMT):<br/>
neither are good options
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 14:54:51 GMT):<br/>
ahh... I see - if you run the `curl` installer, you get the tagged release w/o my changes, if you just clone from GitHub you get the branch w/ my changes
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 14:54:59 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 14:55:48 GMT):<br/>
fabric-samples is versioned to the 3rd digit, while doc is versioned to the 2nd digit
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 14:56:57 GMT):<br/>
ideally we'd version fabric-samples to the 2nd digit and people would grab the latest, we can entertain that...

We are looking to create Ethereum ERC 20 tokens but within HL Fabric runtime. we have found that we need to use fab proxy to connect to Eth VM in HL Fabric env. And that there is a constraint of one user per fab proxy, This is a issue because we need to move tokens between users, and this means that if we need to create 5k users, which also implies that we need to create 5K Fab Proxies. is there any way fab proxy constraint can be managed/eliminated?

The documentation under the Private Data Tutorial section of the docs might need a change.

In the first "Try it yourself" section Step 1 gives the following as a command to install the chaincode sample on some peer from the cli container that is spun up by running the byfn.sh script:

peer chaincode install -n marblesp -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/chaincode/marbles02_private/go/

However, the docker-compose file that is used to spin up the cli container actually mounts the chaincode samples to the 

github.com/chaincode directory in the cli container.

The result is that following the steps in the documentation throws an error:

Error: error getting chaincode code marblesp: path to chaincode does not exist: /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/chaincode/marbles02_private/go

Changing the code snippet to:

peer chaincode install -n marblesp -v 1.0 -p github.com/chaincode/marbles02_private/go/

Should fix the problem.


Totally understand if this is not the place to bring this sort of thing up - happy to redirect the comment elsewhere.

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 14:04:31 GMT):<br/>
we should probably cherry-pick to release-1.4 regardless
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 14:20:07 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart indeed
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 14:21:13 GMT):<br/>
but, the problem comes from looking at the latest readthedocs, when using 1.4, doesn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 14:24:04 GMT):<br/>
yes, I think that's correct: there is no problem if one uses the 1.4 doc with the 1.4 release
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 14:37:55 GMT):<br/>
@lehors So we are ok if using v1.4 docs with v1.4 samples, and using latest docs with master (v2.0) samples?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 14:39:00 GMT):<br/>
I'd rather not cherry pick to release-1.4 then... as the samples go to 3rd digit but the docs only goes to 2nd digit
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 14:40:57 GMT):<br/>
that's correct, I say nothing is broken
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 14:41:31 GMT):<br/>
one simply needs to use the corresponding doc - which is normal

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=PT9LWE8kZPjMzEC36) @lehors sorry - slow off the mark

That's right - thank you

Only thing to add is that some sort of disclaimer on the home page for the /latest/ docs might come in handy.

Currently, it's easy to mistake those pages for documentation about release 1.4: so a banner to direct people to the pages that are actually relevant to the Fabric release they want might - for example - save people from posting similar future messages in this chat.

I've just discovered an issue with the `peer chaincode` command: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/commands/peerchaincode.html
The documentation say we can use `--peerAddresses` for subcommands `install`, `instantiate`, `invoke`, `list`, `query`, `upgrade`.
But in the go code of the peer chaincode command we can see:
```
// currently only support multiple peer addresses for invoke
	if cmdName != "invoke" && len(peerAddresses) > 1 {
		return errors.Errorf("'%s' command can only be executed against one peer. received %d", cmdName, len(peerAddresses))
	}
```
Looks like `--peerAddresses` is only supported for `invoke`.
That's why when I do things like:
`# peer chaincode -C businesschannel list --instantiated --peerAddresses=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 --peerAddresses=peer1.org1.example.com:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles='/etc/hyperledger/fabric/tls/ca.crt'`
I get the error:
`Error: error validating peer connection parameters: 'list' command can only be executed against one peer. received 2`
We should update the documentation for telling uses, it won't work correctly.
</p>
<p><strong>GuillaumeCisco</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 10:56:51 GMT):<br/>
For context, I'm implementing the `list instantiated chaincode` command for the `fabric-sdk-py` and I wonder how I should handle this as I have the possibility to return an error if a chaincode has not been instantiated on a peer

The last link point us to the node sdk tutorial : https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-channel-events.html

Hi, @Silona how can we (the community) help to improve the Fabric and fabric-sdks documentation?. Also I think that is important translate the docs to other languages to increase and improve our community.

Hi, @Silona how can we (the community) help to improve the Fabric documentation?. Also I think that is important translate the docs to other languages to increase and improve our community. Maybe we can work in make the documentation more easy to read, with more updated examples, a better user experience. Keep in touch, thanks in advance.

<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 20:03:52 GMT):<br/>
@mauricio If you are interested in translation, I would encourage you to reach out to @richzhao who is initiating a process for translating Fabric content and community contribution is always welcomed of course. Also if you are interested in improving anything in the docs, see this fabric topic https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html.

There is a Documentation workgroup call that meets weekly on Fridays. There are 2 calls, one for the eastern hemishpere and one for the western hemisphere and they are run bu Anthony O'Dowd. He sends out an email agenda every week to the hyperledger fabric  email list server. You can subscribe here: https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/main

<p><strong>richzhao</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:10:21 GMT):<br/>
@mauricio  thank you for much for your advice.  we have set up a translation tool set,  translating into Chinese is on going.

Working through this document: https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/hyperledger-fabric/latest/hyperledger-fabric.pdf

And on page 110, under 6.4 Smart Contract Processing, it points to "If you'd like, you can download the sample and even run it locally." BUT THE LINKS to both are broken.

"download the sample" points to install.html -- but no domain or other info

and "run it locally" points to tutorial/commercial_paper.html

Can someone *please* point me to the correct URLs so that we can work through these examples? Please?

update the ledger — updating requires the consent of other peers in the network. A peer requires other peers in the network to approve a ledger update before it can be applied to a peer’s local ledger. This process is called consensus, which takes much longer to complete than a simple query.

<p><strong>francisco-rojas</strong> (Sat, 21 Sep 2019 16:51:26 GMT):<br/>
Hello,
My name is Francisco and I started to learn about Blockchain an Hyperledger Fabric recently.
For the last few weeks I've been reading the Hyperledger Fabric Docs and have found a few small inconsistencies.
After reading the Contribution guidelines my understanding is that I should broadcast the doc bugs here. 
So here are a couple inconsistencies I found today while going through the "Writing Your First Application" tutorial (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/write_first_app.html)

1. In the "Enrolling the admin user" section (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/write_first_app.html) there is a note that says: 
"You may find it useful to stream the CA logs when running the upcoming programs by opening a new terminal shell and running docker logs -f ca.example.com"
However, after launching the network with the `./startFabric.sh javascript` command there is no "ca.example.com" container therefore the command fails.
There are, however, two CAs: ca_peerOrg1 and ca_peerOrg2. After checking the source code of enrollAdmin.js I can see that it uses: ca.org1.example.com which corresponds to ca_peerOrg1 according to the first-network/docker-compose-ca.yaml file
So the actual command to inspect the logs is docker logs -f ca_peerOrg1

2. In the "Querying the ledger" section (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/write_first_app.html#querying-the-ledger)
there are some references to the ../../basic-network/connection.json file when in reality the code references ../../first-network/connection-org1.json as you can see in fabcar/javascript/query.js

I am happy to contribute fixes to the docs as I go through them if you would guide me how to.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 13:34:11 GMT):<br/>
@francisco-rojas Thank you for this information! You can start by opening jira issues of type Documentation  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html#reporting-bugs. We are actually in the midst of converting from gerritt to git as we speak. I can give you a link to a video in which the new process was presented and of course we will be udpating the Contributions welcome topic with that information.. Let me get that link for you.  
</p>
<p><strong>francisco-rojas</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 21:37:43 GMT):<br/>

I think [validated ledger](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arch-deep-dive.html#validated-ledger-vledger) docs are outdated due to commit https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric/+/31086 and should removed. wdyt @pandrejko 

(was it ever implemented?)
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 11:42:08 GMT):<br/>
I would agree. Let me look into this.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 12:44:24 GMT):<br/>
@guoger There is a disclaimer at the top of the page. https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arch-deep-dive.html#architecture-origins
The intent of this doc was to capture the original v1.0 design thoughts. 
The recommendation is that from this section we point to the disclaimer as a reminder.  Then, in v2.0 we retire it from master docs, it will be there in the release-1.x branches for posterity. What do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 05:07:03 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko sorry for late reply, i agree! i also saw Dave has proposed the same in #fabric-maintainers as well. thx

Hello guys, I was finding ways to contribute to fabric and found a silly bug in `release1.4` and hence created this: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-17128. The description has the fix, but I wanted to learn also your gerrit workflow. Apparently I found my bug ended up in backlog and from the `jira boards` I see only `v2`. Does that mean we can only contribute to v2.0 ?
</p>
<p><strong>maniankara</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 21:58:14 GMT):<br/>
@cbf and @pandrejko ^^ -> you guys were active in this channel ;)
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 13:03:05 GMT):<br/>
@maniankara Thanks for reporting this bug. release 1.4 is our long term support release so we definitely want to get it fixed there. @joe-alewine is in the process of writing the upgrade instructions for v2 right now so we will definitely evaluate it and can include there if it is applicable as well. 

We welcome community contribution! If you would like to add it release 1.4. Today, the fabric repo is officially moving from Gerritt to GitHub. See https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/CONTRIBUTING.html#

We have a community documentation workgroup call today at 11 am EST where we will be discussing the new github process for contributions https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Documentation+Working+Group

You are welcome to join us or watch the recording. 

If you'd like to try the PR yourself you can - feel free to post here with questions about the process. 

</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 23:51:40 GMT):<br/>
You may have seen Brett Logan's post that the process to submit Documentation (and Fabric) updates has now moved from Gerritt to Github.
- If you are an existing Github user, the process should be very familiar to you.
- If you are new to Github, checkout https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github/github.html to get started.
- If you were used to the Gerritt process and want to see what's different start with the note here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html. I also started a jira to record some of the differences I have noticed https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-17122.

PR reviewers now get automatically assigned when you create the PR. We've experienced some issues with assigning individual reviewers and are currently working through that process. Stay tuned for an update around that.

Issues are still being tracked in JIRA. Nothing has changed there.

We welcome your documentation contributions. Any problems or questions about the new process, feel free to post here.

a small question - in existing docs and new PRs, both single and double backticks are used, however the latter is not necessary in most cases (as we don't have backtick within string to be escaped). why is that? thx

<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 14:37:03 GMT):<br/>
@guoger I checked with our expert @joe-alewine and he confirmed that RST requires double back tics but markdown requires only single back tics. The thinking is that double back tics are required in RST because a single back tics indicates the start of a link. Hope this helps.
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 16:54:44 GMT):<br/>
that does help :) i think we should at least keep consistency for markdowns - use single backtics
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 16:55:07 GMT):<br/>
and my next question would be - are we switching to markdowns?
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 17:45:09 GMT):<br/>
We've left it up to personal preference and have not mandated which format to use. Both are curently supported
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 19:08:25 GMT):<br/>
@guoger Markdown is better in general but RST has its good points. It allows for "note" boxes and is the only file format we currently have that allows for the creation of toc trees (it also does a better job with enumerated lists). 

In general I'd advise people to use markdown, since it's a more ubiquitous format, but if they want to use RST they have my blessing. 

Double backtics in markdown aren't ideal but they do work --- the extra backtics resolve themselves without an issue.

FYI -- found a documentation error in the following -- apologies if this is the wrong chat to post this to:

From here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html

This:

```Because the endorsement policy for the fabcar chaincode requires the transaction to be signed by Org1 and Org2, any chaincode invoke using the peer binaries needs to target both peer0.org1.example.com and peer0.org1.example.com. You can pass the following values to your invoke commands to target both peers:```

should reflect `peer0.org1.example.com` and `peer0.org2.example.com`

The embedded values in the example are correct. Hope this helps.

```Because the endorsement policy for the fabcar chaincode requires the transaction to be signed by Org1 and Org2, any chaincode invoke using the peer binaries needs to target both peer0.org1.example.com and peer0.org1.example.com. You can pass the following values to your invoke commands to target both peers:```

should reflect `peer0.org1.example.com` and `peer0.org2.example.com`

The embedded values in the example are also NOT correct. When passing the code snippet from a terminal command line it throws an error:

` --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles ${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles ${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt`

Hope this helps.

Hi, @dave.enyeart  @rjones as we talked in the meeting just now, I describe the steps how to add the Chinese translations into Fabric official documents in readthedocs here. Thanks very much for your helping.
1.Import a Project: Add repo “https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-docs-cn” to Fabric official document account in readthedocs.
2.Add translations: Choose the project “Hyperledger Fabric Docs Production”, then choose “Admin”- “Translations”- “Project”, choose the translations project added just now (default name is “hyperledger-fabric-cn(Chinese)”), then click “Add”.
3.View docs: Now you can change languages in the Fabric official document show page.

@stone-ch I did that - let me know if I need to do more. I can't get it to show any Chinese, only English versions of text. Do I need to rebuild?
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 18:32:46 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 01:57:24 GMT):<br/>
@rjones  It already has the translation now, one more thing is that you need active "release-1.4" and "release-2.0" version in Chinese project.

posted to questions but should have been posted here...
Running 2.0 and following "Writing Your First Application" e.g, fabcar. All good until:
```
Enrolling the admin user
Note

The following two sections involve communication with the Certificate Authority. You may find it useful to stream the CA logs when running the upcoming programs by opening a new terminal shell and running docker logs -f ca.example.com.

```

There is NO ca.example.com that starts on docker. There are no logs to display. Dashboard shows peers0 & 1 for orgs1 and 2, couchdb's 0-3, orderers (orderer and orderer1-5), and ca_peerOrg1 and ca_peerOrg2.

So what should I be logging ca_peerOrg1 or ca_peerOrg2 or? Thanks

Also, when examining fabcar/javascript/query.js -- the provided files does not parse JSON -- the last two lines are missing from query.js
```The application connects to the network using a gateway:

const gateway = new Gateway();
await gateway.connect(ccp, { wallet, identity: 'user1' });
This code creates a new gateway and then uses it to connect the application to the network. ccp describes the network that the gateway will access with the identity user1 from wallet. See how the ccp has been loaded from ../../first-network/connection.json and parsed as a JSON file:

const ccpPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..', 'first-network', 'connection.json');
const ccpJSON = fs.readFileSync(ccpPath, 'utf8');
const ccp = JSON.parse(ccpJSON);```

Hi all, I have seen that in the latest version of the documentation, in the new section: "_Deploying a production network_" , there is contrary info to the rest of the documentation. 

For example it says: "_Note that for CouchDB in particular it is a best practice to operate your state database external to the peer, as you will be better able to allocate specific resources to the database this way._"

While in the section "_Using CouchDB_ "  for reasons of latency and security the following is mentioned: "_A Docker image of CouchDB is available and we recommend that it be run on the same server as the peer._"

<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:43:59 GMT):<br/>
In a follow on PR I have changed the statement to `Note that for CouchDB in particular it is a best practice to operate your state database external to the peer (for example, in a separate container), as you will be better able to allocate specific resources to the database this way.`   
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 19:02:48 GMT):<br/>
I think it should be better specified that it can be a different container, but that it is best practice to have it on the same server as the peer for less latency, and with every access from outside of the machine closed off (so also without access to the Fauxton interface in production), only the peer container itself should have access to the CouchDB container, nothing else. That is still not clear to me from the PR you proposed. Or what is your point of view about having it on the same machine instance?

Hi All,for decentralized governance for smart contracts in fabric2.0, I want to know how organizations can extend the chaincode for their use cases??
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 17:15:35 GMT):<br/>
@skyliulu As long as the reads and the writes they perfrom are identical, the smart contracts on the  peers can be different. So this mean that one smart contract could be written in Golang while the other can be written in Node.js. @jyellick  Would you care to comment?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 17:31:32 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko In general, we would never encourage smart contracts written in two different languages.  The read and write-sets must match exactly, and getting this to happen consistently across languages would be very challenging to accomplish.  Of course, you _could_, so long as the reads and writes are consistent.

The stronger use cases for 'different' chaincodes are:
1) Simply allowing each organization to perform their own packaging, without having to worry about those "chaincode fingerprint mismatch" errors you might have seen in v1.x.
2) To allow small, backwards compatible changes to be rolled out individually.  For instance, imagine there were a bug in the code which did not check that sufficiently many arguments were supplied before dereferencing them.  This results in a crash if the client makes a mistake.  So, an update could be pushed out to address this bug immediately by one org, and then slowly, over the course of days or weeks by the others.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 17:39:23 GMT):<br/>
As far as use cases for actually having different logic across peers for the same chaincode, this could be done too, though should generally be restricted to decisions about validity.  Something like an additional assertion for which an organization has its own business logic.  For instance, say your org does not want to endorse any transactions over $10 million.  You could of course add this check into the common chaincode "if org == org1 && value > $10 million", or, you could implement it in your own chaincode only.  The latter might make more sense if some of these decisions are private business logic.
</p>

The latter might make more sense if some of these decisions are private business logic (note of course, these additional checks must not perform any additional reads, as this would modify the readset).
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 17:41:57 GMT):<br/>
You could also include custom operational metrics that are interesting to your org only.  Maybe your org is invested in statsd monitoring, while another org is using prometheus.  You might each want to include different instrumentation for monitoring your chaincode.  But, I would generally encourage users to try to keep code the same across all organizations, and only bifurcate it if the need presents itself.

Brett posted in the fabric-maintainers channel but reposting here for broader awareness.  There is now the capability to view the a documentation PR formatted content in ReadTheDocs. We all should be doing local documentation builds to verify content before submitting PRs, but having the ability to see the formatted content for a doc pr in ReadTheDocs can make it easier for reviewers to ensure the formatting and links work.

Hi! I'm reading through the Fabric documentation and finding so minor typos and small fixes that could be made. Do you welcome PRs for such things, or are they normally cleaned up in the next version of the docs? Thanks!

@cryptopatrick We certainly do! You can submit them to the master branch and then we can cherry pick them back to the other branches where applicable. The most important thing is *to not forget to sign your commits*, otherwise we cannot approve and merge your PR. https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs_guide.html

Hello. In the Commercial Paper tutorial, I saw the line `addToWallet.js is the program that Isabella is going to use to load her identity into her wallet,` but didn't see `addToWallet.js` being used. Only `enrollUser.js` is being used which actually `loads the identity into the wallet`

So which is actually doing what? Is this an error in the documentation?

Hi! I was just reading through the fabric 2.2 docs.

IMO -- The name "Membership Service Provider" doesn't clearly explain what it does. especially the 'service' part of the name.  

Could use a bullet list like below to convey what exactly an MSP is used for. At present ,it just seemed to me that as a reader one needs to dig out the true purpose and use of an MSP from the whole text.

- MSP identifies which Root CAs and Intermediate CAs are accepted to define the members of a trust domain by listing the identities of their members, or by identifying which CAs are authorized to issue valid identities for their members.
- Used to assign certain roles to identities. eg. designate ID 1 as org admin, designate ID 2 as peer
- Maintain a list of identities that have been revoked
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:28:34 GMT):<br/>
@clydedacruz We definitely agree that the name is confusing and a poor choice, but I don't think we can rename it now. Agree the clarifications you suggested would help. Which MSP documentation are you referring to specifically -

@cmgabriel  Hello Chris. I heard you are working on the tokens at the Eastern hemisphere documentation WG. I posted a PR to add ERC20 fungible token to fabric-samples. I'm waiting for feedback from the community. If you have some time, could you take a look at this PR?
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/pull/327
</p>
<p><strong>cmgabriel</strong> (Fri, 11 Sep 2020 10:48:20 GMT):<br/>
Sure @yuki-kon, will do.  Also, @dave.enyeart has a UXTO token PR in fabric-samples as well.
</p>
<p><strong>yuki-kon</strong> (Sat, 12 Sep 2020 08:17:14 GMT):<br/>

Hi @yuki-kon, I reviewed and executed your fungible token sample.  Well done!  Thank you for contributing this.  I think there is room to combine this with PR #319 from @dave.enyeart.  I am doing further research, and will provide additional comments in the PR soon.  Thanks again.

Feedback setting up the developer environment for current (latest) release -- readability issues -- https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-setup/devenv.html

Moving from 1.4x to 2.x and trying to document steps for team -- formatting leads the reader to believe that EVERYTHING below Steps -> Developing for Windows is *specifically* for windows only -- and don't believe that was your intent. 

When you pick up with "Before running any git clone commands...." -- is that for windows, mac, linux or ??? 

For Clone the hyperledger source -- do I really need to install the source under a github.com directory or can it go anywhere? And why do you need my userid? Am I not simply dropping this into a folder *somewhere* on my disk? 

etc., etc. -- takeaway is the steps could be clearer by OS -- and they're not. Even if it's repetitive. Thanks in advance.

<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 14:39:37 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick Would you be able to respond to Nik's questions here.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 19:09:51 GMT):<br/>
Raft is a leader based protocol, where a single leader establishes a total order and replicates the data (in our case blocks) out to the followers.  Raft works based on quorum, so, so long as a majority of the Raft nodes are online, the Raft cluster stays available.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 19:10:36 GMT):<br/>
Therefore you have two different competing interests.  On the one hand, the more Raft nodes you have, the more you may lose and still maintain a majority online.  e.g. A 5 node cluster can tolerate 2 nodes down, while a 7 node cluster can tolerate 3 nodes down.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 19:11:51 GMT):<br/>
On the other hand, the more nodes in your cluster, the more followers the leader must replicate blocks to, and the more network overhead there is for the leader to stay in contact with the rest of the cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 19:13:27 GMT):<br/>
Practically, Raft clusters of more than a few dozen nodes begin to see noticeable performance degradation.  Once clusters reach on the order of one hundred nodes, they begin having trouble maintaining quorum.  Of course this is all dependent on the networking, and other resources available, and there are tunables like the tick interval which can be used to mitigate the larger communications overhead.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 19:14:04 GMT):<br/>
Also keep in mind that each channel an orderer participates in is a separate Raft instance, so, an orderer participating in 100 channels is actually doing 100x the work as an orderer in a single channel.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 19:15:32 GMT):<br/>
All this to say, it really depends on your use case, your resources, and your topology.  If you forced me to give concrete guidance, I would generally expect clusters of 3, 5, 7, or 9 nodes, with no more than about 50 channels per orderer.
</p>

Not sure if this is the play to post this, but can someone please just take note that both the 01/10 and the 27/09 hyperledger-fabricdocs Documentation have bad tables in the metrics references. In the 01/10 release, 8.14 Metrics Reference, and in the 27/09 release, 9.11 Metrics Reference, the tables goes off-page to the right. This isn't critical but, would be an improvement to someone else interested in metrics but that does not work with Prometheus/Prometheus style metrics every day. Maybe just use landscape instead of portrait?

Hi All, I am looking for a Hyperledger Fabric System Architecture Diagram thats very similar to the one contributed for Hyperldger Sawtooth. https://www.altoros.com/blog/hyperledgers-sawtooth-lake-bets-on-modular-blockchains-and-elapsed-time-consensus/

A Fabric Documentation Translation Campaign has been started by the Linux Foundation to invite more translators and start the translation of additional languages.

Question for the channel; Currently we have docs meeting (Western Hemisphere) once per week on Fridays.  Are there any objections to moving this to every other week to more align with other meeting cadences?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 16:52:19 GMT):<br/>
@cmgabriel not on my part. I noticed the APAC calls ended, so I think reducing the cadence would make sense.
</p>

Thanks Ry

Does the Fabric Client SDK in Fabric 2.0 handle System Admin Activity like Channel Instantiations, Network bootstrapping etc as well as
the Client Transaction Requests and behind the scenes processing of the Transaction Request.

Is there or are there plans for a Fabric Security Guide?  Something that would cover best practices for privacy and confidentiality?  I ask this primarily due to the recent report of privacy and confidentiality issue with Fabric as posted to hackerone.com.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=TubnGD8y4SMr6s9iH) Is there a link to the actual concern, or are you just advertising?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 16:11:36 GMT):<br/>
@cmgabriel I think the concern is valid; the issues on hackerone pointed out some unclear documentation
</p>
<p><strong>cmgabriel</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 20:02:10 GMT):<br/>
I cannot find the actual article on hackerone because only a general link was provided.  I searched the site and no mention of Fabric that I could find.  What am I missing?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 20:09:27 GMT):<br/>

@toddinpal I apologize for my initial confusion because the link you provided was not to the actual concern raised by the report but to the landing page for hackerone and after performing search on their site could not find any mention of what you were referencing.  @rjones was kind enough to set me on the right path with links to the prior discussion around this.  So first, thank you for raising this and second, we will be making an addition to the docs to address security guidelines in deployment to a production environment.

Hi, 

There's an issue with https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/samples.html#download-platform-specific-binaries

The bash script at https://goo.gl/kFFqh5 mentions https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/hyperledger-fabric/${ARCH}-${VERSION}/hyperledger-fabric-${ARCH}-${VERSION}.tar.gz
But it seems nexus.hyperledger.org is no longer being used. I have no idea where the binaries are located now
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 07 Sep 2021 11:25:35 GMT):<br/>
That page is very old, try referring to this one
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/install.html
</p>
<p><strong>shanedeconinck</strong> (Tue, 07 Sep 2021 11:26:15 GMT):<br/>
Aha thanks, i thought /release would point me to the latest docs
</p>
<p><strong>shanedeconinck</strong> (Tue, 07 Sep 2021 11:40:38 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, was confusing to me that /release didn't point to the latest version
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 07 Sep 2021 16:16:45 GMT):<br/>
yes, we decommissioned nexus four years ago or so

Hi, I reported a issue(https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/2920) and made a pull request (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2921) for that.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 15 Sep 2021 16:47:26 GMT):<br/>
@cmgabriel -- would you be able to help justiny with the process of making an update to the fabric docs?
</p>
<p><strong>justiny</strong> (Thu, 16 Sep 2021 00:19:56 GMT):<br/>
It's already done and merged to master for the pull request for fabric (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2921). There is also a pull request for fabric-docs-i18n (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/pull/551). Is it dealt with in #i18n ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 16 Sep 2021 01:50:57 GMT):<br/>

Hey everyone I am Niku Singh a sophomore from India. I am new here and to the Blockchain world. I was surfing the net and came across Hyperledger and thought could be a part of it. So that I can learn more about its project. Really happy to be here :smile:
</p>
<p><strong>nikusingh</strong> (Mon, 17 Jan 2022 05:55:57 GMT):<br/>
are there any ways I can contribute to the docs, I have Knowledge of MERN stack.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 18 Jan 2022 16:29:32 GMT):<br/>
@nikusingh there is an [i18n project](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n); also, a [samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples) project that might work as well
