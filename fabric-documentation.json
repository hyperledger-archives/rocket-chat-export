{"msg":"thanks @jwolpert what about accessibility to endorsers from a client that sends the initial transaction proposal which needs to get to all/enough endorsers. will the endorsers forward the proposal to the others or how does that work? ","username":"murrekatt","ts":"2017-02-15T13:40:04.013Z"}
{"msg":"@murrekat - the application will hold the endorsement policy, because it will bear responsibility for interpreting the proposal responses which return from the endorsers. As such, at proposal time, it knows which peers to target for endorsement.  If the policy is fulfilled, you forward this \"proposal response\" on to the ordering service.  Then at validation phase, the peers will double check to make sure that a. enough signatures are present & b. these signatures are authentic and arrived from the correct entities.  Then the real magic happens at ledger phase where a versioning check takes place... essentially is the world state (the version of the keys that was used during simulation) still the same?  If so, then the write set is appended and the world state & versions are updated.  Does this help?","username":"nickgaski","ts":"2017-02-15T14:51:06.255Z"}
{"msg":"@nickgaski thanks! yes that helped. I am aware of the flow, just not clear in the docs i have checked have accessible the endorsers are. especially when it might be that the client must use a peer as proxy to reach the orderer(s) i thought it might be the same in case the client just has access to a single endorser. but you mean that a client MUST have access to all endorsers directly?","username":"murrekatt","ts":"2017-02-15T15:18:52.502Z"}
{"msg":"it's a good question.  I believe that the client is able to target all peers for that specific chaincode, and then receive and aggregate back the responses.  Let me give you back a concrete answer for \"does your endorsing peer act as a proxy for proposals and responses?\"  I'm fairly certain the answer is no.  Also, the tx does not pass back through the peers on the way to OS.  The application will parse the responses and then use the SDK to send a grpc call to the Ordering Service with the payload","username":"nickgaski","ts":"2017-02-15T15:32:28.695Z"}

{"msg":"based on this and what you say the clients all have direct access to all (required per endorsement policy) endorsers which might be split off from the committer part of the peers, and the client might or might not have direct access to the orderers so it can thus use and of the endorser peers (assuming just one is picked)","username":"murrekatt","ts":"2017-02-15T15:51:38.482Z"}

{"msg":"no anything with endorser, committer, ordering service is all v1.0 nomenclature.  so yes, it appears you are correct that in certain scenarios if a client does not direct access to an OS, it will broadcast the tx through a peer of its choice who will then forward on to the OS.

{"msg":"1. Navigation panel\nIt is missing a pointer to the Welcome page\nIt's weird that the section headers in green are not clickable\nOverall, I feel like this should map more closely to the pages.\n\n2. Welcome page\nAs Chris said, it reads too much like marketing material.\nI think the paragaphs are too long and this page goes into too many details\nNot every concept needs to be introduced up front. It is better to start with the very basics and let people dig further to find out more details.\nThe sentence \"If you're still reading, you clearly have some knowledge and an interest in distributed ledger technology...\" is very odd. Most people won't fall into that category and yet you would hope they read the whole page (once it is shrunk to a more reasonable size)\n\n3. What's offered\nThis title doesn't ring right. This sounds like a brochure for a product. I'd suggest something like \"What will it take?\" or \"What's in a basic setup?\", something like that.\nI think that instead of referring to the \"SOLO\" Ordering Service which raises the question \"what's that?\" this would read better as \"a basic Ordering Service\" or if you really want to name it: a basic Ordering Service called \"SOLO\".\nKill the second paragraph. This is not the place to explain all this.\n\n4. Getting Setup\nOn Windows if npm install fails due to missing VCBuild.exe, user should do 'npm install --global windows-build-tools' as Administrator as explained in https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools or check https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation for other options\n\nUnfortunately while the above helped me I still haven't managed to get the whole node stuff to work but that's a different story...\n\nCreate the initial channel - this whole section isn't really useful at this point because the reader has already gone through everything and the channel was created. This fails to point out that one would have to reset the whole network then (docker-compose down+up).\n\nTrouble shooting\n\n\"This occurs because you are attempting to create a channel named myc1, and this channel already exists! There are two options. Try issuing the peer channel create command with a different channel name - myc2.\"\n\nThe text after that is essentially a repeat of the CLI section above. Just delete the repeat and change the above with:\n\nTry issuing the peer channel create command with a different channel name - myc2 as described in the CLI section above OR, if you want your channel called - myc1 -, remove your docker containers and then follow the same commands in the Manually create and join peers to a new channel topic.\n\nHelpful Docker tips - I agree with Chris, just put a link to the docker doc\n\n5. Key Concepts\n\nOverview - chaincode links to glossary section instead of the model one\nAssets - \"using the included Fabric Composer tool.\" It is not included. I suggest changing to something like \"using a tool such as Fabric Composer\".\n\nIt seems to me that this section is too detailed at this point in the documentation and it's too much to read if what I want is to get going. I just got my environment set up and the next thing I want to do is to try to modify the example to start doing my own thing. I would expect a section explaining that most of the development will focus on two key areas: chaincode and client side/SDK and how to go at starting to do that.\n\nOnce people get started with that they can then dig up for more information as they try to do more and more complicated stuff.\n","username":"lehors","ts":"2017-03-15T15:54:30.286Z"}

{"msg":"1. MSP (membership service provider) - this is a concept which allows for 2 things:\n- ability to use different types of membership providers. the default (and only one currently implemented) is an X509 provider\n- it allows for \"identities\" to be issued by different providers (e.g. if you have multiple companies participating in the blockchain, each company could manage/provide their own certificate authority for issuing certificates)\n\n2. Based on 1), fabric peers / ordering nodes are not required to obtain their X509 material from fabric-ca but of course we provide fabric-ca for people with their own CAs to use\n\n3. MSPs are used in 2 ways (and I admit this is confusing)\n- \"LocalMSP\" - think of local MSPs as \"structures\" which hold the cryptographic identity information for clients, peers and ordering nodes. They will contain the root CA which issued the identity as well as the signing certificate key pair for the client, peer, orderer. For example, when a peer starts up, it will populate its localMSP from the file artifacts reference in core.yaml and will use this information to actually sign endorsements (among other things)\n\n- \"VerifyingMSPs\" - similar to a \"localMSP\" except they DO NOT contain a signing identity (i.e. no reference to a private key for a signing keypair).\n\n(you'll note that one of the fields of an MSP is actually a revocation list and in the case of X509 provides this will be an X509 CRL\n\n4. When channels are created, you actually specify which organizations are allowed to participate in that channel. Each organization will be associated with an MSP (and it would be a \"verifying\" MSP). When the genesis / config block for a channel is created, it will contain the list of organizations (each of which has its MSP info)\n\n5. When a peer joins a channel, you give it the genesis / config block for the channel. The peer will parse that information and will have a map of channels with one of the properties of each channel being the list of MSPs for the channel\n\n6. So let's say we have a channel (call it channelA) which has 3 orgs - Org1, Org2, Org3. Let's say that chaincode get's deployed with a policy that requires signatures from 2 out of the 3 orgs\n\n7. So a client submits an endorsement proposal to peers from from at least 2 out of the 3 orgs, gots the proposal responses back, creates an transaction and submits it to the ordering service. A couple of things happened along the way:\n\n- each peer has the list of per channel MSPs and will actually check to make sure that the client who submitted the proposal is allowed to do so by verifying the signature of the proposal (the client signed it using its local MSP) and making sure that the client's certificate was issued by an MSP that's associated with the channel (there's more detail to how this works, but should be good enough for now)\n\n- when the client submits the transaction to the orderer, the same basic thing happens - signature is checked and orderer node checks to make sure that the certificate is valid / issue by one of the MSPs for the channel\n\n8. Let's say a Peer is connected to channelA and receives a block of transactions. Let's say it got a block which had the transaction submitted in step 7) above. The peer now needs to make sure that the endorsement policy for the transaction has been met (the endorsement policy is assocaited with the chaincode against which endorsement was requested). From step 6), we said that this requires signatures from 2 out of the 3 orgs and from step 5) the peer knows which orgs (and MSPs) are part of the channel. So the peer can make sure that there are enough valid signatures which meet the policy\n\n9. OK - so finally - let's say that a peer (we'll call it org1Peer1) from Org1 was compromised. For simplicity, let's say that Org1 is only part of channelA. So we need to be able to tell all peers which have joined channelA that the certificate for org1Peer1 has been revoked. All peers need to receive and process this information at the same time (this is to ensure that the committing logic is deterministic). So we need to update the MSP for Org1 and propogate that information to all peers connected to channelA. Recall that one fof the fields for an MSP structure is a revocation list, so what needs to happen is that an update transaction is submitted to the ordering service for channelA which updates Org1's MSP to know have a CRL containing the certificate for org1Peer1","username":"nickgaski","ts":"2017-05-11T13:32:05.982Z"}

{"msg":"@Yuvaraj_Ravi the time taken depends on the settings which affect block 'cutting', and the implementation of the orderer service.  Currently only 'solo' and 'kafka' are available.  Solo is for dev purposes only, so only kafka is recommended for production use.  The latency is highly dependent on a multitude of factors, eg. TX payload size, network latency, etc.  Work is under way to gather performance related information.

It allows one org's peers to become aware of the rest of the channel's peers, thus facilitating gossip.  The notion of leading peer is also gossip related, however it's different.  The leading peer simply receives the blocks from the ordering node and disseminates to the rest of the its org's peers on that channel.

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=wAdpbBtcHxmrXpYh4)  @joe-alewine hey, I got this, regarding consensus of Hyperledger Fabric:\n\nHyperledger Fabric provides three ordering mechanisms: SOLO, Kafka, and Simplified Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT), the latter of which has not yet been implemented in Fabric v1.0.\n\nSOLO is the Hyperledger Fabric ordering mechanism most typically used by developers experimenting with Hyperledger Fabric networks.SOLO involves a single ordering node.\n\nKafka is the Hyperledger Fabric ordering mechanism that is recommended for production use. This ordering mechanism utilizes Apache Kafka, an open source stream processing platform that provides a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. In this case, the data consists of endorsed transactions and RW sets. The Kafka mechanism provides a crash fault-tolerant solution to ordering.\n\nSBFT stands for Simplified Byzantine Fault Tolerance. This ordering mechanism is both crash fault-tolerant and byzantine fault-tolerant, meaning that it can reach agreement even in the presence of malicious or faulty nodes. The Hyperledger Fabric community has not yet implemented this mechanism, but it is on their roadmap.\nThese three ordering mechanisms provide alternate methodologies for agreeing on the order of transactions.\n\nHope it will help you.

Here's one on Identity and MSPs: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/AdminGuide/KeyConcepts/IdentityandMembership/IdentityandMembership.md\n\nAnd here's a more general intro doc: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/AdminGuide/KeyConcepts/Network/Network.md\n\nMuch of our focus right now (other than the work on the imminent alpha release) is on Peers, which can be found here: https://github.com/FabricTOC/FabricTOC/blob/master/docs/AdminGuide/KeyConcepts/Peers/Peers.md\n\nAs I said, we welcome all comments and suggestions.

This file also specifies a consortium - SampleConsortium - consisting of our two Peer Orgs. Pay specific attention to the “Profiles” section at the top of this file. You will notice that we have two unique headers. One for the orderer genesis block - TwoOrgsOrdererGenesis - and one for our channel - TwoOrgsChannel.\n\nThese headers are important, as we will pass them in as arguments when we create our artifacts.\n\n\n\nThis file also contains two additional specifications that are worth noting. Firstly, we specify the anchor peers for each Peer Org (peer0.org1.example.com & peer0.org2.example.com). Secondly, we point to the location of the MSP directory for each member, in turn allowing us to store the root certificates for each Org in the orderer genesis block. This is a critical concept.

{"msg":"all your nodejs app really needs to do is be oconfident that the end user is who they say they are, then it can use it's identity to write information to the blockchain","username":"odowdaibm","ts":"2018-03-16T07:34:58.642Z"}
{"msg":"and you can do that by authenticating them in your nodejs app using whatever security mechanism","username":"odowdaibm","ts":"2018-03-16T07:35:30.050Z"}
{"msg":"Yeah, thats why we authenticate with the certificates that are generated by Fabric CA for the specific users to validate. ","username":"varun-raj","ts":"2018-03-16T07:36:10.378Z"}
{"msg":"We dont use username/password to identify the users. Instead we directly use the certificate pair","username":"varun-raj","ts":"2018-03-16T07:36:32.466Z"}
{"msg":"And almost all our client's organization will set the nodejs client in the intranet thus nothing is exposed to public ","username":"varun-raj","ts":"2018-03-16T07:37:08.721Z"}
{"msg":"I think it's something similar to how composer does it","username":"varun-raj","ts":"2018-03-16T07:37:31.099Z"}
{"msg":"Composer has a REST server sample that uses a standard node package to o this","username":"odowdaibm","ts":"2018-03-16T07:37:57.246Z"}
{"msg":"exactly right","username":"odowdaibm","ts":"2018-03-16T07:38:10.109Z"}
{"msg":"I think that's a much better security architecture","username":"odowdaibm","ts":"2018-03-16T07:38:18.549Z"}
{"msg":"and actually simpler too","username":"odowdaibm","ts":"2018-03-16T07:38:28.090Z"}
{"msg":"Yeah","username":"varun-raj","ts":"2018-03-16T07:38:30.801Z"}
{"msg":"We dont have to store the keys all the time, only when the user is logged in and wants to use the system","username":"varun-raj","ts":"2018-03-16T07:38:49.482Z"}
{"msg":"I hope that helps.","username":"odowdaibm","ts":"2018-03-16T07:38:50.539Z"}
{"msg":"And if we can store the keys in temp storage like RAM, it'll be much more secured ","username":"varun-raj","ts":"2018-03-16T07:39:09.984Z"}

{"msg":"well, you separate the keys, into those used by the end users, and the HLF one used by your nodejs Fabric SDK app, it's much easier","username":"odowdaibm","ts":"2018-03-16T07:39:44.918Z"}

For the record, I am not the author of the statement \"All members of a channel must be in the same consortium.\" But I am happy that this statement has been made such that we now can find out exactly how the relationship is between channels, organizations and consortia. Let me summarize what I have learned so far: make a clear distinction between the system channel and the application channels. Let me ask the following question: suppose that all organizations and all consortia in a HLF network agree to have one application channel for all peers of all orgs, inside and outside a consortium but of course inside the HLF network, is that permitted?  Any subset of the organizations (inside and outside a consortium in a HLF network) can have a second,separate application channel? A subset of said subset can have a third application channel. You have probably a much better formulation of what that relationship is. I am sure my colleagues in the documentation WG and myself really appreciate your help.

The orderer system channel defines consortiums  When a channel is created, its initial membership must be only those organizations from within the consortium identified within the channel creation transaction.  Once a channel has been created, the membership of the channel may be changed arbitrarily (to add other orgs from the consortium, or orgs from outside the consortium).  So, initial channel creation restricts the membership to be a subset of a consortium.

It is the database of the ledger.  The world state represents the latest values for all keys ever included in its chain transaction log. The world state makes it easy for a program to get the current value of these states, rather than having to calculate them by traversing the entire transaction log.  The world state can change frequently, as states can be created, updated and deleted. Peers commit the latest values to ledger world state for each valid transaction included in a processed block.

{"msg":"Hello,\nMy name is Francisco and I started to learn about Blockchain an Hyperledger Fabric recently.\nFor the last few weeks I've been reading the Hyperledger Fabric Docs and have found a few small inconsistencies.\nAfter reading the Contribution guidelines my understanding is that I should broadcast the doc bugs here. \nSo here are a couple inconsistencies I found today while going through the \"Writing Your First Application\" tutorial (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/write_first_app.html)\n\n1. In the \"Enrolling the admin user\" section (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/write_first_app.html) there is a note that says: \n\"You may find it useful to stream the CA logs when running the upcoming programs by opening a new terminal shell and running docker logs -f ca.example.com\"\nHowever, after launching the network with the `./startFabric.sh javascript` command there is no \"ca.example.com\" container therefore the command fails.\nThere are, however, two CAs: ca_peerOrg1 and ca_peerOrg2. After checking the source code of enrollAdmin.js I can see that it uses: ca.org1.example.com which corresponds to ca_peerOrg1 according to the first-network/docker-compose-ca.yaml file\nSo the actual command to inspect the logs is docker logs -f ca_peerOrg1\n\n2. In the \"Querying the ledger\" section (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/write_first_app.html#querying-the-ledger)\nthere are some references to the ../../basic-network/connection.json file when in reality the code references ../../first-network/connection-org1.json as you can see in fabcar/javascript/query.js\n\nI am happy to contribute fixes to the docs as I go through them if you would guide me how to.","username":"francisco-rojas","ts":"2019-09-21T16:51:26.122Z"}

{"msg":"You may have seen Brett Logan's post that the process to submit Documentation (and Fabric) updates has now moved from Gerritt to Github.\n- If you are an existing Github user, the process should be very familiar to you.\n- If you are new to Github, checkout https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github/github.html to get started.\n- If you were used to the Gerritt process and want to see what's different start with the note here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html. I also started a jira to record some of the differences I have noticed https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-17122.\n\nPR reviewers now get automatically assigned when you create the PR. We've experienced some issues with assigning individual reviewers and are currently working through that process. Stay tuned for an update around that.\n\nIssues are still being tracked in JIRA. Nothing has changed there.\n\nWe welcome your documentation contributions.

{"msg":"Raft is a leader based protocol, where a single leader establishes a total order and replicates the data (in our case blocks) out to the followers.

{"msg":"Therefore you have two different competing interests.  On the one hand, the more Raft nodes you have, the more you may lose and still maintain a majority online.  e.g. A 5 node cluster can tolerate 2 nodes down, while a 7 node cluster can tolerate 3 nodes down.","username":"jyellick","ts":"2020-09-29T19:10:36.462Z"}

{"msg":"Practically, Raft clusters of more than a few dozen nodes begin to see noticeable performance degradation.  Once clusters reach on the order of one hundred nodes, they begin having trouble maintaining quorum.  Of course this is all dependent on the networking, and other resources available, and there are tunables like the tick interval which can be used to mitigate the larger communications overhead.","username":"jyellick","ts":"2020-09-29T19:13:27.574Z"}
