{"msg":"I think we do need the concept of *accounts* for evm integration. Take the voting app here as an example: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/solidity-by-example.html#voting\nwhen chair person assigns the _right to vote_ to a voter, it actually looks up and update variables using voter's address as the key. And when that actual voter invokes `vote`, the contract checks `msg.sender` to retrieve caller's address, which is used to lookup the map. This can be depicted by following code snippet:\n```\n    struct Voter {\n        uint weight; // weight is accumulated by delegation\n        bool voted;  // if true, that person already voted\n        address delegate; // person delegated to\n        uint vote;   // index of the voted proposal\n    }\n\n    /// Give your vote (including votes delegated to you)\n    /// to proposal `proposals[proposal].name`.\n    function vote(uint proposal) public {\n        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];\n        require(!sender.voted);\n        sender.voted = true;\n        sender.vote = proposal;\n\n        // If `proposal` is out of the range of the array,\n        // this will throw automatically and revert all\n        // changes.\n        proposals[proposal].voteCount += sender.weight;\n    }\n```\n\nI synced up with @swetha today and noticed that to introduce token in Fabric, accounts are also required. In our current poc, we follow the pattern of burrow to *compute account address from public key*, which can be retrieved using `stub.GetCreator()`. I wonder where we could track the effort of token work, and align the design\n\ncc @cbf @mastersingh24 @swetha ","username":"guoger","ts":"2018-02-27T09:26:08.749Z"}

{"msg":"Hello fabric-evm... I wanted to share a project that @seanyoung has started that I think has a lot of potential to grow into something rather interesting. It is a solidity-to-LLVM compiler using modern compiler tooling to generate LLVM IR with an antlr grammar: https://github.com/seanyoung/solang. What we (Burrow) have in mind is using the LLVM WASM backend to create a migration path for existing solidity code and also thinking about WASM-EVM interop within Burrow that can bring with it a host of advantages. In the context of Hyperledger I would like to see WASM emerge as a cross-framework point of integration for different projects (and I know others would too). However this approach is interesting for chaincode written in any LLVM-supported backend architecture and has the advantage of running through sane, mature, modern compiling machinery.

Can you tell me more about how your network will look in terms of orgs, and users per org? And if fab3 were to support more than one user at a time, how would you divide out the users amongst the different fab3? In general, my reluctance to supporting multiple users is because fab3 becomes more of a centralized component in that design.","username":"swetha","ts":"2019-03-11T20:54:07.519Z"}

But the core logic is the same, plus I don't use the value, just the nonce in the next scenario. \n\nSo the scenario is the following.

I have two versions of this contract, C1 and C2, but their transfer functions are identical (their whole bytecode is not). I have 2 Fabric identities/certs (client[1|2]). \nI test C1 and C2 independently, on totally clean and separate Fabric networks, but with the same identities (that's why I exposed the nonce, so the contract address generation and the nonce passed to the EVM can be deterministic). The contracts and identities got the same addresses in both tests, I've verified this.\n\nI can deploy both contracts successfully, and client1 get a lot of token in the constructor. Now I call transfer on a clean system with client1: transfer 1000 tokens to client2. And it works in both cases, but there's something strange going on under the hood. Namely, the two contract calls produce a different writeset, but a same readset.\n\nIn both cases, there are 3 matching reads (across C1 and C2): \n1. `calleeCode := evmCache.GetCode(calleeAddr)` in EVMCC, with the `contract address` as the key, at version `2.0` (1st block: instantiate EVMCC; 2nd block: deploy EMV contract, so the version comes from this). I assume this read is produced by `statemanager.GetAccount`, based on the key.\n2-3: `balances[msg.sender]` and `balances[_receiver]` also produce 1-1 reads (the other access calls are answered from the EVM State's cache). First part of the key is the contract address, plus an extra part, guessing it's the map's key encoded somehow. Guessing these reads are produced by `statemanager.GetStorage`. And so far still good, it returns a version 2.0 answer and a nil, since the second user has 0 tokens, hence not in the map at this point.\n\nRegarding the write set, there are 3 writes:\n1-2: Setting `balances[msg.sender]` and `balances[_receiver]` produces 1-1 write, with matching keys and values (across C1 and C2). \n3. However, there's a 3rd write, with the contract address as the key, and a really long value (in hex encoded form, 7116 characters for C1 and 7072 for C2). I guess it's produced by `statemanager.UpdateAccount`. What does this 3rd write represents? The map-related storages are already updated by the previous reads. Plus the two value are almost identical, apart from the length and randomly distributed hex characters around the end...\n\nSo what happens here? Functionally, from the client's POV, everything is fine, but this write set difference really botheres me, especially since I don't know where it comes from and everything else matches. Both execution should be deterministic, as ensured by the manually provided nonces.\n\nI've arrived to the following hypothesis by the time I've finished writing this message: the entire Account object is updated/saved, which includes the bytecode of the contract, which is different, hence the different write value. Can someone confirm this? I don't see the bytecode directly in the written value, but I guess Account.Encode() can obscure it somehow.","username":"klenik","ts":"2019-05-08T12:01:01.032Z"}

{"msg":"I have two questions about fabric-evm. \n1. evmcc is replacing \"from account\" or caller address to the creater's ID. This creater's ID will be the ID of Fab3 and it is strange that Fab3 replaces the caller address with it's own address. Some Ethereum Dapp will not work if it's JSON-RPC proxy replaces the caller address. For example, Ethereum wallet will not able to send ERC20 tokens to other accounts using Fab3. Is there any reason why Fab3 replaces the caller addess?\n2. Ethereum Dapps usually send signed transaction to the proxy and this ensures that the transaction is valid and it will not be modified in the middle until it is included in the block. evmcc does not seem to check the signature of the transaction, and it does not save the transaction as the original form. It's a problem because it executes the transaction without validation and the stored transaction cannot be verified that it's not tampered.","username":"conanoc","ts":"2019-08-29T09:50:01.373Z"}
{"msg":"@conanoc \n1. So in this case Fab3 would be connected to your wallet. When you start up you indicate the identity that you want to use. Fab3 does not actually replace the address. It just removes whatever is provided because the EVM gets the address by the submitting signature. Fab3 will sign the transaction with the identity you have chosen to use and from the signature the EVM on the fabric node will be able to determine the caller address. So there is no way to actually insert an caller address. We currently do not support Ethereum wallets. One of the biggest reasons is because the certificate algorithms are different from Ethereum and Fabric so the certs cannot be shared.\n2. Fab3 does not have the ability to send signed transactions. One of the blocks for this is that the underlying fabric client  (fabric-go-sdk) does not accept signed transactions yet. When the feature is added, there will need to be some thought on design because of the differences in Ethereum and Fabric certs. \nBy the time the transaction comes to the EVMCC, the fabric node has already verified the signature of the transactions. And for the transaction to be added to a block, various nodes must generate the same read write sets. Each node would be verifying the transaction signature ","username":"swetha","ts":"2019-08-29T20:23:57.644Z"}

{"msg":"@swetha Thanks for your explanation. I think fabric transaction can just embed ethereum transaction as data and treat ethereum as one of the apps using fabric. fabric-evm could support ethereum wallets if evmcc does not replace the caller account. You mentioned that certificate algorithms are different from Ethereum and Fabric, but why do they have be the same? The thing fabric-evm has to do with the ethereum signature is to validate the signature of the ethereum transaction. As for the transaction added in the block, Ethereum Dapps will only care whether it's the same transaction as the one they submitted and if it can be verified with the signature attached in the transaction that it's not tamperd.","username":"conanoc","ts":"2019-08-30T02:45:17.024Z"}

Saying that, we have thought about the approach you have mentioned, but have not settled on how to handle it. Questions that come up is whether that ethereum identity/certificate can be anonymous, which is different from Fabric. If we say ethereum identity needs to be connected to a fabric identity, it means maintaining two types of identity management. Ethereum Dapps would still be able to see it as the same transaction, as the caller address will be the same as the identity that signed the transaction to begin with. It would only be different if the Dapp tried to put in a callee address that it was not using to sign the transaction.\n\nI am also curious to understand the use case of needed an ethereum certificate over using the fabric one?

{"msg":"@swetha \"If we say ethereum identity needs to be connected to a fabric identity\" I want to argue the opposite. I think fabric need not worry about ethereum identity. Because fabric need not worry about the internal ID system of the apps running on fabric. Ethereum is an app running on fabric. But currently, evmcc is touching the internal account of the app named \"ethereum\".\nI'd like to clarify this confusion. An ethereum node which serves evm-JSON-RPC can have two roles. One is serving the user running the node. The user is running a Dapp and a node on the his computer. He is the single user of the computer. The node has accounts generated by the user and the Dapp will use that accounts. The second role is serving multiple users as a proxy. The users are running Dapp on their own computers but are not running ethereum nodes. They use a proxy node which supports JSON-RPC. In this case, the users have their own accounts and they send transactions signed with their own certificate to the proxy. \nI've talked about this second case and you seem to considering only the first case. I think the second case is more common when we consider the ethereum nodes for the enterprise.","username":"conanoc","ts":"2019-08-30T04:16:42.015Z"}

My concern here is that Fab3 if it is doing F(x), where x is any transaction, is that it should not be used as a proxy that multiple users can use. Because from a fabric transaction standpoint only one user is submitting those transactions. I know Jay and I have talked about F(E(m)) as a way to introduce wallet support sooner than later. However, even if we don't care about the E(m) algorithm or identity, we should care that F(x) is done per user, not a group. If we break this, it opens the door for pseudo anonymous transactions which I feel like is a departure from Fabric. \n\nTo be able to make fab3 a proxy that does no signing and simply acts as a way to send transactions, then I think the identity used needs to be one recognized by the system. This option requires that 1. either we support ethereum signing algorithm or 2. waiting on signing transactions through the go sdk. Though as I think about it we could support 2 now and leave it up to the user to figure out how to sign the transaction.\n\nIf we support F(E(m)) I think we are then making Fab3 1-1 to a user. If we try to support using Fabric ways of submitting signed transactions we would be able to make fab3 more lightweight and simply a proxy.","username":"swetha","ts":"2019-08-30T16:44:59.194Z"}

Fab3 only checks the validity of the signature and bypasses the transaction to evmcc. F(x) will be done on the endorsing peers as usual. In this scenario, E(m) is not done when Fab3 is serving eth_sendTransaction because Fab3 is creating ethereum tx itself.
