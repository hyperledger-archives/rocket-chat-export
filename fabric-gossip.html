hey - was getting on a flight earlier.  it was pretty good.  some good conversations on various subjects and looks like people are very interested in the new 1.0 architecture
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 03 Feb 2017 04:26:05 GMT):<br/>
we are clearly going to need to get some good docs out with the alpha

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 12:57:50 GMT):<br/>
I'm here
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 12:58:04 GMT):<br/>
so you want me to start?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 12:58:24 GMT):<br/>
I am. 
So, https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2007 deals with adding support for gossip to expose endpoints to peers according to whether they are in the same org as the source peer or not
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 12:58:59 GMT):<br/>
I'm addressing this in the following way- in the `AliveMessage` I'm adding another field that's a remote endpoint.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 12:58:59 GMT):<br/>
I'm addressing this in the following way- in the `AliveMessage` I'm adding another field that's an internal endpoint.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 12:59:21 GMT):<br/>
to simplify things:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:00:25 GMT):<br/>
When an `AliveMessage` is propagated from peer to peer, once the `AliveMessage` has crossed to a peer that's in a different org, the inner endpoint is deleted. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:00:54 GMT):<br/>
now... a peer may start without a remote endpoint, just an inner endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:02:46 GMT):<br/>
ok - that makes sense - so then all we need in the peer config is some property called something like "advertiseAddress" 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:03:03 GMT):<br/>
yeah. The idea I thought of is the following:
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:03:17 GMT):<br/>
since you can use "listenAddress" for the internal / default address
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:03:19 GMT):<br/>
Now when you have 2 endpoints in the AliveMessage, you also have 2 signatures:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:03:28 GMT):<br/>
1 on the whole message, with the external endpoint which can be nil
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:03:32 GMT):<br/>
and 1 on the inner endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:04:12 GMT):<br/>
so if the messages "crosses" an organization boundry- the last peer that forwards it- deletes the inner endpoint, and doesn't need to re-sign the actual message which it can't since he may not be the source peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:04:16 GMT):<br/>
but we have a problem
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:04:32 GMT):<br/>
Let's say a peer `p` has been initialized without a remote endpoint and joins a channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:04:38 GMT):<br/>
it contacts an anchor peer, tells it about itself
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:05:17 GMT):<br/>
and now the anchor peer, which may be in a different org- publishes that peer's alive message with the inner endpoint in the "best" case and with *no endpoint* in the worst case
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:05:33 GMT):<br/>
so what I want to do is something as the following which I think it's also a cool concept
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:05:44 GMT):<br/>
peers that don't have external endpoints, are "invisible" to outside orgs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:05:54 GMT):<br/>
and may not join channels that are cross-orgs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:06:18 GMT):<br/>
I mean- the gossip part won't support cross-org channel messages for them
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:06:57 GMT):<br/>
would they still be able to connect and pull across orgs for say something like block/state transfer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:07:09 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:07:26 GMT):<br/>
if they have no external endpoint, i don't think they should
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:07:34 GMT):<br/>
if you want the peer to be able to do that, start it up correctly
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:07:43 GMT):<br/>
you may even of course, have the same endpoint in both fields
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:07:43 GMT):<br/>
you may even of course, have the same endpoint in both configs(internal and external)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:11:01 GMT):<br/>
so basically, if a peer wants to participate in cross-org gossip (of course scoped to a channel), it must have an "advertiseAddress" in its config?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:11:46 GMT):<br/>
of course, you could trick the system and populate this with a non-routable address as well and still be able to "connect" to someone else
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:12:32 GMT):<br/>
and then no one will be able to connect to that peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:12:44 GMT):<br/>
so why do that?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:13:02 GMT):<br/>
he could always get blocks from peers in its org that did publish an external address
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:13:30 GMT):<br/>
but that peer could still make an outbound connection to another peer and given that the GRPC connection is duplex, the peer it connected to could still send it messages and vice versa
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:13:46 GMT):<br/>
yes I understand that
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:13:50 GMT):<br/>
agree - no reason to do it - but you could do it  :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:13:51 GMT):<br/>
but- I don't see the use case
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:13:56 GMT):<br/>
oh yeah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:14:19 GMT):<br/>
but I also want users to be able not to config the peer/gossip in a way that causes problems that are hard to "debug"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:14:30 GMT):<br/>
Now, having said that- there is an alternative for this, however- and it is to create 2 membership overlays: 1 for inter-organization membership, and 1 for intra-organization membership.
The implementation is much simpler, but it of course induces "double" the messages in a certain sense. 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:14:31 GMT):<br/>
but I'm fine with saying that you need to specifically populate an address that will be used for gossip and if you don't have it, no cross-org gossip
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:15:01 GMT):<br/>
simplifies things a bit plus makes it clear what needs to happen to participate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:15:01 GMT):<br/>
I think I want to go with the 1st way at first, and if I'll see that it doesn't work well I might switch to the 2nd
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:15:10 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:15:19 GMT):<br/>
so you're ok with that "invisible peer" idea?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:16:48 GMT):<br/>
I think so - as I said, the only drawback is that an "invisible" peer cannot "pull", but I think it's ok to say "hey - if you are not willing to expose yourself, you can't play in cross-org gossip"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:16:58 GMT):<br/>
it can pull from its own org
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:17:05 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:17:16 GMT):<br/>
and it will most likely have an anchor peer to pull from, anyway
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:17:24 GMT):<br/>
good point
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:18:51 GMT):<br/>
ok I just wanted to make sure we agree on the idea.
@C0rWin if you have some comments you're welcome
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:19:03 GMT):<br/>
so I suggest we explicitly add an item to the peer yaml config  - maybe we call it "advertiseAddress" and put it under the "gossip" section?  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:19:22 GMT):<br/>
*advertisedAddress*
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:19:30 GMT):<br/>
sounds good
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:19:41 GMT):<br/>
Kafka uses something like that as well
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:19:57 GMT):<br/>
ok. Thanks Gari. 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:25:03 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm so we will have two addresses advertisedAddress - for across org (but maybe different from anchor address, listenAddress - internal listen address) ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:27:12 GMT):<br/>
So, now the gossip in the peer would advertise to peers in its own org both addresses, and to peers outside- only the external, and if the external address isn't specified, that peer won't be published to peers outside of the org.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:27:20 GMT):<br/>
The listenAddress has nothing to do with that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:27:33 GMT):<br/>
I'm not talking about https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/peer/core.yaml#L58-L64
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:30:03 GMT):<br/>
ok. I saw `since you can use "listenAddress" for the internal / default address` from @mastersingh24 and wanted to make sure
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:31:08 GMT):<br/>
so if there's an `advertisedAddress` a peer from across the org can communicate with that
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:31:32 GMT):<br/>
and if not ?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:37:33 GMT):<br/>
if peer won't have `advertiseAddress` it won't be able to communicate with other orgs (at least directly)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:39:32 GMT):<br/>
 its not a "requirement" that we have advertisedAddress right ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:40:44 GMT):<br/>
just trying to understand what we have to tell users to do 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 13:43:03 GMT):<br/>
not it's not, but if you'd like your peer to be able to communicate with external peers from different orgs, only then you will have to setup this parameter
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 14:26:44 GMT):<br/>
sorry, let me play "dumb user" (likely a true description of me :-) )... in what circumstance should I specify `advertiseAddress`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 14:28:05 GMT):<br/>
it's `advertisedAddress`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 14:28:15 GMT):<br/>
and when you want your peer to connect to different orgs
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 14:30:33 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr  - we actually played a similar trick in v0.6 with  `peer.listenAddress` and `peer.address` for the discovery protocol.  Basically discovery would advertise `peer.address` if present (for example this might be the expose IP:Port used by a Docker container whereas `listenAddress` was actually binding to localhost in the container which of course is not routable)

Hi @yacovm in the demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di4y1gauoKc , out of the first 10 peers, what as the leader setup? peer0 set to leader?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:20:16 GMT):<br/>
@AdnanC  the demo is quite old, it was only for demonstrating development process. 
We're in a much much more advanced stage of gossip and we have multi-channel support now, and also soon dynamic leader election.
Also notice that there wasn't any talk about channels in the demo, since it was made in a very early stage of V1.0 development.

As for the demo- there wasn't really a leader, we were using a peer that was disseminating blocks manually.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:21:09 GMT):<br/>
(by manually I mean- it was hardcoded to disseminate new blocks when it got them, and wasn't selected by some leader election)
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:21:23 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:21:26 GMT):<br/>
Of course if you have questions, feel free to ask
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:21:45 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, are there any other recent demo/plabacks?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:24:41 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, I'm afraid that's the most up to date playback we have at the moment.
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:25:04 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks. Will ask questions as you suggested :)
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:38:13 GMT):<br/>
About the changeset https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5163/, is this the usecase? 
"when the peers are are on different hostmachines, the endpoint will be overriden and set to the IP address of the respective machines so that Gossip data dissemination can take place." 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:42:26 GMT):<br/>
of course.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Feb 2017 20:42:49 GMT):<br/>
for example if you're running your peer in docker and its local IP is 172.20.0.3

you would want remote peers to connect to an ip address that is routable from them, @AdnanC

@yacovm Hi, about the code-review, I just found that I created the chain with security-enabled.  So, it's not a bug.  I'll abandon that review.  Thanks very much for the explanation.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 11:10:43 GMT):<br/>
of course, thank you for trying to patch our code!

Hello gossipers, would it be possible to reduce the amount of gossip trace?  The same gossip bytes fill the debug log every second over and over, even when there are no transactions go through the system, making it nearly impossible to find actual transactions in the debug. Here is one second of peer debug when nothing is happening:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:22:00 GMT):<br/>
Hey Dave
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:22:07 GMT):<br/>
so, a question
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:22:14 GMT):<br/>
are you using debug?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:22:17 GMT):<br/>
or info level?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:22:33 GMT):<br/>
the gossip inherits its logging levels from the "node" logging attribute
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:22:43 GMT):<br/>
as the rest of the peer...

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:23:19 GMT):<br/>
peer debug
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:23:27 GMT):<br/>
well- if the peer is in debug
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:23:33 GMT):<br/>
what do you expect me to do?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:23:37 GMT):<br/>
could you maybe print out the bytes the first time, and then only print them again if they change?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:23:52 GMT):<br/>
that's impossible logic-wise. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:24:01 GMT):<br/>
look at the sequence numbers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:24:03 GMT):<br/>
they increase
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:24:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to understand though
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:24:29 GMT):<br/>
if you're after the DEBUG messages or the INFO one you pasted here?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:24:30 GMT):<br/>
I see pages of gossip trace when nothing is happening in the system
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:24:49 GMT):<br/>
would you agree to a situation
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:24:59 GMT):<br/>
in which the gossip comm layer prints the Send() method in debug
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:25:03 GMT):<br/>
instead of INFO as it is now?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:25:33 GMT):<br/>
because- what do you expect me to do with debug messages? we have debug messages as the rest of the system
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:25:45 GMT):<br/>
yeah, that's a debug message though
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:25:58 GMT):<br/>
definitely shouldnt be info
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:26:03 GMT):<br/>
it's not info
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:26:05 GMT):<br/>
it's debug
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:26:17 GMT):<br/>
there is some INFO each second
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:26:22 GMT):<br/>
much more DEBUG
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:26:26 GMT):<br/>
and I think that logging levels should be fine-grained per peer sub-component
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:26:44 GMT):<br/>
the "some INFO" - unless I'm mistaken is only the Send() isn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:26:54 GMT):<br/>
right, but when there issue people turn on DEBUG for the entire peer and then they cant find the problem through the gossip gorp
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:27:34 GMT):<br/>
There are a few INFOs
</p>

2017-02-18 11:58:22.536 UTC [gossip/comm#-1] GossipStream -> INFO 8fa Servicing 127.0.0.1:35198
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:27:40 GMT):<br/>
yeah I agree here- but the solution I think is appropriate is to be able to control which sub-component of a peer needs its logging levels adjusted
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:28:14 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=hi6MggrwJZYSSjM88)

so the peer/core.yaml?

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:31:49 GMT):<br/>
using the default, no changes

but starting peer with CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:32:13 GMT):<br/>
remove this bootstrap line

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:32:23 GMT):<br/>
and you won't see (I hope) the WARNings
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:33:08 GMT):<br/>
not all the gorp has sequence numbers.. for the stuff without sequence numbers can you print the gorp only the first time?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:33:20 GMT):<br/>
gorp?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:33:27 GMT):<br/>
or remove sequence numbers from the gorp
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:33:41 GMT):<br/>
this is gorp:

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:34:29 GMT):<br/>
when a peer authenticates to a different peer, we print in DEBUG the message
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:34:30 GMT):<br/>
meaningless bytes to the administrator
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:34:37 GMT):<br/>
why meaningless? look
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:34:40 GMT):<br/>
you have the PEM here!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:34:48 GMT):<br/>
you can take this PEM
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:34:52 GMT):<br/>
and understand who that peer was
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:34:53 GMT):<br/>
ok, just print it the first time
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:34:57 GMT):<br/>
I can't
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:35:08 GMT):<br/>
this is logically not possible
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:35:31 GMT):<br/>
ok, maybe we need multiple levels of debug then
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:35:40 GMT):<br/>
I think what we really need is something else
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:35:50 GMT):<br/>
the ability to define a fine-grained mapping
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:35:58 GMT):<br/>
of which peer sub-component starts in which logging level
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:36:12 GMT):<br/>
btw you can turn all these off with the peer logging control CLI did you know that?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:36:19 GMT):<br/>
(just making sure you did)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:36:21 GMT):<br/>
i think there is component level debug, but when somebody doesnt know what the problem is they always turn on peer-wide debug
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:36:37 GMT):<br/>
there isn't, and it doesn't really work
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:36:53 GMT):<br/>
the reason it doesn't is that everyone in this project defines a logger with:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:37:09 GMT):<br/>
logging.getModule(mySubcomponent/sub-subcomponent)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:37:19 GMT):<br/>
therefore it's impossible to fine-tune these things
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:37:20 GMT):<br/>
ok, at least for me can you provide the instructions to enable all peer debug except gossip?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:37:29 GMT):<br/>
yeah sure :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:37:32 GMT):<br/>
1 sec
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:38:03 GMT):<br/>
not to insult you, but i care about all debug except gossip :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:38:14 GMT):<br/>
hehe, you're not
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:38:49 GMT):<br/>
1 sec I'll build the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:39:33 GMT):<br/>
I think also I need to open a JIRA for that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:39:44 GMT):<br/>
maybe someone will take up the challange
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:39:47 GMT):<br/>
and do this
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:40:00 GMT):<br/>
this is an open source project after all
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:40:18 GMT):<br/>
`./build/bin/peer logging`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:40:28 GMT):<br/>
you have there "setLevel"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:40:46 GMT):<br/>
so the gossip sub-component you need to silence is the thing in [ ] 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:41:25 GMT):<br/>
ok, i havent used that before, can you provide the statement i'd need?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:41:31 GMT):<br/>
yeah sure
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:41:34 GMT):<br/>
let me try first before
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:44:10 GMT):<br/>

```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:44:43 GMT):<br/>
so, basically if you see a log entry that has: `[gossip/subcomponent#identifier]`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:44:59 GMT):<br/>
you can do `peer logging setlevel gossip/subcomponent WARNING`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:45:05 GMT):<br/>
you can also set to error of course...

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:45:15 GMT):<br/>
great, thank you, will give it a try
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:49:40 GMT):<br/>
no problem, and I also opened: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2351

I see
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:54:41 GMT):<br/>
can you paste them?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:54:56 GMT):<br/>
the INFO and WARNINGs I pasted above
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:55:19 GMT):<br/>
i'll get you a clean one...

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:58:35 GMT):<br/>
i'm ok now, just asking you remove those by default for others
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:58:54 GMT):<br/>
wait I don't understand
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:59:00 GMT):<br/>
have you managed to silence them or not?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 12:59:48 GMT):<br/>
yes, i can silence them now.  changed it back to INFO so that I could show you the INFOs and WARNINGs that come out.  These should be DEBUG.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 13:00:24 GMT):<br/>
when the system is at rest, the INFO/WARNING log should be empty
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 13:00:25 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, yeah maybe you're right.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 13:00:45 GMT):<br/>
I mean about the DEBUG, not about the "when the system is at rest"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 13:00:51 GMT):<br/>
The system may be at rest to you
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 13:00:56 GMT):<br/>
but gossip might do lots of things
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 13:01:14 GMT):<br/>
therefore I think the optimal thing to do is to implement FAB-2351 I just opened
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 13:02:17 GMT):<br/>
when the system is at steady state and not processing any transactions,  the INFO/WARNING log should be empty
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Feb 2017 13:03:27 GMT):<br/>
INFO is fine for initialization, but not steady state.

@yacovm @C0rWin Looking at joinChain() resilience... @manish-sethi and I are trying to make the createLedger() call more resilient if there are any problems (e.g. cant connect to state database).  Question - would it be possible to createLedger(), then createChain() and InitChain(), before committing the genesis block to ledger?  So that gossip and everything can get initialized for the chain before the genesis block is committed.  This way, if there is a problem committing the genesis block (e.g. cant connect to state database), then the genesis block could be gossipped later like any other block, after the problem gets resolved. Or must the genesis block be treated as a special case and therefore must get written before createChain() and InitChain()?

@dave.enyeart 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:38:00 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  part of the gossip is the state transfer capabilities
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:39:06 GMT):<br/>
which assumes it starts with valid ledger which has at least one block (genesis) committed, so it could track the proper order of blocks comming
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:39:51 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I suspected as much, so the genesis block needs to get written prior to createChain() and initChain()
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:40:02 GMT):<br/>
currently yes
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:40:40 GMT):<br/>
while I can imagine how this could be changed/refactored so the state transfer layer would be initialized upon some event/callback from the ledger once it become ready
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:41:29 GMT):<br/>
also it seems, that there are many other parts will fail on the way before the gossip
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:41:45 GMT):<br/>
and what exactly does 'ready' mean?  do you need some config from the genesis block?  or could ready mean that the ledger infrastructure is in place, even if the genesis block is not there yet
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:42:21 GMT):<br/>
trying to see if genesis block itself could be gossipped later
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:42:25 GMT):<br/>
ready, ledger infrastructure is in place and block committed. 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:42:59 GMT):<br/>
I think this is doable
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:43:39 GMT):<br/>
but, the callback may not be until after the peer is restarted.  it may require a restart to fix up the state database, etc
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:43:59 GMT):<br/>
wait
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:44:17 GMT):<br/>
of peer need to be restarted not sure what is the problem here?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:44:45 GMT):<br/>
ledger infra is in place, you trying to commit GB, but failing, then restarting the peer to resolve the problem... Right?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:45:08 GMT):<br/>
you will have to call join again and submit GB anyway, no?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:45:27 GMT):<br/>
you need to initialize all MSP infrastructure using GB
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:45:53 GMT):<br/>
I'm just failing to see the exact flow you trying to solve currently
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:46:29 GMT):<br/>
with the current design we get into an inconsistent state, where ledger thinks it is created, but genesis block did not get committed yet.  re-join will fail since you cannot re-create ledger
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:47:20 GMT):<br/>
we can do a larger re-design... but just wanted to check if it would be possible to 'catch up' the genesis block later via gossip, after the problem is resolved.
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:48:39 GMT):<br/>
if the invalid state of ledger could be propagated somehow to the gossip state layer 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:48:55 GMT):<br/>
then there should not be a problem I guess
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:49:04 GMT):<br/>
of course the evil in details
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:49:20 GMT):<br/>
but seems that it has to work
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:49:56 GMT):<br/>
let me ask this... does the gossip 'registration' get persisted somewhere?  upon peer startup how do you know which channels to gossip on?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:50:19 GMT):<br/>
we get this info from GB
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:50:58 GMT):<br/>
```// Initialize sets up any chains that the peer has from the persistence. This
// function should be called at the start up when the ledger and gossip
// ready
func Initialize(init func(string)) {
	chainInitializer = init

	var cb *common.Block
	var ledger ledger.PeerLedger
	ledgermgmt.Initialize()
	ledgerIds, err := ledgermgmt.GetLedgerIDs()
	if err != nil {
		panic(fmt.Errorf("Error in initializing ledgermgmt: %s", err))
	}
	for _, cid := range ledgerIds {
		peerLogger.Infof("Loading chain %s", cid)
		if ledger, err = ledgermgmt.OpenLedger(cid); err != nil {
			peerLogger.Warningf("Failed to load ledger %s(%s)", cid, err)
			peerLogger.Debugf("Error while loading ledger %s with message %s. We continue to the next ledger rather than abort.", cid, err)
			continue
		}
		if cb, err = getCurrConfigBlockFromLedger(ledger); err != nil {
			peerLogger.Warningf("Failed to find config block on ledger %s(%s)", cid, err)
			peerLogger.Debugf("Error while looking for config block on ledger %s with message %s. We continue to the next ledger rather than abort.", cid, err)
			continue
		}
		// Create a chain if we get a valid ledger with config block
		if err = createChain(cid, ledger, cb); err != nil {
			peerLogger.Warningf("Failed to load chain %s(%s)", cid, err)
			peerLogger.Debugf("Error reloading chain %s with message %s. We continue to the next chain rather than abort.", cid, err)
			continue
		}

		InitChain(cid)
	}
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:51:02 GMT):<br/>
ok.  and if there is a later config update, you get this info from the later config block, or always from genesis block?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:51:06 GMT):<br/>
this is the code of peer initialization right?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:51:53 GMT):<br/>
so it basically iterates over ledgers and recreates the infrastructure entities to allow peer to operate across all channels it was subscribed to
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:52:01 GMT):<br/>
so if you won't have GB commited
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:52:17 GMT):<br/>
restarting the peer you will have to somehow resubmit the GB
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:55:12 GMT):<br/>
if there is later config block you will read update from it
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:55:18 GMT):<br/>
makes sense.... with current flow it is possible for ledger to get created, but no genesis block, since they are separate calls:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:55:23 GMT):<br/>
```// CreateChainFromBlock creates a new chain from config block
func CreateChainFromBlock(cb *common.Block) error {
	cid, err := utils.GetChainIDFromBlock(cb)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	var ledger ledger.PeerLedger
	if ledger, err = createLedger(cid); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	if err := ledger.Commit(cb); err != nil {
		peerLogger.Errorf("Unable to get genesis block committed into the ledger, chainID %v", cid)
		return err
	}

	return createChain(cid, ledger, cb)
}```
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:55:40 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:56:18 GMT):<br/>
but, probably the intermediate solution will be to destroy ledger if you cannot commit the block
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:56:25 GMT):<br/>
probably createLedger needs to accept genesis block, so that we can be in a consistent state (all success or all fail)
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:56:39 GMT):<br/>
since anyhow you will restart the peer to solve the problem, right?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:56:59 GMT):<br/>
there is an error state
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:57:38 GMT):<br/>
right, its just a question of whether the 'rollback' should be handled in this joinChain code, or abstracted within the createLedger() code
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:57:56 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:58:45 GMT):<br/>
so basically you trying to achieve the ability in case of problem with ledger, to restart the peer and get the GB via gossip w/o a need to explicitly call join channel once again?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:59:15 GMT):<br/>
just exploring if that is an option
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:59:31 GMT):<br/>
I'd say we have to be very careful here, since in that case I'm not sure peer will be able to build gossip membership
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:59:48 GMT):<br/>
membership build based on the anchor peers info
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:59:53 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin: In addition to `Initialize` that initializes the existing chain, does gossip also take care of the chains that are supposed to be on a peer (e.g., peer was down when the chain got created)?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 12:59:54 GMT):<br/>
so if no GB available
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:00:27 GMT):<br/>
you have to explicitly join() each peer when the peer is up
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:00:32 GMT):<br/>
> In addition to `Initialize` that initializes the existing chain, does gossip also take care of the chains that are supposed to be on a peer (e.g., peer was down when the chain got created)?
How that even possible?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:00:38 GMT):<br/>
peer was down...
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:00:49 GMT):<br/>
there is no magic in here
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:00:54 GMT):<br/>
peer is running gossip code
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:01:09 GMT):<br/>
i think Manish did not know that an explicit join() was required
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:01:11 GMT):<br/>
so, who keeps track what all peers are supposed to be part of a chain?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:02:04 GMT):<br/>
orderering service has the membership info in genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:02:25 GMT):<br/>
no-no-no
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:02:30 GMT):<br/>
and peer explicitly raise a join request by some manual operation?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:02:35 GMT):<br/>
ordering service has membership on the org level
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:02:49 GMT):<br/>
no one actually has the global knowledge which peer has to be part of the channel
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:03:11 GMT):<br/>
every peer is part of an org, which is part of a membership, right
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:03:13 GMT):<br/>
> and peer explicitly raise a join request by some manual operation?
yes, you need explicitly call join channel for peer
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:03:43 GMT):<br/>
> every peer is part of an org, which is part of a membership, right
correct, but you cannot tell which peers included in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:03:55 GMT):<br/>
based on the info from ordering service
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:04:06 GMT):<br/>
OK, and during that explicit join call, you obtain a GB and create a new ledger
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:04:13 GMT):<br/>
you mean, which peers 'should' be part of the channel?  or which peers have actually joined the channel?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:04:26 GMT):<br/>
both
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:04:46 GMT):<br/>
can't you tell from the peer's org which channel's it is authorized to join?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:05:42 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:05:58 GMT):<br/>
but that doesn't mean this peer has to be in that channel
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:06:10 GMT):<br/>
in that sense if org A part of the channel XXX
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:06:17 GMT):<br/>
every single peer from org A
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:06:24 GMT):<br/>
ok, peer has the option to join the channel
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:06:37 GMT):<br/>
So, join is a manual operation initiated at a peer and during that explicit join call, you obtain a GB and create a new ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:06:37 GMT):<br/>
allowed to be part of that channel
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:07:23 GMT):<br/>
correct manish, so i think the proper design would be for createLedger() to accept the genesis block and it either atomically succeeds or fails
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:08:07 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's right.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:08:45 GMT):<br/>
ok, we can go work that offline and free up Artem :)
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:09:22 GMT):<br/>
Yes, sure
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:09:40 GMT):<br/>
I suspect this would be a post-beta enhancement
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:12:07 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart @manish-sethi I'd be happy to follow up on this later
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:12:33 GMT):<br/>
From ledger changes point of view, it should take a couple of days. The changes in the higher layer should be easy because even now mostly it would have been create ledger and commit GB in continuous statements
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:13:04 GMT):<br/>
correct.  currently it looks like this:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:13:09 GMT):<br/>
```// CreateChainFromBlock creates a new chain from config block
func CreateChainFromBlock(cb *common.Block) error {
	cid, err := utils.GetChainIDFromBlock(cb)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	var ledger ledger.PeerLedger
	if ledger, err = createLedger(cid); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	if err := ledger.Commit(cb); err != nil {
		peerLogger.Errorf("Unable to get genesis block committed into the ledger, chainID %v", cid)
		return err
	}

	return createChain(cid, ledger, cb)
}```
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:13:46 GMT):<br/>
we need to simply combine createLedger and commit of genesis block into one atomic function call
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:14:34 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:14:53 GMT):<br/>
we should not introduce this churn for beta... therefore we have time and can do it post-beta
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:15:23 GMT):<br/>
thanks @dave.enyeart :-)
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:15:59 GMT):<br/>
sure, Murali's joined hands are making my lol :-)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:16:26 GMT):<br/>
Murali has enough problems on his hands without us introducing churn :)
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:16:40 GMT):<br/>
yes, indeed
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:16:50 GMT):<br/>
> we need to simply combine createLedger and commit of genesis block into one atomic function call
```
   err := createLedger(gb)
```

^^^ I would imagine it will look like this?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:16:57 GMT):<br/>
not problems of his own making :)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:17:08 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:17:41 GMT):<br/>
createLedger(cid, gb)
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:17:52 GMT):<br/>
cid part of gb
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:17:57 GMT):<br/>
looks redundant
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:17:58 GMT):<br/>
no?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:18:14 GMT):<br/>
you dont want to force ledger to parse config :)
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:18:29 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:18:41 GMT):<br/>
ledger is 'dumb' wrt config
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:18:54 GMT):<br/>
yes, but before calling this, the caller would have to check 'exist(ledgerID)' because, a crash may have happened during a join operation but join actually succeeded at the ledger level.
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:19:23 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart is there JIRA item for this effort?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:19:32 GMT):<br/>
i will create it now
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:19:58 GMT):<br/>
So, at next join request, it should be checked first whether the last time the ledger create was succeeded
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:20:33 GMT):<br/>
I just want to subscribe to it to follow the development of this
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:21:40 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin just curious what other components (in addition to ledger) are involved in join operation. They also maintain some state or for them it doesn't matter?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:22:47 GMT):<br/>
@manish-sethi MSP configs loaded from GB
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:23:23 GMT):<br/>
I'd guess it also involved in join operation in some way or another
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:24:49 GMT):<br/>
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2676 : Need to atomically createLedger and commit genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:25:09 GMT):<br/>
So, from ledger point of view the two calls `Exists(ledgerId)` (which is already there) and `Create(GB)` should be enough? Even if a crash happens during a join and a join is re-initiated after a restart?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:26:34 GMT):<br/>
i believe that's right

@C0rWin - does that sound reasonable to you? I am asking because you have better visibility about the overall join operation
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:29:30 GMT):<br/>
Just chiming in to say that it is design to be impossible to gossip a genesis block of a channel

OK, @yacovm. whenever you get time... It would be good if you or Artem can confirm that the above two APIs are good enough for the join operation to survive a crash.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:40:20 GMT):<br/>
I think Artem is right

if the commit fails,the peer shouldn't advance further in the join-channel flow
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:43:35 GMT):<br/>
My personal opinion is that if the commit fails it's probably because the DB isn't accessible, right? 
So the join operation should be synchronous and block until it succeeds, and it should return a failure status all from that `joinChain` operation all the way back to the gRPC connection of the CLI/SDK with a failure status

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=QJYQQMmTu8Dd5M33k) @C0rWin What I assume is that when a join operation is initiated, first call should be `Exists(ledgerId)` - which if returns true that means the ledger is already created  - most likely in a previous attempt during which peer may have crashed. If the `Exists` returns false then `Create(GB)` call should be made. If this call return successfully then ledger is created otherwise not.

Hi @yacovm a few questions about gossip 1)is the gossip leader the only peer that calls ordering service Deliver in an organization? 2) will Gossip layer take endorser the same as committer or differently when selecting the gossip leader inside an organization?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 14:53:24 GMT):<br/>
1) Yes
2) There is nothing in gossip that relates to endorsements 
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:03:24 GMT):<br/>
thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:09:04 GMT):<br/>
I asked question 2 because I think endorser should always keep latest state inside an org, (being gossip leader would help), though this is not critical

@yacovm @C0rWin I believe committing peer can process blocks from various channels in parallel, and call ledger.Commit() in parallel (one thread with one Commit() ongoing per channel).  @Senthil1 was asking how this worked.  And I as well would like to understand the high level gossip procedure for block dissemination from orderer to committing peer (we can assume all peers are leaders for now, to keep the answer simple).

</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 17:58:30 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart not sure what exactly you are looking for, while dissemination procedure is very simple. Gossip leaders pulls out blocks from ordering service and distribute them across other peers. If peers receives same block which was already processed twice it simply drops it.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:03:21 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin I'm looking for the multi-threading behavior.  Can the blocks be pulled from ordering service and committed to ledger in parallel?  I'm assuming one thread doing this in parallel per channel, right?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:26:15 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart pulling of blocks out of ordering service and block dissemination two decoupled processes same for block commits 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:26:59 GMT):<br/>
ok, this is what we want to understand better.  what is the sequence of processes, and which processes can be done in parallel?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:29:47 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart can you please be more specific? sending blocks, processing blocks to the ledger and pulling blocks out of ordering service all this are parallel processes 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:32:23 GMT):<br/>
I mean, what is the degree of parallelization?  I assume you get blocks for ordering service one at a time, and then commit it to ledger, and then get next block from orderering service?   And this process is done in parallel for each channel?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:32:58 GMT):<br/>
Looking for the one paragraph high level explanation of the flow.
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:36:58 GMT):<br/>
if there are 3 peer nodes, they all get the blocks in parallel right?
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:37:11 GMT):<br/>
peer nodes would do things sequentially per channel
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:38:03 GMT):<br/>
parallelization happens at the peer level rather than thread level right?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:39:52 GMT):<br/>
yes, 3 leader peers would process blocks in parallel.  Let's understand from @C0rWin the sequencing/parallelization within each leader peer.
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:47:41 GMT):<br/>
I went through the code to understand the steps: What i understood is the following (correct me if I am wrong). 

(1) `InitializeChannel()` in _gossip/service/gossip_service.go_ is called to create a channel which in turn calls `NewGossipStateProvider()` in _gossip/state/state.go_ and `StartDeliveryForChannel()` in _core/deliverservice/deliveryclient.go_
(2) As a result, 4 go routines (i.e., *threads*) are created for this channel: `listen()`, `deliverPayloads()`, `antiEntropy()`, `DeliverBlocks()`
(3) `DeliverBlocks()` in _core/deliverservice/blocksprovider/blocksprovider.go_ fetches block from ordering service for that channel and gossip the block to other peers (non-leaders)
(4) `deliverPayloads()` in _gossip/state/state.go_ , on receiving a block, calls committer to commit the block.

What we wanted to know was the point (2). 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:54:47 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean "was the point"?
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:55:43 GMT):<br/>
4 threads are created, yes, but each does something different
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 18:55:54 GMT):<br/>
not what we are asking
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 19:02:58 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm The question remains - what is the degree of parallelization (for deliverBlocks() and deliverPayloads()? I assume you get blocks for ordering service one at a time, and then commit it to ledger, and then get next block from orderering service? And this process is done in parallel for each channel?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 19:03:24 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 19:04:59 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart process of pulling blocks and committing to the ledger completely decoupled, the communication between these two via queueing and yes this done in parallel for each channel
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 19:05:40 GMT):<br/>
are asking because this because you trying to see whenever you need to take care of synchronization and locks while blocks are committed?

</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 19:07:18 GMT):<br/>
each peer has a queue, one thread pulls block, puts on queue, anoher thread reads block from queue, commits to ledger
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 19:07:26 GMT):<br/>
that is the level of parallelism right?

yes
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 19:08:10 GMT):<br/>
not: channel 1 has 2 threads, channel 2 has two threads, channel 3 has 2 threads... 
</p>

can you turn on debug in all peers and try again?
</p>
<p><strong>ruslan.kryukov</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 08:51:59 GMT):<br/>
If I start fabric with genesis method file, gossip spams to log with message:

peer-01    | 2017-03-15 08:49:54.127 UTC [gossip/gossip#IP:7051] PeersOfChannel -> WARN 094 No such channel [116 101 115 116 99 104 97 105 110 105 100]

116 101 bla bla bla - is testchainid word

</p>
<p><strong>ruslan.kryukov</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 08:55:14 GMT):<br/>
my config block contains my own channel name and orderer in this case doesn't know about testchainid

But when I start peer with command "peer node start", it starts with default channel testchainid, right? After that I send command "peer join" to my channel, but gossip still sends a lot of messages "no such channel"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 08:56:41 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 08:56:54 GMT):<br/>
because if you start without the --testchainid false flag
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 08:57:03 GMT):<br/>
the peers announce that they are part of "testchainid"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 08:57:25 GMT):<br/>
` --peer-defaultchain=false`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 08:57:30 GMT):<br/>
use this when starting the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 15 Mar 2017 09:07:07 GMT):<br/>
@ruslan.kryukov  also you can `git pull` now and rebuild the peer, you won't see these messages anymore.
Thanks @mastersingh24  for the merge

prefix your `peer channel create` with the MSP folder

do i need to run both network_setup.sh up as well as generateCfgTrx.sh script? last question :-)
</p>
<p><strong>MadhavaReddy</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:20:05 GMT):<br/>
or only network_setup.sh
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:26:57 GMT):<br/>
ah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:27:12 GMT):<br/>
@MadhavaReddy  only `./network_setup.sh up`
</p>
<p><strong>MadhavaReddy</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:27:44 GMT):<br/>
thank you @yacovm will run it
</p>
<p><strong>MadhavaReddy</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:58:18 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm fyi the CLI container existed once network_setup.sh execution is completed even same with generateCfgTrx.sh script, that means its not allowing to create a new channel from cli
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:59:27 GMT):<br/>

Is there something I missing? If I disable gossip security, then it completely disregards the MSP configuration and uses DEFAULT org instead.

Oh, dont use the ignore security thing

<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 19:52:20 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I figured that out after I went looking into the code. So I removed it

Now I'm stuck with the above error
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 19:52:45 GMT):<br/>
The error you're getting is that you get a message signed by a peer from a dofferent org
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 19:52:58 GMT):<br/>
And that peer does not share any channel with you
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 19:53:18 GMT):<br/>
So gossip is only intended for peers within the same org?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 19:53:25 GMT):<br/>
Of course not
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 19:53:29 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:01:22 GMT):<br/>
ah but it needs to be different for each peer!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:01:34 GMT):<br/>
are you somehow providing a different mount volume for each peer?
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:01:38 GMT):<br/>
it is, this is the one from org1peer1
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:02:09 GMT):<br/>
how do you ensure that peer0 and peer1 have different MSPCONFIGPATHs?
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:02:32 GMT):<br/>
they're running on different hosts. they each get the MSPs from their own local dirs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:03:00 GMT):<br/>
but they're in docker
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:03:01 GMT):<br/>
are they not
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:03:03 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:03:53 GMT):<br/>
yes, but each container is running on a different host. I've copied the MSPs for each peer org to each host, and i'm mounting it there locally
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:04:15 GMT):<br/>
ah got it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:04:32 GMT):<br/>
`"CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT=10.13.218.181:7051`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:04:35 GMT):<br/>
Nice!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:04:50 GMT):<br/>
did you read all the fabric code or something?
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:05:17 GMT):<br/>
i'm getting there :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:06:29 GMT):<br/>
okay
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:06:31 GMT):<br/>
next question
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:06:37 GMT):<br/>
have you created a channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:06:40 GMT):<br/>
with the configtxgen
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:06:41 GMT):<br/>
and all
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:08:09 GMT):<br/>
not yet, this happens when I start the peers. I've tried creating a channel and that is successful, but I can't join it. I keep saying error 'No such channel' in the peer logs after I join
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:08:34 GMT):<br/>
ahhhh
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:08:37 GMT):<br/>
great!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:08:52 GMT):<br/>
so basically
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:09:02 GMT):<br/>
you didn't create a channel?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:09:43 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:09:50 GMT):<br/>
you created a channel but haven't joined the peers?
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:11:30 GMT):<br/>
i can create the channel but I haven't joined the peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:11:36 GMT):<br/>
ah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:11:38 GMT):<br/>
that's great
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:11:43 GMT):<br/>
it means my code works
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:11:45 GMT):<br/>
so here is the deal
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:12:03 GMT):<br/>
peers in different orgs *are not supposed to be able to communicate unless they share a channel*
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:13:39 GMT):<br/>
I just created the channel and joined the peers and the errors disappeared :)
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:13:54 GMT):<br/>
which confirms your point
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:15:01 GMT):<br/>
I can't believe you doubted me @akashmar :O
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:15:19 GMT):<br/>
I never did, I was trying that while you were typing :)
</p>
<p><strong>saism</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:16:02 GMT):<br/>
That was actually very helpful little discussion
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:16:03 GMT):<br/>
that rule you mentioned, is that documented somewhere?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:17:38 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, let me see
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:18:35 GMT):<br/>
well not really because I don't think we have a _ public _ document that describes *both gossip and MSP* 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:18:45 GMT):<br/>
We are working on such a doc however!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:19:01 GMT):<br/>
But it's an architectural security constraint
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:19:13 GMT):<br/>
I see
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:19:14 GMT):<br/>
you don't want your peers to be able to talk to any organization, unless there is a reason to, right?
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:19:37 GMT):<br/>
You're right, it makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:20:17 GMT):<br/>
Are you able to help me with chaincode deployment, I have another problem there
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:21:04 GMT):<br/>
I don't think I can because I'm not a chaincode developer but I can give it a shot, but in any case please do *not* ask chaincode questions in this channel :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:21:13 GMT):<br/>
Ask in some other channel and tag me
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:21:29 GMT):<br/>
but if it's something complicated I don't believe I would be able to
</p>
<p><strong>akashmar</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:22:09 GMT):<br/>
is there a channel specifically for chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:22:36 GMT):<br/>
I don't think so. Ask in #fabric or in #fabric-questions

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Mar 2017 15:07:21 GMT):<br/>
I think not. It's best to make the period a function of some other duration

<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:23:35 GMT):<br/>
hey guys i have a question... im still using v0.6
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:23:54 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible to have a network of peer nodes on laptop 1 in docker containers
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:24:12 GMT):<br/>
and then connect a node on ANOTHER laptop to this existing network?
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:32:18 GMT):<br/>
i try to explain where i see the problem
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:32:42 GMT):<br/>
so suppose on laptop 1 we have a network of 4 peer nodes including the root node vp0
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:33:04 GMT):<br/>
now i try to connect from laptop2 another peer node lets call it vp4
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:33:24 GMT):<br/>
then vp4 finds vp0 BUT
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:33:37 GMT):<br/>
vp0 tells vp4 now the ip addresses of the docker containers on laptop1
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:33:55 GMT):<br/>
BUT vp4 thinks these ip addresses are on the network
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:34:18 GMT):<br/>
thus vp4 only gets the connection to vp0 the rootnode but it cannot communicate to vp1-3
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:38:28 GMT):<br/>
So first of all- this channel is dedicated to the gossip component which is only in V1.0
Second- yes it's possible. You need to configure port forwarding and also set this address to the external address of the laptop: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v0.6/peer/core.yaml#L93 
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:40:41 GMT):<br/>
sry didnt know about the restrictions of this channel but thanks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:41:03 GMT):<br/>
np
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:57:04 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm hmm getting the same problem
</p>
<p><strong>thojest</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:57:24 GMT):<br/>
in which channel should i ask this question?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 21 Mar 2017 11:10:31 GMT):<br/>

Enlighten me a bit on this one:
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:14:56 GMT):<br/>
> However, to gossip a block to a peer will require that the ``/Channel/Application/Readers`` policy be satisfied.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:15:05 GMT):<br/>
From `policies.rst`.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:15:29 GMT):<br/>
Hey Kostas how you doing?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:15:35 GMT):<br/>
Why wouldn't we consult the `/Channel/Readers` policy for gossiping as well?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:15:41 GMT):<br/>
Hey Yacov, doing well.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:16:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm sure there's a good reason. `/Channel/Readers` only for those allowed to reach out to the ordering service directly?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:16:34 GMT):<br/>
(But if that's the case... I have follow-up questions.)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:19:38 GMT):<br/>
Isn't channel readers for everyone including ordering service or something ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:20:40 GMT):<br/>
I'm not an expert on this policies thing but I'd assume that the channel application readers is a more restrictive requirement isn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:25:07 GMT):<br/>
Don't quite know and I'm researching this now. There should be (and I'm sure there is) a good argument as to why we do both `Channel/Readers-Writers` and `Channel/Application/Readers-Writers`. Will keep on digging.

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:25:47 GMT):<br/>
To be honest
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:26:05 GMT):<br/>
We don't really consult these policies directly
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:26:13 GMT):<br/>
we invoke a function that the MSP layer gives us 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:26:21 GMT):<br/>
I'd ask in #fabric-crypto instead
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 20:02:23 GMT):<br/>
For my edification, do you plan to consult policies specific in the config eventually?

This is indeed unrelated, @manish-sethi.
It was supposed to be fixed in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7493/
But I pulled your patch set (2) and it appears that https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7493/ didn't fix it... @C0rWin maybe we need to do that callback synchronous after all? I've never seen these failures before when it was changed to async.
Your build, however- failed again.
I opened a JIRA yesterday https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2944

I've never seen these failures before when it was changed to async. Or- maybe we were just wrong in the evaluation of the reason it fails.
Your build, however- failed again.
I opened a JIRA yesterday https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2944

@yacovm for me, all the tests had passed in my local vagrant. Yes, in the latest failure some of the other tests failed - though the last patch did not change anything other than fixing some indentation in proto file.

<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 15:57:20 GMT):<br/>
naive question.  Does gossip communicate between peers using GRPC?
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 15:59:13 GMT):<br/>
and .. is it involved in the dissemination of blocks from the ordering service?  
</p>
<p><strong>bobbiejc</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 15:59:29 GMT):<br/>
@david.enyeart ^^
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:17:02 GMT):<br/>
@bobbiejc yes. It uses the same gRPC server as the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:17:08 GMT):<br/>
and regarding the dissemination - correct
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:17:50 GMT):<br/>
for leader to non-leader peers Gossip is used.  How about from ordering service to leaders?  Is that still Gossip (over gRPC)?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:20:59 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:21:08 GMT):<br/>
that code is in `core/deliveryservice`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:21:29 GMT):<br/>
but... it sort-of goes through gossip
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:21:46 GMT):<br/>
I mean package wise
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:21:49 GMT):<br/>
Bobbie is trying to explain to some newbies (that dont know the code).  so conceptually can you explain sort-of
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:21:51 GMT):<br/>
not communication wise
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:21:53 GMT):<br/>
ah 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:21:55 GMT):<br/>
so don't mention it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:22:11 GMT):<br/>
depends on whether you want to know the code, or want to know the big picture
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:22:35 GMT):<br/>
so from big picture, we can just say that leader peers get blocks from ordering service via grpc?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:23:45 GMT):<br/>
yeah directly via gRPC by calling `Deliver` on the ordering service
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:24:07 GMT):<br/>
ok cool.  and furthermore dissemination between leader peers and non-leaders is via gossip
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:24:55 GMT):<br/>
is Gossip used anywhere besides state transfer and leader to non-leader dissemination?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:25:20 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean anywhere
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:25:46 GMT):<br/>
as a function for fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:25:52 GMT):<br/>
are these the only two functional interactions that gossis is involved in?  1)  state transfer and 2 ) leader to non-leader dissemination
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:26:03 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:26:59 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 15:35:23 GMT):<br/>
I am running a test, with two orgs, create a channel, and attempt peers to join the channel but I see error in peer logs; gossip is saying: "Tried joining channel test1 but our org( DEFAULT ), isn't among the orgs of the channel: [PeerOrg1 PeerOrg2] , aborting."  Can anyone suggest anything that might be configured wrong? Why is gossip on the peer using "DEFAULT" instead of PeerOrg1? I am trying to run this inside vagrant, using PTE and node sdk; a colleague does not see the error when running same test without using vagrant, so I think the certs are all correct, which is why I am confused.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 15:37:03 GMT):<br/>
Immediately after, I see another log (I think the ascii translation of the bytes is "testOrg1"):    [gossip/gossip#172.19.0.5:7051] UpdateChannelMetadata -> DEBU 2c0 No such channel [116 101 115 116 79 114 103 49]

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 17:20:46 GMT):<br/>
Hey @scottz .
This is a message that the gossip layer prints in order to notify to the operator that the peer's MSP-ID (DEFAULT) isn't one of the organizations in the configuration block.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 17:21:08 GMT):<br/>
I guess the peer has started with a wrong MSP ID config
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 17:21:32 GMT):<br/>
the certs might be ok but the MSP_ID isn't derived from the certs, but from `core/peer.yaml`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 17:22:25 GMT):<br/>
now, the "No such channel" message you see- is that the gossip component received a metadata update invocation from the peer (upper layers) but since the "join channel" on the gossip failed, it doesn't know what to do with it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 17:23:16 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/peer/core.yaml#L240 this sets that value
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 18:08:22 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  In docker-compose.yml, for peer0 and peer1, we had set CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Peer1MSP, which should override the value "DEFAULT" defined in fabric/peer/core.yaml.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 18:10:08 GMT):<br/>
Even so- why is it Peer1MSP and not as the log error wants you to? PeerOrg1?
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 19:34:56 GMT):<br/>
Peer1MSP is the ID of the organization. (DEFAULT is the chainID too.) PeerOrg1 is the Name.orgListFromConfig() returns the list of names.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 19:38:18 GMT):<br/>
They *have* to be the same in the configtx.yaml 
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:02:17 GMT):<br/>
Ummm, that makes no sense. First, the code should not print an ID and compare it to names. Second: then why do we have two variables? We should eliminate one. Third: values are not the same for example in fabric/common/configtx/tool/configtx.yaml Organizations / &OrdererOrg1 (Name:OrdererOrg1, ID:Orderer1MSP)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:05:13 GMT):<br/>
>  First, the code should not print an ID and compare it to names
Which code? The code that prints the log you described in gossip?
> Second: then why do we have two variables? We should eliminate one. 
I have said that long ago, but I do not make the calls. And I guess you mean two config options, not variables, right?
> Third: values are not the same for example in fabric/common/configtx/tool/configtx.yaml
They should be the same for the peers, if you want things to work.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:08:19 GMT):<br/>
yes. yes. yes, ok. I will create 3 bugs for these items, and a 4th bug for the original error I was asking about "Tried joining channel ...".  Maybe one or more will not be fixed, but we will try.

@scottz hi, can you please explain, how misconfiguration turned to be the bug?

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:15:25 GMT):<br/>
I mean there is clearly wrong configuration provided

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:15:35 GMT):<br/>
what is the bug here?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:16:27 GMT):<br/>
So I understand that misconfiguration itself is a bug, but you just need to fix and provide a correct one
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:16:45 GMT):<br/>
or you would like to be alerted in different way?

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:16:55 GMT):<br/>
also how this gossip related?
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:17:39 GMT):<br/>
1. bug is for inconsistency in the log:  "our org ( ID ) isn't among ( list of Org Names )". 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:17:54 GMT):<br/>
This is not an inconsistency
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:18:02 GMT):<br/>
this is on purpose
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:18:07 GMT):<br/>
it prints the name of your org
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:18:13 GMT):<br/>
and the names of the orgs in the block
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:18:18 GMT):<br/>
no it does not.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:18:22 GMT):<br/>
it prints the ID of the org
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:18:36 GMT):<br/>
and the names of the orgs in the block.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:19:25 GMT):<br/>
(2.) The whole thing about the name and ID being required to be the same ... I will create a different bug for that one.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:19:36 GMT):<br/>
exactly!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:19:43 GMT):<br/>
that's what its supposed to print :)
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:22:15 GMT):<br/>
why don't you just print both the org name AND org ID and state that the org name and ID must match for gossip to work, plus it must be in the list of possible org names
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:22:43 GMT):<br/>
 ... if indeed that is a requirement - and I have not heard a reason WHY that must be so.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:23:02 GMT):<br/>
there is no such thing as org name
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:23:37 GMT):<br/>
to the peer there is only org ID
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:23:50 GMT):<br/>
as for the rest
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:24:31 GMT):<br/>
it's up to the operator of the environment to take care that the org ID of the peer matches one of the orgs in the config block
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:25:01 GMT):<br/>
>  ... if indeed that is a requirement - and I have not heard a reason WHY that must be so. 
OK, this is a different problem, still not a bug though. maybe a JIRA story at best

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:27:36 GMT):<br/>
> ... if indeed that is a requirement - and I have not heard a reason WHY that must be so.
^^^ This is very explicit requirement, since you need to make sure peer belongs to the org and eligible to participate

<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:38:24 GMT):<br/>
ok.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:40:48 GMT):<br/>
And I still say your code illegally compares an ID with Names (even if they are "suppposed to be the same"), and it would help if you printed both the name and the ID in this log. Can you agree to that?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:41:13 GMT):<br/>
No, because I only have access to one of them
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:41:19 GMT):<br/>
That's the API we were given
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:41:29 GMT):<br/>
I work with what I have
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:46:58 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/common/config/api.go#L48
This ^ is the API that needs to be changed in order to support what you want
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:48:17 GMT):<br/>
You're basically saying- why are 2 configuration attributes are in the configtx.yaml file, but they need to be the same?
I agree, but the people that are in charge of the config, and on the API above that I put in the link are roaming in the #fabric-consensus  channel :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:48:36 GMT):<br/>
I can not do anything about that, as I only consume an API that I was given.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:52:59 GMT):<br/>
How can they have anything to say about the PEER's Name and ID config parameters? Or are you saying they must match within an Orderer org too?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:53:22 GMT):<br/>
it has nothing to do with a peer's name
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:53:43 GMT):<br/>
a peer belongs to some organization
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:53:51 GMT):<br/>
the organization is identified by the MSP id
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:55:36 GMT):<br/>
Having said that, @scottz I'm off for the rest of the night. 
If you have deeper questions about the configuration I suggest you ask in #fabric-consensus  as they are responsible for that.
If you have further questions about gossip, you are free to ask here.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=neqQ3pPjWFvTrAyPK) @yacovm Actually, Organizations returns ApplicationOrg, which contains Org, which contains method MSPID() in addition to Name(). Maybe that method did not exist before, but it seems to me that you can add a bit of code to orgListFromConfig() that digs a bit deeper for the MSPID instead of just taking the Name? Then you would be comparing ID to a list of IDs, and you would not be forcing user to set ID equal to Name.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 06 Apr 2017 16:34:06 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, @scottz , nice observation! :) @C0rWin  what do you think? 
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Thu, 06 Apr 2017 16:50:34 GMT):<br/>
thanks. I agree that seems to be the best solution, and would clean up all the items I mentioned. hopefully that will work.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 07 Apr 2017 13:33:02 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm @C0rWin can you guys add a note to FAB-2499 (and maybe change the title), and take ownership of it, to get that done? if so, then I won't create any more bugs/issues.
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 07 Apr 2017 13:34:37 GMT):<br/>

@yacovm In a two peer organization when CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=true for an anchor peer in each organization, while CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=false only on non-anchor peers, then processing transactions on those non-anchor peers fails with following error
```

Is this a valid configuation ? If not, then why not ?

you have a peer in one of the organizations that is set to ORGLEADER=true and the other peer shows you this error?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 16:54:11 GMT):<br/>
Anyway- I just checked:
I modified and set useleaderelection to false in the peer-base and then turned on orgleader on the anchor peers, and ran the e2e test and it passed
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 16:54:24 GMT):<br/>
so "works for me" :)
</p>
<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:14:53 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm My bad , I should have tried e2e_cli example too , I was using docker-compose file from node-sdk repo https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/test/fixtures/docker-compose.yaml

The difference I see between thes two docker-compose files is that , In e2e_cli example we have `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_SKIPHANDSHAKE=true`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:15:15 GMT):<br/>
yep. that should be there too.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:15:23 GMT):<br/>
but you could've also looked at the logs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:15:29 GMT):<br/>
gossip complains when this option isn't set
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:15:33 GMT):<br/>

Invokes/Query on anchor peer works but fails on non-anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:22:43 GMT):<br/>
ah because they can't communicate because of TLS expects mutual-TLS, unless SKIPHANDSHAKE is true
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:22:47 GMT):<br/>
we don't have mutual TLS yet
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:22:52 GMT):<br/>
so we use on-way TLS
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:23:14 GMT):<br/>
since you made one non-leader and one-leader, if they can't communicate... they can't send each other blocks

Does it only make sense to set a gossip external endpoint on a peer that has been designated an anchor peer as defined in a configtx.yaml file?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 18:14:35 GMT):<br/>
So- I'd say, anchor peers *should have* external endpoints
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 18:14:44 GMT):<br/>
for other peers- depends on installation.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 18:15:26 GMT):<br/>
if you think a peer has an external endpoint (routable from other orgs) and you have a mechanism for resurrecting it, in case it dies, I'd advise simply make it an anchor peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 18:15:32 GMT):<br/>
you can have many anchor peers per org

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 06:03:09 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda clients don't have the code to speak with peers. I'm not sure what is your concern here
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 06:04:17 GMT):<br/>
You should be worried from something else, I'd say- that someone takes a peer, and gives it a client certificate, and that will be validated. No?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 10:56:58 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand - they can download the peer code from github :)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 10:58:05 GMT):<br/>
My concern is that a client who got a certificate and with that is allowed to pretend to be a peer, they could intercept all the gossip traffic
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 10:58:30 GMT):<br/>
This must not be allowed especially since clients should not see all the data in the ledger network.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:10:03 GMT):<br/>
If you are implying that not having user chaincode takes away the attack, this is not the case -- the blocks and gossip traffic can have sensitive data that doesn't require code to interpret.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:16:02 GMT):<br/>
user chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:16:33 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:17:13 GMT):<br/>
In gossip, in order for 2 peers to communicate they need to perform a secure handshake
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:17:56 GMT):<br/>
the secure handshake uses the signing identity of the peer (meaning- the peer needs a private key, and a peer's identity)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:19:50 GMT):<br/>
Now... if from some reason, a client's certificate and a client's private can be used for that - that's a problem but there is nothing that can be done in the gossip code for that since we just use the MSP infrastructure
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:20:42 GMT):<br/>
ok - i mentioned the chaincode because that's the code the client wouldn't have. the rest of the peer code, they can obtain.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:20:51 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:24:04 GMT):<br/>
it also depends on the MSP types that you have in the system
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:24:50 GMT):<br/>
if for example you have both an MSP of type X and an MSP of type Y, and the PKI- infrastructure of the "network" only provides identities of type X to clients, and identities of type Y to peers, then you're safe, no?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:27:28 GMT):<br/>

aha I see
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:29:09 GMT):<br/>
You're saying the following:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:29:48 GMT):<br/>
since a client can connect to a peer, it means its certificate is (perhaps) likely to be validated by the peer's MSP - and that means that a client's certificate can be used as a peer certficate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:29:50 GMT):<br/>
right?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:30:16 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:31:55 GMT):<br/>
Well- I'd say it's a sound concern, but it's not a gossip issue at all :) 
We just blindly invoke methods that the MSP layer provides. If the MSP layer can make it so a client's certificate can not be validated by the implementation of the API between gossip and the MSP, then you're safe.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:32:56 GMT):<br/>
i hear ya - i was just browsing the gossip code to see if there was something additional (didn't find so asked) :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:33:18 GMT):<br/>
understood. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:34:58 GMT):<br/>
The API I'm talking about, @troyronda  is in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/gossip/api/crypto.go btw
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:39:59 GMT):<br/>
Right, essentially currently peers implicitly include in their "trustzone" nodes that are members of the same msp as the peer (have valid identities under the same MSP). The underlying assumption was here that msps map to orgs in a 1-1 fashion and that clients and peers do not need to be distinguished.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:52:29 GMT):<br/>

@yacovm I'm looking for more info on the differences between the way peers talk to each other -- "information-scoped messages" as referenced here https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8273/1 by @elli-androulaki -- when the peers were given their certs by multiple CA instances as compared to entirely separate MSPs (operating in one consortium/network whathaveyou)
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:31:17 GMT):<br/>
How would it influence decision making on behalf of potential users about whether to go with a single MSP with multiple instances as compared to multiple MSPs. I'm new to the docs team so I realize this might not be the ideal question/way to phrase the question
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:33:10 GMT):<br/>
can you point me to the line please?
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:34:54 GMT):<br/>
Lines 76 and 85. And I'm sorry, it's "organization scoped messages" not "information"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:35:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:35:24 GMT):<br/>
Sure. I appreciate it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:35:46 GMT):<br/>
So in gossip there are messages that are sent between peers that are about a specific channel - in example, ledger blocks, or metadata information
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:36:10 GMT):<br/>
and the rest are messages sent between peers just for maintaining the infrastructure itself, like membership
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:36:44 GMT):<br/>
Maintaining it how? A "hey is everyone still here?" kind of thing?
</p>

Yeah I've got that. I'm working on gathering some information on a "best practices" doc and I wanted some more info on the differences. Is this ability to "maintain the infrastructure" a feature important enough that it might influence network starters on how they set up membership services?

<p><strong>s.narayanan</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:33:27 GMT):<br/>
is it possible to turn gossip off ? Specifically we have a scenario where we have 2 orgs with 2 endorser nodes, each node being set up to receive blocks directly from orderer. In this scenario, the client is asking if gossip can be turned off altogether.  Appreciate instructions on how to do this. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:38:34 GMT):<br/>
Can you share why is the client asking such a request? 
Is there some other problem that he's trying to avoid?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:40:25 GMT):<br/>
Is it a logging verbosity issue?
You can make all peers connect directly to the ordering service by toggling these 2 environment variables:
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L74-L83
The above makes the peer connect to the ordering service regardless what other peers say. 
</p>
<p><strong>s.narayanan</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:57:58 GMT):<br/>
They are just interested in knowing if this is mandatory to use because in a small scale deployment they see it as unnecessary overhead. They understand as the number of nodes scale , there is benefit to using it.  Presume that if you want peers to connect to orderer, you need to specify use leader election: false and orgleader: true. However I presume in this case gossip is still used under the covers?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 15:12:50 GMT):<br/>
It is always used if you have anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 15:12:55 GMT):<br/>
Or bootstrap peers
</p>
<p><strong>s.narayanan</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 15:41:37 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm   thanks.  Logical question is if it necessary to specify either (anchor or bootstrap).   Is it fair to say there is no way to disable gossip?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 16:34:45 GMT):<br/>
well if you have 0 anchor peers in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 16:34:50 GMT):<br/>
in every channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 16:34:59 GMT):<br/>
and also no bootstrap peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 16:35:09 GMT):<br/>
then gossip doesn't do anything
</p>
<p><strong>s.narayanan</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 17:27:37 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thanks

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=eGDdJq3P4nmY8mp9x) @troyronda @elli-androulaki So today we cannot differentiate if a transaction was initiated by a client or a peer? Or which client (if I have multiple)?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 07:02:07 GMT):<br/>
@rmohta, this is correct; at least the type of the identity is not exposed directly by the interface of the MSP. However, one can leverage the OU field in X.509 certificates and an OU suffice/prefix to denote a peer/client.
</p>
<p><strong>rmohta</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 18:13:59 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=5nQvaHydFMF7LfZsA) @elli-androulaki Cool. One last question - is that (OU field) something we can extract in chaincode? Or it should be SDK's job to send that as part of invoke to chain code?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Sat, 13 May 2017 18:07:54 GMT):<br/>
@rmohta, the chaincode can obtain the transaction creator's identity (marschalled SerializedIdentity structure). SerializedIdentity consists of the msp identifier of the MSP that identity belongs to and (for the default and only MSP supported currently by Fabric) a marshalled X.509 certificate. 
The OU field is exportable currently only by manually (at the chaincode side) unmarshalling the creator's identity and the subsequent X.509 cert structure and leveraging X.509 cert lib to obtain the OU field. 
In the future this will be easier as we will provide either some extension to the SHIM or some invocable system chaincode that would provide membership service provider calls based on the state of each MSP on the channel/chain.

hello guys , maybe this question is a bit silly, does the orderer delivers blocks to commiter by gossip?
</p>
<p><strong>rocket.cat</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 05:33:55 GMT):<br/>
Well hello there, Willson
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 06:34:12 GMT):<br/>
@Willson some peers connect to the ordering service themselves and some not.
Those that do not, receive blocks from other peers, via gossip
</p>
<p><strong>Willson</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 06:57:00 GMT):<br/>
thanks yacovm, how the peers that connect to the ordering service get block ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 08:45:14 GMT):<br/>
@Willson via gRPC.
in short - The peer sends a `Deliver` request to the ordering service with a descriptor of what to fetch (channel, which block to start from, etc.) and then it keeps the connection open and whenever new blocks are formed, they are pushed to the peer.

 Are only anchor peers of an organization allowed to gossip with (anchor) peers of other organizations?

@yacovm As I expected. but what port does the orderer connect to with peers?  7050? except for this not found in the configtx.yaml file and env variable

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 09:23:32 GMT):<br/>

Hi folks. Say if I got a peer removed from the network for some days and then rejoin, what would happen on that peer? I guess it would first connect to the anchor peer and then sync the chain information from another peer. How that rejoined peer to decide which peer to get information from?

In the documentation on Gossip messaging:
</p>
<p><strong>bmkor</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 14:14:45 GMT):<br/>
"Peers maintain channel membership by collecting these alive messages; if no peer receives an alive message from a specific peer, this "dead" peer is eventually purged from channel membership."
</p>
<p><strong>bmkor</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 14:15:10 GMT):<br/>
Where are these alive or dead information saved?

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 14:17:30 GMT):<br/>
@bmkor this information is not persisted anywhere, it's maintained internally inside discovery layer

My thought: suppose the randomness is uniform, the expected time for choosing a particular peer, r, would be `E(T_r) = 1*(n/N) = n/N` and the expected total time to choose all peers is `Sum E(T_r) = N*(n/N) = N` [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=eq2FtxoYq6jftS8T7) @yacovm

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:29:57 GMT):<br/>
well every node sends an alive message once per about 5 seconds
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:30:12 GMT):<br/>
so if you're a new node in the network
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:30:26 GMT):<br/>
5 seconds passed and you send an alive to other nodes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:30:55 GMT):<br/>
after 5 seconds these nodes would send you (but indirectly) an alive message too
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:31:07 GMT):<br/>
so you "know about them" after that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:31:22 GMT):<br/>
if you asked how much until you have actually communicated with all of them
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 06:32:13 GMT):<br/>
depends if you want an expectence (E(X)) or an upper bound. But why do you ask? Why is this important?

<p><strong>bmkor</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 09:18:53 GMT):<br/>

@bmkor so basically a peer may get blocks from the ordering service directly or via some other peer

What is the "default" state of gossip leader and gossip election? in other words, if someone downloads Fabric, builds the docker images, and ups the network without anything on the dockercompose files regarding gossip-----what will be the value of leder_election and is_leader?

yes

</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:49:07 GMT):<br/>
yes, the non leader, the one that was restarted 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:50:23 GMT):<br/>
so you stopped the non leader in org2, did an invoke on org1, then started the peer in org2 that was restarted and waited for the query to give the right result
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:50:24 GMT):<br/>
right?

and second- ok now I get what you mean
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:31:28 GMT):<br/>
yeah there is indeed that dev mode thing
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:31:41 GMT):<br/>
anyway I wouldn't worry about it - it's DEBUG message
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:31:42 GMT):<br/>
not WARN
</p>
<p><strong>lprao</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:34:38 GMT):<br/>
hmm, but peer2 does not execute the chaincode(chaincode_example02) and so the ledger is empty
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:34:48 GMT):<br/>
it has nothing to do with gossip
</p>
<p><strong>lprao</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:35:05 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>lprao</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:36:06 GMT):<br/>
which is the right channel to discuss this issue? i have tried chaincode-dev but haven't heard back.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:36:34 GMT):<br/>
what issue
</p>
<p><strong>lprao</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:37:08 GMT):<br/>
the chaincode not running on peer2.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:37:26 GMT):<br/>
ah I guess either #fabric  or #chaincode-dev 
</p>
<p><strong>lprao</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:37:43 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks.

<p><strong>s.narayanan</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:52:41 GMT):<br/>
How do I disable gossip protocol? Specifically scenario where  the peers need to connect directly to the orderer to deliver block. Appreciate instruction/guidance to do this
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:53:32 GMT):<br/>
you can take these 2 configuration keys https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L87-L92
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:53:40 GMT):<br/>
set `orgLeader` to true
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:53:45 GMT):<br/>
and the `useLeaderElection` to false
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:54:03 GMT):<br/>
but this doesn't really disable gossip, just makes all the peers to connect to the ordering service
</p>
<p><strong>s.narayanan</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:56:05 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thanks. since we are using docker images for peers presume this has to be done through an environment variable setting in docker  compose file? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:56:26 GMT):<br/>
yes.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:56:31 GMT):<br/>
make all the characters uppercase
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:56:34 GMT):<br/>
and also
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:56:44 GMT):<br/>
prefix with: CORE_PEER_GOSSIP
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:56:55 GMT):<br/>
i.e CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=true
</p>
<p><strong>s.narayanan</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:00:47 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thanks. Presume it would also be CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION=false. Also what is the reason disabling gossip protocol is not supported?  If all peers are leaders one can presumably avoid the chattiness of gossip protocol? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:01:21 GMT):<br/>
just don't put anything in the anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:01:26 GMT):<br/>
and don't put anything in the bootstrap peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:01:30 GMT):<br/>
and this effectively disables
</p>
<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:07:29 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm what do you mean by 'don't put anything in the anchor peers'   do you mean don't actually define any, or something else?   (same question for bootstrap peers)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:09:35 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:10:08 GMT):<br/>
not to define any
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:10:24 GMT):<br/>
yes

I will add a patch to provide more meaningful error message and handle the failure more graceful, rather than panicking with simple stack trace

hi, i have a question. the e2e_cli example network is used. i want to deploy peer0, pee1, orderer, couchdb on manager host, and peer2, peer3 and cli on worker host.
to simplify the deploy, the volume option is skipped by below steps:
1. start up network_setup.sh and do not run any command, i.e. orderer, peer node start.
2. backup volume directories using `tar cvf fabric.tar ./dirs` on the containers and export the containers into tar files.
3. import the tar files, run the images and restore volume directories by `tar xvf fabric.tar`
4. export again the containers, now the images will have all the files required to run.
the docker swarm are installed on the two hosts. and a overlay network is created on the manager host. when starting the network, and `docker logs peer0`, there is a panic error.

<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 15:52:32 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  I think it was you who previously provided to me some helpful information. I have 2 followup questions:
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 15:52:54 GMT):<br/>
"A reasoning behind having bootstrap peers is to peers of the organization to find each other and
to know each other before you make some of them join the channel."
  --->  QUESTION: Why is this helpful?

"Another reasoning is that technically you can create a channel without any anchor peer in your organization.
So having a bootstrap peer(s) for your org is very very important in such a case."
  --->  QUESTION: Why would you do this, in production network?

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 15:53:03 GMT):<br/>
I try not to provide unhelpful information if I can
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 15:55:06 GMT):<br/>
> Why is this helpful?
Because if you take a look, for example - in the e2e - first you create a channel without any anchor peers, and then you send 2 subsequent config transactions that add anchor peers.
Now, in case the peers are configured to use leader election, without bootstrap peers they won't see each other at channel join, and will all connect to the ordering service, until the config update that adds anchor peers would happen for each organization.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 15:55:36 GMT):<br/>
Now if they had anchor peers, they could upon channel join - do leader election, and then not all to connect to the ordering service
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 15:56:31 GMT):<br/>
>  QUESTION: Why would you do this, in production network?
because you have access control over the config items of various organizations, so the admin that creates the channel, say from orgA - can't add into the genesis block, anchor peer of orgB
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:00:15 GMT):<br/>
Also another important thing
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:00:25 GMT):<br/>
if you have a set of peers, and they are configured not to use leader election
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:00:35 GMT):<br/>
and only 1 of them is configured to be a leader with `orgLeader=true`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:00:38 GMT):<br/>
the rest is false
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:00:46 GMT):<br/>
well, and you don't have bootstrap peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:01:15 GMT):<br/>
the ones that have the `orgLeader=false` won't be able to get the config block that adds anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:02:52 GMT):<br/>
In the second question - ok, so it makes sense that each admin could add their own anchor peer. But, if all the peers in one particular organization get restarted at same time, or a new org is added, then I think they would need to know an anchor peer in ANOTHER org, or else they couldn't sync up state database. Hmmm... or maybe could they simply get all the necessary blocks from the orderer again, and (re)create their state database that way?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:04:36 GMT):<br/>
an anchor peer in another org works though
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:04:39 GMT):<br/>
what's the problem?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:05:01 GMT):<br/>
when peers are restarted they don't need to re-create their state database
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:05:03 GMT):<br/>
it's persisted
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:05:20 GMT):<br/>

Just trying to think of various (not-so-happy-path) scenarios.   So... it seems we really DO need to use anchor peers, one in each org, or we could not reconfig to add a new org to an existing network.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:09:38 GMT):<br/>
no, that's not true
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:09:43 GMT):<br/>
you can always use leaderElection
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:09:48 GMT):<br/>
and then you don't need anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:09:48 GMT):<br/>
and then you don't need all anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:10:02 GMT):<br/>
then, they are just "nice to have"
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:16:40 GMT):<br/>
Using bootstrap peers and leader election would allow the peers in an org to work together, but they could not sync state database from other orgs without contacting an anchor peer in another org. Wouldn't they need to do that? it seems you are saying, in the case of restarting all peers in one org, that they would not need to do so. But in the case of adding a new org, is it necessary? (or maybe not because the new org should NOT have access to the blocks that existed before the new org was added.)

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:27:40 GMT):<br/>
well but don't forget - you just need 1 anchor peer 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:27:42 GMT):<br/>
to be alive
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:27:55 GMT):<br/>
and if all peers know about it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:27:59 GMT):<br/>
they can contact it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:28:12 GMT):<br/>
an anchor peer isn't a gateway or something
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:38:51 GMT):<br/>
OK. But if there are no anchor peers anywhere, and if we are booting the first new peer in a channel in a newly added org, could that peer get all blocks from orderer? In other words, can we function without anchorpeers, and should we test that configuration?  (I have heard that if the ledger is huge, then the orderer might not deliver all the blocks in the channel ledger, which means the peer would be required to sync the whole blockchain from another peer, which means an anchor peer in another organziation, since this is the first peer to come up in a new org.) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:42:07 GMT):<br/>
well if there are no anchor peers anywhere and you're booting the first new peer in a channel on a new org, so obviously that peer doesn't know anyone else but itself, right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:42:35 GMT):<br/>
so it can only obtain blocks from the ordering service
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:42:41 GMT):<br/>
but I don't see where you're getting at
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:43:42 GMT):<br/>
> which means the peer would be required to sync the whole blockchain from another peer, which means an anchor peer in another organziation, since this is the first peer to come up in a new org
Well it doesn't work that way. You not always choose to sync from an anchor peer. It depends on if you know other peers or not
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:44:38 GMT):<br/>
also you do it in "batches"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:44:44 GMT):<br/>
each batch you select a peer again
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:44:56 GMT):<br/>
so you probably won't select the same peer over and over
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:45:01 GMT):<br/>
unless it's.... the only one you know

<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 21:25:53 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  ok, that helps. In summary: If we want to configure a network, without anchor peers, it could work. In that case, we would have to use a bootstrap peer in each org, and every other initialized peer in an org would contact the bootstrap_peer. The first orgleader peer in an org would retrieve the whole blockchain from the orderer, and new peers would sync state from that one (or from neighbor peers).
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 22:18:35 GMT):<br/>
Someone else asks: in my scenario, where we start and join first peer in a newly added org (and it is orgleader), when the other orgs do have anchor peers: the peer is the only one in its org. Does it sync from anchor peer(s) in other orgs, or does it read/deliver all blocks from orderer, or both?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 22:41:16 GMT):<br/>
leader election is per channel and organization, hence if peer is the only one node in the org, it will be declared a leader, connect to the ordering service and pull the blocks

New questions. We are considering a test (without leader election) to set exactly 2 leaders per org, instead of just one. Is that recommended? I would think so, in case one stops. And the peers would get their blocks from whichever leader is operating, right?

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:02:15 GMT):<br/>
what is the scenario exactly?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:02:23 GMT):<br/>
have 2 leaders statically configured
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:02:27 GMT):<br/>
and some number of other peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:02:34 GMT):<br/>
and "stop" on of the leaders?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:02:44 GMT):<br/>
and to ensure blocks still reach the other peers?
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:03:04 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:03:45 GMT):<br/>
You can test it, if you want
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:05:09 GMT):<br/>
oh, that raises another question. Do all the nonleader peers get the new blocks from an orgleader directly? Or if we had 10 peers, could some remote peers get from neighboring nonleaders.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:05:31 GMT):<br/>
the latter
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:08:40 GMT):<br/>
ok cool.  And I guess my first question was more to get confirmation that the network of peers within an org is somewhat dynamic. e.g. if one peer gets its blocks from orgleader1, and orgleader1 goes down, then it would get blocks via orgleader2 (instead of waiting for orgleader1 to restart and retrieve all the missed blocks itself from teh orderer and forward them). I guess you answered that already that the peers could get blocks via any orgleader. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:10:47 GMT):<br/>
I was talking about multiple leaders in the same org
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:10:50 GMT):<br/>
just to be sure
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:10:58 GMT):<br/>
obtaining blocks from other orgs is *sloooow*
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:11:38 GMT):<br/>
sorry. yes that is all I meant - from other orgleaders within the same org.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:12:51 GMT):<br/>
But that raises another question. I thought I saw a "fix" merged a few weeks ago that prevents blocks to be shared between orgs. I must have misunderstood, since you are saying we definitely CAN get blocks from different orgs.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:13:28 GMT):<br/>
yeah but we have 2 ways of doing that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:13:40 GMT):<br/>
it disabled one of them ;)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:14:01 GMT):<br/>
Nice tracking though
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:14:05 GMT):<br/>
ok.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:14:26 GMT):<br/>
if I ever want to hire a private eye I would know where to look for
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:14:49 GMT):<br/>
thanks. Then... are there any criteria / restrictions about the sharing across orgs?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:15:07 GMT):<br/>
yeah, the block needs to be committed into the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:15:13 GMT):<br/>
only such blocks can be shared across orgs
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:17:22 GMT):<br/>
The only usecase I can think of ... if useLeaderElection=false and if there are no orgleaders running in one org, then those peers could get blocks from other org. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:18:14 GMT):<br/>
Well they can always get them regardless
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:36:43 GMT):<br/>
Based on values in fabric/sampleconfig/core.yaml (except all peers have useLeaderElection=true and orgLeader=false),  when I stop an orgleader peer, how long can I expect for the next leader to be elected (worst case)?  Is it membershipSampleInterval + leaderAliveThreshold + leaderElectionDuration (16s)?

@yacovm the idea is to redirect certain connections, so all peer grpc services. I think client to docker to docker is easy. I think my error is coming from not setting up the gossip properly. For example, in my case, i do not know why org2 tries to connect to the port specified for org1.

and why?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 08:19:49 GMT):<br/>
you simply want the peer not to connect to the ordering service or you want it not to be able to connect at all?

@yacovm I want to test my network with network delays and package loss. The only way i see, apart from blocking the entire veth of a peer, is to block a specific communication channel. 
What i am trying to do is make the orderer broadcast eventually not reach one peer (e.g. peer0).

</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 08:25:47 GMT):<br/>
you can have decent network setup with docker, while leveraging blockade you can test different network disruption use cases

I am trying to use iptables but it does not seem to have the effect that i want on the network. @C0rWin i was not aware of this tool, seems like exactly what i need. Will take a look at it today. Thank you both
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 11:43:35 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin nice tool but as far as i have tested i can isolate a container like with tc or iptables on the veth of a container. But i do not want to delay every incoming connection. I would like to delay only the path from a -> b, and not everything that goes to b. But thank you anyway. I am open for new suggestions.

@yacovm Hi, I have a question regarding to whether and how a peer can detect a missing block in its ledger. In Fabric, each peer maintains a full copy of the ledger/blockchain (let's assume there is only one channel in the network). What will happen if a peer lost one of its blocks in the blockchain (e.g. another process on the peer accidentally wiped out the disk area that stores the block)? Will this peer be able to detect that this block is missing? If yes, how will the peer detect it and how is it going to repair? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 15:07:31 GMT):<br/>
as long as you have the first block and you're able to communicate with peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 15:07:38 GMT):<br/>
you will reach some peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 15:07:44 GMT):<br/>
and sync from its blocks
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 15:08:24 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I see, but how is a peer going to detect that a block is missing? Does a peer periodically scan its ledger?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 15:10:13 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't need to periodically scan 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 15:10:19 GMT):<br/>
it keeps track of the block number
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 15:10:24 GMT):<br/>
and sees the block numbers of his friends
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 15:10:28 GMT):<br/>
they gossip this data
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 15:14:55 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Thanks! I understand, but still not that clear. Let's say in a network of 4 peers (peer1 to peer4), peer1 - peer3 all have block 1,2,3,4,5,6, but peer 4 only has block 1,3,4,5,6. When will peer 4 see the block numbers of the other peers and find that it is missing block 2?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 20:18:32 GMT):<br/>
define the external endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 20:18:36 GMT):<br/>
in the config
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 20:57:14 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Do I also need to configure TLS settings to ensure an Org1 peer can talk to an Org2 peer? (I'm using a default network setup like fabric/examples/e2e_cli)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 20:57:35 GMT):<br/>
good question
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 20:57:44 GMT):<br/>
when you make the peers join the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 20:57:49 GMT):<br/>
fabric will do that for you ;)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 20:57:58 GMT):<br/>
(magic)
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 17:10:45 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm trying to gain some insight into the magic :)
Are the trusted roots for TLS configured based on the Organization CAs for each channel?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 18:56:22 GMT):<br/>
Yeah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 18:56:33 GMT):<br/>
So basically when you define a channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 18:56:44 GMT):<br/>
You put in the genesis block the root CA certs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 18:57:15 GMT):<br/>
When the peers get them, they update their root ca cert pool
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 18:57:32 GMT):<br/>
For the connections between peers

@yacov Regarding https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/11377/ , is there an error log that announces that the peer dropped a gossip message? It would be good to announce a block was dropped. 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 21:56:27 GMT):<br/>
Since the other peers don't know what they never received, what happens later, after dropping blocks 500-1000, when traffic slows down? Does block number 1001 get delivered and disseminated to all the peers? Do all the nonleader peers ever get the missed blocks? Won't they become confused when they notice the gap in blocknumbers? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:01:39 GMT):<br/>
It is logged 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:02:08 GMT):<br/>
But that change set isn't related
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:02:08 GMT):<br/>
But that change set isn't related to dropping a message
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:02:46 GMT):<br/>
I think you have a mistake in the change set, Scott
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:05:59 GMT):<br/>
I know you didn't add a log with that changeset. I just wanted to know if there was a log - what we can look for while testing to see if a block/message gets dropped. Can you share exactly what it looks like?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:08:15 GMT):<br/>
wait
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:08:20 GMT):<br/>
let's make sure we are in sync
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:08:51 GMT):<br/>
are you talking about dropping messages *because of overflow (too many messages per second)* or dropping messages of blocks that are not verified?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:09:04 GMT):<br/>
the change set you linked refers to the latter
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:10:53 GMT):<br/>
I did mean the first one. But now that you mention it, can you answer both?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:11:25 GMT):<br/>
so the 2nd one - is printed https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/11377/4/gossip/gossip/channel/channel.go@428
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:12:18 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:12:26 GMT):<br/>
the latter - nope, not printed. 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/gossip/comm/conn.go#L262-L263
We can add a print post v1 in DEBUG
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:12:26 GMT):<br/>
the former  - nope, not printed. 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/gossip/comm/conn.go#L262-L263
We can add a print post v1 in DEBUG
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:13:02 GMT):<br/>
That's odd, I was sure we had a DEBUG print, I guess it got deleted
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:14:29 GMT):<br/>
we can create a jira for that.  hmmm. If I lose a block on the send buffer, then another peer will not receive a block. That seems more serious than a DEBUG log.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:14:45 GMT):<br/>
It's not that simple
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:14:46 GMT):<br/>
you just compromised the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:14:48 GMT):<br/>
it's much more complicated
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:14:50 GMT):<br/>
nah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:15:01 GMT):<br/>
I'll elaborate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:15:48 GMT):<br/>
If you lose a block via a connection buffer overflow, the block may still get to that peer via a different peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:16:12 GMT):<br/>
also - in gossip we have reconciliation
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:16:30 GMT):<br/>
eventually you will see that you're missing a block that some other peer has
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:16:38 GMT):<br/>
and you would fetch the block from that peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:17:58 GMT):<br/>
BTW dropping messages is probably the *only thing* you can do if you have to "keep the system running". 
Otherwise - the system may deadlock
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:17:58 GMT):<br/>
BTW dropping messages is probably the *only thing* you can do if you have to "keep the system running". 
Otherwise - the system may get "Stuck"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:18:54 GMT):<br/>
think about it - if you have a network where you input data into it in a rate that exceeds the network consumption - you will get stuck. 
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:23:36 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. ok. then the way to test this would be to run bursty traffic for awhile, and then after a longer while can query and confirm all blocks eventually were delivered to all peers.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:24:33 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:24:48 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:27:05 GMT):<br/>
Hello. Where can i define the peers that the orderer should message on broadcast? Is it `AnchorPeers`?
</p>
<p><strong>yifanxiang</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:27:38 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:30:37 GMT):<br/>
There is leader election mechanism which engages selection of peers which connects to ordering service, basically no need to manually define it
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:31:52 GMT):<br/>
if you need it, you can turn leader election off and make static selection, but please note, that this approach is not resilient to failures and if your peer which connects to ordering service will fails, you will have to bring him up again manually 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:32:39 GMT):<br/>
in case of leader election on, such peer will be reselected once failure will be detected (a few seconds)
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:33:10 GMT):<br/>
@SotirisAlfonsos ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:34:19 GMT):<br/>
this is a part of `core.yaml` you might be interesting in

    # Gossip related configuration
    gossip:
        # Bootstrap set to initialize gossip with.
        # This is a list of other peers that this peer reaches out to at startup.
        # Important: The endpoints here have to be endpoints of peers in the same
        # organization, because the peer would refuse connecting to these endpoints
        # unless they are in the same organization as the peer.
        bootstrap: 127.0.0.1:7051

        # NOTE: orgLeader and useLeaderElection parameters are mutual exclusive.
        # Setting both to true would result in the termination of the peer
        # since this is undefined state. If the peers are configured with
        # useLeaderElection=false, make sure there is at least 1 peer in the
        # organization that its orgLeader is set to true.

        # Defines whenever peer will initialize dynamic algorithm for

        # use leader election for large networks of peers.
        useLeaderElection: false
        # Statically defines peer to be an organization "leader",

        orgLeader: true
```
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:35:14 GMT):<br/>
you either use leader election, hence making `useLeaderElection:true` or select peer as a leader statically `orgLeader: true`....
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:35:27 GMT):<br/>
these parameters are mutual exclusive 
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:35:44 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin hmm. Currently i am dropping packets from the orderer to peer0. But peer1 seems to not get the packets either. Leader election is on. My bootstrap is different though. 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:36:38 GMT):<br/>
> dropping packets

do you mean deliver packets?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:36:55 GMT):<br/>
are peer0 and peer1 in same org?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:37:18 GMT):<br/>
have you configured either of them to bootstrap set?
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:38:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes they are in the same org. Applying package loss to the connection so they do not receive the new blocks. 
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:38:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes they are in the same org. Applying package loss to the connection so they do not receive the new blocks. Basically he can not communicate with the orderer. but peer1 experiences the same package loss. For some reason
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:39:20 GMT):<br/>
ok, but peer0 is alive and peer1 can see it?
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:39:48 GMT):<br/>
Yes they are both alive
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:40:44 GMT):<br/>
do you know which one of them is a leader?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:49:28 GMT):<br/>
Did you join both peers to the channel?
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 10:07:49 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Yes. so let me elaborate a bit because the details i provided so far are not sufficient. I create the containers where org1 belongs to two channels and controls 2 peers ( `peer0.org1.example.com` `peer1.org1.example.com` ). I am triggering the network delays. So an iptables rule that classifies the packets going from the `orderer` to `peer0.org1.example.com`. Then with a `tc qdisc` i apply package loss 100% to those packets. 

Now i run my code that goes: user enrollment, channel creation, join channels, install chaincode. Everything works up to that point. Now i am sending two instantiates, one for each channel, and sending them both to `org1`. The instantiates are signed by both `peer0.org1.example.com` `peer1.org1.example.com`, and now i would expect for the orderer to send the block to the peers. `peer0.org1.example.com` should not receive the block, and he does not. But i would expect that `peer1.org1.example.com` would receive the block, but he does not.

```2017-07-14 12:16:13.561 UTC [ConnProducer] NewConnection -> ERRO 03b Failed connecting to orderer.example.com:7050 , error: context deadline exceeded
2017-07-14 12:16:13.561 UTC [deliveryClient] connect -> ERRO 03c Failed obtaining connection: Could not connect to any of the endpoints: [orderer.example.com:7050]```

But after that he got the blocks. I guess from `peer0.org1.example.com`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:24:14 GMT):<br/>
I don't get it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:25:23 GMT):<br/>
I told you to kill peer0 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:25:32 GMT):<br/>
so how does peer1 get the blocks if peer0 is now dead?
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:26:16 GMT):<br/>
This is a case where the only connection with package loss is `orderer` -> `peer1`. I did not try your suggestion yet. was running another test
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:26:28 GMT):<br/>
setting it up now
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:26:34 GMT):<br/>
ah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:26:48 GMT):<br/>
so it seems like @C0rWin 's theory is correct
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:26:54 GMT):<br/>
try what i said though
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:26:59 GMT):<br/>
start everything from scratch
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:27:06 GMT):<br/>
make the packet loss from peer0 to the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:27:11 GMT):<br/>
ensure peer1 doesn't get the blocks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:27:15 GMT):<br/>
and then kill peer0
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:27:19 GMT):<br/>
and see that peer1 gets the blocks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:28:14 GMT):<br/>
I'm on mobile from now on so will be a bit non responsive, but pleas write your results here
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:36:36 GMT):<br/>
Yes @C0rWin was right. After killing `peer0`, `peer1` tries to connect to him ( but fails ) and then gets the blocks, i guess because he became the leader.
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:39:55 GMT):<br/>
But is there a way to solve that? Can i specify a timer for leader election?

Does peers sync only from peers of the same organization and orderer it is connected to or do they also sync from peers of other organizations of the same channel.
Basically I want to know if peers of different organizations connect to each other and sync up.

@yacovm @C0rWin Does state transfer recompute block hashes and therefore verify chain integrity as it is being transferred?  If not, do you agree it would be a good feature to verify chain integrity as it goes?  This would ensure that one corrupted/tampered peer would not bleed into others.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:02:25 GMT):<br/>
@binhn Note that code was written to Verify the integrity of the chain for https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-609.  I'd still like us to consider it for a next release, even if we don't have cross-peer verification yet.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:02:46 GMT):<br/>
the integrity is preserved by each step
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:03:06 GMT):<br/>
you can't do forward hash chain verification
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:03:08 GMT):<br/>
only backwards
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:03:17 GMT):<br/>
since the ledger is built onwards
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:03:23 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:14:53 GMT):<br/>
'ledger' only does state validation.  'committer' does other validations.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:25:45 GMT):<br/>
you mean MVCC validation @dave.enyeart

right?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 22:23:13 GMT):<br/>
i mean, nothing in ledger component verifies hashes across blocks. not MVCC or any other ledger code. Discussed with @yacovm that this is acceptable since peer trusts orderer and the data is verified against orderer signature.

Hello All, I wanted to know if in the present architecture a malicious orderer is handled or not. Lets say an orderer service node is malicious and drops transactions and forms false blocks, the committers connected to this orderer have difference in the ledgers maintained by them. Do the peers then get the correct ledger by assuming a gossip protocol between them or gossip only happens when the peers are out of sync. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 08:54:03 GMT):<br/>
there is no byzantine support with regard to orderers

Hi, is there any function that related with a peer fetching a block from its neighbors? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Sun, 30 Jul 2017 22:44:53 GMT):<br/>
@qizhang there is no direct API to fetch a block from other peers. there is a logic which detects a gap and request missing block based on ledger height advertised by channel peers.
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Sun, 30 Jul 2017 22:45:21 GMT):<br/>
there are two type of messages responsible for that
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Sun, 30 Jul 2017 22:45:36 GMT):<br/>
```// State transfer

// RemoteStateRequest is used to ask a set of blocks
// from a remote peer
message RemoteStateRequest {
    uint64 start_seq_num = 1;
    uint64 end_seq_num = 2;
}

// RemoteStateResponse is used to send a set of blocks
// to a remote peer
message RemoteStateResponse {
    repeated Payload payloads = 1;
}

</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 03:50:32 GMT):<br/>

Given that I have multiple ordering nodes in an ordering service (with a single kafka-zookeeper cluster), when i create a channel and make the peer join the channel, will gossip connects to all orderers in the ordering service for receiving the block or only one chosen at random or load balanced? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 10:40:39 GMT):<br/>
chosen at random
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 10:41:13 GMT):<br/>
when disconnects - chosen at random again.
when receives a bad status from the orderer - chosen at random out of the other orderer nodes

>I have a couple of doubts: 1. What exactly does the environment variable `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP` does? Does it enable gossip only between peers belonging to the same organization, and if so, if there are 4 peers within the same org, does each have to have a comma separated ip address list of all other peers in `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP`. A link/reference to documentation with all the env variables for 1.0 with explanation would be helpful. 2. What are anchor peers and what are their roles. Does the `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER` set the anchor peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 15:52:18 GMT):<br/>
So the bootstrap is a list of peers in the org that the peer knows. It uses them as a bootstrapping for membership.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 15:52:54 GMT):<br/>
if there are 4 peers within the same org - so they need to have a bootstrap list of some of the peers in the org, such that the transitive closure would be the entire group of 4 peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 15:53:35 GMT):<br/>
i.e `p0,p1,p2,p3` you would need something like `p0: p1, p2: p1, p3: p1` etc. but not - `p0: p1, p1: p0, p2:p3, p3:p2`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 15:53:53 GMT):<br/>
anchor peers are peers from any org that participate in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 15:54:04 GMT):<br/>
they are in a way - bootstrap peers for cross organization
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 15:54:17 GMT):<br/>
the orgLeader variable doesn't set the anchor peer - it is set via the config block

No.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 17:02:11 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=iL2qx4jbjgxEFWGrw) @yacovm so multiple peers can become anchor peers and participate in channels from an organization?

yes

Hi..I am trying to run 2 peers on the same node. I generated the required crypto-materials with fabric-ca and kept in respective folders in mspconfig directory.

I really can't understand anything this way
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:07:48 GMT):<br/>
can you please describe the setup in words?
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:15:44 GMT):<br/>
I setup the fabric-ca server and client. I registered and enrolled 2 roles: admin and 2 peers viz, peer1 and peer2. This generated the public/private keys for each role and the cacerts. As per the documentation: https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/hyperledger-fabric/latest/hyperledger-fabric.pdf --page 74, I created the mspconfig directory for each peer with admincerts, cacerts, keystore and signcerts as subdirectories. I copied the required certificates in the respective subdirectorires and the mentioned the path  `/home/ubuntu/crypto-material/Org1/Peer1/mspconfig` for mounting it to the docker container. Then I started docker-compose.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:16:26 GMT):<br/>
so you have only 1 org?
</p>

aha

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:41:31 GMT):<br/>
so if that doesn't work - it means you have a bad setup of the stuff inside the MSPDir

in any case

that's not a gossip issue :(

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:41:44 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:41:50 GMT):<br/>
and can't verify each other's certificate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:42:15 GMT):<br/>
I think there is a misconfiguration 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:42:30 GMT):<br/>
ah wait
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:42:35 GMT):<br/>
if its the same org
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:42:41 GMT):<br/>
why do you have there - 2 different MSPIDs?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:42:51 GMT):<br/>
`- CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP` and `- CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org2MSP` ?

A question regarding gossip non-leader: if a peer is set up as a) non-leader and b) no leader election, c) and the leader peer is online
will the non-leader peer ever get blocks from the orderer directly?

<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 16:50:58 GMT):<br/>
I would guess the answer is no, but I see in some cases (if the non-leader was down for some time and comes back up) it gets blocks from the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 16:53:14 GMT):<br/>
impossible
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 17:32:04 GMT):<br/>
@AdnanC does non leader peer have bootstrap set of peers? 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 17:32:31 GMT):<br/>
Or is there anchor peers in the channel?
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:03:22 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin it has a bootstrap peer (which is the same as the selected leader) and the anchor peer is also the same
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:03:53 GMT):<br/>
This is why it get in sync then
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:04:31 GMT):<br/>
you mean it gets blocks from the leader?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:04:31 GMT):<br/>
It builds gossip membership and leader forwards block to it
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:04:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes, exactly 
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:04:52 GMT):<br/>
That was my expectation too
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:05:04 GMT):<br/>
but I corrupted the blocks i the leader
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:05:21 GMT):<br/>
but it still ends up with correct blocks
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:05:21 GMT):<br/>
but the non-leader still ends up with correct blocks
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:05:45 GMT):<br/>
I observe that if I disconnect the orderer, it does not get the blocks anymore
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:06:07 GMT):<br/>
so here's the flow of operations: .....
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:09:17 GMT):<br/>
1. spin up 4 peer, 2 org network where the lower numbered peers are "selected" as leader and gossip elections is turned off for all
2. After some time, I stop non-leader of org1 and both the peers of org2
3. 5 transactions in org1 leader
5. Manually corrupt the ledgerfile in org1 leader
4. restart the non-leader of the org1
5. Query the nonleader

I expected that non-leader will not have the full ledger, but it has
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:09:17 GMT):<br/>

I expected that non-leader will *not* have the full ledger, as it is supposed to get them from its leader's ledger (which is corrupted)but I observe that the non-leader has all the correct blocks
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:09:46 GMT):<br/>
if I stop the orderer, then I see that non-leader has the expected, curtailed ledger
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:09:46 GMT):<br/>
if I stop the ordere before non-leader comes back up, then I see that non-leader has the expected, curtailed ledger

if I stop the orderer before non-leader comes back up(i,e. before step 4), then I see that non-leader has the expected, curtailed ledger @C0rWin 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:19:14 GMT):<br/>
Interesting 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:19:45 GMT):<br/>
Could you please report JIRA and tag me in?
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:20:53 GMT):<br/>
sure. Is there a easy way to verify (maybe from the logs) that a peer is actually getting blocks from the the orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:25:41 GMT):<br/>
I guess maybe the leader still has the blocks in its memory
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:25:48 GMT):<br/>
and the non leader that comes alive
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:25:51 GMT):<br/>
receives them via pull
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:26:00 GMT):<br/>
before it receives them via state transfer?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:26:09 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's possible 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:26:11 GMT):<br/>
we can fetch up to 100 blocks at a time IIRC
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:26:16 GMT):<br/>
so 5 blocks won't cut it ;)
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:26:42 GMT):<br/>
We have expiration so can check it easily 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:26:48 GMT):<br/>
also - I'm not an expert on levelDB but from what I know - LSM tree-type DBs have a level 0 that is stored in memory. it's usually a few tens of MBs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:27:02 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:27:17 GMT):<br/>
he just needs to wait... how many time was it again? :thinking:  
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:27:44 GMT):<br/>
Need to look in the code, connected from mobile
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:28:45 GMT):<br/>
should be like 10 min @AdnanC 
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:29:12 GMT):<br/>
from step1 to step 5 is like maybe 2 minutes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 19:29:27 GMT):<br/>
Fabric is full of so many mechanisms, so hard to test :grin:

A question, how does leveldb come in play here? Gossip transfers only ledger blocks, not the statedb things, right?

*OSN2 reads it at time t=5s and sets a timer that will fire at t=6s*, does it mean that OSN2 sets a timer when it reads a block from the partition?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 20:05:04 GMT):<br/>
the ordering service node has a batch timeout that defines the frequency of it cutting blocks
</p>

not sure about the implementation though

 A question regarding Gossip state transfers: Does a "pull" do state transfers too, or is it only for exchanging block  recieve information etc? (reading the design docs) 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 20:55:39 GMT):<br/>
pull has nothing to do with a state transfer 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 20:56:27 GMT):<br/>
pull used to query for latest updates on neighbors sliding window of blocks
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 20:56:59 GMT):<br/>
while state transfer is actually querying the ledger and capable to replicate whole ledger
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 20:57:43 GMT):<br/>
Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 20:58:30 GMT):<br/>
And the State transfer, is it of two types, based on how large is the data transfer / or how long have a network been up before a peer joins?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 21:02:44 GMT):<br/>
@AdnanC of two types? what do you mean?
</p>
<p><strong>AdnanC</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 21:04:21 GMT):<br/>
From the design document, section 1.2, it sounds like there are two types, one for peers that missed a couple blocks (due to network hiccup etc)\and another for peers that are joining a channel that has been up fore  while

@MeenakshiSingh moving your question to #fabric-ledger as it's more appropriate channel to answer this question

<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:43:25 GMT):<br/>
Hello. I do not know if this is the right channel for this question but i can not find a better fit. On large numbers of transactions (1000tps, 4 peer endorsement), i get an ssl error, or connection failed from the client to the peers ( peers do not crash ). I assume that it might be because i reach the limit of ssl connections. Is my assumption true, or could i configure this number? ( i tried increasing the number of file descriptors but did not change anything)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:44:54 GMT):<br/>
this has nothing to do with gossip though

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:51:06 GMT):<br/>
ah ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:51:15 GMT):<br/>
that's interesting
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:51:17 GMT):<br/>
by the way
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:51:25 GMT):<br/>
do you remember that other error you reported about back then?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:51:28 GMT):<br/>
you opened a JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:51:30 GMT):<br/>
remember
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:51:31 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:52:42 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:52:50 GMT):<br/>
so I fixed it!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:52:54 GMT):<br/>
you can try and check
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:53:10 GMT):<br/>
Yes i saw it was fixed :)
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:53:44 GMT):<br/>
I have not managed to synchronize to release yet though
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:58:18 GMT):<br/>
But after all the issue was on the leader election timer, or was the same peer being reelected? Just curious
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:58:43 GMT):<br/>
there was no relinquishing of leadership
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:58:50 GMT):<br/>
in case of unable to connect to the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 14:00:02 GMT):<br/>
Ah i thought there was a timer for leader election. 
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 14:00:31 GMT):<br/>
So a peer remains the leader as long as he is connected

Hello， to gossip information within a channel, the peer should know the rest of peers in the channel. How does the peer know the others? Thank you
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 11 Aug 2017 05:54:13 GMT):<br/>
It knows the anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 11 Aug 2017 05:54:28 GMT):<br/>
From the config block
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Fri, 11 Aug 2017 05:56:40 GMT):<br/>
it first send its own address to anchor peer, and get back other peer's address?
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Fri, 11 Aug 2017 05:57:32 GMT):<br/>
ok, thank you, Yacovm
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 11 Aug 2017 06:07:45 GMT):<br/>
Something like this, yes
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Fri, 11 Aug 2017 06:30:03 GMT):<br/>
ok, thank you again,Yacovm.

Hi, what does the following warnings in the peer logs suggest? ```2017-08-11 21:03:28.213 UTC [blocksProvider] DeliverBlocks -> WARN 50cb6 Failed adding payload of 38279 because: Ledger height is at 31126, cannot enqueue block with sequence of 38279
2017-08-11 21:03:28.225 UTC [blocksProvider] DeliverBlocks -> WARN 50cb7 Failed adding payload of 38193 because: Ledger height is at 29737, cannot enqueue block with sequence of 38193

</p>
<p><strong>suryalanka</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:10:08 GMT):<br/>
We are seeing the above warnings in the endorser peers in the organization
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:11:04 GMT):<br/>
That happens if you get blocks that are "too far"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:11:07 GMT):<br/>
from your ledger's height
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:11:26 GMT):<br/>
in example- if your peer is *really behind* other peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:11:43 GMT):<br/>
and they send your peer a block that is really really "in the future" with regard to your peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:11:55 GMT):<br/>
then your peer - refuses to enqueue the block to memory and simply throws it away
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:12:02 GMT):<br/>
(it will get the block eventually)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:12:14 GMT):<br/>
This is a protection mechanism so your memory won't explode ;)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:12:59 GMT):<br/>
By the way how did you know to ask in this channel @suryalanka  ? 
</p>
<p><strong>suryalanka</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:14:35 GMT):<br/>
we found `Ledger height is at 30012, cannot enqueue block with sequence of 38295` snippet in the gossip code (gossip/state/state.go)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:14:46 GMT):<br/>
ah, ok
</p>
<p><strong>suryalanka</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:19:02 GMT):<br/>
Thank you, how do I verify that the block is delivered?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:19:39 GMT):<br/>
you look at the logs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:19:46 GMT):<br/>
and you can also use events
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:20:03 GMT):<br/>
you can subscribe to block events from `{node, go}-SDK`
</p>

@yacov surya and I are still troubleshooting some peers connections to orderers - and we see 3 hours of nothing but that same long 'cannot enqueue block'. more on that later.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 16:28:06 GMT):<br/>
A different question:  when we start a network, peers choose randomly which orderer to connect for delivered blocks. However, if we stop the orderer that it is connected to, then (from a small test sample) it looks like a peer will always attempt to connect first to orderer0 (and then move in sequence looking through the rest of the orderers list, which is fine). It seems the peer should choose randomly. Otherwise, we could see all peers connected to the same orderer (for example after restarting all the orderers once). Would you agree?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:25:30 GMT):<br/>
How many are there?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:46:22 GMT):<br/>
>  @yacov surya and I are still troubleshooting some peers connections to orderers - and we see 3 hours of nothing but that same long 'cannot enqueue block'. more on that later. 
So you claim that the peer connects to the orderer, but emits this message?! @scottz 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:46:50 GMT):<br/>
This shouldn't be possible, since for each block the peer pulls - it puts it into that payload buffer in-order
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:47:35 GMT):<br/>
Maybe the peer is not a leader and gets the block from some other peer?
</p>
<p><strong>suryalanka</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 18:23:00 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm every peer in the org is org leader
</p>
<p><strong>suryalanka</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 18:23:00 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm every peer in the org is org leader in this case
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 18:24:24 GMT):<br/>
More information can be useful
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 18:24:28 GMT):<br/>
how many peers per org, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 18:24:34 GMT):<br/>
is leader election on? etc. etc.
</p>
<p><strong>suryalanka</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 18:28:44 GMT):<br/>
each organization has 2 peers(one peer is endorser and other is committer). `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER` is set to `true` for both the peers.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 19:02:10 GMT):<br/>
Interesting... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 19:02:33 GMT):<br/>
And which peer emits these warnings?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 19:06:19 GMT):<br/>
What is the setup? Docker compose? What did you do to make it happen?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 19:06:43 GMT):<br/>
And... are you in the office in the next 2 hours or so?

@suryalanka 
</p>
<p><strong>suryalanka</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 19:12:06 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm endorser is emitting those warnings
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 19:12:49 GMT):<br/>
Only 1 of the peers?
</p>
<p><strong>suryalanka</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 19:12:57 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 19:13:08 GMT):<br/>
Are both in the channel? Is he connected to the orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>suryalanka</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 19:14:13 GMT):<br/>
yes both the peers joined the channel... committer is getting the blocks, but not the endorser

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 20:07:31 GMT):<br/>
how mane printouts like these do you see?

can you use QSCC and check ledger height at each peer?

@yacovm when a node fails and needs to use gossip to catch up, it will see the latest block size to be blah, at this point, it requests blocks from peers via gossip? If so, I assume read/write sets are passed around right? In this scenario, there is no validation done? Just directly apply read sets?
</p>

Hello. I am blocking the network connection on both peers in an org so they do not get the new blocks. When i reconnect, the leader gets the blocks but he does not gossip them to the second peer. ( The second peer closed the endpoint connection to the leader while they were both offline ). How can i re-establish the gossip connection? I am still in beta so could this just be an old issue?
</p>

so @SotirisAlfonsos 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Aug 2017 12:03:56 GMT):<br/>
you're saying that you blocked connection between peers?
</p>

and they don't reconnect?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Aug 2017 12:04:14 GMT):<br/>
they are supposed to re-connect periodically
</p>
<p><strong>SotirisAlfonsos</strong> (Wed, 16 Aug 2017 12:09:34 GMT):<br/>
They did not reconnect. Even when i invoked and queried transactions on them. By the way, when they disconnected, they both closed the endpoint with each other. In case you recall, was there a change on that from beta to rc? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Aug 2017 12:10:04 GMT):<br/>
how much time passed?

@yacovm we also cross this problem
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 14:59:33 GMT):<br/>
on which version?
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 14:59:43 GMT):<br/>
1.0
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:00:04 GMT):<br/>
we got three peers distribute in different PC
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:00:52 GMT):<br/>
likes few hours, it would have a chance some peers disconnect with the others and never reconnect
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:01:16 GMT):<br/>
hmmm really?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:01:27 GMT):<br/>
what do they print when they disconnect?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:02:30 GMT):<br/>
why do they disconnect though?
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:02:51 GMT):<br/>
i haven't look into the logs, but it appears so, after one day, we execute another transaction, one of the peer didn't receive the transaction, the block height is less than others
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:03:22 GMT):<br/>
interesting... so you basically keep the peers online and after a day they disconnect?
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:03:35 GMT):<br/>
unless we restart the peer, it would not synchronize with the others
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:03:42 GMT):<br/>
I see
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:03:47 GMT):<br/>
I'll check it out
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:03:50 GMT):<br/>
thanks 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:04:00 GMT):<br/>
but if you can show me logs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:04:02 GMT):<br/>
that'd help 
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:04:34 GMT):<br/>
seems the peers on the same computer would not happen
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:05:07 GMT):<br/>
if the peers are in the same computer it doesn't happen
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:05:11 GMT):<br/>
but in different computers it does?
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:05:38 GMT):<br/>
i'm not sure, since our environment now all in different computers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:05:53 GMT):<br/>
ok, any chance you get me some logs to look at ?
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:06:29 GMT):<br/>

I know that the genesis block contains the anchor peers addresses. But when one of them sends “alive” message, how do the others know that this message is from that anchor peer?  is it just from the source IP? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:57:19 GMT):<br/>
why do they need to know that the message is from an anchor peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:57:30 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't matter which peer the message is from
</p>
<p><strong>Eman0</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 23:35:47 GMT):<br/>
Actually, I just want to know how peers learn the addresses of each other's. So when a peer receives an "alive" message, how does it know the address of the sender?

<p><strong>Eman0</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 13:31:07 GMT):<br/>
Is that in the "alive" message ? And is the purpose of anchor peers just to be discovered by newly connected peers ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 13:47:36 GMT):<br/>
Yep

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 19 Aug 2017 10:31:43 GMT):<br/>
@kelvinzhong  @SotirisAlfonsos I tried reproducing your problem with a modified peer that has a 1 Minute times where it does a re-scan and expiration of certificates (instead of the default hours and day ) and it doesn't reproduce :(
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 19 Aug 2017 10:32:07 GMT):<br/>
Could it be that it's something with the network in your environment?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 06:26:49 GMT):<br/>
Wait actually i'm not sure that still works

well...if it still working please let me know:grin:
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 06:40:48 GMT):<br/>
one more question:grin:   the setting "- CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=true", it's stand for the leader peer that orderer would send the transaction first, or it's stand for the anchor peer that would communicate across the organization?
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 06:48:17 GMT):<br/>
i saw the example from fabric-java-sdk, all peers set as CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT, but there are comment line of CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP and CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER, not sure what would be the usage of those, could you share how to choose the setting of those?

@kelvinzhong ^
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 06:50:44 GMT):<br/>
So the org leader setting makes gossip connect to the ordering service 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 06:51:05 GMT):<br/>
there is another setting that makes gossip discuss who will connect to the orderer on behalf of the other peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 06:51:18 GMT):<br/>
and then some peer is elected and it is the one that connects to the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 06:51:21 GMT):<br/>
per channel, of course

but the anchor peer seems has been set in the genesis block, why would it need to be set in the compose file
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 06:59:44 GMT):<br/>
and the leader peer could be chosen automatically right?

if leader election is on, yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 07:00:12 GMT):<br/>
this has nothing to do with anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 07:01:31 GMT):<br/>
well... as i read from the doc says the anchor peer is used to communicate with different organization, is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 07:02:28 GMT):<br/>
yes and no. It is used to know about peers from other organizations
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 07:02:37 GMT):<br/>
but once the peers know each other they don't need the anchor peer anymore
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 21 Aug 2017 07:02:44 GMT):<br/>
unless they are shut down, that is

And can we specify more than one using docker-compose when using config variable CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP? Or are you implying we could simply specify a different bootstrap peer when we configure each peer?
```
  peer0.org1.example.com:

In our network we expect to have only one peer per organization. If a peer has to recover, for example  by catching up  with missing blocks,  where will the peer request blocks from ? Will it go to peers of other organizations on the channel or will it go to one of the orderers for redelivery ? If its peers of other organizations where would it get the address other peer from ?

@qizhang I think it's nothing to worry about, it happens when you get a block from the orderer or from some peer while trying to do state transfer 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:08:33 GMT):<br/>
( @C0rWin correct me if I'm wrong)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:08:59 GMT):<br/>
You might want to try to turn the logging verbosity level to debug
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:09:10 GMT):<br/>
and see what messages you receive besides it
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:14:30 GMT):<br/>
thanks @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:15:08 GMT):<br/>
do you have any thought on why these warnings only occur in peer0 but not peer1? @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:15:58 GMT):<br/>
The message was actually from the function 'antiEntropy()', and this function is supposed to run on each peer, right?
</p>

>  do you have any thought on why these warnings only occur in peer0 but not peer1? @yacovm 
My bet would be that peer0 doesn't connect to the ordering service, and peer1 does.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:17:43 GMT):<br/>
You can verify it from logs...
</p>

>  The message was actually from the function `antiEntropy()`, and this function is supposed to run on each peer, right? 
Well yeah, but there is a place in the code where it checks if it's needed to fetch blocks from other peers... if you're the most up to date peer, you don't fetch blocks from peers
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:19:01 GMT):<br/>
I see. Can you let me know how to verify from the logs that whether a peer has connecte to the orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:19:55 GMT):<br/>
Also, even if peer0 does not connect to the orderer, why it receives blocks that it already has?
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:19:55 GMT):<br/>
Also, even if peer0 does not connect to the orderer, why it keep receiving blocks that it already has?
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:19:55 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:20:50 GMT):<br/>
yeah of course
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:20:53 GMT):<br/>
it prints it....
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:21:23 GMT):<br/>
>  Also, even if peer0 does not connect to the orderer, why it keeps receiving blocks that it already has? 
because it might fetch N blocks at a time, because it batches them
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:21:31 GMT):<br/>
but it might already received them from a peer
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:23:37 GMT):<br/>
Normally, a peer is supposed to receive blocks from the orderer, right?
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:25:10 GMT):<br/>
If it does not connect to the orderer, the peer then needs to ask its neighbor peers for the blocks. Then, if it receives blocks from its neighbors, why it still receives those blocks from the orderer?

@qizhang blocks are gossiped hence received at arbitrary order, this method leverages buffer which takes care to commit blocks to the ledger according to the natural order
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Fri, 22 Sep 2017 16:11:50 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin I know that each peer has a buffer to store the received blocks, does this method receives the gossiped blocks and put them into the buffer, so that the committing routine can commit the blocks from the buffer to the ledger, Or this method takes the block from the buffer and then calls the committing routine to commit to the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 22 Sep 2017 18:52:39 GMT):<br/>
@qizhang this method polls buffer and commits the next in oder block once available 
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Fri, 22 Sep 2017 19:34:09 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin You mentioned that the blocks come to the buffer in an arbitrary order, and I saw that this method just pops each block out of the buffer and then commit. Does it mean that this method commit the block in the same order that the blocks arrive in the buffer, which is also arbitrary?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Sat, 23 Sep 2017 08:07:59 GMT):<br/>
@qizhang buffer takes care to re-order blocks in natural order, hence blocks are committed in the original order according to sequence numbers generated by orderer

Hey, I was wondering if I start a byfn network and the start a peer separately and assign that peer's gossip external endpoint to the core peer, Will that peer update all the blocks into its own ledger by itself??
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:06:00 GMT):<br/>
Or do i require some process beforehand??
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:09:41 GMT):<br/>
what is a core peer?
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:41:04 GMT):<br/>
Anchor peer? is'nt that the one mentioned in the compose file?? Will it sync itself with any peer it has its core_peer_address set to for that matter?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:46:05 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand what you're asking, sorry.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:46:07 GMT):<br/>
can you rephrase?
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:49:17 GMT):<br/>
I have a docker network running, supposedly of byfn network. Now If i start a separate peer setting all the defaults of any other peer in the network. will the peer sync all the blocks in its own ledger by itself?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:50:38 GMT):<br/>
ah so the peer needs: 
1) To join a channel
2) To know some anchor peer. I'm not sure if byfn has anchor peers in the configtx.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:50:53 GMT):<br/>
but, *very important - do not forget!* 
You have to give your peer a new certificate. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:50:59 GMT):<br/>
do not give it a certificate of an existing peer
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:51:48 GMT):<br/>
Yes this was gonna be the second question, but i was wondering if the syncing process requires a certificate.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:53:15 GMT):<br/>
Fabric is a blockchain for a permissioned network
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:53:24 GMT):<br/>
everything you do that interacts with another network node
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:53:28 GMT):<br/>
requires some authentication ;)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:53:51 GMT):<br/>
so, in gossip's case we have a check in the code that sees if someone uses the same certificate as some other peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:55:49 GMT):<br/>
now, what will happen is that both peers won't be able to "see" each other
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 15:56:06 GMT):<br/>
they'll just complain that there is some peer with the same certificate, but with a different endpoint than their own

<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 16:40:21 GMT):<br/>
sorry for the rapid fire @yacovm , I have just 2 more queries. 
1)You said a peer needs to join a channel. does that mean it will it sync blocks of that particular channel only? That would disrupt the chain right? So maybe it will just commit changes from other channels also, updating its world state and the blockchain. 
</p>
<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 16:42:19 GMT):<br/>
2)"To know some anchor peer". Will it be the peer the new peer should set its core_peer_gossip_address to?? How exactly will it know a peer.

@CodeReaper  dont know why or how i forgot about these pending questions :slight_smile: . I guess i'm overwhelmed with questions these days. So w.r.t 1)yes. Why would it distrupt the chain? Syncing blocks is a read. 2) the anxhor peer(s) are just endpoints of known prers, encoded in configuration blocks.

Hi @yacovm ; I have been exploring the concept of leader peers in the past few days; sorry if my questions are naive or basic - I have  been looking for answers elsewhere, but I couldn't find them. From what I understand, in order to actually have a single leader peer elected in the context of a channel, for a single org, I need to explicitly configure gossip.bootstrap before I start the peers and join them to a channel; that's required to make sure each peer node knows which other peer nodes it needs to interact with in the context of gossip - I believe. Is there any possibility (or any future plan) to make it possible for peers to "discover" each other through the ordering service or other means? Relying on the configuration files settings for a leader peer to be elected (a setting which is not even required) seems to be quite error prone - and I suppose it also forces peer nodes to be bounced if I want a new peer to be recognized in the election process.

In general, I'm trying to understand if I should rely on the concept of leader peer, to possibly assigning some specific roles to the leader peer moving forward; right now, the fact that leader peers seem to be an "optional" entity, surprises me a little.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:18:32 GMT):<br/>
@minollo well - you can also use anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:18:38 GMT):<br/>
you don't have to use bootstrap peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:18:48 GMT):<br/>
if your org has an anchor peer you don't need a bootstrap peer.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:29:35 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm perhaps I'm missing something, but I can't find a good description of the role of anchor and leader peers and how they operate.  They're barely mentioned at all in the hyperledger architecture section.  Is there a good description somewhere of what they do and how they do it?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:30:01 GMT):<br/>
I can just explain it here
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:30:46 GMT):<br/>
yeah, but I suspect others have similar questions...  Seems like a good section for the architecture section of the documentation
</p>
<p><strong>minollo</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:35:41 GMT):<br/>
I agree with @toddinpal that an explanation of the architecture in the documentation would help; but in the meanwhile, @yacovm , I would be happy to hear here about the role of anchor and leader peers, and for what purposes I can/should rely on one or the other. My initial understanding of anchor peers (and the reason why I didn't pay much attention to them) is that they can be >1 for a channel/org - while I was looking for a peer (what I was assuming should be the leader peer) to have a unique role in the context of a channel/org...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:07:01 GMT):<br/>
an anchor peer is an endpoint of a peer from an organization
that is useful for multi-organizational channels
in which the orgs can find the peers of other organizations using the anchor peers
i.e org0 and org1 each have an anchor peer: peer0.org0 and peer0.org1
so the update tx is sent to the channel to all organizations
and with that - peer0.org1 can know about peer0.org0 and can tell peer1.org1, peer2.org1, etc. about peer0.org0 but also about peer1.org0, peer2.org0
because peer0.org0 knows about peer1.org0, and peer2.org0 and would tell other organizations about them
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:07:11 GMT):<br/>
a leader peer is the peer (in an org) that connects to the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:07:22 GMT):<br/>
on behalf of its organization, for the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:07:29 GMT):<br/>
a leader peer is per channel and for an org
</p>
<p><strong>minollo</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:18:05 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm , thanks for the explanation; luckily enough, that fits the understanding I had. And I am apparently correct in focusing on leader peers, as I was looking for that one peer with a special role in the context of one channel for an org. Going back to my original question(s), it looks like the notion of the leader peer is not "mandated", but optional - and entirely driven by configuration files. Is that ever going to change (so that I can count on the fact that I will *always* have a single leader peer per channel, per org? Is that always going to be driven by the gossip configuration information?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:18:41 GMT):<br/>
it's not strictly via config files
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:18:52 GMT):<br/>
a leader can be statically set via the config
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:19:00 GMT):<br/>
or it can be dynamically elected by its peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:19:03 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:19:03 GMT):<br/>

No one promises you that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:19:52 GMT):<br/>
why do you have such a need?
</p>
<p><strong>minollo</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:25:09 GMT):<br/>
I was looking for a peer who would a role of possibly storing information in some peculiar way - either because I might want to replicate at least one peer's ledger in a slow but resilient storage, or because I might want to store state or history in a persistence storage which allows me to run richer queries than what couchdb state queries or leveldb history iterations allow me to do. And that would need to be per channel, per org - which fits quite well with the way a leader peer is defined. Makes sense?
BTW, one more question specific to leader peers and gossip protocol: assuming that gossip is configured to have peers elect a leader, I assume there is a mechanism to make sure that if the current leader is no more responsive a new one is elected; is that assumption correct? If yes, how long would it typically take for the new leader to be elected after the old one dies?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:27:02 GMT):<br/>
I understand your odd need, but I'm not sure how you're going to accomplish that - store in the state in a storage that isn't couch or levelDB. are you going to change the fabric code?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:27:24 GMT):<br/>
> I assume there is a mechanism to make sure that if the current leader is no more responsive a new one is elected; is that assumption correct?
Of course.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:28:27 GMT):<br/>
> If yes, how long would it typically take for the new leader to be elected after the old one dies? 
hmm it's configurable:
```
        election:
            # Longest time peer waits for stable membership during leader election startup (unit: second)
            startupGracePeriod: 15s
            # Interval gossip membership samples to check its stability (unit: second)
            membershipSampleInterval: 1s
            # Time passes since last declaration message before peer decides to perform leader election (unit: second)
            leaderAliveThreshold: 10s
            # Time between peer sends propose message and declares itself as a leader (sends declaration message) (unit: second)
leaderElectionDuration: 5s
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:28:32 GMT):<br/>
the above are the defaults

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:49:04 GMT):<br/>
how much time pass between the upgrades?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:49:23 GMT):<br/>
did you upgrade one of the peers?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:49:31 GMT):<br/>
and the other peer complains about this?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:50:31 GMT):<br/>
So the scenario is- you upgrade one of the peers and the other one complains?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:56:41 GMT):<br/>
Basically, this may happen if you replace a peer's identity and then restart it. 
The peer that tries to reconnect to the peer that was restarted assumes it is a certain peer and it sees a different peer on the other side
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:56:53 GMT):<br/>
therefore, it suspects it, and aborts the connection.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:57:09 GMT):<br/>
It's none fatal, unless it's an anchor peer or a bootstrap peer. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:57:52 GMT):<br/>
Generally, what you can do is just wait for a while until the peer is considered "really dead" by the peer that re-connects
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:58:01 GMT):<br/>
so it will not try to re-connect to that ip:port anymore
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:58:26 GMT):<br/>
Upgrade some of the peers
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:58:41 GMT):<br/>
There was no identity replacement though, only upgrading the binary
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:59:06 GMT):<br/>
ah but the master branch changed the `Serialize()` method
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:59:06 GMT):<br/>
ah but the master branch changed the `mspIdentity.Serialize()` method
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:59:16 GMT):<br/>
so to gossip it is in a way a change of the identity ;)
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:05:45 GMT):<br/>
So... what's the fix? Does it just work after a while?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:05:52 GMT):<br/>
It should. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:06:03 GMT):<br/>
you can do something else though
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:06:09 GMT):<br/>
when you launch the upgraded peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:06:20 GMT):<br/>
if it's in the same org, for example - give it the none-upgrade peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:06:25 GMT):<br/>
as a bootstrap peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:06:32 GMT):<br/>
then it'll connect to it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:06:36 GMT):<br/>
instead the other way around
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:06:48 GMT):<br/>
and since it's a fresh PKI-ID, it'll be OK
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:07:03 GMT):<br/>
In the bdd, each peer points to the other
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:07:21 GMT):<br/>
How long is the timeout before things should 'just work'?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:07:24 GMT):<br/>
wdym to the other? like `--> --> -->` in a circle?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:07:26 GMT):<br/>
We also tried restarting the peer binary
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:07:37 GMT):<br/>
if you restart both of them it should work 100%
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:07:41 GMT):<br/>
since the memory is wiped out
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:07:44 GMT):<br/>
PeerA points to PeerB points to PeerA, yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:07:59 GMT):<br/>
did you try restarting both?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:08:03 GMT):<br/>
not yet
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:08:04 GMT):<br/>
just to check the claim
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:08:05 GMT):<br/>
can give it a go
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:08:16 GMT):<br/>
Not at the same time
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:08:47 GMT):<br/>
hmmm wait a second
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:09:07 GMT):<br/>
if the bootstrap configuration points in a circle
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:09:14 GMT):<br/>
that means they should be connected
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:09:24 GMT):<br/>
the upgraded peer should be connected to the none upgraded
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:09:34 GMT):<br/>
can you perhaps do `tcpdump` or `netstat` and confirm?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:10:11 GMT):<br/>
or, if the gossip logs are in DEBUG you should see lots of noise
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:11:06 GMT):<br/>
We are still getting the warning after 35 minutes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:11:49 GMT):<br/>
right but I'm trying to figure out - are they connected?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:11:54 GMT):<br/>
or not?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:11:57 GMT):<br/>
We restarted peer3, with an updated binary.  Then restarted peer2 with the existing binary because of the warning
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:12:13 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if they are connected, but the spamming of that warning would seem to imply to me that they are not?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:12:36 GMT):<br/>
who are the peers in the story? just peer3 and peer2?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:12:55 GMT):<br/>
Yes, peer2 and peer3 are the only two peers in an org
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:13:45 GMT):<br/>
(peer0 and peer1 are Org1, peer2 and peer3 are Org2, we upgraded peer3 with a binary from master, saw the warning, restarted peer2 with the existing v1.0.3 binary)
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:14:08 GMT):<br/>
peer0 and peer2 are anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:14:40 GMT):<br/>
Though external endpoint is not set for anyone, so there should be no cross org gossip
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:14:54 GMT):<br/>
> we upgraded peer3 with a binary from master, saw the warning, restarted peer2 with the existing v1.0.3 binary
hmm?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:15:02 GMT):<br/>
so you upgraded both?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:15:16 GMT):<br/>
No, peer2 and peer3 were executing with the v1.0.3 binary
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:15:25 GMT):<br/>
We stopped peer3, upgraded his binary to master, then started him again
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:15:41 GMT):<br/>
We saw the warning, suspected it was a cache problem from peer2, so, simply restarted peer2 (no change in binary)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:15:55 GMT):<br/>
wait so you restarted both peers? 
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:15:58 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:16:12 GMT):<br/>
Not at the same time, first peer3, then peer2
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:17:25 GMT):<br/>
hmmm let me take a look how much time an identity can even circulate before it's purged
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:18:35 GMT):<br/>
ok so it's an hour. but I still don't understand how can 35 minutes pass and a peer attempts to probe another peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:19:00 GMT):<br/>
the fact that it expects a certain PKI-ID says that it got that from a previous AliveMessage
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:19:23 GMT):<br/>
wait a second
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:19:27 GMT):<br/>
BDD is docker
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:19:33 GMT):<br/>
and in docker you get random IP addresses
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:19:50 GMT):<br/>
well, semi random
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:20:21 GMT):<br/>
... I still don't understand how can 35 min pass and still have warnings though
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:22:37 GMT):<br/>
ah wait
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:23:38 GMT):<br/>
ok I think I understand what's going on @jyellick / @jeffgarratt 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:23:51 GMT):<br/>
when a peer connects to an anchor peer or a bootstrap peer it computes its PKI-ID
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:24:24 GMT):<br/>
so we have a v1.0.3 peers that computes the PKI-ID and expects the upgraded peer on the other side to identify itself in a certain way
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:24:24 GMT):<br/>
so we have a v1.0.3 peers that computes the PKI-ID and expects the upgraded peer on the other side to identify itself in a certain way and present its PKI-ID which is computed differently.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:24:53 GMT):<br/>
but since the computation is different... they will never be able to communicate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:24:53 GMT):<br/>
but since the computation is different... they will never be able to communicate because the side that opens the connection suspects the other side is not who it expects he is.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:25:34 GMT):<br/>
I don't see that as a problem
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:25:42 GMT):<br/>
So... gossip will be broken in a mixed v1.0.x v1.1 network forever?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:25:44 GMT):<br/>
most folks will coordinate the upgrade process I presume
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:25:49 GMT):<br/>
yep!
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:25:58 GMT):<br/>
good nough
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:26:10 GMT):<br/>
I'm sorry, my code is over-paranoid :( 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:26:25 GMT):<br/>
so you would assume once I upgrade both peers, gossip should reestablish?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:26:30 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:26:33 GMT):<br/>
k.. will verify
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:26:35 GMT):<br/>
thnx!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:26:42 GMT):<br/>
sure.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:28:29 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 so looks like we won't get mixed peers gossiping anyway.... ^ 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:31:21 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick @jeffgarratt something suddenly strikes me as odd. Did no peer complain about handshake problems?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:32:25 GMT):<br/>
when they handshake, they exchange PKI-IDs and verify the PKI-IDs match the expected computation... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:33:15 GMT):<br/>
should be some `c.logger.Warningf("Identity store rejected %s : %v", remoteAddress, err)` message IIUC
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:34:31 GMT):<br/>
do not see that
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:34:31 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  do not see that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:06:03 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick @jeffgarratt I take back what I said:
>  so we have a v1.0.3 peers that computes the PKI-ID and expects the upgraded peer on the other side to identify itself in a certain way and present its PKI-ID which is computed differently.

I don't think the PKI-ID computation changed between the versions. I'll look into this myself and investigate. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 21:17:50 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick  , @jeffgarratt I did it locally it everything seems to work for me :/ 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 21:18:03 GMT):<br/>
I started both peers as v1.0.3
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 21:18:16 GMT):<br/>
and then killed one of them and restarted it as a v1.1
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 21:18:22 GMT):<br/>
and they gossip just fine
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 21:18:55 GMT):<br/>
Do you want to help me reproduce this?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 21:19:20 GMT):<br/>
only I did it with VMs not with BDD or docker
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 22:37:02 GMT):<br/>
ok so I'm pretty sure it's from the discovery module trying to re-connect to the dead peer that is PKI-ID was `x` and after the upgrade it changed because the implementation of `Serialize()` changed to `y`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 22:38:10 GMT):<br/>
however I'm not sure why it's not purging the message from memory fast enough...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:37:53 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick , @jeffgarratt @mastersingh24  I investigated this issue, the TLDR is that there is no bug and everything is working as expected:
1) Have 2 peers in v1.0.3
2) Upgrade one of them to v1.1
The v1.0.3 peer now has the new upgraded peer in its alive view, but since https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/13265/17/msp/identities.go@181 was merged, it now sees this peer as a completely different peer because its identity now serialized into new bytes.
Now, it still has the old incarnation of the peer (when it was v1.0.3) in its "dead" view and attempts to re-connect to it.
When it reconnects to it, it does it in 2 stages:
   - Probes it via a gRPC RPC which succeeds
   - Sends it a membership request to merge its membership view with the peer's view, but gossip is a paranoid communication middleware, and when it establishes connection with new peers it knew before - it expects their PKI-ID to match what it was before (this is so a malicious org won't publish membership with endpoints of an existing org and thus isolate peers from other peers). The communication that re-establishes to the re-incarnated peer performs a handshake (that succeeds) and returns the new PKI-ID (one that it is already connected to, but it's irrelevant) and then it rejects the connection (hence the `createConnection` warning in the log) and complains. 

I did an experiment and it seems that after ~ 16 minutes it stops reconnecting because it forgets the peer (by purging it from the dead member list).
This time duration is computed by multiplying `20` by `peer.gossip.aliveExpirationTimeout`.
I tested this on a recompiled v1.0.3 peer on which I added a printf to the part where it deletes the message from the dead list and indeed after that print, there were no new warnings or attempts of reconnections.

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:47:57 GMT):<br/>
How about the TLDR; what should the admin do on upgrade?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:48:15 GMT):<br/>
just upgrade and wait for the errors to fade
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:48:25 GMT):<br/>
I tested and they did after 16 min 
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:48:48 GMT):<br/>
So wait, is it supposed to be a **seamless** upgrade from v1.0.3 to v1.1?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:49:19 GMT):<br/>
Well gossip is backward compatible
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:50:19 GMT):<br/>
We are striving to allow a mixed-network rolling style upgrade.  Where some peers may be upgraded and others may not.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:50:54 GMT):<br/>
Presently, on restart, the peer changes the way it computes its own PKI-ID which will cause a little log spam from the gossip layer as it tries to sort things out.  After 16 minutes, the log spam should go away and things should be fine again.

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:51:26 GMT):<br/>
it's not the computation that changes, but the serialized identity
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:52:26 GMT):<br/>
Also... if you have time and mind merging https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/14217/ Jason, it would help :) 
It's related to this
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:52:57 GMT):<br/>
> but since https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/13265/17/msp/identities.go@181 was merged

I'm a little confused why that change was snuck into that CR.  It seems like, doing this 'right', we should have tied the serialization style to the MSP version added recently by @adc 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:53:45 GMT):<br/>
how would that have helped?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:54:09 GMT):<br/>
His change set is only good for verifier MSPs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:54:20 GMT):<br/>
while the identity in the story is produced by the local MSP
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:54:58 GMT):<br/>
also Jason don't forget - gossip is cross channel. There is no notion of "act now as v1.1" in gossip
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:55:23 GMT):<br/>
you can only have 1 identity for your peer at least for now...
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:57:03 GMT):<br/>
14217 seems unmergeable to me as is.  This affects the output of `Validate`, no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:57:17 GMT):<br/>
it's gossip validate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:57:23 GMT):<br/>
it's only used in gossip 
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:58:00 GMT):<br/>
Oh, I see, I missed that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:58:03 GMT):<br/>
that's the function that validates identities for gossip... it was written by @adc 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:58:29 GMT):<br/>
we have an interface that is implemented from the MSP building blocks and we use it as a black box so we can mock it for tests
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:58:36 GMT):<br/>
Though it does seem worth arguing that `Valdate` in the MSP in `V1_1` should also invoke this method
</p>

I don't understand... can you elaborate?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:59:39 GMT):<br/>
(This goes back to my general dissatisfaction with the identity interface, that it requires caching and synchronization, because there's no type differentiation based on the checks which have been performed against the identity)
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 21:00:18 GMT):<br/>
If the PEM field for the type is set incorrectly for an identity, would we not want `Validate` to fail for that identity?

so @adc told me he will follow up on this 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 21:01:02 GMT):<br/>
but in a different CR and this will be based on the compatibility

otherwise we'll fork.

that's peer/gossip, not gossip :rolling_eyes:

 If I want add a peer to multiple channels at a time, do I need to take care that the channel-join requests take place one after another?
Right now, I was adding a peer to 8 channels at once, and got this in peer logs:

```
2017-10-18 21:09:08.978 UTC [gossip/state] directMessage -> WARN 19f Received state transfer request for channel ch5 while expecting channel ch6 skipping request...
2017-10-18 21:09:08.978 UTC [gossip/state] directMessage -> WARN 19e Received state transfer request for channel ch5 while expecting channel ch7 skipping request...
```

This seems to have caused a deadlock - as the peer doesn't join any other channels after joining one of the 8

@yacovm, any idea?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:37:34 GMT):<br/>
hmm what fabric version is that, first of all?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:41:27 GMT):<br/>
v1
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:42:46 GMT):<br/>
I was going through the code, and doesn't look like it should happen.

```
gossipChan, _ := g.Accept(func(message interface{}) bool {
		// Get only data messages
		return message.(*proto.GossipMessage).IsDataMsg() &&
			bytes.Equal(message.(*proto.GossipMessage).Channel, []byte(chainID))
	}, false)
```

in NewGossipStateProvider should filter out messages of different channels, and thus that warning should never be shown
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:43:22 GMT):<br/>
But that's being shown in directMessage(), not sure how that works.

https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/gossip/state/state.go#L162 
Perhaps here we need to add the chainID equality condition too?

@C0rWin ^

return true```
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:51:22 GMT):<br/>
isn't this code should implicitly take care of chanID?

oh
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:51:54 GMT):<br/>
so I think the problem is that the filter just doesn't explicitly filter by channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:52:12 GMT):<br/>
but there is still (I think) no real problem, it just spams the logs
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:52:15 GMT):<br/>
I think because same identity appear in both channels
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:52:19 GMT):<br/>
I _ think _ the logic still should work
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:52:22 GMT):<br/>
so we need to add an explicit check

so a peer contacts another peer but their handshake fails because they have no common channel.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=YNZZFdfYMR5iwHujf) @yacovm The one thing the diagram clearly states - which is missing from other descriptions I've seen - is that the recovery procedure is different for leader peers vs. non-leader peers.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 23 Oct 2017 22:18:46 GMT):<br/>
well but if leader election is on then a leader can become a non leader and vice versa 
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=uJu9BjvHYqJbWt37t) @yacovm Understood; but doesn't that change then the recovery procedure for that peer - if it was a leader, and now it isn't anymore?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=YNZZFdfYMR5iwHujf) @yacovm I'm looking at adding orderer archiving support and the chart is my attempt to understand just what/when the peer needs something from the orderer. In this instance, I see that a non-leader peer does not need anything from the orderer, while a leader peer will need at most, at minimum, the blocks needed to stay up-to-date, at worst, all blocks from block #1.

<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 12:32:44 GMT):<br/>
I was getting around 400s Gossip time in a 16peer set up, but it suddenly went up to 2.5s in 32peers

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:06:45 GMT):<br/>
hmm, 400ms - what are you measuring?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:06:46 GMT):<br/>
@rishabh1102  - How exactly are you measuring gossip time?  And what exactly is your setup - e.g. how many peers per org, etc
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:06:53 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm   :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:09:49 GMT):<br/>
We made experiments of our own for ~ 16 nodes and they were much less in the latency part. I remember the average number was much lower than 400ms.
For 32 peers you would probably need to crank up the `propagatePeerNum` property
</p>
<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:10:59 GMT):<br/>
Where is this property set in docker compose? Do you have an example?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:11:18 GMT):<br/>
since it's x2 the peer number, it makes sense to increase the `propagatePeerNum` at least by 1, but I'd say that 6 peers is a good number, because log(32) is 5 so make it 6 to be certain
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:11:50 GMT):<br/>
ah so the property is not set, therefore it is inherited by core.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:11:53 GMT):<br/>
which is 3....
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:12:50 GMT):<br/>
also make sure you have at least 4 cores per peer
</p>
<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:14:10 GMT):<br/>
I have 16 peers and 1 orderer. The block size is 5, so for every 6th successive transaction, I have to wait a certain amount of time before sending it, otherwise it fails
</p>
<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:14:19 GMT):<br/>
That waiting time is how I'm measuring gossip time
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:15:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:17:22 GMT):<br/>
right, tha'ts probably MVCC
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:17:37 GMT):<br/>
but do transactions 1,2,3 succeed?
</p>
<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:18:46 GMT):<br/>
The following Happens:
Cycle 1 -> 1,2,3,4,5 -> All Succeed
Cycle 2-> 1,2,3,3,5 -> 1 fails unless I make my SDK sleep for a certain amount of time, and this repeats on every 1 of the cycle
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:18:51 GMT):<br/>
>  That waiting time is how I'm measuring gossip time 
This is really not an ideal way to measure gossip. If you want to bench a component of an entire system you should isolate it, for example- measure the time it takes for the leader peer to propagate blocks to the peers.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:19:14 GMT):<br/>
why does the transaction fail?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:19:18 GMT):<br/>
is it invalidated by MVCC or what?
</p>
<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:19:25 GMT):<br/>
By fail, I get 2 types of errors
</p>

But, mostly its the following error: Transaction has Failed The proposal responses do not have consistent read write sets
</p>
<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:20:42 GMT):<br/>
Also, my main aim isn't benchmarking, it is to get the total transaction latency down at the moment
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:20:48 GMT):<br/>
where is that error? the peer or the SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:20:52 GMT):<br/>
SDK
</p>
<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:21:30 GMT):<br/>
But I'm assuming that its because not all peers give the same result for the transaction, which would be because not all are updated when I send the new transaction to them
</p>
<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:22:26 GMT):<br/>
How can I manually set propogatePeerNum?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:25:44 GMT):<br/>
`CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_PROPAGATEPEERNUM=`
</p>
<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 14:22:06 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I tried changing the variable, but the gossip time is still the same
</p>
<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 14:22:22 GMT):<br/>
Is there any other setting which has to be changed along with this?
</p>

I told you that running 16 peers in docker on a single physical machine isn't such a good idea...

hi all, i would like to ask whether there is any way to let the gossip leader to retry connecting back to orderer after the connection exhausted?
`2017-11-10 02:29:13.674 UTC [blocksProvider] DeliverBlocks -> WARN 7d3 [channel01] Receive error: Attempts (1) or elapsed time (10m19.967564472s) exhausted` 
On my network, when the gossip leader peer is unable to reach the orderer, based on current Fabric (using v1.0.0) deliveryClient reConnectTotalTimeThreshold = 5 minutes, after this threshold, the connection will be exhausted. 
When the orderer is resumed reachable, the gossip leader won't retry to connect back even the block provider event is being deregister & register again:
```
2017-11-10 02:39:00.733 UTC [eventhub_producer] validateEventMessage -> DEBU 7d4 ValidateEventMessage starts for signed event 0xc42155d4a0
2017-11-10 02:39:00.737 UTC [eventhub_producer] deRegisterHandler -> DEBU 7d5 deregistering event type: BLOCK
2017-11-10 02:39:00.743 UTC [eventhub_producer] Chat -> DEBU 7d6 Received EOF, ending Chat
2017-11-10 02:39:00.757 UTC [eventhub_producer] validateEventMessage -> DEBU 7d7 ValidateEventMessage starts for signed event 0xc421ce42a0
2017-11-10 02:39:00.759 UTC [eventhub_producer] registerHandler -> DEBU 7d8 registering event type: BLOCK
```
The block providers can only be resumed when restarting the gossip leader, .
```
2017-11-10 03:36:14.846 UTC [deliveryClient] StartDeliverForChannel -> DEBU 362 This peer will pass blocks from orderer service to other peers for channel channel01
2017-11-10 03:36:14.859 UTC [deliveryClient] RequestBlocks -> DEBU 363 Starting deliver with block [33] for channel channel01
```
On one side, the current reConnectTotalTimeThreshold at 5 mins is too idea. There is already setter function but not yet available as a parameter for peer start up configuration.
Is there any other way to let the gossip leader to resume orderer connection for blocks provider purpose? 
Thanks.

@nickyng in v1.1 you can customize this 5 minute time
</p>
<p><strong>nickyng</strong> (Fri, 10 Nov 2017 10:16:47 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thanks. I can see the it will be configurable in v1.1... while we are using v1.0 having app built and tested, and thus, not at a good moment to look into v1.1 which is so-called a preview now... 
that's why would like to get advice whether another means to resume it on v1.0 ?? thanks a lot....

And compile the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 10 Nov 2017 11:21:45 GMT):<br/>
It might work

Oracle ---->>> verification module

JPMorgan ---->>> verification module

1. Oracle as well as JPMorgan has done transactions with verfication module. 
2. Now verification module can have information for both Oracle and JPMorgan.
3. Oracle should not have access for JPMorgan data and vice-versa. 

How can we implement this kind of requirement? Can we implement this by using channels and how we can implement if we have any chances?

Hey all ! I am trying to learn more about blockchain gossip protocols  ( and p2p in general ) Looking through some of the gossip code for fabric is seems to be somewhat similar to the raft protocol. Can anyone explain the difference or confirm that it is loosely  based on raft ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 18:35:17 GMT):<br/>
It is nowhere near raft
</p>
<p><strong>elewis787</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 18:38:30 GMT):<br/>
mind explain a little more why ? I have been reading through the gossip/election code. The pseudo code for identify a leader is what got me thinking about raft. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:15:13 GMT):<br/>
oh that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:15:37 GMT):<br/>
so, the main difference is... that the LE in gossip, favors availability / progress over consistency 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:15:48 GMT):<br/>
in other words, if you have a partition, some leader will get elected
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:16:13 GMT):<br/>
even if the partition is you as a peer, is isolated from the rest - you'll simply elect yourself as a leader

<p><strong>elewis787</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:18:33 GMT):<br/>
I see. So the actual data dissemination is weakly consistent meaning some nodes may be out of sync ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:21:29 GMT):<br/>
no no no
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:21:34 GMT):<br/>
this has nothing to do with it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:21:46 GMT):<br/>
the leader election only determines who will connect to the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:21:48 GMT):<br/>
that's all
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:22:06 GMT):<br/>
the peers want only 1 peer to connect to the orderer, from all the organization
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:22:11 GMT):<br/>
and the rest to receive the blocks via gossip
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:23:01 GMT):<br/>
of course the ledger, is identical among all peers (strong consistency in that aspect)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:23:06 GMT):<br/>
otherwise it wouldn't be a blockchain right?
</p>
<p><strong>elewis787</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 19:25:59 GMT):<br/>
I see. That makes sense thanks for the explanation !

<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 20:21:30 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm can you please expand on that? If the blocks are disseminated via gossip which is not strongly consistent, then how is the ledger identical among all the peers? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 20:23:53 GMT):<br/>
The leader election isn't strongly consistent
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 20:23:58 GMT):<br/>
the replication is
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 20:24:15 GMT):<br/>
each block, gets put into the ledger by order
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 20:24:19 GMT):<br/>
and is verified 
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 20:27:30 GMT):<br/>
does the leader wait until the other peers have received the block before committing it? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 20:29:58 GMT):<br/>
no...
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 21:15:45 GMT):<br/>
I'm having trouble seeing how it's strongly consistent. Suppose there are 2 peers, p1 and p2. Suppose a client queries a CC for key "k", which has value "v1" at time t1. Specifically, suppose query(p1, k)@t1 = v1, and query(p2, k)@t1 = v1. Now suppose "k" has been updated to "v2", and p1 is the leader. Could there not be a race where query(p1, k)@t2 = v2 and query(p2, k)@t2 = v1?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=K3Nmq7eDiQad8cTHu) @samwood Leader means being responsible to pull blocks with ordered transactions from the ordering service and take care of blocks dissemination within the org, I'm not sure how this related to the consistency and scenario you've described? also as @yacovm mentioned, election isn't strongly consistent, e.g. there could be a case where an org will have more than one leader, but in that case the only implication will be that two peers pulling blocks from the ordering instead of one.
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:11:42 GMT):<br/>
and to your point, yes it's possible that if ledger height on two different peer not the same, you might query and see different results
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:12:07 GMT):<br/>
although, this has no relation to the gossip leader election 
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:12:31 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin sure, but this is a result of the block replication which seems to be eventually consistent, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:12:57 GMT):<br/>
what is the result of block replication?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:13:37 GMT):<br/>
generally speaking, yes, state update is eventually consistent 
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:13:38 GMT):<br/>
I'm having trouble reconciling your comment "yes it's possible that if ledger height on two different peer not the same, you might query and see different results " , with yacovm's earlier comment "of course the ledger, is identical among all peers (strong consistency in that aspect) "
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:14:23 GMT):<br/>
well, there is a latency in the network
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:14:49 GMT):<br/>
so it might be the case where peer p1 at ledger height 100, while peer p2 at 99
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:15:16 GMT):<br/>
wrt, state up until block 99, both ledger are equal 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:15:16 GMT):<br/>
wrt state,  up until block 99, both ledger are equal 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:15:16 GMT):<br/>
wrt state,  up until block 99, both ledgers are equal 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:17:17 GMT):<br/>
also blocks applied and delivered to the ledger according to the sequence number
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:17:59 GMT):<br/>
so say peer p2, from my example which at block num 99 will get block 110, it will still wait until it will get block number 100
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:21:38 GMT):<br/>
OK, thanks. Do leaders commit their blocks as soon as they receive them from the orderer? Just to clarify, they don't communicate with other leaders or peers before committing blocks correct? (e.g, a 2 phase commit)
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:23:24 GMT):<br/>
there is no need for 2 phase commit here
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:23:48 GMT):<br/>
leader commits the block as soon as it gets it
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:24:42 GMT):<br/>
what will be the reason to communicate with other leaders? 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:24:57 GMT):<br/>
block signed with OSN
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:25:09 GMT):<br/>
could be easily verified

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:29:05 GMT):<br/>
To be honest I don't think that strong vs weak consistency are right terminologies to describe peers. 

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:30:21 GMT):<br/>
Usually when you talk about strong vs weak you think about replicated state machines vs. systems that may return a false result but eventually converge
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:30:47 GMT):<br/>
however - in fabric, each time you query a peer (assuming it is honest) - it will return to you a result that was correct to some point in time
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:30:53 GMT):<br/>
it may not be the latest result
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:31:04 GMT):<br/>
but it is always "correct"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:31:42 GMT):<br/>
it just may be in the past, and the peer isn't updated yet
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:31:59 GMT):<br/>
Even in replicated state machines, a replica or two might be lagging behind
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:32:40 GMT):<br/>
the difference is that in fabric, most peers might be lagging behind
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:32:51 GMT):<br/>
its because the consensus isn't done in the peers
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:36:36 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the explanations @C0rWin @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:39:51 GMT):<br/>
I agree that the strong/weak consistency terminology is confusing. |When I think of strong consistency I think that all peers will agree on a value before any of them return it to a client. E..g, all peers appear to be at the same height from the perspective of the client
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:41:34 GMT):<br/>
So in that case it is not
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:57:43 GMT):<br/>
i gather the orderer maintains a current block height and rejects transactions that read data from a block height that is less than the current block height (per the "read-write set semantics" section in the docs) ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:58:35 GMT):<br/>
No, orderers blidly order transactions 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:58:39 GMT):<br/>
*blindly
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:59:00 GMT):<br/>
You throw trnsactions into them and they cut identical blocks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:59:10 GMT):<br/>
(identical across all orderers)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:59:20 GMT):<br/>
They are strongly consistant :wink:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:59:58 GMT):<br/>
Though, it is also not a good way of describing
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 23:00:09 GMT):<br/>
Bevause the strong consistency comes from kafka
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 23:00:26 GMT):<br/>
hmm, just thinking out loud here, but if the orderer isn't enforcing the read-write set semantics and the peers aren't strongly consistent (per discussion above)) then are there not situations then that could put the network in an inconsistent state? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 23:00:36 GMT):<br/>
An orderer node might be behind too
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 23:00:51 GMT):<br/>
If he cant connect to kafka
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 23:01:34 GMT):<br/>
So, the read-write logical semantics are enforced at commit
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 23:07:09 GMT):<br/>
i guess i'm confused what commit means -- this is after the tx has been endorsed, and included in a block by the orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 23:09:13 GMT):<br/>
is it possible for 2 peers to be at the same height and have different world state ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 23:11:43 GMT):<br/>
It is not possible
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 23:12:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes, commit is when the transaction comes into the ledger

Hi all, in the fabric docs it was given "Anchor peer is a peer node on a channel that all other peers can discover and communicate with." My understanding is that the communication between peers of different orgs is through these anchor peers. To test that, I brought down the anchor peer of OrgA and triggered an invoke transaction on a peer of another Org. Later queried the non anchor peer of OrgA and I could still get the latest result for query. So, what exactly means by " all other peers can discover and communicate with"?

Hi @yacovm . Can you let me know why are we not joining anchor peers in the channel and the balance-transfer example? I want to know the benefit and disadvantage if any of defining anchor peers. Also, please let me know what is the effect of not having anchor peers on election or behavior of leading peer. Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:21:15 GMT):<br/>
@ArnabChatterjee you need anchor peers to be able to connect two different organization, think of it like a cross org bootstrap set, it's orthogonal to the concept of leader election and presence or absence of anchors has no effect on leader election
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:22:28 GMT):<br/>
leader election purpose is to choose the peer responsible to get connected to the ordering service and pull the blocks via gossip to rest of the peers
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:23:09 GMT):<br/>
peers monitoring availability of the leader peer and in case it's down or not reachable for some reason a new leader has been elected 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:23:44 GMT):<br/>
while wrt anchor peers, you need them so two organization will be able to advertise and share membership of peers within the channel
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:31:14 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @C0rWin . How does setting anchor peer enable other orgs to discover peers in my org? Does it somehow expose my endorsing peers to allow for endorsement or something like that? 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:31:41 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:31:56 GMT):<br/>
setting anchor peers and config update transaction
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:31:56 GMT):<br/>
setting anchor peers is a config update transaction
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:32:24 GMT):<br/>
once it get applied within orgs, anchors peers get learned and used to bridge the membership across peers
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:33:03 GMT):<br/>
peers in fact shares local membership views via anchors

Hi. I'm new to the code base and looking at ways to speed up some of the unit test coverage. I've noticed there are a lot of sleeps in the gossip/comm package. One of the patterns in the tests it to setup two comm instances, start go routines to handle messages, and then send messages across the comm instances. Between the two calls to send, there's a sleep.

When the sleep is removed, the tests fail. It looks like this happens because of a race between client connections and server connections. Basically, client connections from a->b created by `Send` are closed (and the associated output buffer with the pending message is drained) when the connection from b->a is established and the `onConnected` callback is driven.

The sleep is clearly avoiding this issue but is losing the message the correct behavior? Should everything in the send queue be dropped on the floor when the message target initiates a connection concurrently?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:27:09 GMT):<br/>
uh, I don't think it has to do with queues, actually. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:27:19 GMT):<br/>
i'ts basically because gossip keeps a single connection to a peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:27:42 GMT):<br/>
so if you connect to someone and someone connects to you at the same time...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:28:09 GMT):<br/>
you might "succeed" but then the connection is closed on the other side
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:28:16 GMT):<br/>
because he did the same thing
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:28:42 GMT):<br/>
So, help me out. TestBasic in gossip/comm/comm_test.go
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:29:02 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing it's the "most basic" flow that exists.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:29:23 GMT):<br/>
the `onConnection` callback happening when b connects back to a is closing the connection from a to b
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:29:40 GMT):<br/>
I get *why* that's happening. 
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:29:40 GMT):<br/>
I get *why* that's happening. (single connection between peers is desired)
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:30:42 GMT):<br/>
going back to the goal (remove the sleeps), what is expected?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:30:46 GMT):<br/>
if you want to make tests faster I don't think the comm package is the right place, actually
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:30:52 GMT):<br/>
there are much worse places :(
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:30:56 GMT):<br/>
like gossip/service

<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:31:11 GMT):<br/>

The test is structured where it's sending a message, sleeping, and sending a message. Should it be structured (instead) to send a message and simply expect the target to receive it?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:33:05 GMT):<br/>
oh, 
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:33:08 GMT):<br/>
Is dropping the contents of the send queue expected? (possibly - since it's no blocking)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:33:24 GMT):<br/>
no, the point was to to have both instances send each other
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:33:51 GMT):<br/>
the sleep between is because the code doesn't support that concurrent event :/ 
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:34:06 GMT):<br/>
but the test is artificially working around the race for a positive outcome - and there are other ways that take less real time
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:34:06 GMT):<br/>
when 2 peers create connections, at the very same instance
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:34:21 GMT):<br/>
yeah there are
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:34:23 GMT):<br/>
we can make the test
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:34:38 GMT):<br/>
check if the 2nd peer got the message from the 1st
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:34:43 GMT):<br/>
and then continue
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:34:44 GMT):<br/>
that's what I did.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:34:48 GMT):<br/>
went down to ~4ms
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:34:49 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:35:06 GMT):<br/>
cool we've gained a second :)
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:35:29 GMT):<br/>
but I wanted to ask explicitly about the fact that the onConnection happening on the server - it closes the client connection and drops all pending messages
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:35:46 GMT):<br/>
that really seems odd - we didn't "drain" it by sending - we dropped them
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:36:01 GMT):<br/>
local tests are down to 6m for me (so it's not just this)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:36:29 GMT):<br/>
yes we did
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:36:58 GMT):<br/>
well this is because implementing detection that a connections happens from the other side while you are connecting to that side is much more complex
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:37:10 GMT):<br/>
to just have a naive implementation that replaces the connection always
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:39:57 GMT):<br/>
but don't you think it's more cost-effective to go after "slow" tests (i.e the service package, they are not parallelized)?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:40:20 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 19:42:02 GMT):<br/>

@yacovm Do peers ever gossip blocks across organizations? Or is that reserved strictly for things like private data?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:10:28 GMT):<br/>
not via classic gossip but via point-to-point state transfer, and only if they were already committed
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:10:48 GMT):<br/>
private data is transferred in 2 ways:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:11:29 GMT):<br/>
1) When state transfer (block transfer which is cross-org too) occurs, the peer piggybacks related private data on these messages
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:12:05 GMT):<br/>
2) When the gossip coordinator (`gossip/privdata/coordinator.go`) detects missing private data that it doesn't have on disk, it fetches from other peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:12:14 GMT):<br/>
for the latter its also cross org
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:12:18 GMT):<br/>
but it's only private data
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:12:26 GMT):<br/>
and we ask the MSP to check if it's eligible
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:12:34 GMT):<br/>
I guess you're asking for config changes?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:12:46 GMT):<br/>
Note that gossip doesn't use the ACL management 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:12:51 GMT):<br/>
only channel config
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:14:25 GMT):<br/>
oh I also forgot
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:14:31 GMT):<br/>
that peers also send private data upon endorsement
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:14:36 GMT):<br/>
according to latest config
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:14:42 GMT):<br/>
It was actually a more generic question I was dm-ed, since I did not know the answer, I thought I would ask here.

> not via classic gossip but via point-to-point state transfer, and only if they were already committed

Just to confirm, for 'classic gossip', blocks are gossiped speculatively (a peer may re-broadcast a block to another peer, prior to the commitment time validation checks).

For "point to point state transfer", this would be a peer responding to an explicit request for a block? Will this happen automatically if an org is partitioned from the ordering service (but not to another peer org which has a connection to the orderer)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:15:02 GMT):<br/>
yes and yes
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:15:22 GMT):<br/>
Great, thanks @yacovm !
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:15:38 GMT):<br/>
>  this would be a peer responding to an explicit request for a block?
The peer detects a fellow peer that has a higher ledger height than his
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:15:48 GMT):<br/>
and thus asks for a block from the highest one
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:15:48 GMT):<br/>
and then asks for a block from the highest one
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:17:30 GMT):<br/>
One final question -- does the point-to-point state transfer involve the  gossip 'leader'? Or is 'leader' only related to the ordering service?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:17:45 GMT):<br/>
the latter :)
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:18:00 GMT):<br/>

Hello everyone, I have a question regarding the sync of peer node(s) once they are stopped and restarted. Is there some specific standard logs in the peer container that confirms that the peer has been brought back to sync with the remaining peers? I'm looking at the peer container logs but to no avail.  Thanks beforehand.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=8HBjXzvRfYeX3v2MX) @C0rWin - Thanks. I want to know if there is any specific mechanism that is carried out. For example, if I am having 4 peer nodes and 3 of them are faultuy, is there any kind of implicit consensus running at the gossip level that will come into action and bring all 4 of them in sync. I am interested in knowing if something like BFT is implemented?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=68JmpJ3SXHd3DitNq) @ArnabChatterjee the anti entropy in context of gossip is mechanism to take care to bring partitioned nodes or newly connected nodes up to speed by taking care to replicate missing blocks. There is no consensus running at gossip level, there is a layer which leverages natural order of blocks sequence numbers given from ordering service to maintain same order while forwarding block for commit into the ledger. There is block verification in place to check the integrity, hence not really sure why you mention BFT in this context.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 17:15:08 GMT):<br/>
that's a misconfiguration
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 17:15:26 GMT):<br/>
most chances are - you used the same certificate for 2 peers
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:40:19 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Does the gossip protocol not allow multiple peers to share a certificate?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:40:27 GMT):<br/>
of course not
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:40:40 GMT):<br/>
why?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:40:51 GMT):<br/>
because a certificate is an identity of a node
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:41:50 GMT):<br/>
and if I want to have copies of that node for HA?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:42:07 GMT):<br/>
The nodes have unique IP addresses
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:45:05 GMT):<br/>
don't do that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:45:14 GMT):<br/>
don't use your own HA methods
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:45:22 GMT):<br/>
if you want HA just have more peers with different certificates
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:45:29 GMT):<br/>
really, fabric does HA for you so you won't have to
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:52:51 GMT):<br/>
yet for an OSN, we need to do our own HA as the SDKs only support specifying a single url for the ordering service
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:53:25 GMT):<br/>
oh, they do?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:53:28 GMT):<br/>
:/ 
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:54:14 GMT):<br/>
at least the node.js SDK you specify a single url for the orderer...
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:54:53 GMT):<br/>
no list/array of urls...   so we can hide multiple OSNs behind a load balancer...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:56:04 GMT):<br/>
yes, you can
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:56:14 GMT):<br/>
make it a network-level LB
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:56:21 GMT):<br/>
right...
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:56:29 GMT):<br/>
have to think some more about peers though
</p>
<p><strong>novusopt</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 06:35:52 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thanks for the response I will check. One more question what is the difference between CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT and CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP?
</p>
<p><strong>novusopt</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 07:12:31 GMT):<br/>
I have checked and each peer has a different certificate...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 08:29:00 GMT):<br/>
Bootstrap is a peer it contacts when in starts up in order to know other peers im the network
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 08:29:22 GMT):<br/>
External endpoont is the address you publish to peers in other organizations

peer has to be online and connected to accept the communication and being able to receive message 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 12:02:30 GMT):<br/>
there is a way to sync up off lines nodes, not directly connected to gossip though 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Thu, 01 Feb 2018 12:02:51 GMT):<br/>
also, there is no such thing as submitting peer

I am trying to setup up peers on different servers. How do they discover each other? Any bootstrapping needs to be done?

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:17:07 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:17:09 GMT):<br/>
@sampath06 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:17:23 GMT):<br/>
You have ways in which peers discover each other
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:17:38 GMT):<br/>
peers that are in the same org, do that via the gossip.bootstrap parameter 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:17:47 GMT):<br/>
peers of different orgs, discover each other via anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>sampath06</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:20:12 GMT):<br/>
So I set the anchor peer to peer0 and am trying to bring up peer1 on another server. Peer0 comes up and joins the channel correctly. But when trying to bring peer1 up, I am getting the following error
```
peer1.fi1.com    | 2018-02-22 14:17:54.330 UTC [gossip/discovery] func1 -> WARN 1df Could not connect to {127.0.0.1:7051 [] [] 127.0.0.1:7051 <nil>} : x509: cannot validate certificate for 127.0.0.1 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs
```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:20:33 GMT):<br/>
aha, very good
</p>
<p><strong>sampath06</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:20:55 GMT):<br/>
configtx.yaml has
```
        AnchorPeers:
            # AnchorPeers defines the location of peers which can be used
            # for cross org gossip communication.  Note, this value is only
            # encoded in the genesis block in the Application section context
            - Host: peer0.fi1.com
              Port: 7051
```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:20:58 GMT):<br/>
it has nothing to do with anchor peers though
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:21:07 GMT):<br/>
that message is when it tries to connect to the bootstrap peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:21:15 GMT):<br/>
that is in `core.yaml`
</p>

https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L136
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:21:42 GMT):<br/>
what version are you running?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:22:14 GMT):<br/>
are you running with docker?
</p>
<p><strong>sampath06</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:23:29 GMT):<br/>
Yes.. using latest 
```
hyperledger/fabric-peer        latest                 f00c5d490d19        3 weeks ago         170MB

```
</p>
<p><strong>sampath06</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:23:43 GMT):<br/>
So how do I change it when the peer0 is on a different server?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:23:49 GMT):<br/>
ok then what is the value of `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP` ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:24:06 GMT):<br/>
are you using docker-compose?
</p>
<p><strong>sampath06</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:25:58 GMT):<br/>
yes. havent set the value. Let me try setting that to peer0 and see if that works. 
</p>
<p><strong>sampath06</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:36:52 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Am getting the following error now
```
peer1.fi1.com    | 2018-02-22 14:35:11.482 UTC [gossip/discovery] func1 -> WARN 1df Could not connect to {peer0.fi1.com:7051 [] [] peer0.fi1.com:7051 <nil>} : context deadline exceeded
```
Have set the remote address mapping in extra_hosts in the compose file
```
    extra_hosts:
        - "peer0.fi1.com:52.187.146.176"
```
Any help?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:38:13 GMT):<br/>
1) first try to log into the container and see if the address is resolved
2) Try to see if the port is reachable
3) Set `CORE_LOGGING_GRPC=debug` in the environment variables, it might be a TLS mis-configuration
</p>
<p><strong>sampath06</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:45:46 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Thank you so much. Fixed the issue. The port was not open in Azure where it is hosted. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:45:58 GMT):<br/>
no prob, happy to help :)

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 15:55:58 GMT):<br/>
@david_dornseifer I'd guess that's a misconfiguration issue
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 15:57:13 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm hmm think the x509 cert for the orgs should be distributed via the channel config right? - the tls section 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 15:57:22 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 15:57:44 GMT):<br/>
unless its in the same org, which is not the case here
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 15:59:17 GMT):<br/>
hmm ok, already checked it but i'll have another look :) - there is no no need to distribute the tls root cas to the peers manually right? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 15:59:58 GMT):<br/>
you only need the root cert of the peer's org to be present in `tls/ca.cert`
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 16:00:33 GMT):<br/>
thx - will check the config again

actually, even if the handshake would succeed, gossip would reject it :)

How do the peers of different organisation join the network. Is it just through the channel join?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 10:24:30 GMT):<br/>
you can use a cryptogen of version v1.1
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 10:24:38 GMT):<br/>
and then it will add IP SANs to the certificates

yes with openssl
</p>
<p><strong>SashiKanth</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 11:04:39 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:02:44 GMT):<br/>
Hello, all. I have a question regarding gossip configuration in a network with multiple peers from multiple orgs: what happens if I don't configure the env variables `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_*` in peer config?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:05:36 GMT):<br/>
it uses the core.yamll values
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:05:40 GMT):<br/>
from the `core.yaml` file
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:08:45 GMT):<br/>
So in this case all peers will be configured as "org leaders" and receive blocks directly from the orderer service, is this correct?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:10:24 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:10:26 GMT):<br/>
I think
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:12:19 GMT):<br/>
In this scenario, what happens to a newly connected peer? Does it receive the existing blocks from the orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:18:22 GMT):<br/>
Another question: configuring the env variables `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_*` is considered *mandatory* or *optional* in a network with many orgs and many peers?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:28:17 GMT):<br/>
depends on what you want
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:34:10 GMT):<br/>
please elaborate. I'm trying to understand how to properly configure a network but really don't know the implications, even after reading the docs (fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/gossip.html)
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:34:31 GMT):<br/>
I appreciate your help :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:35:35 GMT):<br/>
so, you need to define a bootstrap list for your peers for your org
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:35:43 GMT):<br/>
ummm... and also define anchor peers in the configtx.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:35:53 GMT):<br/>
I think that's basically it, the rest should work out of the box
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:39:37 GMT):<br/>
I understand these are the steps needed to properly configure gossip, right?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:39:49 GMT):<br/>
That's ok to me
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:40:24 GMT):<br/>
What I trying to figure out is what are the impacts of not configuring the gossip and use the default config
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:41:08 GMT):<br/>
ah - all peers will connect to the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:41:11 GMT):<br/>
that's it basically
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:43:11 GMT):<br/>
Ok...but do peer discovery and channel membership, ledger dissemination and update ledger data for newly connected peers will work fine?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:43:11 GMT):<br/>
Ok...but will peer discovery and channel membership, ledger dissemination and update ledger data for newly connected peers work fine?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:44:06 GMT):<br/>
I'm assuming it will, but the messages will be receveid from the orderer instead of from other peers, but I want to be sure I'm understanding correctly. :)
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:47:16 GMT):<br/>
And when all peers connected to the orderer starts to impact the network performance?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:47:44 GMT):<br/>
>  Ok...but will peer discovery and channel membership, ledger dissemination and update ledger data for newly connected peers work fine? 
it will not
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:47:56 GMT):<br/>
unless you have anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:48:07 GMT):<br/>
then it would
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:48:14 GMT):<br/>
but you also need to configure your endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:48:23 GMT):<br/>
`CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ENDPOINT`

</p>

in the configtx.yaml
</p>

- What is the impact of not configuring the gossip (use the default config)
- If gossip is not enabled but anchor peers are defined in `configtx.yaml` and peer address is configured in `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT`, do we have the same benefits from configuring gossip?
- When all peers are connected to the orderer (as org leaders), is there any performance degradation due to network size?
- In what situations/scenarios configuring gossip properly in a network is recommended?

You need anchor peers to know of other peers. If you had `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP` too then you could know of peers in your own org.
> - If gossip is not enabled but anchor peers are defined in `configtx.yaml` and peer address is configured in `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT`, do we have the same benefits from configuring gossip?
if you have external endpoint, your peer is visible to other orgs and it is conversing with peers from other orgs. But keep in mind you need to configure `CORE_PEER_ADDRESS` to have gossip with peers in your own org.
> - When all peers are connected to the orderer (as org leaders), is there any performance degradation due to network size?
You will hit a bandwidth bottleneck at the orderer if the network can't keep up, but that's it.
> - In what situations/scenarios configuring gossip properly in a network is recommended? 
when you have lots of peers and lots of organizations, and when you use the v1.1 feature called "side DB" - gossip is used in that to pass data between peers.

one last question, @yacovm: what do you mean by "lots of peers" and "lots of organizations"?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 18:44:30 GMT):<br/>
many
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 18:44:41 GMT):<br/>
more than 10, 50 or 100? :)
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 18:44:47 GMT):<br/>
how big
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 18:45:05 GMT):<br/>
it depends on the block creation rate and the bandwidth the orderers can give and their amount
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 18:45:12 GMT):<br/>
just do the math
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 18:45:21 GMT):<br/>
if you have too many peers pulling too many blocks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 18:45:27 GMT):<br/>
and the bandwidth is too low
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 18:45:38 GMT):<br/>
then you are bottle-necked by bandwidth

@yacovm  I encountered this phenomenon when I tried to measure performance of fabric through multi-thread. 
The time spent in block committing phase were huge, nearly taking up 90% of the total. 
here is the logging message embedded in the source 
```
2018/03/23 14:40:40.858 [INFO ] ★START SEND OS REQUESTID=0.3381804038376005  f822028580ce3e5aaf46ba45446cef535e3022b48e32a19febcfd3283983d5dc

```
from which you can see that it took 1449ms in the blocking committing.
I was wondering what are causing this delay. 
My guess would be something happened in one of the goroutine waiting for request? Or the influences from gossip?

Hi.. I am using `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER and CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION` settings in my fabric network which consists of 3 organizations with 3 peer each. I have set `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=true` for one peer in each organization and false for the others and `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION=false` for all the peers. Now, only my leaders are getting the blocks delivered and all the non leaders aren't. Could anybody please help me on this. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 31 Mar 2018 19:58:43 GMT):<br/>
@jarvis26 looks like you don't have bootstrap peers or anchor peers, and the non leaders don't know about the leader peers and vice versa.

@MeenakshiSingh - the same org only. Read the comments in the core.yaml.

you set anchor peers via a config update

not sure what you're asking
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 08:37:41 GMT):<br/>
but you need to submit the anchor peer transaction to the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 08:55:05 GMT):<br/>
I executed the following commands for generating the channel and anchor peer artifacts:
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 08:55:11 GMT):<br/>
```CONFIGTXGEN=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/build/bin/configtxgen

</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 08:56:53 GMT):<br/>
Not sure where these `Org1MSPanchors.tx` and `Org2MSPanchors.tx` would be used as I am able to create and transact upon a channel which I create using the `channel1.tx` artifact.

How do a I work out how many signing operations there will be for peer / client / orders  (non tls signing that is) in steady state ? I need this to make sure that our HSMs have sufficient capacity. I really want the answer for fabric 1.0 but it would be useful to know if this would change with 1.1.
Its clear that the submitter /   endorsers will each sign for a transaction, as will the orderers each sign once per block. 
I've read that the gossip protocol also uses signed blocks for "keep alive".
Are there "keep alive" between peers and orderer ? Is that per channel ? Does it sign again each message ?
If we put anchor peers into the config how does that add to the signing? 
If we have multiple peers in an organisation how does that affect the signing ?

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 14:52:37 GMT):<br/>
signed blocks for keep alives?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 14:52:58 GMT):<br/>
we send signed "alive messages" for keep alives
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 14:53:09 GMT):<br/>
the keep alive between peers and orderers are at the grpc level
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 15:46:22 GMT):<br/>
Does the peer sign those blocks ?
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 15:46:22 GMT):<br/>
Does the peer sign those blocks ? Read the blocks says "Online peers indicate their availability by continually broadcasting “alive” messages, with each containing the public key infrastructure (PKI) ID and the *signature* of the sender over the message." 
"Although TLS certs are also used, it is the peer certificates that are authenticated in the gossip layer. "

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:21:11 GMT):<br/>
how often - its configurable

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:21:20 GMT):<br/>
are you worried that HSM is costly or something?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:21:45 GMT):<br/>
it should be one in a few seconds
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:22:18 GMT):<br/>
HSMs only support a certain number of signing operations per second depending on the key types and lengths used.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:22:31 GMT):<br/>
well but we sign once every few seconds
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:22:38 GMT):<br/>
so it's a fraction per second
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:22:50 GMT):<br/>
like, for example- once in 5 seconds
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:22:51 GMT):<br/>
Is that once per second per channel ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:22:54 GMT):<br/>
i think that's the default
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:23:04 GMT):<br/>
so we have alive messages that are global and cross channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:23:09 GMT):<br/>
and special messages per channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:23:21 GMT):<br/>
think of them as alive messages per channel
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:24:03 GMT):<br/>
So if we have 13 channels that's 13 signings per "configured interval" per peer. 
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:24:57 GMT):<br/>
Are there keepalives on the peer to order coms as well ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:26:09 GMT):<br/>
well 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:26:12 GMT):<br/>
if you have 13 channels
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:26:19 GMT):<br/>
just increase the time of the state info message sending
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:26:26 GMT):<br/>
to like - once in 13 seconds
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:26:39 GMT):<br/>
but you need to do it globally across channel ideally
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:26:46 GMT):<br/>
to all peers in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:27:00 GMT):<br/>
so, between peers and orderers - there is a gRPC level keepalive
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:27:04 GMT):<br/>
so no ECDSA signing
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:27:13 GMT):<br/>
it's like a tcp level ping-pong
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:27:25 GMT):<br/>
and there is a connection for each channel between peer and orderer
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:29:37 GMT):<br/>
So we just get a single setup signed message per channel per peer between peer and orderer and after that messages (but encrypted at the TCP level).
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:30:54 GMT):<br/>
yeah exactly!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:30:58 GMT):<br/>
to be more specific:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:31:15 GMT):<br/>
the peer sends to the orderer- "hey, can you start giving me block for channel X starting from sequence N?"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:31:20 GMT):<br/>
the orderer checks the certificate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:31:28 GMT):<br/>
either complies or rejects
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:31:40 GMT):<br/>
and starting from that point - the connection is encrypted via TLS
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:31:46 GMT):<br/>
*per channel*
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:31:58 GMT):<br/>
if you're concerned about HSM performance
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:32:06 GMT):<br/>
what you *really* need to be afraid of
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:32:14 GMT):<br/>
is the validation of transactions :(
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:32:19 GMT):<br/>
imagine a block that has 150 transactions
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:32:51 GMT):<br/>
the peer, validates them `n` at a time, when `n` is number of cores
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:33:08 GMT):<br/>
but, if you can only do `x` hsm operations in a second
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:33:17 GMT):<br/>
then.... you know
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:33:27 GMT):<br/>
depends on how big `x` is
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:33:35 GMT):<br/>
what is its estimated size btw?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:33:48 GMT):<br/>
how many HSM signature verification can you do in a second?
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:40:04 GMT):<br/>
 We have 4 gemalto HSMs  (for availability) . So we can do a lot. I forget the numbers.  When we calculated we allowed for a signature for the submitter & 3 endorsers per transactions and 3 orderers per block.  But did not know about the gossip signatures.  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:41:33 GMT):<br/>
and i'm telling you that gossip signatures should be the least of your worries
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:41:45 GMT):<br/>
you should worry about validation of transactions
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:41:49 GMT):<br/>
that's where the big money is
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:43:04 GMT):<br/>
Given that we don't have anchor peers specified , and are on 1.0.6 and only have one peer per organisation , how do I   make sure that the peer does not attempt to sign gossip blocks unnecessarily ?
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:43:48 GMT):<br/>
Do you know if there is a variable that gets checks to say "don't bother with gossip" ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:44:02 GMT):<br/>
if you don't have anchor peers and don't have bootstrap peers too
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:44:05 GMT):<br/>
then there is no gossip
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:44:16 GMT):<br/>
and peers don't sign blocks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:44:19 GMT):<br/>
they sign messages
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:46:44 GMT):<br/>
Does the fabric work that out before signing  the height of its channel or only afterwards ?
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 16:46:44 GMT):<br/>
Does the fabric work that out before signing  the height of its channel or only afterwards ?  We have had a problem with the HSMs and CPU and in the stack trace I did see calls relating to example and I was juts a bit worried we might still be signing.    gossip. goroutine 182 [select]:

Hi,
I am relatively new to fabric. I have gone through the documentation and I am working with a few samples in hand. I am not able to find out a configuration file which is mentioning the gossip protocol for the network. 
1) Can anyone please guide me to find out where I can do the configuration? 
2) Also where can I find the list of peers in the organisation to whom the leader can communicate?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 19 Apr 2018 08:13:47 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 19 Apr 2018 08:14:09 GMT):<br/>
2) peers in the org communicate with all peers in the same org

hi..can we define multiple peers for bootstrap within the same organization against the `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP`. i.e., if there are n peers in an organization then for each peer mention n-1 other peers as bootstrap peers irrespective of which one is the anchor peer or the leader peer for the organization?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 12:13:13 GMT):<br/>
@MeenakshiSingh yeah - just separate them with spaces
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 12:13:15 GMT):<br/>
it should work
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 12:13:37 GMT):<br/>
this code actually treats this as an array and not as a single string
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 12:40:54 GMT):<br/>
ok.. Also, how does the gossip ensure byzantine failures as mentioned here: ```Gossip messaging is continuous, and
each peer on a channel is constantly receiving current and consistent ledger data from multiple peers. Each gossiped
message is signed, thereby allowing Byzantine participants sending faked messages to be easily identified and the
distribution of the message(s) to unwanted targets to be prevented. Peers affected by delays, network partitions, or
other causes resulting in missed blocks will eventually be synced up to the current ledger state by contacting peers in
possession of these missing blocks```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 12:50:39 GMT):<br/>
it is mentioned how 
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=337NBH37ggAKk58hR) As for my earlier question, could you please elaborate on a few points:
1. `each peer on a channel is constantly receiving current and consistent ledger data from multiple peers.` --> does the gossip message encapsulate all the data present in the ledger or only the world state..that is to say that gossip messages ensure ledger consistency/validation or transaction/worldstate validation? If its entire ledger then wouldn't gossip messages themselves become too heavy and add to latency? 
2. How does the Gossip messages ensure sync between the peers? Can two lagging peers who haapen to have same number of blocks, will be allowed to participate in endorsement?
3. Now, since the gossip messages are signed, we can trust the handshake and hence any byzantine participants can be identified. However, how is the trust established as the peers do not possess certificates of other peers?
4. If in a network of 4 nodes (2 peers per org), if certificate of two peers, one in each org is compromised and the EP is AND(Org1MSP.member, Org2MSP.member), would gossip be able to identify this?
5. Is there a rule of thumb on how to securely define EPs based on the network?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=RJn7mWkZ7rHv4wbxJ) @yacovm ok, so this is for the lagging peer to get the missing blocks. This is one aspect of gossip, I presume. How do they really ensure sync, does this also require bundling of the entire data?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 18:20:01 GMT):<br/>
3) the rule is simple... 2 peers can talk to each other, only if they are either in the same organization (have same root CA) or they are both in some same channel

@yacovm "2 peers can talk to each other, only if they are either in the same organization (have same root CA)"
Does it mean that if two orgs have the same rootCA (e.g. Let's Encrypt in a future) their peers will be supposed to be in the same org?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 14:58:40 GMT):<br/>
same root CA... and as long as you don't have OUs
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 02:36:25 GMT):<br/>
Does the orderer keeps all history data in its ledger(I read some documents and found this module, haven't check in repo)? Can a leader peer pull all blocks only from orderer to catch up latest world state, or does it need to talk to other organizations' leader peer? Any sources or document would be helpful.

 Hi. I've got a theoretical error. Is not directly related to the gossip service, but with race conditions on endorsement. Let's say...
If there are two endorsers belonging to different orgs that are acting over the same variable, that variable is modified over the same state. I think, one of them is going to have an error on commitment and the winner will successfully modify the variable state. But: 
1. Which error is going to have the first client?
2. From who?

@yacovm @C0rWin if the `externalEndpoint` doesn't set,it doesn't use gossip to spread msg cross the orgs?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 16:12:57 GMT):<br/>
if you don't set an external endpoint to a peer then it is only visible to its own organization

Do anchor peers have to know and communicate with each other directly? I have a consortium network distributed in 2 machines. Machine 1 has the kafka orderers and org1 peers, machine2 has org2 peers. Both machine has different docker-compose bootstrapped networks and they don't use Swarm or something to communicate with other. Machine2's docker-compose file has `extra-hosts` to let org2 cli understand the public address of orderer containers, but I don't list public address of peer containers of org1. Then network is working fine, when I invoke chaincode in org1 cli, I can see the ledger is updated in org2. But the org2 peer's log has a lot of warning: 
```
2018-05-21 11:48:56.328 UTC [gossip/discovery] func1 -> WARN 13d Could not connect to {peer0.didi.com:7051 [] [] peer0.didi.com:7051 <nil>} : context deadline exceeded

```

Looks like the anchor peer of org2 want to gossip with anchor peer of org1? Does the gossip protocol work really like this, not through orderers->leading peers -> normal peers, but also has anchor peers involved?
</p>
<p><strong>lclclc</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:31:11 GMT):<br/>
If my guess is correct, when the consortium is large(take, for examle, 10 orgs), I have to pointed out every org's anchor peer in every machine's docker-compose file?

I went through the code and found that the `InitGossipService` in gossip_service.go does not send request to pull missing blocks rather it accepts any incoming gossip messages and sends membership request. Can anybody tell me where to look at and what initiates the thread to send a request message to pull missing blocks from broadcast peers?

Hey can anyone help me with this. I cannot figure out how the process of sharing missing blocks starts.
1. From Pull request - Cannot locate the code where such a request is created and sent.
2. Random Push of message blocks - Cannot locate this either. 
When a peer starts it just sends the membership request and connects to bootstrap peers a thread for accepting blocks starts. Where is the code for checking if its ledger is lacking behind and sending a pull message requesting missing blocks ?? Please help.

@yacovm I am running a blockchain network which includes 2 orgs with 3 peers for each org in multihost environment. I am using fabric-ca to generate peers and orderer certificates. some days back all of the services got stopped suddenly. I restarted all of the services but unfortunately by mistake, i recreated the peer1-org1 instead of just restart it. So i fetch the 0 block first from peer1-org1 and then make the peer1-org1 to rejoin the existing channel, I installed the chaincode and upgraded the chaincode. Now I am getting the below warning messages in all of the peer logs

hi, one question about service discovery, i checked it (using CLI discover) and it works fine.  What i don't understand is the following: fabric client SDK need to have access to TLS certificate of the peer(s) in order to be able to send endorsment proposal to that peer(s).  But, i can't seem to find TLS of the peer in any of the query responses that i executed (peer membership, configuration, endorsers). Am i missing something?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:05:16 GMT):<br/>
>  fabric client SDK need to have access to TLS certificate of the peer(s) in order to be able to send endorsment proposal to that peer(s)
of course that's not true.... where did you get that from? @IgorSim 
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:08:01 GMT):<br/>
hm, then what client need in case TLS is enabled on peer ? I though client need CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:10:23 GMT):<br/>
the client needs its *OWN* TLS certificate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:10:48 GMT):<br/>
notice that when you use the `discover` command you can mention your TLS certificate, right?
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:11:25 GMT):<br/>
that's right
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:11:31 GMT):<br/>
``--tlsKey=`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:11:31 GMT):<br/>
`--tlsKey=`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:11:41 GMT):<br/>
and `--tlsCert`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:11:48 GMT):<br/>
but you don't have to... right? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:12:04 GMT):<br/>
that's because if you don't put - the `discover` command in the background generates one for you
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:12:08 GMT):<br/>
and uses that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:12:22 GMT):<br/>
but you don't need the TLS of the peer, obviously
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:15:10 GMT):<br/>
if i understand right, tlsKey and tlsCert are used only if TLS client authentication is turned ON at peer side, is that corect?
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:15:10 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:26:58 GMT):<br/>
yep @IgorSim 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:27:22 GMT):<br/>
but... service discovery enforces client TLS authentication at the application level
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:27:45 GMT):<br/>
but the `discover` CLI - creates a TLS certificate for you, if you don't specify one in the config
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:40:02 GMT):<br/>
yes, tnx, i see what you just explained in the documentation, that is clear
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 13:37:06 GMT):<br/>
going back to my question, i will try to explain it better.  Maybe i should ask in sdk-java channel, but anyway here it is: When channel is initialized and peer is added to channel you can specify few peer properties . 
One of them is called:  'pemFile' - File location for x509 pem certificate for SSL
I thought this property basically represents CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE, if not then what is it?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 13:37:58 GMT):<br/>
@IgorSim that is a *peer* configuration
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 13:38:02 GMT):<br/>
not a *client* config ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 13:49:03 GMT):<br/>
that's right, CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE is indeed peer configuration but does client, i guess client==SDK, right :) , need that certificate during channel initialization, i.e. when adding a peer ?  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 13:55:17 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand what you're asking
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:10:04 GMT):<br/>
Let's say i'm using Fabric Java SDK, that means in order to be able to transact with HLF from Java SDK i need to initialize channel and add endorsing peer(s) and orderer to the channel.
API looks like this, for example:
Channel channel = client.newChannel(<channel_name>);
channel.addPeer(client.newPeer(<peer name>, <peer location>, *<peer properties>*)
I'm asking about <peer properties>, one of supported properties is called 'pemFile' , i'm asking what does it represents.
I hope its clearer now

but let's ask @rickr  ... he would know for sure
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:24:10 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/c5c31b8100f62a146220cffb6d304921dfce5829/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/HFClient.java#L286-L297
trust certificates 
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:31:52 GMT):<br/>
@rickr  yeah, i see, thanks, let's say peer doesn't have mutual TLS enabled, that means 'clientKeyFile' and 'clientCertFile' can be skipped. I'm not clear about 'pemFile' and unfortunately java doc doesn't help me as well. If for example i set 'pemFile' to  CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE then SDK works fine.
But, is that right setting, that is what i'm trying to understand...... I guess not because as far i understood discovery service doesn't return that value hence i can't 'dynamically' add and configure all peers in the channel 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:36:16 GMT):<br/>
how do you know that discovery doesn't return that value @IgorSim  ? 
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:38:28 GMT):<br/>
well, i executed supported server-side queries but i don't see it in the response, maybe i'm missing something...that lead me to ask myself question, what is pemFile, what does it represents
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:39:15 GMT):<br/>
so far, when i used SDK, i set pemFile=CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:39:25 GMT):<br/>
does that make sense? :)
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:42:25 GMT):<br/>
If the peer your doing discovery on is TLS enabled you're going to have provide a trust chain for that server certificate (the peer)   that's what the pemBytes and pemFile are for. You'll also need the client* if the server (peer) is enforcing mutual TLS
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 05:17:05 GMT):<br/>
so basically, executing discovery configuration query will return the trust chain under: msps/<organization_MSP>/tls_root_certs , is that correct @yacovm ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:10:27 GMT):<br/>
yeah... it returns all the MSP config @IgorSim 
</p>

ok, tnx

Hi Expert, I am currently using Fabric 1.2 and have setup my network in 3 ubuntu servers each with 1 org, 1couch, 1 ca, 1 cli, 1 orderer, 1 kakfa and 1 zookeeper..
my channel creation is also working and i can install the chaincodes in all the 3 peers
instantiate the chaincode in one of the peers...
Then i am trying to leverage the private data collection feature of Fabric 1.2. while doing so, i observed when i am firing the invoke command, i am getting an error in my 2nd peer's log whcih says - "Do not know any peer in the channel( mychannel ) that matches the policies , aborting
[gossip/privdata] fetchFromPeers -> WARN 494 Failed fetching private data for block 2 from peers: Empty membership"
due to which when i am trying to query the data in my second peer who has the access to the private data, i am not getting the same and an error is thrown again which says - "Error: endorsement failure during query. response: status:500 message:"{\"Error\":\"Failed to get state for marble1\"}"
"
in my peer log i found this eeror - " HandleTransaction -> ERRO 6eb [4d08c75d] Failed to handle GET_STATE. error: Private data matching public hash version is not available. Public hash version = &version.Height{BlockNum:0x2, TxNum:0x0}, Private data version = (*version.Height)(nil)"

<p><strong>chandrika</strong> (Sun, 19 Aug 2018 12:31:51 GMT):<br/>
. I took the same network which you shared. Only difference which i did is - I am using network_mode=host and trying to setup the network in 3 separate vms. Rest of the configurations i didnt change really... The error is saying something like this - "2018-08-18 09:10:22.837 UTC [gossip/privdata] fetch -> WARN 534 Do not know any peer in the channel( mychannel ) that matches the policies , aborting

In our current 1.0 configuration we don't have any anchor peer definitions ( we wanted our recovery to go back to the orderer and we only have one peer per organisation) .    I see that read the docs for  the service discovery says "and uses the network metadata information maintained by the gossip communication layer to find out which peers are online. " If we move to 1.2 will the service discovery service work correctly if we don't have anchor peers defined ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 09:50:07 GMT):<br/>
it will only work for the peer's organization @rsherwood 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 09:50:13 GMT):<br/>
and the peers won't know about other peers
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 10:16:14 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=ghXca3aLCjGY8Wrvv) @yacovm How much of the service discovery will not work ?    It says "With service discovery, applications no longer need to specify which peers they need endorsements from. The SDK can simply send a query to the discovery service asking which peers are needed given a channel and a chaincode ID. The discovery service will then compute a descriptor comprised of two objects:With service discovery, applications no longer need to specify which peers they need endorsements from. The SDK can simply send a query to the discovery service asking which peers are needed given a channel and a chaincode ID. The discovery service will then compute a descriptor comprised of two objects:"         Will the discovery service correctly identify the peers in other organisations, but not which are up to date , or will more that this not work ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 10:21:31 GMT):<br/>
so, endorsement policies that require AND from some organizations
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 10:21:33 GMT):<br/>
won't work
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 10:34:23 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=HAS8kDqAWX7t69S2i) @yacovm Given that most of endorsement policy's have an "AND"  between organization , I think you  are saying that the "Endorsement query" will not work . What about the   "Peer membership query" I assume that will not work either ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 10:43:41 GMT):<br/>
it will work
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 10:44:10 GMT):<br/>
look, not having anchor peers also makes you unable to use private data for inter-organizations
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=ibM66QxhiQS8RuZEa) @yacovm Hi , right now we don't use the private member data, although I can see a way it would be useful to us . We are planning our upgrade to 1.2 and I'm just trying to workout what we need to change, and what will work given that we don't want to make too many application changes, given there is limited budget.   
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 10:59:18 GMT):<br/>
you need to add anchor peers

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 11:00:19 GMT):<br/>
if you don't tend to constantly add and remove peers from the channel you can just make them all anchor peers

Hi 
I have couple of queries - 
1. Private Data collections - I could not find private data history , GetHistoryForKey - returns only public data 
Note: i am using public data as normal ledger , whilst only private data as Collections 
2. Is there any way i can find say recent 10 blocks from ledger, i dont see any API for it. The one we have is getBlockByTxID , which become quite tedious , since first we need to invoke transaction history and then invoke for each one of them to get Block . Any simpler way to this ?

Hi - I'm trying to get the discover command to work. I've setup BYFN (which has GOSSIP running). I've created the config file using the cmd discover (with private key and cert of Admin and TLSCA cert). When I run the following command from within the fabricsamples/bin directory I get an error:

$ ../bin/discover --configFile org1conf.yaml peers --channel mychannel  --server peer0.org1.example.com:7051
[failed connecting to peer0.org1.example.com:7051: failed connecting to discovery service: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded]

I've tried multiple host/port combinations and checked the keys/cert in the configfile. Any suggestions on how to debug this please? Thanks!

Hi @yacovm , On my mac I ran it from the /bin directory after installing FabricSamples. For the peer URL I've used 0.0.0.0:7051. I can see this command is making connection to the peer as I've turned on gRPC trace on the peer and can see:

grpc: Server.Serve failed to complete security handshake from "192.168.192.1:44144": remote error: tls: bad certificate

I've tried various combinations of certificates but can't seem to resolve this problem.

My config file looks like:

daves-mbp-2:first-network gormand$ cat org1conf.yaml 
version: 0
tlsconfig:
  certpath: ""
  keypath: ""
  peercacertpath: /Users/blockchain/fabric-samples/fabric-samples/first-network/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt
  timeout: 0s
signerconfig:
  mspid: Org1MSP
  identitypath: /Users/blockchain/fabric-samples/fabric-samples/first-network/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp/signcerts/Admin@org1.example.com-cert.pem

The command looks like:

../bin/discover --configFile ./org1conf.yaml peers --channel mychannel  --server 0.0.0.0:7051

Hi @yacovm , Some good news. Within in the *CLI* container I installed the *fabric-samples bin* directory to get the *discover* command and then ran the command successfully using the same privkey and certs as above. As I was in the CLI container on the same docker network as the peers I specified the host url as *peer0.org1.example.com:7051*. It responded in an instant. 

I've still not been able to get the discover command working from my host mac to the peer running in the docker container though :( I checked */etc/hosts* and it has *127.0.0.1	localhost* so I specified *127.0.0.1:7051* as the url but I still get the *tls bad certificate* message in the peer logs.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 10:46:07 GMT):<br/>

associate `127.0.0.1` with `peer0.org1.example.com`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 10:46:41 GMT):<br/>
in the `/etc/hosts`

<p><strong>gormand</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 11:33:52 GMT):<br/>
Hi @yacovm , that worked!! Adding `127.0.0.1 peer0.org1.example.com` to the hosts file has fixed the connection issue. Do you know why this is needed?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 11:37:44 GMT):<br/>
because when you do the TLS handshake
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 11:37:51 GMT):<br/>
the remote peer presents its certificate
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 11:37:57 GMT):<br/>
that has `peer0.org1.example.com`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 11:38:06 GMT):<br/>
and you expect 127.0.0.1
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 11:38:11 GMT):<br/>
so your client denies the connection
</p>
<p><strong>gormand</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 11:52:57 GMT):<br/>
Hi @yacovm thank you, that makes sense. Thanks for your help!

hi, i have one q, not sure if its related  to gossip protocol, anyway here it is. I have simple network that contains 3 ORGs, 2 of them are having  one peer, 3rd ORG is owning an ordering node(solo). Each organization peer is also an anchor peer and leading peer. Network was working fine for few days/weeks, but yesterday i noticed that one of the peers was missing few blocks. I checked orderer logs and saw that missing block(s) were delivered to both peers. I guess these are the messages indicating the delivery:
 [common/deliver] deliverBlocks -> DEBU 1587^[[0m [channel: xx] Delivering block for (..) for peer1Org1:52502
 [common/deliver] deliverBlocks -> DEBU 1589^[[0m [channel: xx] Delivering block for (..) for peer1Org2:33476
Next, i check peer logs, i noticed messages like the one below doesn't exist on peer which was missing few blocks
[blocksProvider] DeliverBlocks -> DEBU 9d9000^[[0m [xx] Adding payload locally, buffer seqNum = [33], peers number [1]
[blocksProvider] DeliverBlocks -> DEBU 9d9001^[[0m [xx] Gossiping block [33], peers number [1]
Does it mean block never reached the peer? Does orderer have some kind of re-try in this case? I didn't see anything in the logs.
I was also wondering if somehow problematic peer will understand that its own ledger height is not up-to-date(through gossip message or other kind of message coming from peer from the other ORG) and will try to 'pull' the missing blocks, or that's not how it works by design?
Btw, when i restarted peer container,  peer received missing blocks. It looks like peer was  'stuck' for some reason or there was network issue between orderer <->peer. 
One more thing, are gossip protocol functionalities (sync ledger data for ex)relevant only for peers from same org or also for cross-org?

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:42:18 GMT):<br/>
smells to me like a ledger deadlock. We had a bug fixed in v1.2
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:42:28 GMT):<br/>
that involves this kind of thing
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:42:34 GMT):<br/>
but I don't remember if a fix was released
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:43:14 GMT):<br/>
oh
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:43:17 GMT):<br/>
if it was released in 1.2, or planned to be realeased in 1.3 not sure i understand you
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:43:20 GMT):<br/>
right... we didn't release 1.2.1
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:43:28 GMT):<br/>
i think we'll release it either this or next week
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:43:33 GMT):<br/>
i see
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:43:40 GMT):<br/>
let me show you the bug, hold on
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:43:45 GMT):<br/>
which bug is this one, can you tell me jira id?
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:43:47 GMT):<br/>

FAB-11094
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:45:17 GMT):<br/>
so there was a bug in the ledger that made block commit get stuck 
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:46:27 GMT):<br/>
and that prevent peer from receiving new blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:46:56 GMT):<br/>
if the ledger is stuck...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:47:04 GMT):<br/>
obviously it won't commit new blocks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:47:11 GMT):<br/>
to commit a block you need to obtain a lock
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:47:19 GMT):<br/>
and if the lock is held and isn't released... ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:47:29 GMT):<br/>
but i don't know if this is the case in your problem
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:47:43 GMT):<br/>
did you restart the peer via docker?
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:47:47 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:47:50 GMT):<br/>
next time if you restart the peer - do something else
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:47:58 GMT):<br/>
`docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:48:05 GMT):<br/>
and then `pkill -SIGABRT peer`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:48:16 GMT):<br/>
this would make the peer die but also write to stderr the goroutine stack trace
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 20:48:25 GMT):<br/>
it will show if a deadlock occurred or not
</p>

ok, tnx for the tip....

@yacovm hi, we encountered the problem again, this time on different environment but symptoms looks the same. Goroutine stack trace can be found at https://pastebin.com/KSXuXNZt ...can you please check and let me know  if this is related to the bug

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 13:10:22 GMT):<br/>
it only has 1 goroutine
</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 13:11:28 GMT):<br/>
ok, i can paste entire stack trace..i will do it bit later and let you know, tnx

</p>
<p><strong>IgorSim</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 07:51:30 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm , how i can apply the patch on the peer? If i understand right, peer binary is part of the 'fabric-ca' image (under /usr/local/bin/)..does it mean i need to build the peer (get sources, apply patch, build the peer) and then use this new patched version?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 08:02:30 GMT):<br/>
you need to build it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 08:02:41 GMT):<br/>
how is that part of the fabric-ca ???
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 08:03:08 GMT):<br/>
you need to clone the fabric repo, - specifically checkout branch `release-1.2`

@Ammu probably you would have restarted your network. You may have left some old containers running that might be causing conflicts. so first stop and remove the old docker containers then try again.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=nPn5rJoR2sJE3KX6B) @yacovm hi, i got some similar issue, but is the private data not synchronized, i haven't look into the weather the block height is up-to-date, but one of the peer work fine at first, but later it doesn't update the transaction any more, even restart the peer won't help.
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 06:16:14 GMT):<br/>
this issue does not happened all the time, but indeed i encounter for few times, i not sure if it's relate to the connection are base on the public network ip, once i change to test in localhost and use the domain inside docker network, seems won't trigger this issue.

What similar issue? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 07:02:16 GMT):<br/>
Similar to what?
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 10:03:14 GMT):<br/>
some peer won't synchronized the transaction at some point
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 10:03:53 GMT):<br/>
can you give some more information please?
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 10:03:56 GMT):<br/>
i'm not sure is the private data didn't synchronized or the block didn't synchronized
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 10:03:58 GMT):<br/>
were there any warning in the logs?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 10:04:06 GMT):<br/>
well you can check the height of the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 10:04:18 GMT):<br/>
what version are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 10:04:22 GMT):<br/>
1.2
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 10:05:19 GMT):<br/>
i will try next time, if the peer are connected by public network ip, this would happened
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 10:05:23 GMT):<br/>
ok then use the discovery CLI to see:
1) Does the peer know other peers
2) The ledger height of the peer

Hi...I am trying to configure cross organization gossip using anchor peers. I have successfully updated the channel configuration with the anchor peer updates on the channel. But the individual peers are not able to communicate with each other. Following are the peer logs:

<br/><a href="./assets/NLhwtjq7eijQnisH9-Clipboard - September 19, 2018 11:58 PM">Clipboard - September 19, 2018 11:58 PM</a>
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:35:04 GMT):<br/>
right... they can't connect.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:35:09 GMT):<br/>
you need to troubleshoot why
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:37:45 GMT):<br/>
how do I do that? I am able to normally invoke transactions over the network that means peers are discoverable.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:38:55 GMT):<br/>
how did you deduce that?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:39:07 GMT):<br/>
the fact that you can connect to peers, doesn't mean the peers can connect to one another...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:39:21 GMT):<br/>
you can try to log into the peer's container, or VM
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:39:35 GMT):<br/>
and try to connect from there, to the address it tries (but fails) to connect
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:48:22 GMT):<br/>
what protocol does gossip use for communicating? Do I need to enable any other protocol for inbound traffic other than tcp on 7051?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:49:40 GMT):<br/>
it uses gRPC over TLS 
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:50:24 GMT):<br/>
any specific configuration required for tls?
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:50:24 GMT):<br/>
any specific configuration required for tls at the peers?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:03:57 GMT):<br/>
no...
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:17:12 GMT):<br/>
tested by allowing all traffic, irrespective of protocols. Still no luck. I am able to ping one host from another. 
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:18:08 GMT):<br/>
any other suggestions?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:56:41 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:56:47 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 08:27:31 GMT):<br/>
Let me guess @MeenakshiSingh you didnt add the anchor peer to the channel?
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 08:33:34 GMT):<br/>
I did. All peers are added to the channel - peer channel join command.
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 08:37:37 GMT):<br/>
the network is tls enabled - is that the cause of ```Err :connection error: desc = "transport: authentication handshake failed: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of \"x509: ECDSA verification failure\" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate \"fabric-ca-server\")" ``` Do I need to provide some specific TLS settings?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 08:38:03 GMT):<br/>
Lol what is that certificate?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 08:38:26 GMT):<br/>
I think you messed up the certificates when you created the channel
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 08:39:32 GMT):<br/>
Umm..messed up? How?
</p>
<p><strong>MeenakshiSingh</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 08:42:33 GMT):<br/>
Should I regenerate the certificates and bootstrap the network again?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 09:23:00 GMT):<br/>
So i dont know what you should do
</p>

hi while trying private data collection in balance transfer i got the following error 'Requested to send to at least 1 peers, but know only of 0 suitable peers
'

  

what is the relationship between requiredPeerCount and maxPeerCount
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 21 Sep 2018 11:20:37 GMT):<br/>
read all about the private data policies here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/private-data-arch.html.  i asked you to post over here for troubleshooting gossip on balance transfer's network...
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 21 Sep 2018 11:21:24 GMT):<br/>
`requiredPeerCount` is states how many peer *at least* private data has to be distributed to
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 21 Sep 2018 11:22:02 GMT):<br/>
`maxPeerCount` is the maximum number of peers to sent data to, has to be greater than `requiredPeerCount`
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 21 Sep 2018 11:24:07 GMT):<br/>
looks like gossip is not configured at all for balance transfer network: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.2/balance-transfer/artifacts/docker-compose.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 21 Sep 2018 11:24:25 GMT):<br/>
i'd suggest use first-network sample network, which is pre-configured for gossip and known to support private data

@yacovm 4 peers for org1. does `balance-transfer` mistake to configure gossip like above?

<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Sun, 07 Oct 2018 12:24:48 GMT):<br/>
it is different from e2e example in fabric https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/77c3aa6ce5b0cfba93bfda009095886dbcadff91/examples/e2e_cli/base/docker-compose-base.yaml#L64.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 Oct 2018 12:26:10 GMT):<br/>
why is it different?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 Oct 2018 12:26:18 GMT):<br/>
use the configuration in the e2e 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 07 Oct 2018 12:26:22 GMT):<br/>
it's more up to date
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Sun, 07 Oct 2018 12:29:28 GMT):<br/>
so i think `balance-transfer` makes a mistake here.

Hi, I have similar issue as the hyperlearner above. Went through the docs. I'm using the fabric sdk java. I'm also attaching more info from the logs. Could somebody elaborate on the possible reasons?! Thanks in advance.

Hi everyone. I have a query, the ports which we assign to our peers in fabric network, why they start from 7050 ? and how much peers can we create? Since we have limited number of ports in our computers like maximum 65535 ??

Hi,
</p>
<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:26:28 GMT):<br/>
Hi,

I have a question, regarding the "requiredPeerCount" parameter on Private Data collection configuration and the corrsponding gossip SendByCriteria() implementation:
Which peers are evaluated to be disseminated to? Is there a preference to disseminate to the Anchor peers of other organisations or all peers (same & different organisations) are equally treated?

Best Regards,
Venko
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:37:32 GMT):<br/>
all peers in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:37:38 GMT):<br/>
no preference to anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:37:46 GMT):<br/>
all peers are equally treated
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:57:19 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I thought there was a best effort attempt to distribute private data to multiple organizations
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:01:17 GMT):<br/>
nope... that's not how it is
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:01:46 GMT):<br/>
so you might send to N peers within 1 org, and completely miss the other orgs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:01:55 GMT):<br/>
that's correct
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:02:08 GMT):<br/>
at least the intent was to distribute across orgs best effort, do we need to open a new jira?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:02:56 GMT):<br/>
do you know a lot of settings where you have a single org that is huge and other smaller satellite orgs with a few peers?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:03:33 GMT):<br/>
if you put the max peers big enough I think you're good to go
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:04:16 GMT):<br/>
also - when you have a minimum threshold and a maximum threshold
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:04:38 GMT):<br/>
what does it mean to do a best attempt to round-robin across the orgs?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:04:41 GMT):<br/>
i know a lot of networks have 2-3 peers per org... and it would be better not to double up, rather better to distribute widely.  and on the pull side, we could favor peers local to the org
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:05:39 GMT):<br/>
on the pull side we favor the endorsers
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:05:50 GMT):<br/>
best effort would mean distribute to all orgs first before doubling up
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:06:09 GMT):<br/>
yeah, pull side should favor endorsers first, then same org peers, then others
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:06:25 GMT):<br/>
why same org peers? speed?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:06:44 GMT):<br/>
speed, co-location, trust
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:06:57 GMT):<br/>
you don't need trust, you have the hash
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:07:08 GMT):<br/>
so what is the intent of distributing across orgs ? data availability? 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:07:13 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:07:28 GMT):<br/>
open a JIRA and we'll see what can be done ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:07:41 GMT):<br/>
if you distribute everything to OrgA and then OrgA goes away you're toast
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:07:55 GMT):<br/>
not with reconciliation 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:08:26 GMT):<br/>
we don't want to count on reconciliation, reconciliation is a worst case backstop
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:08:37 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:08:48 GMT):<br/>
so open a JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:08:51 GMT):<br/>
will do

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:24:24 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart can this be considered small enough to be backported to v1.4 ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:24:31 GMT):<br/>
or do we only backport bug fixes?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:29:08 GMT):<br/>
We would first get it into master (for v1.4). If it passes all tests well including system tests, and if the code appears low risk, we can consider backport to v1.3 at that time.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:29:40 GMT):<br/>
That being said, v1.4 is our target long term support release and we'd encourage people to move to v1.4
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:30:19 GMT):<br/>
Backporting functions is a slippery slope, need to be very judicious about it

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:41:50 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart what's the time window for v1.4 development? isn't that end of month?
</p>
<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 08:56:19 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm (comment on post @6:06 PM) 
I have a simple setup: 1 host, 1 docker network, 3 orgs x 1 peer.  
OrgA writes to private collections onlyA & onlyB. Setting is for both "requiredPeerCount=0". The data is Not written to the ponlyB database within an hour+ (the hash ends up in the honlyB database almost immediately).
After setting up "requiredPeerCount=1" the data was available for OrgB within seconds (as expected).
These are just observations for those 2 use cases. I definitely have to play more on the case, but it seems (for now to me, and it could be that I'm wrong) that being able to push targeted during the endorsement phase helps.

Thanks,
Venko

</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:03:46 GMT):<br/>
@ivanovv setting `requiredPeerCount=0` has semantic of not distributing private data at endorsement time
</p>
<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:08:02 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin Yes, I expected that... But it "never" occurred. At least not within 1+ hour.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:08:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:08:28 GMT):<br/>
not following you
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:09:18 GMT):<br/>
if it's expected it shall never occur even after 100+ hours 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:10:05 GMT):<br/>
oh, I see, you are saying that peer of ponlyB, commits block and doesn't pull the data?
</p>
<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:10:51 GMT):<br/>
and with requiredPeersCout=1 we will have feedback
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:12:32 GMT):<br/>
@ivanovv on what version are you testing it?
</p>
<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:12:36 GMT):<br/>
1.3
</p>
<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:14:50 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin Could you please confirm that with "requiredPeerCount=0"
"if it's expected it shall (dissemination) never occur even after 100+ hours"
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:15:10 GMT):<br/>
let me clarify 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:15:23 GMT):<br/>
there are two aspects of data dissemination 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:16:02 GMT):<br/>
while tx endorsed peer should try to push private data based on `requiredPeerCount` number of peers 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:17:10 GMT):<br/>
so if this is set to 0 peer will never tries to push anything
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:17:19 GMT):<br/>
however 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:18:09 GMT):<br/>
there is a second part, where peer while getting next block to commit extract info about missing private data pieces and tries to pull them 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:18:43 GMT):<br/>
what I meant to say is that with `requiredPeerCount=0` data will be never pushed, even after 100 hours :)
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:18:58 GMT):<br/>
but definitely peer should be able to pull it during commit time
</p>
<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:20:25 GMT):<br/>
And in my case the second phase did not happen within an hour+
</p>
<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:21:31 GMT):<br/>
And according one video there is a timeout of about an hour after which the second peer will dtop trying to retreave the data and this peer will not be able to deliver the private data anymore.

</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:26:33 GMT):<br/>
can you run your peers in debug mode?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:26:38 GMT):<br/>
and collect logs?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:26:54 GMT):<br/>
I'd be glad to take a look on this closer 
</p>
<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:32:13 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin Yes, I will do. Is there something in the logs that deserves to pay more attention at? I believe I can stop logging about a minute after the transaction gets committed (everything is local 3 orgs x 1 peer & 2 cpu's). requiredPeerCount will be 0. OK?
</p>
<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:58:04 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin 
Hi, I believe that even with requiredPeerCount=0 the peer will try to disseminate messages to (up to the maxPeerCount) other peers.
It will just not throw an exception.
My conclusion is based on the code in:
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/c45fde94b72a0f2fad7db37dff54d08ed4b280a8/gossip/gossip/gossip_impl.go
line: 645 & 654.

@ivanovv that's right. what was your maxPeerCount? Still need your debug for both A and B too understand why thee private data wasn't pulled at commit time.

<p><strong>ivanovv</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 13:30:51 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin Most probably this was the problem. 
Looking in the code for my previous post I saw that with maxPeerCount = 0 it will not try to disseminate at endorsement time at all... 
I've fixed this (based on info I've got from David on the fabric-ledger thread) last Friday and it worked... 
The reason I expected it to work was based on previous tests (AFAI remember) when OrgA was writing to collectionOrgA&OrgB and everything worked with both params set to 0. 
Thanks for the help!

Venko

Hello. I am running a hyperledger fabric network with 4 kafkas, for my dev env, they are running on a single VM. Yesterday my VM ran out of memory and 3 of the kafkas died. The last one threw an error that a leader election failed. If a leader kafka dies, one of the followers should become a leader immediately. So even with one kafka the network shouldn't die. I tried to reproduce the issue, I am killing kafka containers, but now everything is working fine. Do you have an idea what might cause the problem?

Hey guys! In our current setup we have 2 peers and 2 orderers. We have a specific transaction which is executed every 15 min. So every 15 min I see something like this in the Peer Logs: `2018-10-11 01:15:29.224 UTC [gossip/privdata] StoreBlock -> INFO 719c Received block [33327]`
`2018-10-11 01:15:29.758 UTC [kvledger] CommitWithPvtData -> INFO 719d Channel [bccchannel]: Committed block [33327] with 1 transaction(s)` . After sometime though the logs wont show up anymore and nothing is written to the ledger. After a restart of the peer, the logs show up again. My assumption is that the connection between Orderer and Peer gets lost/was closed. Does anyone have an idea why this could happen? Any help is very much appreciated!
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 10:46:18 GMT):<br/>

@deelthor how do you check this? do you see any errors on the log? are you subscribed to events? have you checked tx status to see it's valid?

@deelthor do you see anything else in the logs? it block is committed, hence you should be able to see the data. are you sure you client doesn't cache anything?

<p><strong>JayJong</strong> (Sat, 09 Feb 2019 21:30:47 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thanks for the pointer! I have another qn, im using fabric v1.3, after setting the network with 15 peers and installed chaincode, my peer logs kept increasing to the point where i do not have enough disk space because of gossip/gossip and gossip/comm DEBUG logs. Is this normal? Is it possible that i dun receive the debug logs and just listen to ERROR logs?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 09 Feb 2019 21:32:02 GMT):<br/>
yeah it's possible
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 09 Feb 2019 21:32:28 GMT):<br/>
set the environment variable `CORE_LOGGING_GOSSIP=WARNING`
</p>
<p><strong>JayJong</strong> (Sun, 10 Feb 2019 15:39:08 GMT):<br/>
I want to have gossip of WARNING level and the rest at DEBUG level. I defined CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG and CORE_LOGGING_GOSSIP=WARNING in my docker compose but it seems that gossip was still at debug level. Any way i could get what i want?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-gossip?msg=3Zyktty9yuwCjrRjJ) @JayJong The logging levels of the peer and orderer commands are controlled by a logging specification, which is set via the FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC environment variable.
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 05:35:57 GMT):<br/>
may be that is the reason its still in debug mode , if you try with FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC = WARNING , may be it works
</p>
<p><strong>JayJong</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 06:27:18 GMT):<br/>
@knagware9 thanks for the reply, im aware that FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC has replaced CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL in v1.4. My current workabout for my situation is that im writing CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug:gossip/gossip,gossip/comm,gossip/discovery,gossip/pull,gossip/election=warning

<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 12:46:48 GMT):<br/>
@JayJong I'm assuming you're using a version of Fabric pre-1.4? And yes, in the later versions before 1.4, the environment variable overrides (e.g. CORE_LOGGING_GOSSIP, CORE_LOGGING_MSP) aren't really functional. Some concurrency issues with the logging package we used required some changes that "broke" those overrides. Glad you found the spec functionality that's always been available via CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL. 
</p>
<p><strong>JayJong</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 17:01:37 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti yes, im using v1.3 currently but im upgrading to v1.4 soon. Do i still have to do `FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=debug:gossip/gossip,gossip/comm,gossip/discovery,gossip/pull,gossip/election=warning` for v1.4 or is there a cleaner way?
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 17:03:02 GMT):<br/>
for v1.4, you should be able to use `FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=debug:gossip=warning` to set any logger that begins with `gossip` to warning
</p>
<p><strong>JayJong</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 02:34:51 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti Ok, thanks for the help!

Hi, I have multiple organizations with one peer per org. when I instantiate chaincode, Init() is only called in the chaincode for the peer I instantiate on. it's never called on the other peers.
how is the data that's set in Init() supposed to get to the other peers? is it supposed to be propagated by gossip?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 22:14:37 GMT):<br/>
the init transactions gets into the next block, @jtrayfield 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 22:14:45 GMT):<br/>
and it gets either from orderer or via gossip

Hi All,

We are intending to run a fabric network with 26 organizations comprising of:
	- one orderer ("solo" based consensus)
	- two peers per organizations each having a couchdb database. Out of two, one peer is designated
	as the Anchor peer and are setting "CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION=true" for electing the
	leader dynamically.

On the whole, we are spinning 105 containers (52 peers + 52 couchdb + one orderer).
We based our network configuration on the "BYFN" example. In addition to this,
we are setting the values of "CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED" and "ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED"
to "true" - also set the value of "ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_CLIENTROOTCAS" to contain the list of client CA's.
We were able to successfully spin off a network with 14 organizations but when tried to extend it for 12 more
organizations, we are facing multiple issues - by extending, I meant we are trying to create the peers for
26 organizations at one go. We are running the network on a single machine.

We were able to create the channel and join the peers to the channel. But when doing an "Anchor" peer update,
the network stops when updating the "Anchor" peer for the 19th organization with the following error: "Context deadline exceeded."

We added a sleep of 100 seconds between each update and set the following environment variables.
	- CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ALIVETIMEINTERVAL=100s
    - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ALIVEEXPIRATIONTIMEOUT=100s
    - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_RECONNECTINTERVAL=100s
    - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_DIALTIMEOUT=1000s
    - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_RESPONSEWAITTIME=1000s
    - CORE_PEER_DISCOVERY_PERIOD=300s
    - CORE_PEER_DISCOVERY_TOUCHPERIOD=30s
    - CORE_LEDGER_STATE_COUCHDBCONFIG_REQUESTTIMEOUT=300s
    - CORE_PEER_KEEPALIVE=300s
    - CORE_PEER_KEEPALIVE_CLIENT_INTERVAL=300s

We aren't sure if they are required, but assuming that it would, we tried but failed.
This time, the anchor peer update was successful, despite the following errors/warnings:

2019-03-25 11:04:35.518 UTC [gossip/comm] sendToEndpoint -> WARN a8c Failed obtaining connection for peer0.organization17.com:7051, PKIid:[213 58 75 254 200 30 208 175 202 1 180 210 202 31 30 144 176 199 65 190 121 87 70 35 133 236 10 32 167 113 116 112] reason: context deadline exceeded

Hello @yacovm , when calling service discovery from a peer, I encountered an issue that the peer only returned a sub set of endorsers from time to time. How long should I wait before a peer can get a full list of endorsers list for a specific chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:19:09 GMT):<br/>
@xixuejia hmm you can see why it doesn't select all of them
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:19:15 GMT):<br/>
for example try to do a peer membership query
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:19:20 GMT):<br/>
and see if it has them in the view
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:27:53 GMT):<br/>
if I repeat doing service discovery, say I have 2 orgs with 2 peers per org, the peer will might return 1, 2, 3, 4 peers
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:28:03 GMT):<br/>
that seems unpredicatable
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:29:29 GMT):<br/>
when you do a peer query?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:29:32 GMT):<br/>
@xixuejia 
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:30:08 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:41:11 GMT):<br/>
and the peer query returns to you not all peers?
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:48:25 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:48:52 GMT):<br/>
I did encounter this in v1.3 and v1.4
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:49:34 GMT):<br/>
hmm this is most likely not a bug in discovery, but actually the peers themselves have an unstable membership view
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:49:52 GMT):<br/>
check the logs to see if the peers complain about some errors or somethign
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:50:08 GMT):<br/>
and check if the peers communicate with one another
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:50:53 GMT):<br/>
if it is a bug somewhere, i would guess it might be a bug in gossip that it sometimes doesn't return an external endpoint 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:51:19 GMT):<br/>
but i don't think it can be a bug in discovery... the code path for membership query is very simple 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:51:26 GMT):<br/>
so check for the logs first please :) 
</p>

aha
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:52:41 GMT):<br/>
ok so it's because of it
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:52:58 GMT):<br/>
I don't know why it expire dead members. all these peers run in a single machine
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:53:12 GMT):<br/>
how many peers do you have?
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:53:23 GMT):<br/>
2*2=4 peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:53:31 GMT):<br/>
how many channels?
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:53:35 GMT):<br/>
10
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:59:22 GMT):<br/>
oh i see
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:59:27 GMT):<br/>
so, you need more CPUs :( 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:59:40 GMT):<br/>
the message verification is too costly and i never had the time to optimize it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 14:00:07 GMT):<br/>
check `top` 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 14:00:12 GMT):<br/>
see if the CPU is on 100%
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 14:02:35 GMT):<br/>
:ok_hand: haha. let me check. Thanks for your help @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 14:04:07 GMT):<br/>
it's not 100%, average to ~50%
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 14:06:17 GMT):<br/>
hmmm odd. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 14:06:32 GMT):<br/>
so you don't need more CPUs then i think
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 14:06:49 GMT):<br/>
but seems like the peer only started
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 14:06:54 GMT):<br/>
it takes some time for things to stabilize
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 14:07:01 GMT):<br/>
if you want like 30 seconds
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 14:07:04 GMT):<br/>
how is that then?
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 14:16:49 GMT):<br/>
sure, I will retry it later. Thanks @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 05:26:35 GMT):<br/>
Hi @yacovm  with the suggestions you provided last week, I found that the cpu usage was ~100% when I do cc instantiate, and I did service discovery immediately after cc instantiate, I think that caused the issue I encountered. I gave it a 5s sleep after cc instantiate and I no longer encounter that problem. Thanks for your help!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 07:57:24 GMT):<br/>
@xixuejia cool

I have a quick question about private data propagation:

Starting in v 1.4 peers from organizations that are added to a private data collection definition automatically fetch private data committed to the collection before they joined.

My question is whether they receive historical write-set information (so that this information can be used to audit past transactions) - or whether they just receive contemporary data?

My question is related to this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51960671/history-for-private-data-in-hyperledger-fabric

Help clarifying these points appreciated.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 20:29:26 GMT):<br/>
@zacpl in v1.4... peers from newly added orgs will receive the historical private write-sets for collections that they join, and their private state database will be updated if the private data represents the latest keys/values. The piece that is not there is APIs to query this information: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5094
</p>
<p><strong>zacpl</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 11:06:55 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @dave.enyeart !

Somehow missed that on jira: only spotted FAB-5093...

will stay posted

Fabric network setup: 23 Organisations. They are hosted on 2 VMs on a docker swarm legacy setup. There will be 1 peer per org (23 peers total) and 1 ca per org (23 CAs total). There is a SOLO orderer setup, with only one channel that every org and peer will join. There are 2 chaincodes instantiated on the channel, and both will be installed on every peer. One of the chaincodes use private data collections. Our VMs are 16G CPU and 32GB Memory each.

Fabric network setup: 23 Organisations. They are hosted on 2 VMs on a docker swarm legacy setup. There will be 1 peer per org (23 peers total) and 1 ca per org (23 CAs total). There is a SOLO orderer setup, with only one channel that every org and peer will join. There are 2 chaincodes instantiated on the channel, and both will be installed on every peer. One of the chaincodes use private data collections. Our VMs are 16G CPU and 32GB Memory each.

Can you explain what cause these errors. In our deployment we have two peers in the same organization and the team configured both peers as anchor peers. I am thinking that is causing the error.

Hi Guys, my customer wants to not use gossip between peer in different organisations, so 2 questions: 1-  there is any other impacts besides Services Discovery and Private Date Collections?  2 - What is the best practices to disable it? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 16:30:25 GMT):<br/>
what's the rational behind disabling it? 
</p>
<p><strong>risc</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 16:57:05 GMT):<br/>
They want to reduce the network (firewalls, ips etc) complexity 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 16:57:52 GMT):<br/>
ok so just don't put any anchor peers or bootstrap peers
</p>
<p><strong>risc</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 17:07:09 GMT):<br/>
Anchors are just used for Gossip, correct? 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>risc</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 17:08:39 GMT):<br/>
and internally in the Org? can the peers use gossip to sync?

<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Tue, 04 Jun 2019 23:33:15 GMT):<br/>
what does the term mean or where is it described?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 05:43:28 GMT):<br/>
antiEntropy used to sync state, e.g. bring block what outside of gossip push/pull sliding window

> and now that I have a paper, I can make sure it's correct and put a link to the paper somewhere.

paper explains the context and why you cannot avoid it, while algorithmic wise it's not described. 
while making sure it's correct and before publishing a link could you please keep me posted? 

this is very general paper which kind of incepted all epidemic style protocols, while it has really little connection to what we have in Fabric.
hence I do not think publishing this link stating it's related to Fabric will be just wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 17:18:02 GMT):<br/>
okay, will keep posted, haven't started on either yet, was more of a curiosity issue at the time.

Dummy question.. Is there any validation of transactions when an offline peer comes back online and uses gossip to catch up? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 20:20:02 GMT):<br/>
@tennenjl - it's via the same mechanism... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 20:20:26 GMT):<br/>
gossip just pushes transactions into validation and then into the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>tennenjl</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 20:21:04 GMT):<br/>
Thanks so does that mean each peer will validate the transactions before they get recorded into the ledger.  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 20:21:16 GMT):<br/>
of course

Hi Team 

I inserted around 21 million records of data into blockchain creating around 2180 blocks across two peers .. so the main anchor peer - peer1 worked well having all the data
but the peer2 after aroud 13 million records it was throwing some error and and did not insert any more
i recorded the whole peer2 logs.

means lets say mine each block is around 20 MB so i can have the batchSize as 5 right of more than that then it would fail?

<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:15:30 GMT):<br/>
means lets say mine each block is around 20 MB so i can have the batchSize as 5 right ? if more than that then it would fail crossing the 100 limit of GRPC message?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:17:55 GMT):<br/>
then put 4 ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:17:58 GMT):<br/>
to be safe
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:19:40 GMT):<br/>
So how to know in that case as blocks may be of varying sizes .. it might happen let say given batchSize as 4 and the total size is less than 100 mb then it goes through , if at all it happens the next 4 blocks is of 120 MB then it would fail at that moment and would never proceed ? So how this would be handled ?
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:22:01 GMT):<br/>
that 100MB is depicted by this property - blockBufferSize: 100 ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:22:52 GMT):<br/>
no that block buffer size is unrelated
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:26:41 GMT):<br/>
Ok but how to handle the blocks of varying sizes when there will be bulk transactions happening 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:26:57 GMT):<br/>
you can limit the size of the block in the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:27:03 GMT):<br/>
and thus ensure the blocks are not too large
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:30:29 GMT):<br/>
where we do that in orderer are you telling we need to do in configtx.yaml ? 
BatchSize:
        MaxMessageCount: 10
        AbsoluteMaxBytes: 98 MB
        PreferredMaxBytes: 512 KB

or in any other parameter ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:31:04 GMT):<br/>
preferred max bytes
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:33:26 GMT):<br/>
so a question here is then by default if the value is 98 or 99 MB max then it should be the case that in peer - core.yaml the batchSize should be by default 1 right instead of 10 .  Based on the preferred max bytes we reduce we increase the batchSize in core.yaml ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:34:27 GMT):<br/>
i don't understand
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:37:27 GMT):<br/>
my question was the maximum size of the block can be upto 98 MB based on the absoluteMaxBytes. So based on that if a block goes upto 98 MB and the GRPC size allowed is upto 100 MB , then the default size of the pramater batchSize in core.yaml should be by default 1 right.

</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:38:17 GMT):<br/>
in my case i am putting 10000 rows of data in one block 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:38:18 GMT):<br/>
yeah it can.... but you want to make it *smaller* no?
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:38:28 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:38:31 GMT):<br/>
why do you put so much data in the block?
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:39:53 GMT):<br/>
actually i have around 35 millions of rows of data which has to be back filled from a sql server to the blockchain and then the transactions would happen on the data  -- so in a loop we were trying to run and insert 10000 rows of data to one block...
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:40:05 GMT):<br/>
is this the ideal way of doing or any other way you can suggest 
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:41:07 GMT):<br/>
each row of data is having two fields that is inserted
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:43:57 GMT):<br/>
so each block was coming around 20-25 MB i had fetched one block and checked
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:45:01 GMT):<br/>
do it in several transactions
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 13:19:01 GMT):<br/>
ok if i put the value in peer.state.enabled as false in core.yaml .. so what would be the default batchSize it would take?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 13:20:47 GMT):<br/>
if you disable the state transfer then there is no point to point bkicj replication
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 13:20:49 GMT):<br/>
*block
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 13:22:19 GMT):<br/>
ok so it means that it will never sync up with any other bootstrap peer for the data .. so it should be mandatory enabled right?  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 13:22:41 GMT):<br/>
it can sync from orderer
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 13:24:23 GMT):<br/>
when it does from orderer what would be the batch size or no of blocks fetched at each call ? WIll there be any performance difference fetching from the orderer or from other bootstrapped peers . Wanted to know the best practice here
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 14:17:00 GMT):<br/>
any thoughts on this @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 14:17:15 GMT):<br/>
no, i'm too busy with other stuff atm
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 15:29:33 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  i tried updating from orderer directly .. so what ia observed was the whole azure VM memory is getting used up and the system is becoming very slow even to  SSH into it. So is there any reason of the whole memory getting used up or any way to handle that?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 15:29:51 GMT):<br/>
yeah of course
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 15:30:02 GMT):<br/>
how much memory do you have?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 15:30:03 GMT):<br/>
in the VMs?
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 15:30:07 GMT):<br/>
8 Gb RAM
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 15:31:34 GMT):<br/>
Is this an ideal memory to have ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 16:22:02 GMT):<br/>
dunno seems enough
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 09:45:29 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm is there any plan to have a API or CLI command to check whether a given peer is an anchor peer or not? Any JIRA raised for it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 09:46:34 GMT):<br/>
just look at the latest config block
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 09:46:37 GMT):<br/>
it should be there
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 09:48:32 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 06:08:41 GMT):<br/>
when tried joining a peer to the channel its giving the below error 

peer1       | 2019-10-01 06:06:29.053 UTC [gossip.service] updateAnchors -> ERRO 321 Tried joining channel legaldescriptionchannel but our org( OrgA ), isn't among the orgs of the channel: [Org1] , aborting.

What does it mean
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:05:52 GMT):<br/>
@soumyanayak - it seems that the org OrgA was added to the channel legaldescriptionchannel later and was not there from the start, right?
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:06:39 GMT):<br/>
yes @yacovm  orgA was added later as part of config update 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:06:44 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:06:47 GMT):<br/>
this is natural 
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:06:53 GMT):<br/>
i added one more orgB same issue for that also 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:06:53 GMT):<br/>
ignore the error ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:07:02 GMT):<br/>
yeah, ignore the error then
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:07:05 GMT):<br/>
it's fine
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:07:10 GMT):<br/>
but i am getting it continuously 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:07:25 GMT):<br/>
it will stop when the peer will get the blocks from the orderr
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:07:27 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:12:54 GMT):<br/>
and when i am  trying to do individual org anchor update for the newly added orgs i am getting the below error

oh... if you get a forbidden error - it's bad
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:15:29 GMT):<br/>
it means that your organization is not really in the channel 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:15:29 GMT):<br/>
it means that your organization is not really in the channel  or doesn't have permission to pull the blocks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:15:33 GMT):<br/>
you did something wrong :/ 
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:17:36 GMT):<br/>
how we can check or debug where it was wrong like getting the latest config block and checking from the config JSON or how  to do this?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 08:20:20 GMT):<br/>
oh check the tutorial of channel update

<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 09:25:22 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm i was able to make the two org peers join the channel -- so there was admin certificate issue
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 09:25:27 GMT):<br/>
now the issues are not coming

<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 12:03:46 GMT):<br/>
Got the solution by config update need to update the anchors

Document say, "Note that in order for peers to be known to the discovery service, they must have an EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT defined. "
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discovery-overview.html#how-service-discovery-works-in-fabric

How can I define EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT in peer and orderer? Is it different from CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 09:49:48 GMT):<br/>
it's only for the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 09:49:57 GMT):<br/>
and this is exactly what you wrote
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 09:50:02 GMT):<br/>
`CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT`
</p>
<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 01:41:58 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  Then, How is it possible that orderer's addresses could be found by discovery service? And I could not find any reference(not any but nothing meaningful) of CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT from the source code of fabric. Where can I find the code handling the CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 09:08:09 GMT):<br/>
Look for "externalEndpoint"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 09:08:34 GMT):<br/>
The discovery returns the addresses from the channel config block

</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:24:54 GMT):<br/>
hello, having an issue after all my peers are joined to the channel and i add the anchor peers im getting these warnings in my gossip logs in the first anchor peer: ```
2020-03-10 20:24:03.947 UTC [gossip.comm] createConnection -> WARN ac5 Remote endpoint claims to be a different peer, expected 051881a63876d5f0fba6b9a7e533a7ccb5fb203536b6fcee1ad72343fcb408e8 but got 0c5e3f1de15afe0619397274fb51d35e0bfe90b48cc3c641daaf197ae587bf7c
2020-03-10 20:24:03.947 UTC [gossip.comm] sendToEndpoint -> WARN ac6 Failed obtaining connection for 3.1X.72.X:7011, PKIid:051881a63876d5f0fba6b9a7e533a7ccb5fb203536b6fcee1ad72343fcb408e8 reason: authentication failure

``` 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:25:33 GMT):<br/>
so the socket in the second warning is the socket of the peer for which logs im following
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:25:42 GMT):<br/>
so im not sure how it makes sense that its failiing to connect to itself, but there it is
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:27:34 GMT):<br/>
so from the anchor peer in org2 i get these warnings: ```
2020-03-10 20:26:50.976 UTC [gossip.comm] createConnection -> WARN 803 Remote endpoint claims to be a different peer, expected 0c5e3f1de15afe0619397274fb51d35e0bfe90b48cc3c641daaf197ae587bf7c but got 051881a63876d5f0fba6b9a7e533a7ccb5fb203536b6fcee1ad72343fcb408e8

``` 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:27:51 GMT):<br/>
so 7021 is the listening port of the anchor in org2 as well
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:28:01 GMT):<br/>
so its like they're trying to connect to themselves and failing?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:29:38 GMT):<br/>
i have the anchor peer in org two setup with the following config parameters: ```
- CORE_PEER_LISTENADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7021
- CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT=3.X.72.X:7011
``` 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:30:04 GMT):<br/>
so the second config entry should be the socket for the anchor peer of org1
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:30:07 GMT):<br/>
if im not mistaken
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:30:46 GMT):<br/>
why would it be trying to connect to itself though?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:31:21 GMT):<br/>
also what are those big long strings where it says "expected"
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:31:31 GMT):<br/>
are those hashes of the ip address or something?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:00:38 GMT):<br/>
@Antimttr has the anchor peer joined the channel?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:00:51 GMT):<br/>
yes ive got anchor peers from both orgs in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:00:59 GMT):<br/>
but ive been reading about those externalendpoints 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:01:02 GMT):<br/>
i might not even need them
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:01:06 GMT):<br/>
ahh:
> 2020-03-10 20:24:03.947 UTC [gossip.comm] createConnection -> WARN ac5 Remote endpoint claims to be a different peer, expected 051881a63876d5f0fba6b9a7e533a7ccb5fb203536b6fcee1ad72343fcb408e8 but got 0c5e3f1de15afe0619397274fb51d35e0bfe90b48cc3c641daaf197ae587bf7c
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:01:09 GMT):<br/>
that's the problem
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:01:28 GMT):<br/>
so i have the anchors configured with externalendpoint andi shouldn't correct?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:01:28 GMT):<br/>
so, i can tell you when it happens process wise
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:01:38 GMT):<br/>
maybe it will give you a clue
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:01:51 GMT):<br/>
basically anchor peer connection is a 2 staged process
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:02:17 GMT):<br/>
consider yourself a peer that you get a new config block of a channel, or the genesis block of that channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:02:23 GMT):<br/>
and you see you have anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:02:26 GMT):<br/>
so you do 2 things:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:02:44 GMT):<br/>
1) Probe the anchor peer to find out its certificate and organization association
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:03:08 GMT):<br/>
2) Connect to the anchor peer again, and initiate the standard gossip membership exchange protocols and stuff

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:03:24 GMT):<br/>
trick question: why would you want the first stage?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:03:45 GMT):<br/>
hmm
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:04:08 GMT):<br/>
seems like exactly what you'd get with step 2
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:04:35 GMT):<br/>
in step 2 you also acquire the certificate as well
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:04:59 GMT):<br/>
so the answer is - if somehow, someone took over the network routing
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:05:02 GMT):<br/>
are both steps done over gossip or is one done via grpc?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:05:11 GMT):<br/>
no, it's 2 different TLS connections 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:05:34 GMT):<br/>
the reason is - if someone took over the routing and redirects all the communication into itself
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:05:42 GMT):<br/>
or some stupid admin
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:05:49 GMT):<br/>
configued the wrong IP for anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:05:56 GMT):<br/>
that doesn't correspond do its own organizatio
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:06:18 GMT):<br/>
you don't want peers to connect to the wrong IP (could be a peer from a malicious organization or just some hacker's server)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:06:26 GMT):<br/>
so you first "sniff" the remote peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:06:29 GMT):<br/>
but don't tell it anything
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:06:32 GMT):<br/>
i see
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:06:38 GMT):<br/>
later, at the second stage
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:06:45 GMT):<br/>
after you acquire the certificate from the first stage
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:07:04 GMT):<br/>
you expect the 2nd connection to still have the same certificate from the first stage
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:07:15 GMT):<br/>
if you detect the certificate changed
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:07:19 GMT):<br/>
then something is wrong here
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:07:31 GMT):<br/>
so how would my certificate have changed from first two second stage..
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:07:33 GMT):<br/>
now obviously it's just a "software engineering" problem
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:07:44 GMT):<br/>
because you could have done stage 1+2 together
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:07:47 GMT):<br/>
but unfortunately 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:07:56 GMT):<br/>
gossip communication layer is decoupled from the membership layer :( 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:08:10 GMT):<br/>
so the communication code doesn't know what an organization, or an anchor peer even means
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:08:42 GMT):<br/>
>  so how would my certificate have changed from first two second stage.. 
Probably you restarted the peer or something
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:08:54 GMT):<br/>
and you re-created the certificate
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:08:57 GMT):<br/>
these are both fresh peers
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:09:22 GMT):<br/>
i basically docker-compose rm -f all the peers and the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:09:24 GMT):<br/>
i think the endpoint in the past belonged to some different organization
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:09:39 GMT):<br/>
then started them up and then joined them to the channel
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:09:47 GMT):<br/>
and as soon as i designated the two anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:09:51 GMT):<br/>
i started getting these warnings
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:10:04 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/gossip/comm/comm_impl.go#L176-L180
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:10:09 GMT):<br/>
this is the code that prints it
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:11:26 GMT):<br/>
my anchor peers are specified in the genesis block 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:11:53 GMT):<br/>
with the same socket that im getting the error messages on
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:12:07 GMT):<br/>
what's confusing to me is that my anchor peer for org1: peer1.org1.example.com
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:12:37 GMT):<br/>
that anchor peers logs are `2020-03-10 21:12:20.637 UTC [gossip.comm] sendToEndpoint -> WARN 2204 Failed obtaining connection for 3.x.72.x:7011, PKIid:051881a63876d5f0fba6b9a7e533a7ccb5fb203536b6fcee1ad72343fcb408e8 reason: authentication failure
`
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:12:37 GMT):<br/>
that anchor peers logs are `2020-03-10 21:12:20.637 UTC [gossip.comm] sendToEndpoint -> WARN 2204 Failed obtaining connection for 3.x.72.x:7011, PKIid:051881a63876d5f0fba6b9a7e533a7ccb5fb203536b6fcee1ad72343fcb408e8 reason: authentication failure`
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:12:55 GMT):<br/>
that IS the socket for peer1.org1.example.com
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:13:08 GMT):<br/>
so why would the anchor peer try to connect to itself
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:13:33 GMT):<br/>
maybe i should decode the current config block on the channel
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:13:42 GMT):<br/>
and check to make sure that the anchor peers are what i think they are
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:13:53 GMT):<br/>
anchor peers should not be specified in genesis blocks
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:13:57 GMT):<br/>
oh really?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:14:01 GMT):<br/>
yeah....
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:14:10 GMT):<br/>
you need to do a subsequent config block for that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:14:15 GMT):<br/>
look at the samples 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:14:24 GMT):<br/>
i am basing this all off of balance-trasnfer
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:14:46 GMT):<br/>
im pretty srue thats in the configtx.yaml of the balance trasnfer example
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:14:48 GMT):<br/>
let me  double check
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:14:49 GMT):<br/>
look at first_network
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:15:34 GMT):<br/>
ok let me look at first_network 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:16:13 GMT):<br/>
oh this one has policies in it already
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:16:16 GMT):<br/>
i was looking for that
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:16:33 GMT):<br/>
```
 # leave this flag set to true.
        AnchorPeers:
            # AnchorPeers defines the location of peers which can be used
            # for cross org gossip communication.  Note, this value is only
            # encoded in the genesis block in the Application section context
            - Host: peer0.org1.example.com
              Port: 7051

``` 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:16:41 GMT):<br/>
so thats from configtx.yaml in first-network
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:16:48 GMT):<br/>
but you're saying i shouldnt have it in there?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:17:07 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/first-network/scripts/utils.sh#L71-L90
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:17:11 GMT):<br/>
look at this ^ 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:17:17 GMT):<br/>
this is how you do it
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:17:56 GMT):<br/>
ive been doing it after i join the channel with the JAVA SDK
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:18:09 GMT):<br/>
but i guess its kind of repetitive if i already have it in the genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:18:17 GMT):<br/>
but if i shouldnt have it in the genesis block at all
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:18:23 GMT):<br/>
then ill just remove it and do it after i join the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:19:05 GMT):<br/>
there is a reason behind it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:19:22 GMT):<br/>
you need to do it the "hard" way as i said
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:20:11 GMT):<br/>
or i guess its not the genesis block but the channel.tx ?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:20:54 GMT):<br/>
ok ill take the anchor peer out of my configtx.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:21:14 GMT):<br/>
and then add it after i join the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:21:56 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:22:18 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks, ill give that a shot and report back here 
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:23:17 GMT):<br/>
doing the anchor add with the javasdk should be equivilent to doing it with peer command, right?
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:25:15 GMT):<br/>
well ill try it with sdk if it doesnt work ill try it with cli
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:27:55 GMT):<br/>
yes

Hello everyone, I have setup network of two orgs while each orgs have four anchor peers. I have started network with org1 and later add the org2 in the channel through updating channel block config.

When I installed chaincode on both organization peers then org2 giving me gossip privdata error.
I'm also getting endorsement error from each peer while invoking any function on chaincode.

Hello, I'm trying to fetch peers from discover CLI but result giving me only target peer information. Is this the default behavior or should I expect all four peers information?
Note: I have set the "CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT" on all four anchor peers but still no way of knowing that gossip is running properly since, peers logs contain no warning and error.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 11:59:33 GMT):<br/>
@FarhanShafiq Both this and the prior message indicate a gossip configuration problem. Please try with the test network that is known to have working gossip connection: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html  And then you can compare your configuration with the working test network configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 12:04:46 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @dave.enyeart for the reply, It was indeed problem of gossip configuration problem. First, I didn't provide the gossip bootstrap peers that's why peer was not able to discover other peers. Second, for adding anchor peers, I had to update the channel with anchor transaction.

Thanks @dave.enyeart for the reply, It was indeed problem of gossip configuration. First, I didn't provide the gossip bootstrap peers that's why peer was not able to discover other peers within the organizations. Second, for adding anchor peers, I had to update the channel with anchor transaction.
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 12:40:58 GMT):<br/>
I bootstrapped my network with org1 and create and join mychannel after then, I updated config block trx to add the org2 and create and join mychannel from org2.
At this point, both organizations are able to discover peers within organization using `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP` but org1 peers are not able to discover org2 peers. For that, I updated the channel with org1 anchor trx for org2 peers to discover org1 peers but to my surprise, org1 peers are also able to discover org2 peers.
I know how org2 peers able to discover org1 peers using org1 anchor trx but how org1 peers are discovering org2 peers?
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 12:43:13 GMT):<br/>
Let say, I add another org3 then org1 and org3 peers will be able discover each other? and what about org2 peers? Will org2 peers able to discover org3 peers?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 14:00:34 GMT):<br/>
you need the peers to sync all blocks until the height where they were added
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 14:00:47 GMT):<br/>
only then they can discover, because until then, gossip thinks they are not in the channel
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 14:18:59 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. Existing org also will be able to discover new org peers without adding the anchor trx?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 15:18:32 GMT):<br/>
you just need a single anchor peer in a channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 15:18:42 GMT):<br/>
but it's better if every org has its own anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 15:55:50 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I have configured separate configtx.yaml for every org.

Does anyone summarize which ports should be opened by firewall to enable gossip over different hosts?

I built a fabric network on 2 VMs hosted in an old thinkpad x230. To simulate concurrent proformance, five clients submit transactions simutaeously. About after 900 seconds, it failed to disseminate private data.
```2021-02-17T17:43:02.789Z - error: [Transaction]: Error: No valid responses from any peers. Errors:
    peer=peer1.example.com, status=500, message=error in simulation: failed to distribute private collection, txID 6cddc86a2eb75033381e2d12f2a1acc52cfc8f244622ab7af0ac4b7d44a99d47, channel mychannel: Failed disseminating 2 out of 8 private dissemination plans```
Is this issue caused by poor resources?
