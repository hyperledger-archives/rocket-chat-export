{"msg":"I am. \nSo, https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2007 deals with adding support for gossip to expose endpoints to peers according to whether they are in the same org as the source peer or not","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T12:58:24.429Z"}
{"msg":"I'm addressing this in the following way- in the `AliveMessage` I'm adding another field that's a remote endpoint.","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T12:58:59.727Z"}
{"msg":"I'm addressing this in the following way- in the `AliveMessage` I'm adding another field that's an internal endpoint.","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T12:58:59.727Z"}
{"msg":"to simplify things:","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T12:59:21.013Z"}
{"msg":"When an `AliveMessage` is propagated from peer to peer, once the `AliveMessage` has crossed to a peer that's in a different org, the inner endpoint is deleted. ","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:00:25.499Z"}
{"msg":"now... a peer may start without a remote endpoint, just an inner endpoint","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:00:54.285Z"}
{"msg":"ok - that makes sense - so then all we need in the peer config is some property called something like \"advertiseAddress\" ","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:02:46.799Z"}
{"msg":"yeah. The idea I thought of is the following:","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:03:03.470Z"}
{"msg":"since you can use \"listenAddress\" for the internal / default address","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:03:17.017Z"}
{"msg":"Now when you have 2 endpoints in the AliveMessage, you also have 2 signatures:","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:03:19.497Z"}
{"msg":"1 on the whole message, with the external endpoint which can be nil","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:03:28.113Z"}
{"msg":"and 1 on the inner endpoint","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:03:32.391Z"}
{"msg":"so if the messages \"crosses\" an organization boundry- the last peer that forwards it- deletes the inner endpoint, and doesn't need to re-sign the actual message which it can't since he may not be the source peer","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:04:12.976Z"}
{"msg":"but we have a problem","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:04:16.379Z"}
{"msg":"Let's say a peer `p` has been initialized without a remote endpoint and joins a channel","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:04:32.494Z"}
{"msg":"it contacts an anchor peer, tells it about itself","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:04:38.816Z"}
{"msg":"and now the anchor peer, which may be in a different org- publishes that peer's alive message with the inner endpoint in the \"best\" case and with *no endpoint* in the worst case","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:05:17.842Z"}
{"msg":"so what I want to do is something as the following which I think it's also a cool concept","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:05:33.619Z"}
{"msg":"peers that don't have external endpoints, are \"invisible\" to outside orgs","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:05:44.891Z"}
{"msg":"and may not join channels that are cross-orgs","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:05:54.812Z"}
{"msg":"I mean- the gossip part won't support cross-org channel messages for them","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:06:18.442Z"}
{"msg":"would they still be able to connect and pull across orgs for say something like block/state transfer?","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:06:57.977Z"}
{"msg":"no","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:07:09.012Z"}
{"msg":"if they have no external endpoint, i don't think they should","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:07:26.923Z"}
{"msg":"if you want the peer to be able to do that, start it up correctly","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:07:34.728Z"}
{"msg":"you may even of course, have the same endpoint in both fields","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:07:43.340Z"}
{"msg":"you may even of course, have the same endpoint in both configs(internal and external)","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:07:43.340Z"}
{"msg":"so basically, if a peer wants to participate in cross-org gossip (of course scoped to a channel), it must have an \"advertiseAddress\" in its config?","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:11:01.112Z"}
{"msg":"of course, you could trick the system and populate this with a non-routable address as well and still be able to \"connect\" to someone else","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:11:46.123Z"}
{"msg":"and then no one will be able to connect to that peer","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:12:32.367Z"}
{"msg":"so why do that?","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:12:44.467Z"}
{"msg":"he could always get blocks from peers in its org that did publish an external address","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:13:02.653Z"}
{"msg":"but that peer could still make an outbound connection to another peer and given that the GRPC connection is duplex, the peer it connected to could still send it messages and vice versa","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:13:30.069Z"}
{"msg":"yes I understand that","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:13:46.200Z"}
{"msg":"agree - no reason to do it - but you could do it  :)","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:13:50.988Z"}
{"msg":"but- I don't see the use case","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:13:51.114Z"}
{"msg":"oh yeah","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:13:56.792Z"}
{"msg":"but I also want users to be able not to config the peer/gossip in a way that causes problems that are hard to \"debug\"","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:14:19.297Z"}
{"msg":"Now, having said that- there is an alternative for this, however- and it is to create 2 membership overlays: 1 for inter-organization membership, and 1 for intra-organization membership.\nThe implementation is much simpler, but it of course induces \"double\" the messages in a certain sense. ","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:14:30.840Z"}
{"msg":"but I'm fine with saying that you need to specifically populate an address that will be used for gossip and if you don't have it, no cross-org gossip","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:14:31.074Z"}
{"msg":"simplifies things a bit plus makes it clear what needs to happen to participate","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:15:01.470Z"}
{"msg":"I think I want to go with the 1st way at first, and if I'll see that it doesn't work well I might switch to the 2nd","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:15:01.786Z"}
{"msg":"ok","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:15:10.247Z"}
{"msg":"so you're ok with that \"invisible peer\" idea?","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:15:19.067Z"}
{"msg":"I think so - as I said, the only drawback is that an \"invisible\" peer cannot \"pull\", but I think it's ok to say \"hey - if you are not willing to expose yourself, you can't play in cross-org gossip\"","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:16:48.665Z"}
{"msg":"it can pull from its own org","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:16:58.604Z"}
{"msg":"right","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:17:05.274Z"}
{"msg":"and it will most likely have an anchor peer to pull from, anyway","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:17:16.690Z"}
{"msg":"good point","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:17:24.513Z"}
{"msg":"ok I just wanted to make sure we agree on the idea.\n@C0rWin if you have some comments you're welcome","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:18:51.568Z"}
{"msg":"so I suggest we explicitly add an item to the peer yaml config  - maybe we call it \"advertiseAddress\" and put it under the \"gossip\" section?  ","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-02-07T13:19:03.455Z"}

{"msg":"So, now the gossip in the peer would advertise to peers in its own org both addresses, and to peers outside- only the external, and if the external address isn't specified, that peer won't be published to peers outside of the org.","username":"yacovm","ts":"2017-02-07T13:27:12.868Z"}

So that gossip and everything can get initialized for the chain before the genesis block is committed.  This way, if there is a problem committing the genesis block (e.g. cant connect to state database), then the genesis block could be gossipped later like any other block, after the problem gets resolved.

One of the patterns in the tests it to setup two comm instances, start go routines to handle messages, and then send messages across the comm instances. Between the two calls to send, there's a sleep.\n\nWhen the sleep is removed, the tests fail. It looks like this happens because of a race between client connections and server connections. Basically, client connections from a->b created by `Send` are closed (and the associated output buffer with the pending message is drained) when the connection from b->a is established and the `onConnected` callback is driven.\n\nThe sleep is clearly avoiding this issue but is losing the message the correct behavior?

{"msg":"Hi All,\n\nWe are intending to run a fabric network with 26 organizations comprising of:\n\t- one orderer (\"solo\" based consensus)\n\t- two peers per organizations each having a couchdb database. Out of two, one peer is designated\n\tas the Anchor peer and are setting \"CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION=true\" for electing the\n\tleader dynamically.\n\nOn the whole, we are spinning 105 containers (52 peers + 52 couchdb + one orderer).\nWe based our network configuration on the \"BYFN\" example. In addition to this,\nwe are setting the values of \"CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED\" and \"ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED\"\nto \"true\" - also set the value of \"ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_CLIENTROOTCAS\" to contain the list of client CA's.\nWe were able to successfully spin off a network with 14 organizations but when tried to extend it for 12 more\norganizations, we are facing multiple issues - by extending, I meant we are trying to create the peers for\n26 organizations at one go. We are running the network on a single machine.\n\nWe were able to create the channel and join the peers to the channel. But when doing an \"Anchor\" peer update,\nthe network stops when updating the \"Anchor\" peer for the 19th organization with the following error: \"Context deadline exceeded.\"\n\nWe added a sleep of 100 seconds between each update and set the following environment variables.\n\t- CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ALIVETIMEINTERVAL=100s\n    - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ALIVEEXPIRATIONTIMEOUT=100s\n    - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_RECONNECTINTERVAL=100s\n    - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_DIALTIMEOUT=1000s\n    - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_RESPONSEWAITTIME=1000s\n    - CORE_PEER_DISCOVERY_PERIOD=300s\n    - CORE_PEER_DISCOVERY_TOUCHPERIOD=30s\n    - CORE_LEDGER_STATE_COUCHDBCONFIG_REQUESTTIMEOUT=300s\n    - CORE_PEER_KEEPALIVE=300s\n    - CORE_PEER_KEEPALIVE_CLIENT_INTERVAL=300s\n\nWe aren't sure if they are required, but assuming that it would, we tried but failed.\nThis time, the anchor peer update was successful, despite the following errors/warnings:\n\n2019-03-25 11:04:35.518 UTC [gossip/comm] sendToEndpoint -> WARN a8c Failed obtaining connection for peer0.organization17.com:7051, PKIid:[213 58 75 254 200 30 208 175 202 1 180 210 202 31 30 144 176 199 65 190 121 87 70 35 133 236 10 32 167 113 116 112] reason: context deadline exceeded\n\n2019-03-25 11:07:36.109 UTC [gossip/discovery] func1 -> WARN b4c Could not connect to {peer0.organization6.com:7051 [] [] peer0.organization6.com:7051 <nil> <nil>} : context deadline exceeded\n2019-03-25 11:07:36.203 UTC [gossip/gossip] func1 -> WARN b4d Deep probe of peer0.organization18.com:7051 failed: context deadline exceeded\ngithub.com/hyperledger/fabric/gossip/gossip.(*gossipServiceImpl).learnAnchorPeers.func1\n        /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/gossip/gossip/gossip_impl.go:247\ngithub.com/hyperledger/fabric/gossip/discovery.(*gossipDiscoveryImpl).Connect.func1\n        /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/gossip/discovery/discovery_impl.go:159\nruntime.goexit\n        /opt/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:2361\n\t\t\nWe also see that the docker containers for some of the peers are exited with error code \"2\" - however, the OOMKiller flag is set to false.\nWe aren't sure where we are going wrong as we don't see an issue with the system resources nor the docker engine.\nRequest your help in fixing the issue. #fabric-gossip #fabric ","username":"krishnatejap","ts":"2019-03-25T12:27:06.074Z"}
