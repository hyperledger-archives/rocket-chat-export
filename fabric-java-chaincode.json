{"msg":"Hey @kisna , not exactly sure why that would be happening. I've run both of these without any errors using the 1.3 Snapshots. The order in which I did everything was:\n\n1. Start docker network. Make sure that you are using all the right versions for the containers, it can fail with weird reasons if you're for some reason using an old container. I can't remember if it jsut uses the `latest` tag or not, but be sure to check this. \n\n2. Run the End2EndIT as it is, with java chaincode. \n\n3. Without touching the docker containers at all, just run the End2EndITJava example. \n\nIn my experience it worked just fine. If you look in this folder: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/tree/master/src/test/fixture/sdkintegration  you will see all of the docker stuff that you need.
