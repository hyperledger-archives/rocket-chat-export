We had a proposal more depend on k8s under internal review, however we might not understand everything, we would like more feedback. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x4W_hltmIybOkG4JGMX_cpEFcWqoi7aJHIFNHhzed8E

@grapebaba hi, r u around?
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 13:26:39 GMT):<br/>
Yeah 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 13:31:42 GMT):<br/>
looked at the doc at the link, saw few yaml file assume they are k8s deployment files. not exactly why TPRs, can you provide a bit more info on that?
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 13:32:31 GMT):<br/>
The kind is customized 
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 13:32:52 GMT):<br/>
So actually there are third party resources 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 13:33:32 GMT):<br/>
@grapebaba I understand it is third party resources, do not understand the reason why you need to do that though.
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 13:34:47 GMT):<br/>
I want to customize the spec yaml
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 13:38:10 GMT):<br/>
no other way to do the same thing without creating TPR?

<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 13:41:20 GMT):<br/>
I don't know the other way. 
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 13:47:36 GMT):<br/>
BTW, currently i manage the pods self and don't use builtin one such as replicaset, statefulset
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 13:49:23 GMT):<br/>
That means we can have more control by ourselves, but obviously it should be more difficult than using built in replicaset, statefulset
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 14:15:50 GMT):<br/>
@grapebaba thanks for your info.

We actually have plans to run fabric on multiple nodes. All the effort can combine I think.

<p><strong>zhipengh</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 01:16:22 GMT):<br/>
tongli are you using the operator ?
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 01:30:23 GMT):<br/>
@zhipengh i think not:sweat_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 01:31:38 GMT):<br/>
they should have an official internal plan

the overlay networking is the key to support fabric on multiple nodes, i guess those working for openstack would have good experience.

Hi Guys
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:00:03 GMT):<br/>
last mile from running the Fabric v1 beta on my minikube
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:00:06 GMT):<br/>
got blocked...
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:01:33 GMT):<br/>
So my peer deployment.yaml (will change to StatefulSets if everything working)
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:01:46 GMT):<br/>
```
          # CORE_PEER_ADDRESS will be used as the "callback" address in the cmd of cc chain code
          # chaincode -peer.address=$CORE_PEER_ADDRESS"
        - name: CORE_PEER_ADDRESS
          # FIXME peer0.org1 cannot be looked up in the cc container as it is not deployed with K8S (hence, no DNS entry in K8S DNS)
          # Cannot use IP (does not matter hard-code IP / downward API to get the POD IP) as the x509 validation will fail
          value: peer0.org1:7051
        - name: CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE
          # Need to use bridge to make sure it is on same network with the PODs
          value: bridge
```
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:02:41 GMT):<br/>
I can deploy orderer, 2orgs peers, create channel, join channel and update anchor peers with the e2e
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:03:19 GMT):<br/>
and I can create the chaincode docker image as well and able to start it
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:04:37 GMT):<br/>
but the cc container will die in a few seconds with errors...
```
 $ docker logs edf4
2017-06-12 11:02:20.907 UTC [shim] userChaincodeStreamGetter -> ERRO 001 Error trying to connect to local peer: context deadline exceeded
Error starting Simple chaincode: Error trying to connect to local peer: context deadline exceeded
```
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:05:46 GMT):<br/>
the problem is even they are in the same network

the "startup command" of chaincode container is `chaincode -peer.address=peer0-org1:7051`
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:05:58 GMT):<br/>
but the chaincode container isn't deployed by K8S
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:06:16 GMT):<br/>
that's why the peer0-org1 does not exist as a A Record in the K8S DNS
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:07:53 GMT):<br/>
I have tried to use Downward API to pass the POD IP as well, but failed too
```
$ docker logs a346
2017-06-12 12:36:44.184 UTC [shim] userChaincodeStreamGetter -> ERRO 001 Error trying to connect to local peer: x509: cannot validate certificate for 172.17.0.4 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs
Error starting Simple chaincode: Error trying to connect to local peer: x509: cannot validate certificate for 172.17.0.4 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs
```
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:10:15 GMT):<br/>
Why Docker Swarm + docker compose is working... is that they are running on same Docker Network (overlay or whatever), which all entries are resolvable with the Swarm internal DNS... ... ...
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:17:19 GMT):<br/>
I am thinking of making a GitHub for this... it would be nice if people can join me to "Fix" this and make a version of running it on Google CLoud Platform
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:17:37 GMT):<br/>
Anyone interested?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:48:18 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest to either use a github fork or a gerrit CR to collaborate on the fix if you think its large
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:49:06 GMT):<br/>
(and I would suggest sticking with a CR unless you cant, it will be easier to upstream the fix later
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:51:25 GMT):<br/>
umm... fork from where? It is purely K8S configurations right now.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:52:02 GMT):<br/>
oh, i misunderstood, sorry
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:52:12 GMT):<br/>
i thought you were saying we needed a patch to fabric
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:52:15 GMT):<br/>
all the stuffs I "borrowed" is the e2e script... and the "generateArtefacts", which i customized for K8S
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:52:20 GMT):<br/>
dun worry...
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:52:27 GMT):<br/>
thats fine, i misunderstood, disregard
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:52:32 GMT):<br/>
no problem!
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:52:52 GMT):<br/>
btw: one possibility to explore is the PEER_ADDRESSDETECT thing
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:53:03 GMT):<br/>
cant recall the exact name, but will dig
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:53:09 GMT):<br/>
I know which one
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:53:22 GMT):<br/>
ok..issue is probably TLS CN/SAN, im sure
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:53:35 GMT):<br/>
but it probably solves the k8s DNS problem
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:53:57 GMT):<br/>

<br/><a href="./assets/xumoXcSZs9hQ3hb3d-core.yaml">Message Attachments</a>
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:54:10 GMT):<br/>
really?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:54:24 GMT):<br/>
thats the one...i think if you set that to true, the peer will surface its discovered IP
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:54:33 GMT):<br/>
rather than the name passed in
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:54:45 GMT):<br/>
but like I said, that will fix the DNS issue but break TLS
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:54:49 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:54:49 GMT):<br/>
so not likely usable
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:55:09 GMT):<br/>
I tried before as i used Downward API to pass the POD IP
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:55:16 GMT):<br/>
ah, i see
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:55:16 GMT):<br/>
to the peer.address env
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:55:20 GMT):<br/>
sorry, TLDR ;)
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:55:22 GMT):<br/>
but still DEAD by the TLS thing
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:55:26 GMT):<br/>
ill try to catch up on your notes later
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:55:29 GMT):<br/>
I mentioned earlier as well
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:55:36 GMT):<br/>
no problem. Thanks mate
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:55:55 GMT):<br/>
my only feeling is that... IF this is resolved, then the e2e should be running fine!
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:56:31 GMT):<br/>
one idea: we could possibly do something with addressAutoDetect=true, TLS off, localhost / k8s-network-policy
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:56:49 GMT):<br/>
e.g.hmm
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:56:52 GMT):<br/>
nevermind
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:56:57 GMT):<br/>
i forgot the peer only surfaces one port
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:57:02 GMT):<br/>
(not one specifically for the chaincode)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:57:27 GMT):<br/>
oh well, we'll figure something out
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:57:41 GMT):<br/>
yes... see if anyone else here can think of something else...
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:58:07 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @greg.haskins 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:58:38 GMT):<br/>
not sure how invasive the change would be, but one idea is to get rid of the notion of IP/TLS for the chaincode connection, at least as an option
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:58:46 GMT):<br/>
e.g. use unix-domain-sockets
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:59:17 GMT):<br/>
then we could create a pod-wide UDS that is volume mounted to all or something
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:59:44 GMT):<br/>
related: separate port for chaincode, only bind to localhost
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:59:47 GMT):<br/>
but seems not a small change
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:59:52 GMT):<br/>
probably not
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:59:56 GMT):<br/>
for the UDS
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:00:29 GMT):<br/>
in fact, I think a more appropriate way is to code a SPI to let us config how we want to spin up the chaincode container
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:00:34 GMT):<br/>
you'd be surprised, but I agree that separate localhost TCP is probably easier
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:00:45 GMT):<br/>
one SPI for K8S, one SPI for Docker Swarm
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:00:53 GMT):<br/>
what is SPI?
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:00:54 GMT):<br/>
in fact, just relying on Docker Remote API is not scalable
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:00:55 GMT):<br/>
not familar
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:01:14 GMT):<br/>
Service Provider Interface (reverse of API)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:01:23 GMT):<br/>
ah, ok
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:01:35 GMT):<br/>
Docker Remote API limits by that machine's memory
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:01:37 GMT):<br/>
is that a docker-specific concept, or just speaking generally?
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:01:45 GMT):<br/>
general speaking
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:02:09 GMT):<br/>
now, chaincode is a service... not really a contract
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:02:09 GMT):<br/>
I def agree that going forward, a more flexible abstraction for the chaincode isolation is warranted 
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:02:29 GMT):<br/>
if we want to have one contract one chaincode, then we end up super many cc containers
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:02:46 GMT):<br/>
definitely need to create cc container with proper container scheduler
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:02:49 GMT):<br/>
so why didnt downward API approach work?
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:03:03 GMT):<br/>
downward API can just pass the POD_ID?
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:03:20 GMT):<br/>
```
$ docker logs a346
2017-06-12 12:36:44.184 UTC [shim] userChaincodeStreamGetter -> ERRO 001 Error trying to connect to local peer: x509: cannot validate certificate for 172.17.0.4 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs
Error starting Simple chaincode: Error trying to connect to local peer: x509: cannot validate certificate for 172.17.0.4 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs
```
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:03:22 GMT):<br/>
then this
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:03:46 GMT):<br/>
ok, i might be thinking of a different application of the downward API
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:04:01 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking you meant you asked the k8s api to create the container, I think I got you now
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:04:19 GMT):<br/>
nono
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:04:36 GMT):<br/>
ur previous understanding is correct
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:04:54 GMT):<br/>
for long term solution and more scalable solution, i think using K8S api to create cc container
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:04:58 GMT):<br/>
is quite a must
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:05:14 GMT):<br/>
just that the Fabric should support different impl (different container scheduler)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:05:15 GMT):<br/>
agreed
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:05:40 GMT):<br/>
anyway, a short term hack: we could disable host verification in the shim
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:05:53 GMT):<br/>
but for the downward API, all I did was try to pass the POD_ID to the peer deployment. YAML
then it fails the TLS validation
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:06:00 GMT):<br/>
i need to think about it some more, but that might even be a mid/long term solution because we control the trust root anyway
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:06:18 GMT):<br/>
Yes, agreed... can try disabling the HOST verification thing
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:06:27 GMT):<br/>
ahh do u know whether it is configurable?
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:06:36 GMT):<br/>
or need to change code?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:06:54 GMT):<br/>
so peer::autoAddressDetect=true + shim::hostVerify=false
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:06:57 GMT):<br/>
and I think it would work
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:07:11 GMT):<br/>
my guess is we have to fix the code
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:07:15 GMT):<br/>
but id have to look
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:07:21 GMT):<br/>
where is the shim config?
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:07:36 GMT):<br/>
the peer autoaddressdetect I know where it is (core.yaml + env env)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:07:53 GMT):<br/>
looking, but not sure its exposed
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:07:57 GMT):<br/>
we might have to patch the code
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:11:02 GMT):<br/>
good news, it looks like the shim already has a knob
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:11:13 GMT):<br/>
now just seeing if it can be tweaked from the peer without code changes
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:11:35 GMT):<br/>
ic, let me take a look as well
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:12:25 GMT):<br/>
Can you point me what file you looking at? 
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:12:27 GMT):<br/>
haha...
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:12:30 GMT):<br/>
too fast you are :P
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:12:44 GMT):<br/>
hold on, i am untangling it
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:13:56 GMT):<br/>
be right back, wife shouting at me asking me to take bath
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:13:58 GMT):<br/>
haha
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:15:41 GMT):<br/>
I think you can just use the CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:15:53 GMT):<br/>
plus autoAddressDetect
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:16:19 GMT):<br/>
e.g. set autoAddressDetect=true, and CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE to match your x509
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:16:43 GMT):<br/>
that will force the peer to send its dynamic IP, and the shim will disregard the IP and verify against the environment
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:17:02 GMT):<br/>
confirming now
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:23:00 GMT):<br/>
confirmed, its passed all the way down
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:23:07 GMT):<br/>
heres where the peer gives it to the chaincode

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:23:40 GMT):<br/>
and I also confirmed the shim side
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:32:38 GMT):<br/>
OK cool!
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:39:07 GMT):<br/>
So, the CORE_PEER_ADDRESS set as 0.0.0.0:7051?
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:39:18 GMT):<br/>
as I still gotta specify the port, right?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=Kt55g9CmbmYfyg69w) @DannyWong @muralisr a convenient feature might be something that allows the peer to get the SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE from the x509 itself
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:30:55 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:31:51 GMT):<br/>
or perhaps simpler is to just allow the shim to disable checking
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:36:16 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins need to read up a bit...
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:36:56 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr summary is simple:  launching chaincode under kubernetes is a little more stringent than pure docker because of the DNS namespace that the chaincode ends up in
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:37:30 GMT):<br/>
e.g. in pure docker, "peer0" and "dev-peer0-mycc-1" end up on the same docker network, and thus have resolvable DNS names
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:37:31 GMT):<br/>
ok. 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:37:44 GMT):<br/>
in kubernetes, the peer is launched by k8s, and the chaincode is launched by the peer
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:37:52 GMT):<br/>
so they end up namespace isolated from one another
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:38:32 GMT):<br/>
a solution we have found is to combine AUTOADDRESSDETECT=true + SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE=$x509::CN
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:39:09 GMT):<br/>
and what I was pointing out is that setting SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE=$x509::CN and the x509 is redundant configuration work
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:39:28 GMT):<br/>
so, wondering if it can be automated/simplified
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:39:34 GMT):<br/>
because we can pick that up ourselves ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:39:36 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:40:13 GMT):<br/>
IOW, we _have_ to provide the x509, but why not auto-set the override from it: we already know it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:40:55 GMT):<br/>
honestly though, the most simple and equally correct option might be to simply tell the chaincode to not verify the hostname
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:41:18 GMT):<br/>
its not used in the same context in which a typical x509 PKI derives value from
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:42:16 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure how to disable hostname verification 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:42:32 GMT):<br/>
it might be layered into grpc
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:44:23 GMT):<br/>
also, why do you need AUTOADDRESSDETECT=true ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:44:43 GMT):<br/>
oh because you don't know the IP 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:44:45 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 15:45:16 GMT):<br/>
(ie, that has nothing to do with the TLS)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 16:03:28 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr I know you can in pure golang sockets, not sure what GRPC surfaces
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 16:03:31 GMT):<br/>
can investigate
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 16:04:45 GMT):<br/>
I do like the notion of hostname verification though...
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:49:01 GMT):<br/>
i am not sure it provides any real security in this context
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:49:19 GMT):<br/>
the peer is spoon feeding it all of the parameters
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:49:37 GMT):<br/>
(including the cert)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:49:59 GMT):<br/>
I need to think about it a little more, but i am fairly certain it offers no real security benefit in this context
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:50:26 GMT):<br/>
the problem in general PKI is that all browsers, etc, have a well known trust root
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:51:26 GMT):<br/>
so, I could buy a really cheap verisign cert and then MITM "www.ibm.com" with a hotspot in a coffee shop
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:52:42 GMT):<br/>
hostname verification could help thwart that type of attack surface because theres no way verisign should grant me a .crt with CN="www.ibm.com", etc
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:52:53 GMT):<br/>
but in this case, the peer is spoonfeeding the trust root anyway
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:53:16 GMT):<br/>
(by loading the peer.crt into the chaincode context)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:53:29 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:54:09 GMT):<br/>
so the hostname verification probably has little value
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:54:15 GMT):<br/>
i need to think about it more
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:54:39 GMT):<br/>
yeah, just a warm fuzzy :-)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:27:32 GMT):<br/>

@greg.haskins @DannyWong Hi I have been trying to tailor the docker-compose files at https://github.com/yeasy/docker-compose-files/tree/master/hyperledger/1.0 by converting to a Kubernetes yaml file, but have been unsuccessful so far...can you guys post the yaml that you ran or the instructions to run on Kubernetes?
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:20:24 GMT):<br/>
basically, CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE and CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT at peer do the trick
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:20:47 GMT):<br/>
plus having your /host/var/lib/docker socket as volume not PV
</p>
<p><strong>samarcho</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:36:47 GMT):<br/>
@DannyWong which yaml file did you start with? the link that I mentioned above does not even have the CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE variabel and neither is there a semblance of a certificate in the docker-compose.yaml file....I am beginning to think that I need a different starting point

@DannyWong  I did convert the docker-compose to the Kubrenetes yaml file
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:37:34 GMT):<br/>
well, i also started with using kompose to convert the docker compose
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:38:02 GMT):<br/>
then starting all the jorney to converting it... first kafka (and ZK)
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:38:05 GMT):<br/>
then orderer
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:38:07 GMT):<br/>
then peers
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:38:11 GMT):<br/>
then try to E2E
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:38:14 GMT):<br/>
take some time...
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:38:31 GMT):<br/>
Are you trying on K8S cluster or simply minikube
</p>
<p><strong>samarcho</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:39:08 GMT):<br/>
minishift
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:39:28 GMT):<br/>
then that would be easier
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:39:47 GMT):<br/>
for the PV, make it host path as per docker volume mount
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:40:13 GMT):<br/>
except the docker Unix socket
</p>
<p><strong>samarcho</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:42:12 GMT):<br/>
can you point me to which docker-compose file you started with ? There are many and some of them are not even supposed to work
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:43:53 GMT):<br/>
well, i just start with the one in Fabric github, Maybe u should take the one in e2e_example
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:44:02 GMT):<br/>
example --> e2e
</p>
<p><strong>samarcho</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 16:48:01 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks a lot !

 Hi, Do anyone have any documentations related to multi host networking between hyper-ledger peers ? if so can someone share that doc? As I tried with docker swarm and other stuff where it throws alot of errors or the peers don't communicate with each other.
Thank you in advance 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 07:58:48 GMT):<br/>
@ersudiplama do you have to use docker, or can you also use VMs?
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:11:47 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  we were trying to look at all the probable options for obtaining the multiple host networking between peers residing at different physical machines or servers. We have achieved the multi host networking different physical machines using docker swarm but we are not sure that as the best option or not. We would like to explore more options so that we can create distributed blockchian network between different peers located at different machines.  If anyone have more doc or  info about creating distribute network between peers residing at different servers or machine and share that doc with us, we would appreciate that help.  
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:11:52 GMT):<br/>
Thank you in advance 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:12:28 GMT):<br/>
so, if you have linux VMs and you have SSH keys to all of them you can use https://github.com/yacovm/fabricDeployment 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:12:40 GMT):<br/>
It's just a quick and dirty script that deploys fabric on bare metal VMs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:12:47 GMT):<br/>
assuming you have password-less SSH access
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:12:56 GMT):<br/>
but it does so for a single org
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:13:02 GMT):<br/>
and a Solo orderer (single instance)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:13:08 GMT):<br/>
but I guess it can be extended for Kafka too...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:13:16 GMT):<br/>
I'd suggest to take a look
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 13:57:10 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm We tried to use the docker images of the hyperledger fabric  and tried to creating the networking between the peers residing at different physical machine with Linux residing at different network and We faced problem for creating networking between different Orgs and Orderer. As Orderer in one container can find the Org in different container at different machine using the service name specified at compose file ( e followed documentation given at hyperledger fabric to create the docker images ] ) .  It is works fine sometime and throw unknown error sometime (for same steps which it worked for ) as I dont know what is happening. We are trying to create blockchain network tow Org infrastructure peers residing at different server. So if anyone have any documentation realted to achivig distributed networking between Orgs( peers) residing at different server or physical machine, it would be great help.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=cr6XdwG3b57RaqtqF) @ersudiplama did you try using an overlay network?
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 19:13:46 GMT):<br/>
@Moto 10 Ya we tried using overlay network, it works but it is not consistent ( as sometime it throws error for same steps which worked earlier). Do you have any tutorial or documentation of fabric which we can follow?

Thank you in advance 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:11:30 GMT):<br/>
@ersudiplama @Moto I have been working on that with this project,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:11:53 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/litong01/fabric-deploy
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:12:44 GMT):<br/>
to make fabric working on k8s on multiple nodes, I had to use overlay network (flanneld), this project actually start from basically nothing.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:14:17 GMT):<br/>
it will provision nodes from a cloud (OpenStack, VirtualBox, AWS (in the work now)), then initialize these nodes for them to be ready to run fabric, then setup overlay network, dns, registrator etc. eventually deploy fabric onto multiple nodes with multiple peers, orders, orgs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:14:59 GMT):<br/>
create genesis block, join all peers to the first channel, install a simple chaincode, instantiate the chaincode, then query.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:16:03 GMT):<br/>
for k8s, the project also setup k8s 1.7.0 env on multiple nodes with k8s dashboard and dns services, then start deploy fabric on.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:17:05 GMT):<br/>
the problem that I have is when I start instantiate chaincode, it feels due to network issues.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:18:11 GMT):<br/>
at this point, I am not really sure if chaincode instantiation assumes that all the parties involved has to share same host or ip or something, I tried various ways with no success, need some expert on chaincode instantiation process to help.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:18:57 GMT):<br/>
also, that project now can provision VirtualBox nodes and starting setting things up on the provisioned the VMs if you have no cloud env.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:20:24 GMT):<br/>
If you just have few physical nodes sitting around, you can also use the project to set up fabric but you will need to make sure that your physical servers have ubuntu 16.04 installed clean and network connection.
</p>
<p><strong>Moto</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:26:26 GMT):<br/>
@tongli yeah I saw your project while I was researching fabric networks yesterday.  Ansible looks really interesting.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:27:25 GMT):<br/>
@Moto, it is a tool that is very flexible and can do a lot, for provisioning and installation, it is great.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:28:04 GMT):<br/>
we are working hard to make it THE INSTALLER of the fabric regardless what env you might have.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:29:00 GMT):<br/>
it is working great now on OpenStack cloud (overlay network + docker), having a bit of issues in k8s (currently working on resolving that issue),
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:29:13 GMT):<br/>
we are also working on adding provisioning part on AWS as well.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:29:40 GMT):<br/>
I just added virtualbox script, so that you can actually provision few nodes on your virtualbox env and start doing things as well.
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 13:31:43 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Thank you for sharing . If I have any question, I will reach out to you.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 14:39:15 GMT):<br/>
@ersudiplama yeah, no problem. thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 15:18:03 GMT):<br/>
@ersudiplama forgot to ask you a question, when you setup multiple peer and orderer in k8s env, do you put peer or orderer container inside a pod and create corresponding services for each peer or orderer? 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 15:18:03 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 15:27:44 GMT):<br/>
@here, wonder if anyone else here dealing with k8s doing the similar thing to deploy fabric onto k8s? I assume that bare container on k8s is not the way to go.
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 16:55:14 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Now we are trying to use K8 but not successful so far. In our last iteration, we setup multiple peers and orderer using docker swarm over different physical machine using overlay network.
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 16:55:53 GMT):<br/>
That solution was not consistent
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 16:57:02 GMT):<br/>
@ersudiplama cool, I was successful doing that as well with just docker and overlay network (not swarm),
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 16:57:21 GMT):<br/>
however, when I put everything on k8s, the chaincode instantiation failed.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 16:57:53 GMT):<br/>
looking at the suggestion that @greg.haskins provided, hope I can figure out a way getting it working on k8s env.
</p>
<p><strong>ersudiplama</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 16:59:13 GMT):<br/>
@tongli Cool, if it works let us know ... best of luck ...
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 16:59:39 GMT):<br/>
@ersudiplama will report back as soon as I have some results.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:17:45 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I literally have it running right now, so I know its possible
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:18:45 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins great. can you provide me your deployment yaml file ? are you putting peers and orders inside pods?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:19:10 GMT):<br/>
not easily, statestreet is crazy locked down
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:19:16 GMT):<br/>
i can tell you the key elements though
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:19:32 GMT):<br/>
oh, that will help as well.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:20:10 GMT):<br/>
let me show you mine deployment files.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:20:27 GMT):<br/>
give me few minutes to run the script. a bit of my network settings.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:20:39 GMT):<br/>
I have k8s running on OpenStack 3 VMs.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:21:11 GMT):<br/>
I setup flanneld overlay network so nodes can talk to each other even when they are in a pod.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:21:22 GMT):<br/>
actually, a colleague wrote the deployment that is currently working, and they did it in a different way than i was expecting
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:21:31 GMT):<br/>
will take me a little time to fully decipher what they did
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:21:53 GMT):<br/>
that is fine, just need to know the key things.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:21:55 GMT):<br/>
I know we talked about the way Ive done it in the past here on this channel
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:22:01 GMT):<br/>
let me see if its still in the history
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:22:06 GMT):<br/>
cool.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:22:16 GMT):<br/>
that will help a lot.

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:24:58 GMT):<br/>
also see the AUTOADDRESS thing
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:25:04 GMT):<br/>
thats the other trick
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:25:52 GMT):<br/>
need to use both?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:25:54 GMT):<br/>
you basically need the peer to surface its dynamic IP (thats what AUTOADDRESS does) and then tell the chaincode to basically ignore the x509 CN 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:26:01 GMT):<br/>
thats what SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE does
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:26:40 GMT):<br/>
(and the other part is you need the peer pod to be privelged so it has the rights to drive the docker-api
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:27:09 GMT):<br/>
ok, I will make that change.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:27:18 GMT):<br/>
will make these changes and try again.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:27:23 GMT):<br/>
I use openshift variant of k8s though, and my privileged setup via "oc scc" might not be universal
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:27:47 GMT):<br/>
but I think there is a pure k8s variant that I will leave as an exercise for the reader ;)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:28:17 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins that is totally ok, I setup k8s myself on OpenStack, I can give myself all the rights needed.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:28:24 GMT):<br/>
cool
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:29:01 GMT):<br/>
my colleague addressed the problem slightly differently by managing the DNS/docker environment
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:29:03 GMT):<br/>
fwiw
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:29:14 GMT):<br/>
let me try these things. thanks again for your help. btw, you are putting peers and orderers in pods and make services out of them, right?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:29:33 GMT):<br/>
but since I havent done it that way, I am more comfortable advising on the AUTOADDRESS/HOSTOVERRIDE method
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:29:41 GMT):<br/>
that is correct
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:29:57 GMT):<br/>
1 peer/orderer per pod
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:30:23 GMT):<br/>
right, I did 1 peer inside one pod, then a service per peer pod, or orderer pod.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:30:35 GMT):<br/>
yes, i think thats correct
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:30:45 GMT):<br/>
thats how I did it, and I believe how my colleague did it, but I would have to look
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:30:55 GMT):<br/>
but thats pretty standard, otherwise you dont get a DNS entry
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:30:56 GMT):<br/>
also kafka, zookeeper were done same way.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:31:13 GMT):<br/>
exactly.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:31:40 GMT):<br/>
cool, cool, let me try these tricks, and share my deployment yaml files if they do not work for some reason.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:31:49 GMT):<br/>
the AUTOADDRESS thing _may_ preclude the need at least w.r.t. chaincode, but I think you'd eventually need it to surface the peer to the outside anyway
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:32:06 GMT):<br/>
actually for the peers to find each other, too
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:32:12 GMT):<br/>
so yeah, its needed...
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:32:12 GMT):<br/>
heh
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:32:42 GMT):<br/>
so each peer should use that flag or this is only needed for instantiate chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:32:54 GMT):<br/>
each peer
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:33:14 GMT):<br/>
you should set each peer in the env/config to have those settings
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:33:26 GMT):<br/>
ah, I do not have that flag for each peer. i c.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:33:29 GMT):<br/>
they will take effect when you try to instantiate chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:33:45 GMT):<br/>
make a lot of sense to me.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:33:53 GMT):<br/>
awesome . thanks again.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:33:58 GMT):<br/>
yvw
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:34:07 GMT):<br/>
let us know how you make out
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 17:41:22 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins will report back very soon. thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 18:14:30 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins made the peer container all privileged, no luck.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 18:15:11 GMT):<br/>
will try to add CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE, but do not know what value should it bear, find an example says OBC, which does not make sense to me.

@greg.haskins l did use neither CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE nor  AUTOADDRESS for peer, what I used was to make sure that these bare chaincode containers created by peers using the dns which point back to the k8s dns services (had to use a nginx to proxy it).
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:14:27 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins now it is all working in k8s env. Just wanted to report back to you.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:14:54 GMT):<br/>
that sounds like the solution that my colleague is currently using
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:15:35 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins I will verify few more things tomorrow in terms if privileged container actually makes difference, I have it on. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:16:11 GMT):<br/>
seems to me it is all about networking since the chaincode could not find the peer back, now it can with the dns service help.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:16:35 GMT):<br/>
@tongli the issue will be surrounding the /var/lib/docker.sock
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:16:42 GMT):<br/>
and your k8s environment
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:16:56 GMT):<br/>
that makes a lot of sense to me.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:17:27 GMT):<br/>
as an example, openshift uses selinux to manage pod privleges and if you just blindly try to volume-map the docker.socket it wont work as the peer pod lacks enough selinux privleges
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:18:23 GMT):<br/>
but if you enable elevated privleges in the SCC for the context that the peer runs in, and then set privleged=true, the selinux profile is updated to allow the peer to talk to docker
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:18:25 GMT):<br/>
YMMV
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:18:43 GMT):<br/>
understood.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:19:07 GMT):<br/>
just happy that it is all working with your helping hands, really appreciate it.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:19:19 GMT):<br/>
yvw, sorry it wasnt quite as I depicted
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:19:39 GMT):<br/>
not sure what went wrong with that other approach, but both myself and @DannyWong had success going that route
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:19:41 GMT):<br/>
still would like to know what value this env variable should be CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:19:57 GMT):<br/>
IIRC, you want to set that to match your x509 CN
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:20:10 GMT):<br/>
oh, i c.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:20:17 GMT):<br/>
CN, or any SANs
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:20:37 GMT):<br/>
e.g. peer1.example.com or pee1
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:20:37 GMT):<br/>
e.g. peer1.example.com or peer1
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:20:37 GMT):<br/>
I made sure hostname and CN match up well.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:20:56 GMT):<br/>
Jason is adding something to allow hostname and CN can be different.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:21:09 GMT):<br/>
this is because if you use the two items together I mentioned, your peer will be advertising something like 172.18.0.23
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:21:19 GMT):<br/>
it is to make sure in sitiutations that endpoint and the certificate entry can mismatch.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:21:23 GMT):<br/>
which is unlikely to be in your CN/SAN
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:21:53 GMT):<br/>
yes, that is what SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE more or less does, its just in a different context
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:22:06 GMT):<br/>
make sense.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:22:07 GMT):<br/>
I think Jason added similar feature for orderer
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:22:36 GMT):<br/>
hmmm. I thought it was also for peer. wait, let me pull that patch set out.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:22:48 GMT):<br/>
I might be thinking of a different CR
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:23:12 GMT):<br/>
but I saw one recently where he added ORDERER_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE to pair with PEER_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE (or something like that)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:23:15 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/11677/
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:23:23 GMT):<br/>
that is the patch, I thought it is all about peer.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:23:32 GMT):<br/>
yeah, thats the one
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:23:46 GMT):<br/>
it is a patch for the peer, but it is w.r.t. the connection to the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:24:03 GMT):<br/>
ah. great. great. I am following.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:24:20 GMT):<br/>
did not talk like a fool. 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:24:51 GMT):<br/>
I misstated above anyway
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:25:07 GMT):<br/>
should have said "similar feature for (the) orderer (connection)"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:25:16 GMT):<br/>
it was confusing how I stated it
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:25:27 GMT):<br/>
no issue at all. we are trying to figure out things.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:25:46 GMT):<br/>
here is the project I work on https://github.com/litong01/fabric-deploy
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:26:08 GMT):<br/>
now the code fully deploys fabric 1.0.0 onto the OpenStack.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:26:23 GMT):<br/>
we've added provision code (just today) against AWS.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:26:32 GMT):<br/>
cool...ill check it out later, but I have to get up early tomorrow so off to bed for me
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:26:36 GMT):<br/>
I will try to deploy onto AWS tomorrow and see what happens.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 02:26:48 GMT):<br/>

Hello all ... I have a little challenge deploying fabric-peer and membersrvc image to my kubernetes env, I followed this tutorial https://www.xenonstack.com/blog/blockchain-app-deployment-using-microservices-with-kubernetes, I was able to pull the image but it's not running, but I'm presently faced with this issue  (standard_init_linux.go:178: exec user process caused "exec format error") I need help on what to do and how to resolve this. thanks

<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 12:08:16 GMT):<br/>
but trying to deploy chaincode is the issue

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:03:58 GMT):<br/>
but basically, if you scroll back to the discussion by @greg.haskins and @tongli the answer is there
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:40:49 GMT):<br/>
hello @cbf 
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:41:13 GMT):<br/>
I have just gone through the conversation
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:41:33 GMT):<br/>
I however don't know what to set CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE  to
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:46:20 GMT):<br/>
@daygee the peer containers
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:46:20 GMT):<br/>
@daygee the peer containers x509 CN https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=qKQ8u4Jb3CGjenb87
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:03:10 GMT):<br/>
however I am now seeing that there's another approach that worked for @tongli 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:46:51 GMT):<br/>
@daygee I do not think that parameter works. at least not with a patch that Jason Yellick put in.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:47:05 GMT):<br/>
With Jason's patch, I think that will work.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:47:52 GMT):<br/>
the point is that the endpoint and the peer id can be different. THe endpoint can be an IP address, the peer id can be something peer1st.orga.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:01:01 GMT):<br/>
@daygee The trick is that SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE must be in the set of x509:{CN, SAN*}
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:02:10 GMT):<br/>
All SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE really does it is tells the client-side stack to disregard the hostname/ip that it used to connect to the TLS endpoint, and pretend it used $SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:02:18 GMT):<br/>
all the other rules of TLS validation still apply
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:02:58 GMT):<br/>
meaning, the TLS server still needs to present an x509 that has $SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE defined either as its CN, SAN::DNS, or SAN::IP
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:03:09 GMT):<br/>
I think of it like a DNS alias
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:03:33 GMT):<br/>
IOW, setting $SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE is kind of like setting /etc/hosts
</p>

Hi,I was testing Hyperledger-fabic v1.0.0 with kubernetes. It says missing image when I instantiate chaincode in the cli,But the image just create successful. I found the answer in this RocketChat. And I set CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT=true and CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE=$x509::CN. But this doesn't work for me. By the way, I disabled TLS in the yaml file for some reason. So CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE may not take effect.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 11:29:06 GMT):<br/>
@chenshiok , when that happens, I found most of the time due to the chaincode container not being able to find the peer container which creates the chaincode container.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 11:31:13 GMT):<br/>
@chenshiok not sure about your env, but you probably can check when you manually start a container, and see if you can ping back the container by using the peer id.
</p>
<p><strong>chenshiok</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 07:14:55 GMT):<br/>
@tongli I start the chaincode container manually, and the container cant't ping other peers. I think the problem maybe the DNS. The chaincode container started by the peer or started manually, the kubernets didn't resolve the peer id. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 11:44:35 GMT):<br/>
@chenshiok these problems are normally env related. Not sure what kind of env you have, in either swarm like env or k8s env, dns is needed.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 11:44:58 GMT):<br/>
there are a lot of steps you need to go through to make it working.

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 18:46:20 GMT):<br/>
so, we have a bunch of these
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 18:46:47 GMT):<br/>
not that that is a bad thing, but wouldn't it be nice if we had a canonical version we could share?

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 18:48:16 GMT):<br/>

cello, then there's https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/12059/ which adds ansible orchestration on openstack, virtualbox, aws, azure, etc for docker and k8s and then there is other interest from a rather large supporter of k8s

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 18:46:20 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 18:48:54 GMT):<br/>
I figured you meant there was a new gerrit deployment, and I was getting access denied
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 18:49:10 GMT):<br/>
but you are saying you are using a new view into the same data, but it returns an incompatible URL
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 18:49:13 GMT):<br/>
no, just new and old UI
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 18:49:25 GMT):<br/>
right, i found the CR here https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12059/
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 18:49:34 GMT):<br/>

I'm attempting to set up TLS communication between peers and orderers, but I'm seeing this error in the peer log.. would anyone have ideas of what I've configured incorrectly?  `[peer-1 peer] 2017-08-15 21:09:38.795 UTC [ConnProducer] NewConnection -> ERRO 31c Failed connecting to orderer-2.orderer:7050 , error: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

There needs to be a way to connect a chaincode container to a network. In the case where a user runs a peer on one machine, but wants to run that peers chaincode on a different machine, they may need to have additional control over what network the chaincode container connects to. An example of such a scenario would be wanting the peer to communicate with the chaincode container over a docker overlay network.

Hi, I used https://ibm-blockchain.github.io/ instructions to setup a Blockchain network on the IBM Container Service's free plan. But it by default connects to leveldb. How can I migrate it to a CouchDB so that I can do complex Queries?

@NithinPaulCherian I'm 90% of the way there to getting HLF with CouchDB working in Kubernetes, perhaps someone can spot the errors here? I've set up one CouchDB service per peer and wired the peer to CouchDB with the CORE_LEDGER_STATE_COUCHDBCONFIG_COUCHDBADDRESS variable. The peers connect to CouchDB fine, the databases are created and there is no error message. However when the peers try to join the channel there is an error in the 'joinchannel' pod: `2017-08-20T09:52:34.777594452Z 2017-08-20 09:52:34.777 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 005 grpc: addrConn.resetTransport failed to create client transport: connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing dial tcp 10.10.10.62:5010: getsockopt: connection refused"; Reconnecting to {blockchain-org2peer1:5010 <nil>}`.  When I revert back to  LevelDB, the peers join the channel without problems.  I've use the standard IBM instructions and I'll upload the 2 K8s config files I've changed. Any ideas?

Any tips? (Sorry for the long log messages)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 02:47:57 GMT):<br/>
@joaquimpedrooliveira its almost certainly related to your network setup
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 02:48:02 GMT):<br/>
two tips
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 02:48:39 GMT):<br/>
1) if you set CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true to the peer environment, it will include the output of the chaincode to the peers log
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 02:49:15 GMT):<br/>
this is incredibly helpful to debug this type of thing, but its off by default for defensive postering of the peer (to prevent a malicious/broken chaincode from spamming the peer log
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 02:49:15 GMT):<br/>
this is incredibly helpful to debug this type of thing, but its off by default for defensive posturing of the peer (to prevent a malicious/broken chaincode from spamming the peer log
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 02:49:52 GMT):<br/>
2) My guess is that you arent surfacing a k8s-friendly peer address to the chaincode and it cant find the peer
</p>

@joaquimpedrooliveira i got distracted and forgot to paste the rest of (2)

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:43:59 GMT):<br/>
you want

```        - name: CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT

in the peer environment...
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:44:32 GMT):<br/>
that will present the right endpoint to the chaincode when its in k9s
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:44:33 GMT):<br/>
k8s
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:44:58 GMT):<br/>
(SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE should match your x509::[CN/SAN]
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:45:07 GMT):<br/>
The more I look at the examples, the more environment variables I discover :smile: 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:45:09 GMT):<br/>
if you dont use TLS, you can ignore that part
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:46:31 GMT):<br/>
Is there any docs listing all environment variables and their values and effects?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:47:07 GMT):<br/>
the system uses a library called viper which allows configuration to be specified both as a yaml file as well as environment overrides
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:47:14 GMT):<br/>
so the best thing to do is look at the default yaml
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:47:37 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/sampleconfig/core.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:48:01 GMT):<br/>
for instance, if you wanted to set this one: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L38
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:48:26 GMT):<br/>
its $FILE_$PATH_$TO_$ITEM
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:48:43 GMT):<br/>
so CORE_LOGGING_PEER would be the envvar that corresponds to L38
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:49:22 GMT):<br/>
Man, that was the tip of the year :D

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=PTf8ZEFKgcwwjvx7E) @greg.haskins I found a comment you made here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3339?focusedCommentId=28519&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-28519
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:50:46 GMT):<br/>
And when you said:
>The fact is, the chaincode container doesn't need any services except for the ability to find the peer's TLS endpoint.
I understoond that TLS _must_ be enabled in the peer
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:51:01 GMT):<br/>
Did I misunderstand what you mean?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:51:33 GMT):<br/>
im not sure what comment you are referring to, but generally speaking you can disable TLS but you generally do it globally
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:51:38 GMT):<br/>
e.g. the entire network operates that way
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:52:52 GMT):<br/>
Ok, so chaincode would work in k8s even if the network is not using TLS?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:53:56 GMT):<br/>
I mean, the chaincode container creation and execution
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:54:33 GMT):<br/>
yeah, if you turn off TLS in the config, its turned off in the chaincode too
</p>

Great. I'll try the configs you mentioned above. Thanks again for your support!
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:55:28 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 12:55:40 GMT):<br/>
but for sanity checking your setup ...

@joaquimpedrooliveira i'll just throw this out there too in case its helpful.  I have this CR (which I need to update) https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12159/
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 13:01:20 GMT):<br/>
it adds a "make kubernetes" option to examples/cluster
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 13:01:40 GMT):<br/>
I use a more up to date version of that daily to run fabric on openshift
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 13:02:09 GMT):<br/>
ill clean it up and merge my local fixes to that CR so I can get it merged, but theres still valuable info in there if you are curious how to run on k8s
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 13:03:31 GMT):<br/>
in a nutshell, "make kubernetes" output is a self-contained yaml file that you can then fire in with kubectl create
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 13:03:38 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 14:20:13 GMT):<br/>
Now I gonna enable TLS and test again :)
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 18:55:22 GMT):<br/>
Hi, all. When I enable TLS in my network, I get the following error in *peer* when trying to instantiate a chaincode:
```INFO 55a Error starting Simple chaincode: Error trying to connect to local peer: x509: cannot validate certificate for 192.168.4.33 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs2017-10-06 18:45:59.124 UTC [shim] userChaincodeStreamGetter -> ERRO 002 Error trying to connect to local peer: x509: cannot validate certificate for 192.168.4.33 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs
```
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 18:56:22 GMT):<br/>
What certificate is being used here? I cannot remember of any certificate being generated by `cryptogen` for the chaincode container.
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:02:08 GMT):<br/>
Do I need to configure `chaincodeListenAddress` and expose this port in the deployment spec?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:36:28 GMT):<br/>
@joaquimpedrooliveira this is what the SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE mechanism was designed for
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:36:32 GMT):<br/>
heres whats happening:
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:36:50 GMT):<br/>
you (or cryptogen, probably) build a set of x509s for your network
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:37:23 GMT):<br/>
that x509 has a CommonName and/or Subject Alternative Name that is "x"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:37:46 GMT):<br/>
the chaincode will expect that the URL that it uses should match the x509 presented
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:38:20 GMT):<br/>
meaning, the URL that the peer hands to the chaincode is expected to correlated to the CN/SAN that the peer surfaces in its x509
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:38:42 GMT):<br/>
the problem on k8s is, everyone has a dynamic address, etc
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:38:52 GMT):<br/>
(there are actually deeper problems I wont get into)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:39:24 GMT):<br/>
but long story short, you can work around those k8s-dynamic-environment type problems by using the ADDRESSAUTODETECT feature
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:39:41 GMT):<br/>
this means the peer automatically detects its address and gives _that_ to the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:39:54 GMT):<br/>
the problem is, the dynamic address is almost certainly not in your x509 CN/SAN
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:40:09 GMT):<br/>
so, the second part of the equation is to use SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:41:01 GMT):<br/>
this means that the chaincode TLS library will use $SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE when validating the x509 CN/SAN rather than the PEER_ADDRESS that was handed to it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:41:11 GMT):<br/>
you can think of SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE as a DNS entry in a way
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:42:07 GMT):<br/>
so PEER_ADDRESS = 172.17.0.23 SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE="peer1" means that the chaincode TLS library will connect to grpcs://172.17.0.23 while pretending it connected to grpcs://peer1
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:42:32 GMT):<br/>
e.g. as if it had performed a DNS lookup peer1 -> 172.17.0.23
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:43:05 GMT):<br/>
SO...the rub is that you want to ensure your SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE is specified when you use k8s, and that it matches your x509
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:43:31 GMT):<br/>
hopefully this makes sense
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 20:59:07 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=xqmcgfwhW5RQ2p8cJ) @joaquimpedrooliveira correct
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 20:59:40 GMT):<br/>
each peer should have ADDRESSAUTODETECT=true and SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE=$peername
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 20:59:58 GMT):<br/>
Ok!
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 20:59:58 GMT):<br/>
where $peername is something that correlates to either the x509 CN or one of the SAN::DNS entries
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 21:00:49 GMT):<br/>
fwiw, cryptogen registers both the FQDN as as CN and a relative name as a SAN::DNS
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 21:01:21 GMT):<br/>
e.g. {CN: peer1.org1.com, SAN::DNS: peer1}

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 08:06:16 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins the above you said made me wonder - why can't we make the peer always create a self-signed CA cert, and then detect its ip address upon boot and generate a TLS certificate with the proper SAN as its IP address and give that + the self signed root CA cert to the chaincode container when it is launched? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 08:06:45 GMT):<br/>
(via the upload API of course, not commandline args ;) )
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 13:10:24 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm we could...although its not technically any more secure than SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE as far as I can tell
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 13:10:56 GMT):<br/>
(either way, the chaincode relies on the peer to provide information)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 13:11:27 GMT):<br/>
but I thought in your case - the override is supplied not by the peer dynamically but via core.yaml or something?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 13:11:47 GMT):<br/>
no, the peer sets the override as an envvar
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 13:12:00 GMT):<br/>
it always does so?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 13:12:02 GMT):<br/>
but even if it were core.yaml, still doesnt matter
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 13:12:29 GMT):<br/>
i dont recall..it might only set it when its enabled
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=WCqAz8JGfbwc8yhbj) @yacovm i dont recall..it might only set it when its enabled
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 13:13:11 GMT):<br/>
basically, the peer sets envvar, core.yaml, tls material...so I dont think it matters which vehicle is used
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 13:15:20 GMT):<br/>
anyway, i think the SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE is perfectly fine to use..its no different than if we a) hooked the chaincode up properly to the k8s DNS (today its not), or b) dynamically updated /etc/hosts inside the chaincode container, etc
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 13:15:53 GMT):<br/>
its just a convenient way to achieve the same thing as a DNS update
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 08 Oct 2017 13:16:12 GMT):<br/>
and not any less secure
</p>

<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:18:41 GMT):<br/>
What I did after starting a basic network (one orderer, one peer, one couchdb, one CA):
1. Created channel: `peer channel create -o $ORDERER_ADDRESS --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CAFILE -c serprochannel -f /etc/hyperledger/configtx/channel.tx`
2. Joined channel: `peer channel join --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CAFILE -b serprochannel.block`
3. Installed chaincode `fabcar`: `peer chaincode install --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CAFILE -n fabcar -v 1.0 -p github.com/fabcar`
4. Tried to instantiate the chaincode: `peer chaincode instantiate -o $ORDERER_ADDRESS --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CAFILE -C serprochannel -n fabcar -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":[""]}'`
Here I received the following error: `Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = chaincode error (status: 500, message: chaincode exists fabcar)`
5. As it says that the chaincode already exists, I tried to invoke  it: `peer chaincode invoke -o $ORDERER_ADDRESS --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CAFILE -C serprochannel -n fabcar -c '{"function":"initLedger","Args":[""]}'`
Then I receive: `Error: Error endorsing invoke: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error executing chaincode: Could not get deployment transaction from LSCC for fabcar:1.0 - Get ChaincodeDeploymentSpec for fabcar/serprochannel from LSCC error: chaincode fingerprint mismatch data mismatch - <nil>

Running the default hyperledger-fabric-* containers on Kubernetes
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:21:31 GMT):<br/>
I have the logs for each individual operation, if it helps.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:33:38 GMT):<br/>
@joaquimpedrooliveira my guess is this ... it was instantiated on the channel but was not on this particular peer you were trying to invoke 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:34:07 GMT):<br/>
to make that happen, you (rightly) installed the chaincode on the peer (step 3)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:34:48 GMT):<br/>
however the invoke tried to match the installed CC with the fingerprint of the instnatiated CC for the channel 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:34:48 GMT):<br/>
however the invoke tried to match the installed CC with the fingerprint of the instnatiated CC for the channel  before invoking it
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:36:35 GMT):<br/>
and that did not match for some reason ... this could happen if the second install in 3 was different from the chaincode that was used to install in some manner
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:40:28 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr , I started the network from scratch, so I'm assuming that there was no chaincode previously installed anywhere . Is my assumption ok?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:42:06 GMT):<br/>
@joaquimpedrooliveira the chaincode did exist on the ledger in 4 ... I'd have expected it to go through successfully if starting from scratch 
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:43:19 GMT):<br/>
it exists in 4 because it was installed in step 3, right?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:43:57 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand when you say that
> it was instantiated on the channel but was not on this particular peer you were trying to invoke
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:44:59 GMT):<br/>
How can I instantiate a chaincode in channel, but not on a peer? I thought that the command `peer chaincode install` did both :)
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:45:32 GMT):<br/>
I confess I really don't have a deep understand of chaincode lifecycle.
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:46:17 GMT):<br/>
And a curious thing is: when I did the same steps before, with TLS disabled, it worked.
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:47:17 GMT):<br/>
Just for clarification: I did the steps above only once each
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:47:28 GMT):<br/>
I have only one peer in my simple network
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:47:31 GMT):<br/>
step 3 is "install" -> put the chaincode on the peer , step 4 is "instantiate" -> use the installed chaincode to instantiate the chaincode on the channel's ledger
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:48:02 GMT):<br/>
Now I got it. Thanks for the explanation :)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:48:18 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:50:07 GMT):<br/>
4 is the key...for some reason the channel is still there and the chaincode is alreay instantiated though you want it to start from scratch
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:50:20 GMT):<br/>
The couchdb only maintains the world state, not the full ledger, right?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:50:40 GMT):<br/>
I'm not restarting it. Could this be the cause?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:52:41 GMT):<br/>
couchdb maintains everithing ... in particular it would know about instatiated chaincodes
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:53:32 GMT):<br/>
if the clean up did not include removing the ledger dbs, then on restart you'll find it
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:53:48 GMT):<br/>
So a previous chaincode may exist in couchdb
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:53:52 GMT):<br/>
need to get back... talk later
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:53:53 GMT):<br/>
rigfht
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:53:53 GMT):<br/>
It may be the cause
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:53:55 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 13:23:22 GMT):<br/>
if its the same issue, basically the system may not invalidate containers from a previous run
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 13:23:42 GMT):<br/>
it usually materializes as a TLS problem since the old container has old certs
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 13:24:03 GMT):<br/>
(But do note that the problem is deeper than just TLS, that is just how it surfaces)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 13:24:49 GMT):<br/>
I think @ecb is already working on a fix

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=afaAYXSXvEs4gFpFs) @greg.haskins Is there anything I could look for in logs to be sure it's the same issue?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 13:43:54 GMT):<br/>
In fact, I don't see in peers logs something similar to:
```2017-10-11 13:36:28.865 UTC [dockercontroller] Start -> DEBU 42a start-could not find image <dev-peer0.blockchain.serpro.gov.br-marbles-1.0-bd32a92351de591f7c9fcec0836343f5e3adc1ce1cea5a4d202678167fc365c0> (container id <dev-peer0.blockchain.serpro.gov.br-marbles-1.0>), because of <no such image>...attempt to recreate image
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 13:44:31 GMT):<br/>
This was from trying to instantiate `marbles02`, that I've never run before
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 13:47:19 GMT):<br/>
But when I tried `fabcar`, that is the one I'm always using, this message is not shown
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 13:52:08 GMT):<br/>
Bingo! Using `marbles02` chaincode, that has never been used before, I could instantiate and invoke the chaincode!
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 13:52:29 GMT):<br/>
So I think I really bumped into `FAB-3996`.

@greg.haskins - I downloaded the make kubernetes you gave a link to on Oct 5th. When trying to build it I am receiving a build error - ../../vendor/github.com/miekg/pkcs11/pkcs11.go:29:18: fatal error: ltdl.h: No such file or directory. Per FAB-2684 this relates to the PKCS11 dynamic build that Vlad incorporated, but I am not sure how to resolve as I am testing the kubernetes and really do not want to add the overhead issues of dealing with the softhsm as I test. Suggestions on how to resolve?

HI Team, My composer network was running fine till thursday last week. I was able to connect programatically to the composer network running on ibm container service(kubernetes). There was a new composer release last week. I also noticed that lot of script changes and yml changes were introduced on the github repo for container service.  My question is: Do we need a new kind of connection profile to connect to the composer network? or would the old connection profile will do?
</p>
<p><strong>mna2016</strong> (Tue, 17 Oct 2017 12:43:51 GMT):<br/>
Also, "kubectl proxy" does not work anymore. kubctl Ui can be useful for checking cluster logs etc.
</p>
<p><strong>mna2016</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 12:02:20 GMT):<br/>
I was able to deploy the composer network on kubernetes container now. But kubectl proxy doesnt still work.

Hey just wondering... I am running a standard 3 peers multi-host K8S with 100+ chaincode containers (they are created by peer with Docker Remote API, and not K8S pod)

I am wondering.... anyone has a better way to manage those cc containers? e.g. logs...etc
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 06:08:04 GMT):<br/>
can we change the logging driver of those chaincode containers?
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 10:29:39 GMT):<br/>
right now, i am thinking to change the default logging driver of the docker daemon such that all containers log will go to log management tool like Apache Spark
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 10:29:43 GMT):<br/>
Any idea from community?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 16:11:17 GMT):<br/>
@DannyWong generally speaking, there is interest in the community to make k8s type concerns more first class in the peer/chaincode model
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 16:11:21 GMT):<br/>
that would include logging
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 20 Oct 2017 16:12:02 GMT):<br/>
so, if you have some thoughts on ways to make the logging more flexible, create a JIRA and start the conversation
</p>
<p><strong>DannyWong</strong> (Mon, 23 Oct 2017 06:02:37 GMT):<br/>
ok

Hey everyone, I am trying to deploy my blockchain network to the free blockchain service on bluemix. I am following these instructions here: https://ibm-blockchain.github.io/interacting/ . I have deployed my business network in playground, and now I am having trouble accessing my rest API. I executed this command successfully as per the tutorial: 'create_composer-rest-server.sh --business-network-id <my-business-network>', but I am not able to access the REST server at the  http://<My_Public_IP>:31090/explorer/ as it says...Am I missing something in my setup?

use tcpSocket probes tends to give me all sorts of broken pipe errors in my orderer debug logs, so I'm wondering if there's anything better to use

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 22:33:11 GMT):<br/>
@jmcnevin perhaps issue a config request to both?

or a channel list for peer.  Basically any CLI invoke will interface with any peer you wish

<p><strong>tsnyder</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 16:37:14 GMT):<br/>
Not sure where to ask this - but since I am using kubernetes minikube environment and setup is accordingly I thought I would start here and see if anyone had seen this and have a solution. Using the configuration, Dockerfile and kubernetes yamls I have been able to instantiate and orderer, 4 peers in 4 orgs, and a cli container. I have been able to successfully create a channel and have all peers join it. I have been able to install chaincode on all peers (example02). The last step initiating the chaincode is failing due a connection attempt timeout with the ordering service (see errs file). I have also attached my docker file for the peer0 and the kubernetes yaml. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

<p><strong>tsnyder</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 16:39:55 GMT):<br/>

Hi, I am setting 5 peers in one org (i.e. OrgA). They are configured as 5 deployment with 1 replica (not using StatefulSet). Each of them are having separate peer identity and crypto materials).

I have 100+ chaincode... 

Problem Statement:
- If there are 2 peers scheduled to same K8S node (minion) then it will bring 200+ chaincode containers to that peers (and not managed by K8S). The memory and CPU of that host might be exhausted by this.

What I want...
- I want to ensure each peer will be scheduled by K8S to a K8S node (a.k.a minion) if there is no other peer on them

What I have done...
- Googled a bit on K8S scheduling (node/pod affinity and anti-affinity) and Stateful sets... Seems not get it working


Community, any help/insight?

@jmcnevin let me take a look... again
</p>
<p><strong>jmcnevin</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 22:31:52 GMT):<br/>
I'm wondering how everyone here is managing the docker VM that peers use.  I've seen in many places that people are mounting the node's docker.sock and exposing that to the peer, but I'm wondering if this is allowing sibling containers to be created that could be orphaned if the peer pod is destroyed
</p>
<p><strong>jmcnevin</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 22:33:22 GMT):<br/>
i was kicking around the idea of running a completely new docker instance inside of the pod, next to the peer, and letting the peer use that instead, so all of its chaincode containers would be cleaned up along with the pod
</p>
<p><strong>jmcnevin</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 22:36:44 GMT):<br/>
this way you could also put resource requests around that docker host container depending on how much chaincode you expect to have installed per-peer

Hi guys
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 13:10:40 GMT):<br/>
so I have tried to deploy members of a hyperledger network to a kubernetes cluster
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 13:11:36 GMT):<br/>
I also implemented a kafka based ordering service
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 13:14:45 GMT):<br/>
but kafka and zookeeper seem to be acting up
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 13:16:40 GMT):<br/>
zookeeper keeps throwing: caught end of stream exception
EndOfStreamException: Unable to read additional data from client sessionid 0x0, likely client has closed socket
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 13:23:02 GMT):<br/>
and kafka is misbehaving so the orderer can't connect
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 13:23:19 GMT):<br/>
any suggestions would be appreciated
</p>

Hi I was trying to deploy hyperledger on kubernetes , as you know kubernetes doesnot allow us to include '.'(dot) in service name , so my orderer service name is orderer-example-com . So I gave the orderer address as orderer-example-com:7050 , but when peer is trying to connect to orderer while initializing chaincode , I am getting this error -  "Failed connecting to orderer-example-com:7050 , error: x509: certificate is valid for orderer.example.com, orderer, not orderer-example-com"  , any help would be appreciated.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=c7dCCLJtruLa4kiFL) @tsnyder     HEY tsnyder , since you have deployed orderer on Kubernetes , You must have changed the name of the orderer service from "." to something else , connect to that service not orderer.example.com
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 03:02:27 GMT):<br/>
@SwatiRaj maybe disable tls and try again
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 10:58:47 GMT):<br/>
@SwatiRaj you have to change the orderer's name in the configtx file from orderer.example.com to orderer-example-com and then generate new certificates for it
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 11:00:55 GMT):<br/>
So apparently, I discovered that the zookeeper issue is something that can happen to zookeeper that doesn't necessarily stop functionality in the network
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 11:01:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 14:53:22 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 14:53:26 GMT):<br/>
on how to achieve that
</p>

<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 14:55:44 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 14:56:05 GMT):<br/>

</p>

</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 14:57:49 GMT):<br/>
No problem.
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 14:58:44 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels  what if I don't want to go on with vSphere ?
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 14:58:50 GMT):<br/>
Maybe someone @here has some yaml-files ready to go. But the tarball you can download on the same page I linked, has some code which generates a Kubernetes yaml.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 14:59:30 GMT):<br/>
If you download the tarball and the PDF from that page you'll have instructions on how to only generate the Kubernetes resources.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 14:59:41 GMT):<br/>
I'm currently working on getting that working on Windows.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 20 Nov 2017 15:00:05 GMT):<br/>

@Luke_Chen  Firstly, thank you for the great documentation and video tutorial
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 09:34:03 GMT):<br/>
I saw that  in your video you have the kafka orderer files
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 09:34:35 GMT):<br/>
Can you share kafka based ordering service kubernete files if possible
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 10:03:11 GMT):<br/>
@gentios sorry about that, kafka cluster is not work as intended so far, thus we remove it from the fling, however, my colleague is doing this work recently, I will let you know immediately if he got any progress. 
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 10:07:54 GMT):<br/>
ok thank you @Luke_Chen  
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 10:08:02 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>SwatiRaj</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 11:20:36 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen  it was working without tls , but I want it to work with tls enabled.
</p>
<p><strong>SwatiRaj</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 11:22:20 GMT):<br/>
@daygee   Hey I already changed the name in configtx and it is working without tls , but with TLS , I need certificates for orderer-example-com , which cryptogen tool doesnt provide because the format in which cryptogen tool create certs is in 
</p>
<p><strong>SwatiRaj</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 11:22:41 GMT):<br/>
<hostname>.<domainname>
</p>
<p><strong>SwatiRaj</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 11:23:09 GMT):<br/>
and I dont want any dot in the domain, because kubernetes doenot allow it . 
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 14:09:31 GMT):<br/>
guys, with what tool have you generated the docker files into kubernetes
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 14:09:36 GMT):<br/>
while searching I saw this tool
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 14:09:37 GMT):<br/>
http://kompose.io/
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 14:56:34 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 15:05:20 GMT):<br/>
@SwatiRaj I see your problem
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 15:26:09 GMT):<br/>
thanks @daygee 
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 15:27:11 GMT):<br/>
or you can always just do it yourself... :smirk: 
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 15:27:38 GMT):<br/>
those tools may not get your config perfectly anyway
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 15:30:45 GMT):<br/>
yes I will see the both ways
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 15:31:00 GMT):<br/>

@Luke_Chen, if for example I don't want to run in vSphere and just use an Amazon EC3 for example. I'll have to create a NFS there right ?
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Fri, 24 Nov 2017 10:43:54 GMT):<br/>
I'll have to create a shared NFS/Amazon EFS, and than in a EC2/Kubernetes Pods 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Sat, 25 Nov 2017 12:37:38 GMT):<br/>
@gentios this might be relevant for you. I'm currently attempting to drop the nfs server and use ConfigMaps bound to a persistentVolume to store the chain's configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Sat, 25 Nov 2017 12:37:53 GMT):<br/>
That way you wouldn't have to create an NFS server.

<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 09:45:30 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 09:46:45 GMT):<br/>
I can't seem to understand why, but the orderer throws an error : Principal deserialization failure (The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority) for identity

<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 15:57:35 GMT):<br/>
@daygee Have you tried regenerate all certificates?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 16:08:24 GMT):<br/>
I think @LordGoodman means you could replace NFS with other shared storage solutions, since kubernetes support many of them. please refer this link https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 17:36:01 GMT):<br/>
that was my first guess but I checked all the certificates on the crypto-config folder and none of them match the one throwing exception

<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 02:49:17 GMT):<br/>
@daygee Where did you put all these certificates ? Did you use any shared storage solution?
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 06:34:51 GMT):<br/>
yes, after generating, I copied to a shared folder
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 07:04:52 GMT):<br/>
I checked an ssh decoder and the certificate is being generated for example.com meanwhile I have modified my configtx such that domain is no longer example.com for peer orgs and orderer
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 07:56:29 GMT):<br/>

meanwhile, we mount the NFS /opt/share folder to local /opt/share folder

@Luke_Chen  yes I noticed that now and I will fix it
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 09:34:33 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 09:34:50 GMT):<br/>
can I run this in the master node ?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 09:38:51 GMT):<br/>
Of course, since you have made master node schedulable.

Hey guys, we have finished the blog about how to deploy Hyperledger Fabric on Kubernetes, if you want to deploy Fabric on pure Kubernetes environment, this will be a good place to start https://medium.com/@zhanghenry/how-to-deploy-hyperledger-fabric-on-kubernetes-2-751abf44c807 thanks.

<p><strong>vsadriano</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 17:45:01 GMT):<br/>
Ok. It's great! How can I use "**unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock"**" on  **CORE_VM_ENDPOINT** if my container user is non root? Any idea?

I am using this command to install the chaincode 
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 14:32:43 GMT):<br/>
```peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/channel-artifacts/chaincode_example02
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 14:33:14 GMT):<br/>
you need to create a chaincode_example02 dir under  channel-artifacts, and `mv` chaincode_example02.go to chaincode_example02 dir

@gentios By the way, we are deploying fling v1.1 which will contain some new features like blockchain-explorer, kafka cluster and more flexiable way to define a fabric cluster, I will contact you once it was finished,  maybe you could help us to refine some documents :) 
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 14:45:56 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen ofcourse I would be happy to contribute

<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Thu, 07 Dec 2017 15:06:46 GMT):<br/>
firstly I tried with a daemon.json in ```/etc/docker/daemon.json

but that threw me some errors

now I am trying with /etc/default/docker with DOCKER_OPTS

@gentios I am following this tutorial to setup using kubernetes . http://www.think-foundry.com/deploy-hyperledger-fabric-on-kubernetes-part-2/   . This article assumes that we already setup kubernetes between multiple hosts right ? Any other tutorial you would recommend me?

<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 01:37:51 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid  If you need some articles to setup kubernetes, you better take a look of their website https://kubernetes.io/
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 01:41:37 GMT):<br/>
@gentios After restarted the docker service, you can use command `ps -aux | grep docker` to check weather your config has been commited in docker daemon

with what tool ?

Hey guys, has anyone deployed fabric on on-premises kubernetes? 
I have created the whole network (2 orgs + 1 orderer org), but when I create a chaincode (with composer), the container (with the chaincode) cannot connect to the kubernetes peer nodes. I have also setup dokcer host (that is the kubernetes worker node) with --dns and --dns-search that will match the kubernetes DNS service. Any idea how to bypass this issue? What should I set in the docker engine? Is there something else that I am missing?

@Katiyman The parameters are not relevant if you are not running any command from the containers itself. They are just ENV Variable holders, so when you run `peer create` or `peer join` you will already have the needed ENV VARs in the background and the commands are executed based on that.

Hi everyone
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 13:39:40 GMT):<br/>
so I have a 1 peer- 1 org network up on kubernetes
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 13:39:49 GMT):<br/>
can create channel
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 13:39:53 GMT):<br/>
join channel
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 13:39:58 GMT):<br/>
install chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 13:40:07 GMT):<br/>
but I can't instantiate chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 13:40:57 GMT):<br/>
I believe the issue is in the way the peer tries to pull fabric-ccenv image from public docker repo
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 13:41:40 GMT):<br/>

<br/><a href="./assets/N49aJWYbcpjcxQdEG-Clipboard - December 20, 2017 2:41 PM">Clipboard - December 20, 2017 2:41 PM</a>
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 13:43:05 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking I can maybe find out how to configure the peer to pull the image from my company repo as trying to pull from an external repo always fails
</p>
<p><strong>luminance</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 13:48:40 GMT):<br/>
@daygee That means that the dev-* containers are up and running and connected with to the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 14:02:54 GMT):<br/>
the dev container never gets created
</p>
<p><strong>luminance</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 14:09:50 GMT):<br/>
@daygee You need to setup the docker host Daemon config to refer to the Kubernetes DNS service IP address:
```
kubectl get svc --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE     NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)         AGE

kube-system   kubernetes-dashboard   ClusterIP   10.99.197.193   <none>        443/TCP         1m

}

```
And the, reload the reload the docker daemon. for the new config to take place and restart docker service:
`systemctl daemon-reload` and `systemctl restart docker`

@daygee BTW, I am stuck on the same issue. The container gets created, but it never connects to the kubernetes virtual network of the namespaces.
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 14:15:12 GMT):<br/>
so docker points to kubernetes to deploy the containers?
</p>
<p><strong>luminance</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 14:20:22 GMT):<br/>
@daygee Well, because the instantiating of a chaincode actually creates a new container on the Docker host, but that container is not connected to the Kubernetes network(namespace) in which your org/peer exists. So the only way is for the newly created container to communicate with the peer is to set-up the DNS.
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 14:21:10 GMT):<br/>
okay, I understand
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 14:21:51 GMT):<br/>
so when you set up the dns, [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=LaNZ9ht9YWAJEb3Me) @luminance this became your issue?
</p>
<p><strong>luminance</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 14:27:32 GMT):<br/>
@daygee Probably. I am not sure what is the issue actually. That is why I asked few question here and on #fabric channel, but with no avail.

Hello 
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:40:29 GMT):<br/>
I've been thinking about the instantiation of chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:40:35 GMT):<br/>
and how problematic it is
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:42:46 GMT):<br/>
I was wondering, isn't it possible for the peer pod to create a ccenv pod in kubernetes, rather than create a docker container on the node
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:43:08 GMT):<br/>
or at least make it an option
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:48:09 GMT):<br/>
@daygee no such option so far, the only way to created a cc container is by docker daemon of the node rather than kubernetes api.
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:49:02 GMT):<br/>
is there any potential that it will be a task to do?
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:50:26 GMT):<br/>
I ask because it seems like too much work from a dev ops point of view to have to manage the kube-dns for each node
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:51:19 GMT):<br/>
also, in the event a peer dies and is recreated in another node, because kubernetes doesn't know about the container, someone has to go shut it down in that node
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:51:50 GMT):<br/>
and if the node the new peer has been created on will have to be configured
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:51:50 GMT):<br/>
and then the node the new peer has been created on will have to be configured
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:54:02 GMT):<br/>
whereas, kubernetes manages all this for you
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 11:01:32 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I can't agree with you point any more,  which is a huge disadvantage for deploying Fabric on kubernetes so far.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 11:09:45 GMT):<br/>
meanwhile, I am sure it should be a good idea to add feature like supporting kubernetes in Fabric code, however I have not seen any process related to this job so far.
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 11:17:17 GMT):<br/>
I'm actually looking at the instantiation code right now
</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 11:17:29 GMT):<br/>
want to see how it's working

Hello, all! I'm facing some chaincode problems when running Fabric on K8S with more than one peer:
I'm starting a network with two orgs, each one with two peers (with their couchdb) and CA, and a solo orderer. I instantiate the chaincode using a peer from Org1 and when I query from Org2 I get:
`Error: Error endorsing query: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = chaincode error (status: 500, message: {"Error":"Nil amount for a"}) - <nil>`
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 17:50:03 GMT):<br/>
And after some time (e.g. 3 hours), without using the network, when I try to query, another error:
`Error: Error endorsing query: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = could not find chaincode with name '12jan1' - make sure the chaincode 12jan1 has been successfully instantiated and try again - <nil>`
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 17:50:59 GMT):<br/>
The commands are being executed on a `fabric-tools` container. When we run the peers using containers over VMs, outside K8S, it works.
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 17:51:07 GMT):<br/>
Any tips?

@joaquimpedrooliveira  can you find the chaincode container on worker node after the chaincode was instantiated ?
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 14:52:49 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen , actually we don't have direct access to nodes due to company policies. I'll ask the team responsible for maintaining the nodes. What's your hypotesis?

</p>

Because chaincode container will be created by docker daemon of worker node directly, which is not maintained by kubernetes. 
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 15:03:49 GMT):<br/>
make sure your worker nodes have add kube-dns in their DOCKER_OPTS
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 15:07:30 GMT):<br/>
I think you chaincode wasn't instantiated correctly.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 15:07:30 GMT):<br/>
I think the reason that your chaincode wasn't instantiated correctly is the chaincode container failed to start.

My aim with the re-write is to do the following:
- Do not require an NFS-server (Done)
  - I fixed this by using ConfigMaps and secrets.
- Fix fabric sym-link issue (Done)
  - I wrote a general purpose initContainer which simply copies the any Volume mounted to a path X to path Y. In this case it copies the data from the ConfigMaps/Secrets into a PersitentVolume. This is a work-around until the issue with sym-links is fixed.
- Get all of this working in MiniKube (Semi-Done)
  - So far I have PeerOrganizations working. I still need to get OrdererOrganizations functioning but I expect to finish this by the end of the week.
- Get Chaincode running in the cluster (TODO)
  - I still need to do this and I expect I will need some help with it. As I've heard that Fabric does some funky things with creating a Docker container for the Chaincode. I read this requires DNS settings, unfortunately I'm not familiar witht his. So I will probably need your help with that.

Hi all, I am setting up hyperledger fabric with kubernetes using minikube as worker node, but though after changing docker dns seems chaincode container can not be deployed, my docker config file is {
  "dns" : [
    "10.96.0.10",
    "192.168.99.100"
  ],
  "dns-search" : [
    "org1-f-1.svc.cluster.local",

Hello! If I understand correctly, communications between the worker nodes and the master node on the kubernetes network are done through the API server, so basically the master node sort of controls all the activity going on in the network? But if I want to send up my kubernetes network on multiple worker nodes (e.g. one VM for each organization), would it be possible to invoke a transaction through the worker nodes themselves, or do I need to go through the master node no matter what?

Have anyone tried setup hyperledger fabric with minikube on local one successfully?
</p>
<p><strong>Taffies</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 08:45:05 GMT):<br/>
Hello! If I understand correctly, all communication between the master & worker node is done via the apiserver & kubelet. Right now, I'm invoking transactions from within the CLI pod of each org from my master node. However, I want to set up my network such that there is one master node and one worker node for the pods of each organization that I'm creating, and be able to invoke transactions from outside the master node, specifically from a webapp.

I've got a few questions regarding this:
1. Do you all have have any suggestions on the best way to go about doing this? (I've tried to find tutorials on how to invoke externally but many of the pages doesn't really go in-depth into this topic)
2. My current set-up is based on the fact that I want each org to be able to own their own node.. Kinda like decentralising the network & for redundancy purposes? Do you think this is a good idea, or is it redundant?
3. In Kubernetes, if all requests go through the APIserver on the master node.. doesn't it make the entire network centralised?

PS: Relatively new to all of this so I'm dealing with quite a lot of confusion on my part. Sorry if I've got any concepts wrong! :P

<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 02:37:41 GMT):<br/>
for invoking transactions from external, you should define a nodePort type service for pods, mapping ports of pod to ports of node(worker)
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 02:39:06 GMT):<br/>
and then access service that running in pod by address worker_ip:port
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 02:42:37 GMT):<br/>
due to the network proxy of kubenetes, you can use any node_ip as worker_ip in your cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 02:43:00 GMT):<br/>
node_ip = ip of node :)
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 02:46:52 GMT):<br/>
meanwhile, I don't think kubenetes can do this, it schedules pods according to load balance `2. My current set-up is based on the fact that I want each org to be able to own their own node.. Kinda like decentralising the network & for redundancy purposes? Do you think this is a good idea, or is it redundant? `

@Luke_Chen Ok thanks so much! I'll play around with the nodePort type service and see if I can externally invoke it successfully. One quick clarification - in the tutorial, it states that the port of the ordererN is defined as 33700 + N, but it's defined as 32000 + N in the config files. Is this a typo?

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 20:21:42 GMT):<br/>
@antoniovassell I followed a lot of the work by @Luke_Chen . With some minor exceptions. First, I've build some code to transform an Organizations' directory into ConfigMaps and Secrets (where applicable). Second, I'm also creating a bit of code which will generate a Job to: 1. create a Channel, 2. Join x amount of peers to said channel 3. Install chaincode on those peers. 4. (this is the dirty part) listen to the hostPaths unix socket for docker then a. If an image is created via the docker socket, pick up on that and push the image to a repository y. 5. Then launch a deployment which uses that image to run a container. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 20:23:15 GMT):<br/>
Now this is just the theory of course. I'm bound to bump into some roadblocks. I'm about to test steps 1 through 3 to see if that works.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 20:24:16 GMT):<br/>
I want to release a pre-alpha soon. So people can have a go at it. So far I've only tested on Minikube. But I'm working on some ideas so that users can define custom targets for the cluster.
</p>
<p><strong>tupt</strong> (Sat, 27 Jan 2018 07:55:32 GMT):<br/>
I did it using kubernetes api, first instantiate with 1 second timeout to make sure image created, then redo it while peer is waiting for container to connect, then it worked
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Sat, 27 Jan 2018 09:26:24 GMT):<br/>

very nice, it is automation using kubeapi, I used api pod with node sdk to do that

@Luke_Chen It doesn't. I'm using the godaddy kubernetes-client to do the things I need. https://github.com/godaddy/kubernetes-client

Hi team,

I have set up the Blockchain network by following the simple install instructions from  https://ibm-blockchain.github.io/simple/ 

Everything works fine and I could use composer playground , deploy business network and test and perform transactions. 

However after a week or later, the same business network connection is failing with error:

0|composer |     at /home/composer/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/@ibmblockchain/composer-playground/node_modules/grpc/src/node/src/client.js:554:15 
0|composer | HLFConnection           :queryChainCode()         Error: Error trying to query business network. Error: Failed to deserialize creator identity, err MSP Org1MSP is unknown 


Then I have observed that Peer1 is not listing the channel "channel1" which it joined earlier. "peer channel list" command from peer1 / org1 is not listing channel.
Where as the same command from Org2 Peer1 list the channlel - "channel1".

We haven't peformed any operations on kubernetes cluster / blockchain apart from accessing Composer Playground.

As per my understanding the unknown MSP ID error is thrown because the peer is not joined the channel. But I am not sure the reason why Org1 Peer1 is not part of the channel anymore 
where it joined the same channel initially and we were able to deploy bna and invoke, etc.

What is causing the peer to not part of the channel  ? Is it becuase of some pod restart (not sure if it happened ) ?  

This behaviour  has been observed couple of times so far and we are recreating the n/w everytime. 

Please provide some inputs if you come across this scenario and what steps we should verify and take care to handle this behavior.

Thanks,
Indira

Hi, I got this error when i invoke using the invoke.js file in fabcar. 
```
Failed to invoke successfully :: Error: There was a problem with the eventhub ::Error: 14 UNAVAILABLE: Connect Failed
```
The default port for the event hub in the fabcar example is 7053. I am currently deploying my fabric on kubernetes. My peer0org1 maps 7051:30001 and 7052:30002. I tried setting to either of these ports but it still didnt work. What should i set my port to?

Hi everyone, i'm trying to setup a fabric network with kafka cluster, everyting in the same kubernetes cluster. I have deployed kafka previously as 4 brokers, each one as a separate deployment, now im tryng to deploy it using statefulsets. Now i'm having this issue when setting up the orderer. It crashes when it is trying to connect to the kafka cluster. I'm exposing the kafka cluster as a headless service at port 9092 and in the configtx.yaml is declaring a unique broker pointing at the headless service. The orderer crashes when trying to get an IP. I think it is something of the headless service and maybe it is not supported. I'm posting the output of the crash.

@vanitas92 Which could provider are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:22:58 GMT):<br/>
or they are local kubernetes cluster?
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:28:29 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen Everything (the orderer and the kafka cluster) are in the same local kubernetes cluster and in the same namespace
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:29:01 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen im using calico as the network plugin

<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:29:53 GMT):<br/>
can it work in solo mode？
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:31:50 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen yes it work as solo mode and also in kafka mode but as the cluster set up as 4 different deployments. Now im trying to recreate the kafka cluster as statefulset with 4 replicas
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:33:28 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen if you look at the output images, the ordere is resolving correctly the DNS of the kafka cluster, first pointing at the headless service endpoint, and then discovering the 4 brokers
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:34:16 GMT):<br/>
yes, I saw that

Hey guys, for those who are interested. I'm planning on publishing my Fabric Kubernetes project some time next week. Both on Github and on NPM.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:40:44 GMT):<br/>
I'm hoping people on Linux can test it out for me (Windows user here).
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:41:38 GMT):<br/>
Essentially it's a CLI that allows you to create Kuberenetes configuration from Blockchain configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:42:38 GMT):<br/>
Source is written in ES6 and it runs on Node.js.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:44:18 GMT):<br/>
For now it only supports Minikube as a deployment target however I'm working on some code to allow any target the user wants.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:44:43 GMT):<br/>

I just uploaded a java sdk wrapper with a Fabric kubernetes minikube for local development. It is located at https:github.com/t-snyder/fabric-dev . Contents are Docker and Kubernetes deployments for 4 Fabric Peers, a solo Orderer, CLI, a Kafka / Zookeeper cluster for messaging in/out, and an sdk-wrapper service for each org. Its purpose is more around being able to set up a local dev environment. I appreciate all feedback. The doc is located in the setup-dev/doc directory.

`peer channel join -b channel.block` -> `failed to create new connection: x509: certificate is valid for peer0.org1, peer0, not peer0-org1` -- how do you all deal with the discrepancy between the standard `<peer X>.<org domain>` and the way kubernetes services are named (no periods allowed, so everything is hyphenated instead)
</p>
<p><strong>ublubu</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 05:14:57 GMT):<br/>
specifically, @tsnyder, i'm looking at https://github.com/t-snyder/fabric-dev/blob/8548ef08bed94ae378b57c10ff803e1c210fd0f0/setup-dev/kube/peer0.yaml#L152 , where the `peer0.Org1` service is called `peer0-org1`.

i found that `peer channel join -b channel.block` works if i name the peer's service `peer0` instead of `peer0-org1`, but if `Org2` also has a `peer0`, i can't name both peers `peer0`.
</p>

re: my first question from last night. i'm guessing that having the peer service named `peer0-org1` works because CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED is false. is that right?

Hi guys, I have set up fabric using kubernetes and the fabric SDK for node.js to talk to the blockchain. I am testing the performance of fabric by timing the start of invoking a single transaction on node A to the end of quering the same transaction on node B. I wrote a shell script to run the invoke.js and query.js in the fabcar sample. The result was 3.9 seconds for the writing and reading to complete. 
I have 2 questions:
1. Am i testing it correctly? Is that the right way to calculate tx per second? Fabric is said to be able to do 3500 tx per second and ethereum is able to do 15 tx per second. Should I be pushing 10,000 or more transactions to the blockchain and see how long it takes and divide 10,000 by time taken?
2. Why does it take 3.9 seconds to invoke and query using the node.js sdk? Is it because of the javascript code or the authentication takes sometime?

@ublubu - If you look at the command file - setup-dev/fabric-gen/channel-join.sh you will see the commands I am using to join the channels. These are run from within the CLI container as described within the doc.
</p>
<p><strong>tsnyder</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 12:39:08 GMT):<br/>
@ublubu - yes TLS is turned off. All of the network DNS is done within the kubernetes environment for the Peers, Orderers, CouchDB, sdk, etc., via the services.

Hi guys, I would like to know how to handle the restart of a peer pod so that it recovers automatically after a crash in kubernetes. By recovering i mean, join the channels it was previously joined before the crash, recover the installation of chaincodes previously installed and instantiate or invoke the chaincodes installed. I think one way is using persistent volume at path `/var/hyperledger/` of containers. Is this the best way or are there others that are better? Let me know! Thank you all guys, you rock!
</p>
<p><strong>ublubu</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 18:26:02 GMT):<br/>
thanks, @tsnyder. i got it working yesterday. the key for me was to make sure TLS was turned off everywhere and to configure Docker to use kube-dns.

there are many problems with deploying hyperledger on kubernetes, including docker images sharing, host resolving... for easy installation stuff, I think you can use expect or sshpass to automate the synchronization between nodes like save and load image, and share host file(map ip to hostname) then start like normal setup.

Not quite sure I agree with this comment?  Can you provide more details about issues you are seeing?
Of course chaincode deployment *can* be an issue.
And if you are trying to run an entire network (multiple orgs, etc) / sandbox things might be a little tricky (although this is just standard stuff to make distributed things communicate).
If you are simply trying to deploy a peer or an ordering service, not sure there are many issues

Hi All, I have been playing around with Hyperledger to make it run on Kubernetes. And I was successful to do so. The only thing which I was not happy with the solution for the container that was spun up when chaincode is instantiated by the peer. Kubernetes is simply not aware of this container as it was not started by Kubernetes and by the peer. And to make the peer and chaincode talk to each other I had to update the docker daemon running on the kubernetes node with dns server ip address of the kube-dns service.

Is it possible to instantiate a chaincode in a way where kubernetes is aware of the container of the chaincode. And also chaincode container is able to talk to peer in a seamless fashion rather than updating docker daemon process of the node within kubernetes cluster

I'm setting up HLF on Kubernetes (using Azure AKS), but get stuck at the point of creating a channel from a host:

peer channel create -o 10.0.69.21:31010 -c composerchannel -f /shared/composer-channel.tx

```
2018-03-19 16:50:15.657 UTC [msp] GetLocalMSP -> DEBU 001 Returning existing local MSP
2018-03-19 16:50:15.658 UTC [msp] GetDefaultSigningIdentity -> DEBU 002 Obtaining default signing identity
Error: failed to create deliver client: orderer client failed to connect to 10.0.69.21:31010: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded
```

Installing ping on the host, and trying to ping related services, I'm only able to ping the IP/DNS of the Peer container, but not that of the Orderer, etc., even though I can easily ssh into each of these from outside.

Has anyone faced similar pod to pod connectivity issues, and how have you resolved them?

Thanks!

@Varun2887 I'm working on getting a kubernetes cluster working on AWS right now.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:41:02 GMT):<br/>
I've build a tool called Kubechain which transforms blockchain congfiguration to kubernetes configuration. It's pre-alpha right now but you can check it out either way: https://www.npmjs.com/package/kubechain
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:41:31 GMT):<br/>
It's build using NodeJS so it should work regardless of which platform you're working on.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:42:11 GMT):<br/>
Source can be found here: https://github.com/kubechain/kubechain
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:43:36 GMT):<br/>
The main reason I build the tool is because all other tools I could find were highly complex for such a simple thing and didn't work on Windows.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:46:15 GMT):<br/>
For example I can't use Cello because it requires `make` to build a Master node. Which is not available under windows unless I have a VS Studio license or I install something to mimic that functionality.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:49:45 GMT):<br/>
Both of which are undesirable. Personally I feel that using a Makefile to build a supposedly cross-platform application is a big mistake. Since it provides a barrier to people who want to test/build on platforms other than Linux.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:52:30 GMT):<br/>
Fabric also uses a Makefile and so does Burrow. I don't think it would be that much effort to use a go file to build the source especially since go is cross-platform and Makefiles are not.

Hello team! 
I’m currently deploying an HLF blockchain on a K8s cluster. But I have some trouble to instantiate a chaincode : when I run my ` peer chaincode instantiate` command I have the following error `Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Timeout expired while starting chaincode `
Did someone experienced this before ? 
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 14:44:16 GMT):<br/>
@MonnyClara It may caused by the dns resolve error
</p>
<p><strong>MonnyClara</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 14:45:52 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=ER9ne24QkKP37awRv) @Luke_Chen Even if they can ping each other ? I mean that peer1.org1 can ping peer1.org2 ?
So I supposed that the dns resolution was okey ... I'm going to re-check ! 
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 14:48:13 GMT):<br/>
When you instantiate a chaincode, the chaincode container will be created by docker daemon, which is out of kubernetes

<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 13:58:55 GMT):<br/>
Hello, everybody. We're running Fabric over Kubernetes and an update in Kubernetes apparently impacted in chaincode instantiation. After upgrading to kubernetes `1.7.15` chaincode instantation started to fail with message: 
```Failed to generate platform-specific docker build: Error returned from build: 1 "can't load package: package chaincode/chaincode_example02: cannot find package
```
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 13:59:55 GMT):<br/>
The chaincode file exists and is mounted as a `config-map` . We noticed that this k8s version introduced a change that mounts `config-maps` as a **read-only** filesystem, that seems to be error cause.
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 14:00:38 GMT):<br/>
When we added the chaincode to be part of docker image, and stopped using the configmap, it worked.
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 14:01:39 GMT):<br/>
I cannot see why the "cli" pod needs write access to the chaincode dir
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 14:02:15 GMT):<br/>
Another test that worked was to log into the pod and move the chaincode file to a new dir, created in another volume with read/write permissions
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 14:02:53 GMT):<br/>
Any tips why chaincode instantiation needs to have write acccess to the "CLI"/fabric-tools filesystem?

</p>
<p><strong>daygee</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 14:35:23 GMT):<br/>
so whenever the instantiation command is called, the peer tries to pull form docker repo directly
but it can't because connection will be refused
I want to know if there was a way to configure the peer to change where it pulls the ccenv image from when instantiating

@Taffies Yeah ! I have the same issue, everytime a peer container is crashing, you have to re-join and re-install .. A way to fix this ?

@monnyclara mine doesn't even crash. the next morning i wake up and log in to my VM and the pod is still running perfectly fine, but i just need to rejoin and reinstall again. i can't figure out why

@ascatox I've made a NodeJS CLI that installs Fabric on either Minikube or GCE.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 10:20:46 GMT):<br/>
Check it out here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/kubechain

I'm currently working on expanding the feature set.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 10:22:26 GMT):<br/>
Right now it only creates a very basic Fabric cluster but that should suffice for testing.
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 15:05:27 GMT):<br/>
This sounds really interesting!!! I'll try it

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 16:11:29 GMT):<br/>
Please do. Don't be afraid to post a bug-report if you find anything. I might not be able to solve it that fast but I'll try :D :thumbsup:

does anyone else face the problem where your peer keeps having to rejoin channel & installing chaincode on them even though your pods haven't crashed at all? or any idea why that might be happening?

<p><strong>MonnyClara</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 15:12:46 GMT):<br/>
@ascatox  With this kind a setup, if your pod is crashing all your peer will crash too right ? If so, we got a single point of failure I think .. 
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 15:13:59 GMT):<br/>
ok but if I have 1000 clients making transactions to the blockchain how I can improve the load on my peers ?
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 15:15:31 GMT):<br/>
if I'm not wrong at the moment the address of the peer is static, every client should connect to a peer and knows its address
</p>
<p><strong>ascatox</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 15:15:31 GMT):<br/>
Which version ???
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 23:36:50 GMT):<br/>
You should use a service to loadbalance to the set of peers, but this will only work if your endorsement policy requires a single peer.

I found a work around for the Docker container issue and having to reboot your nodes as mentioned in https://hackernoon.com/how-to-deploy-hyperledger-fabric-on-kubernetes-1-a2ceb3ada078 . All you have to do is supply the tool with the cluster you intend to run on. It than adds the Kube-dns IP correctly, without requiring a reboot.

Hi all!! I'm working in developing a simple Fabric application using the Node SDK on Kubernetes. Firstly, I've deployed a custom kubernetes cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine and created a simple network using this repo from steps 4 and 5 (https://github.com/IBM/blockchain-network-on-kubernetes). Note: I skip the IBM Cloud Steps because I'm using my own cluster. 

After the deployment, I'm able to perform invokes/queries inside one peer, without problem. However, if I use the Node SDK (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.1/fabcar) I'm only able to perform enroll/register and queries. The invoke requests fail. Do you have any idea?

Hi all, I'm trying to build MULTIPLE orderers on Kafka on Kubernetes. I've build 2 ORGs with 2 PEERs per 1 ORG, 3 Zoo, 4 Kaffa and 2 Orderer and I think the procress looks like this:
- Each ORG will choose a PEER that connects to 1 Orderer to create a channel calling _mychannel_. In my case, I configured PEER0-ORG1 to Orderer0 and PEER0-ORG2 to Orderer1
- Then, each PEER will join the channel via the Orderer corresponding to its own ORG
- Finally, updating the anchor peer for ORGs
But, I'm in trouble at step one when trying to create channel :) Anyone can help me, please?

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 07:26:16 GMT):<br/>
@alexvicegrab Nice! I've been waiting for someone to do this. Feel free to take a look at my tool if you run into some issues: https://www.npmjs.com/package/kubechain . It's fully functional for 1.0.x. I use configMaps/secrets to mount certificates in my containers and copy them into a PV instead of using NFS or some other form of storage. I did so because it would allow certificate updates to be processed immediately in 1.1.x. Since 1.0.x doesn't follow sym-links for certificates. Either way hope you find something useful in there :D /
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 10:09:01 GMT):<br/>
@RobertDiebels, cool, I did check out your tool early on, awesome that you are also doing work on this front.
We also use configMaps and secrets for a number of the certificates (the ones relating to Organisations). Hopefully we can learn from each other and improve both tools :D
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 10:28:26 GMT):<br/>
@alexvicegrab yea that would be great! I'd love to chuck out the kubernetes resource generation part and just feed the configuration into the helm files. That would save me a boatload of maintenance :P
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 10:29:50 GMT):<br/>
Cool, feel free to use and contribute to my charts, which are created for the resource generation, but not for the coordination between them. That might be a good division of labour for collaborating :)

The file I linked above should contain a property called `options` with an object and another property `chaincodes` which should hold an empty Array.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=WJ5SzYebqR4apuxXH) @Nghiadt Ive tried one way but you have to enable dev mode on your chaincodes to do so. I do not reccomend this approach and its not suitable for dynamic upgrades or instantiation of new chaincodes. I wait until the dev team at hyperledger comes a good way of adding this feature. I follow this issue in jira which they discuss a way of approaching this but since february there is no activity: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7406

@vanitas92  I've just added two vars env. You can try it
`- name: CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE # The server name use this name to verify the hostname returned by TLS handshake`
              `value: <your-server-hostname>`
            `- name: CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT # PEER exposes its dynamic IP`

Hello All, Just a quick question ??? Having Fabric on Kubernetes is possible and but last time I tried for the settings I used, I was able install and instantiate chaincode and transact with same. But the container for chaincode was not visible to Kubernetes and so not managed by it... Is there a way to have chaincode and their versions now visible and managed by Kubernetes ???

@govinda-attal To my knowledge not yet ! But I know that some issues have been opened in Jira about this. 
As I remember, the idea is about being able to tell Fabric if the chaincode must be instantiated on the docker daemon or on K8s.

@vanitas92 Nope, Just 2 options. Your chaincode cannot connect again to its peer because Docker DNS cannot reverse the peer IP from peer hostname. So, you have 2 options, configure docker host to find peer IP from its hostname or expose its IP. 
In my case, I choose the second one.  Setting
`CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT=true` the peer will automate expose its real IP for us instead of its hostname. And you use `CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE='peer-host-name'` for your TLS option.

@vanitas92 Nope, Just 2 options. Your chaincode cannot connect again to its peer because Docker DNS cannot reverse the peer IP from peer hostname. So, you have 2 options, configure docker host to find peer IP from its hostname or expose its IP from the beginning.

`CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT=true` the peer will automate expose its real IP for us instead of its hostname. And you use `CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE='peer-host-name'` for your TLS option.

Hi All Just need one clarification on fabric-ca example in fabric-sample folder. I used fabric-ca example to create certificates via fabric Certificate Authority. After successfully running it, 1 orderer, 1 ca, 2 peers and 1 chaincode containers are started successfully. My Question is that Is it possible to deploy all this container services to kubernetes using *KOMPOSE *tool by converting the docker-compose.yaml file to kubernetes resources??
</p>

"Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to execute transaction: timeout expired while executing transaction"

Hi Everyone, Is there any support yet to run chaincode in kubernetes pod rather than docker container in any version of hyperledger. I want to run chaincode in pod for clustering of chaincode to achieve run fabric network in fault tolerance manner??
Or there is any process to run chaincode container in all peers of an organisation running on different machine . Because it run by peer on same machine as peers running in docker container.

I asked this in general - not knowing this channel existed. This might be a better forum for it - although the activity here is pretty limited.

Anyone have experience using kubernetes with docker in a mac? Version 18.06.0-ce-mac70 (26399) using Kubernetes: v1.10.3 
I'm having trouble getting it to recognize a PVC with a local NFS.
The NFS is fine - it mounts ok in a terminal as expected. The PV looks good. The PVC looks good. 
When I go to deploy though the pod pulls this - ```Unable to mount volumes for pod "blockchain-org1peer1-56ffc95965-8n6nz_default(a131c320-a640-11e8-ba48-025000000001)": timeout expired waiting for volumes to attach or mount for pod "default"/"blockchain-org1peer1-56ffc95965-8n6nz". list of unmounted volumes=[sharedvolume]. list of unattached volumes=[sharedvolume default-token-7z9gr]``` 

I'm thinking it's a problem with NFS inside ~this~ type of install but kubernetes isn't my chosen specialist subject. Anyone hit this?

@Luke_Chen have you explored configmaps, secrets, and network policies inypur kubernetes environment?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 19:38:02 GMT):<br/>
In our kubernetes environment we were able to remove dependencies on NFS which made things much more flexible for GKE deployments
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 19:40:17 GMT):<br/>
My current effort of modifying the peer and chaincode process to natively support kubernetes for workload scheduling seems like a very promising path for making fabric work well on kubernetes, especially in secure, production, managed cloud environments. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 19:45:22 GMT):<br/>
Also @Luke_Chen you may want to look into using stateful sets for peers... the consistency guarantees offered by k8s and the naming/dns were very helpful for me when setting things up with more peer instances.

<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 06:37:32 GMT):<br/>
Hello everyone! The newly introduced service discovery in latest release has arised some questions about the best approach on how to deploy the latest version on k8s. Should we use the statefulset for deploying the components of an hyperledger fabric network (peers, orderer) and use headless service so the service discovery is handled by the application or should we stick with deployments and non headless services? Has anyone had some experience with that approach? Thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 08:53:46 GMT):<br/>
Using a StatefulSet mean you can't use ConfigMaps or Secrets properly since you can only mount them into the entire set instead of one Pod. Same goes for mounting other volumes they're shared across the set afaik.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 08:56:54 GMT):<br/>
So if you'd want to mount a certificate into only one Pod that's a no-go.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 08:56:54 GMT):<br/>
So if you'd want to mount a single certificate as a ConfigMap/Secret into one Pod only that's a no-go.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:14:26 GMT):<br/>
In my case the certificates are installed on the peers specific volume and are created when that pod joins the pool. You need a stateful set if you care about pod disruption budgets. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:20:11 GMT):<br/>
If you using a set of peers with in a single org for redundancy then having them managed as a logical group is useful because the configuration of that group is handled as a set. Therefore the configmaps and secrets are shared across the group and this is a good thing. Peer specific configuration secrets (certificates mentioned above only) are stored on the peer’s individual data volumes.

</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:29:15 GMT):<br/>
I actually use a combination of Deployments + ConfigMaps/Secrets to mount my certificates.

Yes, that comment was made because I was interested in getting an understanding of how others use kubernetes. Was his post a summary or not. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:31:24 GMT):<br/>
There are many ways to apply the tools in kubernetes... it is especially interesting to hear how others are taking a project which is new and unique and applying it to the environment. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:33:28 GMT):<br/>
Exactly. That's why I thought I'd add to the conversation and provide some info about the Secrets/ConfigMaps + StatefulSet.

I take the long route and copy the ConfigMaps into a Peer specific volume since version 1.0.x doesn't support loading PemMaterial from symlinks.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:35:17 GMT):<br/>
My current focus on removing the direct client docker invocations from the peer platform and chaincode areas is all about making our implementation more kubernetes native. It isn’t as easy to make this software run well in the cloud as I would have liked and the feel I have for it is that the native bare metal install case was taken as the readily approach in design. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:36:16 GMT):<br/>
Haha I know. I've used a 'hack' to fix the chaincode dns issues without altering the dockerconfig on the host.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:36:43 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:37:05 GMT):<br/>
When I explained the chaincode container process to our CISO... his face was pretty priceless. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:37:21 GMT):<br/>
Haha I can imagine xD
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:37:46 GMT):<br/>
I don’t want to leave the wrong impression though. This is good work. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:37:59 GMT):<br/>
Ow yes obviously. But it still has some issues.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:38:08 GMT):<br/>
Our environement and use cases are just custom
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:39:40 GMT):<br/>
The kubernetes controller integration isn’t hard fwiw. I hooked in next to the couple places were the Docker controller library is and use viper for an enable flag, kubernetes client to self configure from ambient environment. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:40:27 GMT):<br/>
Did you create a fork to do this?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:40:33 GMT):<br/>
That does mean that currently I use the default service account in that namespace to schedule pods. But I can add that configuration later. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:40:48 GMT):<br/>
Yes we have an internal fork for this. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:41:11 GMT):<br/>
Think you could contribute the kubernetescontroller? Probably a lot of people who would thank you :P
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:41:19 GMT):<br/>
One of which being myself haha
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:42:08 GMT):<br/>
I believe that Corp policy is that we want to do that. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:42:43 GMT):<br/>
I didn’t replace the Docker controller.  Or make the kubernetes one a complete stand alone. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:43:24 GMT):<br/>
That is too big of a change. There are protobufs hardcoded for Docker as the environment
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:44:04 GMT):<br/>
Ow damn..
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:44:16 GMT):<br/>
I essentially added a kubernetes controller in the model of the Docker one that is there... then modified the existing docker one to detect kubernetes when initializing. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:45:26 GMT):<br/>
In this way when the existing code paths run they follow the Docker paths like normal. Then my code is switched in during the create vm step as appropriate and we use k8s from that point. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:45:29 GMT):<br/>
Still anything could be of value I guess. I don't know how far the work on the kubernetescontroller got.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:45:45 GMT):<br/>
Don't recall the issue I was reading on it either..
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:46:48 GMT):<br/>
The kubernetes controller is self contained and could be a first class citizen like the Docker one. But the changes to support that are bigger than I want on what I expected to be a long running fork for our needs
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:46:59 GMT):<br/>
Found it -> https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7406?jql=text%20~%20%22kubernetes%20controller%22
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:48:49 GMT):<br/>
Yea I can imagine. I had a tough enough time trying to apply the DNS-options so the created docker containers would be able to find the kubernetes network and vice-versa.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:49:15 GMT):<br/>
Don't want to think about a standalone k8s controller
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:56:49 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Very useful thread. Thanks for that. My comments... the approach described of building containers in the cluster is just not going to fly. At that point somewhere the Docker sock is still mounted and we are talking about admin rights level code. My method uses the base images and deploys a tarball into the chaincode pod using the same builder patterns as described. No chaincode specific images
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:58:40 GMT):<br/>
I’m working through the platform side of this process at the moment and the kubernetes job approach to build the chaincode seems like a good concept so far. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:00:19 GMT):<br/>
The points in that thread about not adding dependencies to the core project for kubernetes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I don’t have a choice because the hooks to add this are not present and the existing code is hard coded to use Docker. A future version with support from the core team could add those hooks and push this into a standalone library. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:12:15 GMT):<br/>
I don't see why they shouldn't add dependencies for Kubernetes. Depends on how much they really want to enable deploying to Kubernetes.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:12:52 GMT):<br/>
Afaic it's absolutely preferable to Docker Compose and the like.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:18:15 GMT):<br/>
Docker compose isn’t for production anything. Docker swarm doesn’t really have a future... kubernetes is the cloud agnostic container orchestration solution in open source today... 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:19:44 GMT):<br/>
It seems like there isn’t as much focus on production systems and system design in this project as I would have expected. Lots of effort into the trial and experiment modes... come to think of it, that really reflects the state of this area in industry perfectly. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:20:51 GMT):<br/>
Industry as in SE in general or blockchain-related? Either way I agree.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:21:06 GMT):<br/>
Blockchain specific. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:22:03 GMT):<br/>
Agree. Projects are still young though. So lots of potential for growth and maturing.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:23:03 GMT):<br/>
Which is why the test modes are most important honestly. Running something this dynamic long term in production is going to be a serious endeavor for the next couple years
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:24:50 GMT):<br/>
That all said... my helm charts and minikube give me a full fabric that self-configured and is ready to run in about 2-3min on my MacBook... is an awesome example of development when that exact same chart deploys to GKE scaled up. 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:24:50 GMT):<br/>
I figure they'll get it right. Big corps backing the Hyperledger project so they'll make sure it takes off properly.
</p>

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:28:15 GMT):<br/>
Next week I will have to see if we can get an official word on what the engagement process needs to look like with regards to the open source contributions. As a developer I feel it needs to happen as that is what makes open source work.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:30:34 GMT):<br/>
@Luke_Chen’s blog post looks like a fantastic way to share that can pass the communications office before it goes out. That might end up being the way to get started.

<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 14:12:03 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller @RobertDiebels HI, just saw your conversations and got inspired, beside the Kubernetes controller, we are also facing a mapping problem between domain of certificate and  service name of Kubernetes 
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 14:16:50 GMT):<br/>
Regularly, every peer or orderer has a domain name, but it's difficult to identify those peer or orderer with their domain name in Kubernetes, do you have any solution with this problem?
</p>
<p><strong>Luke_Chen</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 14:22:01 GMT):<br/>
beside the original purpose of using NFS server as shared storage is providing a data backup option for peers and orderers, but afterward we use it to store the certificates :joy:
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 14:38:14 GMT):<br/>
I set the domain of each organization to the namespace it will be in. Kubernetes services then allow DNS mapping to: `<serviceName>.<namspace>:<port>`. I based my design on your initial code so I have DNS-addresses like `peer0.org1:7050`.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 14:40:08 GMT):<br/>
Don't know if that answers your questin. Will need a bit more clarification otherwise :P
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 14:40:08 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 15:02:39 GMT):<br/>
Our peers in statefulsets approach means that the peer will have a consistent hostname of `peer-2` a set name of `peer-n.peer` and a local dns name of `peer-n.peer.namespace.svc.cluster.local` where n is typically `0..2`.  I add these names to our peer certificate as alternates when creating/registering with the ca. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 15:05:49 GMT):<br/>
The suffix search portion of kubernetes dns can be really frustrating as the number of suffixes is limited to 6 for the hosts and cloud environments like GKE add some along with the typical kubernetes ones. The `namespace.svc.cluster.local` is a default one that will be present so we can always find a specific peer using `peer-n.peer` on any host in the namespace.

Trying to set up a peer with couchdb in the same pod.
Having a problem using it with a userid and password
Using the same properties in both containers - 
```
        - name: COUCHDB_USER

        - name: COUCHDB_PASSWORD
          value: peer0password

When it tries to bring the peer up I get "you are not an admin user". 
Same code works fine in base docker - has anyone come across this, and if so what am I missing?

I mentioned about the naming rule of the service's name in Kubernetes, because I don't want to bring such restriction to user,  user should be able to create their organizations with any domain name they want, such like org1.example.com, how do this domain map into the Kubernetes?

more especially, we required traffic among peers and orderes need to be encrypted by TLS protocol, however the TLS certificate signed for a specified peer is format like "peerN.org1.example.com", for example, in peer0, then it will have TLS cert with DN= "peer0.org1.example.com" and Kubernetes service name "peer0-org1".

Then problem is, TLS handshake won't pass when you try to connect a service with domain "peer0-org1", which is mismatched with the DN field specified in the TLS certificate owned by the service.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 07:21:09 GMT):<br/>
If they're going to use org1.example.com they probably own the domain, so you could setup a reverse-proxy like NGinx. Expose NGinx through a LoadBalancer service on a specific IP, direct the domain org1.example.com to that IP and finally setup NGinx configuration so that it maps org1.example.com to the namespace `org1` internally.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 18:25:28 GMT):<br/>
You can change the names added to the certificates used by the peers pretty easily... I reworked the certificate process because kubernetes uses `name-n` for sets instead of `namen` that fabric uses by default.

Yes but DNS-wise you would still be bound by the K8s namespaces etc. I think that Luke meant the domains should be anything the user wants them to be.

I'm trying to do the most simplistic thing possible - load CC onto my peer. I'll excerpt the relevant parts of what I have:

DinD
```
      - name: dind
        image: docker:dind
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/docker
          name: dindmount
``` 

Relevant peer config - pruned:
```
        - name: CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT
          value: "true"
        - name: CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS
          value: 0.0.0.0:7052
        - name: CORE_PEER_EXTERNALENDPOINT
          value: "true"
        - name: CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED
          value: "false"
        - name: CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE
          value: dcn
        - name: CORE_VM_ENDPOINT
          value: http://localhost:2375
        - name: GOPATH
          value: /opt/gopath
        - name: GODEBUG
          value: netdns=go
```

dindmount is persistent

When I run like the above I get a "network dcn not found" error.
When I try removing `- name: CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE
          value: dcn
        ` I get something different that goes wrong.
The API I'm using (java) reports back there's an X509 error - which seems odd because TLS is off and everything else is playing nice afaict.
Adding a `CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE` variable - which I read as a suggestion somewhere - was a dismal failure.

There's a dearth of searchable examples so I'm reduced to trial and error. If anyone can point me to what I have misconfigured I'd be grateful.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 07:32:12 GMT):<br/>
@holzeis I don't know if you resolved your issue. I seem to have missed your question. Here's a possible solution though. If you're using 1.0.x using `peer0-service:7052` should work. If you're using 1.1 or 1.2 you need to set the `peer.chaincodeListenAddress` to `0.0.0.0:7052`. Since the dns-address `peer0-service` is being resolved to `10.108.196.51` which is the IP address of the service. Not the local-IP of the peer-container. You can check the ClusterIP of the service: `peer0-service` to verify that's what's happening. It's either that or the ClusterIP of the Pod the container is running in.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 07:34:45 GMT):<br/>
Also, check that your DNS-address is also using the namespace the service is in. So if the service is named: `peer0-service` and the namespace it is in is named `namespace` the dns-address should be: `peer0-service.namespace:7052` 
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 07:34:45 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 07:35:42 GMT):<br/>
It seems to be resolving an IP-address though so I guess it's at least doing something :P

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=WznH3qrBEoayDcPfS) @aatkddny @aatkddny I need a little bit more specifics on which piece you are having trouble with ... in my environments I have setup my kubernetes deployments to use stateful sets for consistent naming ... this was helpful because pods for peers have consistent naming that is resolvable via kubedns without needing to use headless services.  In this type of configuration I can register peers like so: ``` fabric-ca-client enroll -d --enrollment.profile tls -u $ENROLLMENT_URL -M /tmp/tls --csr.hosts "$HOST_NAME,$HOST_NAME.peer,$HOST_NAME.peer.$CORE_PEER_DOMAIN"``` where examples of these variables are `HOST_NAME` as `peer-0`, `CORE_PEER_DOMAIN` is `namespace.svc.cluster.local` giving an overall peer name of `peer-0.peer.namespace.svc.cluster.local`

I use local storage - I'm on a mac and NFS isn't working. 
I'm having trouble getting it to accept the certs I gen with cryptogen when I call a peer with a client. I get a 509 exception. It's fine inside regular docker with same.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 18:58:16 GMT):<br/>
We do not use NFS in our K8S cluster.  It is possible to setup a fabric without it but if you are basing your system off of the demo scripts then you will need to do some work to get past that step.  We use a configmap with the genesis.block, configtx.yaml, channel.tx, and anchors.tx files in it and mount those into pods
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 18:59:09 GMT):<br/>
Additionally we wait on ports vs waiting on log files for the steps that require that sync...

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 21:22:00 GMT):<br/>
I will see what I can do... I need to disentangle a couple different efforts to make sure I have it explained correctly.  My current system is using chain code in scheduled pods (which I have mentioned in channels here in a few places) and that changes things yet again because we do not need to worry about scheduling containers in the host vm through mounted docker.sock in the peer...
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 21:22:49 GMT):<br/>
Prior to making the kubernetes controller though we were running with the normal docker.sock schedule pods and we had to deal with this exact DNS issue... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 21:23:13 GMT):<br/>
hmm I see
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 21:24:42 GMT):<br/>
The important change was to use statefulsets for peers so the hostnames matched up using the `peer-1.peer` (where `peer` is the service name for the stateful set) so that DNS could resolve the names
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 21:26:37 GMT):<br/>
The peer docker vm needs to point to the KUBE_DNS service IP address as well so it can resolve names in kubernetes
```
        - name: CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_DNS
          value:  {{ .Values.fabricPeer.hostDNS }}
```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 21:27:08 GMT):<br/>
OK, understood... I'll forward your tips to him, many thanks again!

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=u8euvniwyyQwCQqiD) @iramiller Perhaps I didn't explain as well as I could have. We have a different implementation from the samples. The simple test version of it calls cryptogen and makes multiple configtxgen to generate the needful files for security and for the channels. It then generates kubernetes configuration yaml for the four defined organizations. It's set to use DinD for chaincode instantiation, which seems to be working.
All this works fine until I turn on TLS. At that point I start getting certificate exceptions, and I'm not sure what's causing them. External communication to the network is through nodeports to localhost and the calling application uses the java SDK with the peer cert coming from `peerOrganizations/{DOMAIN}/peers/{NAME}/tls/server.crt`. 
The same network and the same calling application works just fine in docker using compose, so I'm guessing it's something to do with how kubernetes resolves things but this is a I don't know what I don't know situation. I'm not even sure I'm asking the right questions.

@yacovm I solved those DNS issues by passing the kubedns IP-address and the DNS config into the container as EnvVar's. You'd need to either access the host or change Fabric's code if you want to fix those issues otherwise.

                                "value": "<kubedns.ipAddress>"
                            },
                            {
                                "name": "CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_DNSSEARCH",
                                "value": "default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local"

This way I can avoid changing fabric's code and I don't have to alter the dockerconfig file on the host machine. Downside is that the chaincode runs outside of k8s. For my purposes this is good enough, though I can imagine if you want to utilize k8s's full potential running chaincode outside of k8s just won't cut it.

Won't solve the domain-naming issue for orderer.example.com though. I would have taken a similar approach on that one.

@iramiller I see in your response to @DazWilkin medium post that you have a forked version of fabric with k8s controller code replacing the docker controller code. Any chance you might contribute that upstream as a configurable alternative?

@cbf there are a few hoops to go through before we could release the controller... foremost is that our implementation doesn't support all of the configuration options that are expected for a deployment.  We rely heavily on a set of defaults that match our own internal requirements.  I am happy to pull out examples of where we integrated in and how we solved scheduling of workloads for others that are able to build and integrate the source code.  Until we have a more robust solution releasing the whole thing would likely result in far more support questions than we would be able to field

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 15:26:22 GMT):<br/>
I feel like our approach is a good starting point ... we essentially integrated directly with the existing docker containers with the exception that we do not use the docker client to schedule workloads... this means that all of the container configuration stuff should map over to kubernetes eventually without change protobufs for a new type
```
// from github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/container/dockercontroller/dockercontroller.go @ line 100
// NewVM creates a new DockerVM instance
func (p *Provider) NewVM() container.VM {
	// At this point check to see if we are in kubernetes
	if !kubernetescontroller.InCluster() {
		return NewDockerVM(p.PeerID, p.NetworkID)
	}
	// In a cluster so replace the docker connection with a kubernetes one.
	dockerLogger.Info("Kubernetes environment detected. Using K8s API.")
	return kubernetescontroller.NewKubernetesAPI(p.PeerID, p.NetworkID)
}
```

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 15:30:11 GMT):<br/>
There is a good discussion here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7406 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 15:32:38 GMT):<br/>
As part of that I see that the HLF team was not supportive of pulling in the k8s.io client apis as another compile time reference for the peer code with an expressed preference for an external library instead.  That approach would not work with the implementation I have above that ties into the docker controller directly to use the in cluster configuration and replace the docker client when the kubernetes environment is detected (and the configuration flag enables the K8s controller)

@iramiller @yacovm this is *very* interesting. Thank you both for the follow-up. @iramiller your insights in response to my blog post are very helpful too. I'm headed out on vacation today back and the closing on a house so I'm going to be very offline for a while. However, I'm (re)committed to getting this working. How best to proceed? Is there a project space where we can progress this in the open? Or, should we corral, define a path forward and then return here? @iramiller, I'm my handle here without the "G-" prefix at google.com.

@iramiller I've not been able to look at my problem for a couple of days. I really did a poor job of explaining it, and I conflated two issues I had. 
I'm using yaml config scripts I autogenerate and the client runs under the java sdk for full disclosure.

K8S works fine using grpc:// until I turn on TLS and grpcs://. 
It works fine in a base docker setup with and without TLS. This is single node on a mac.

The first thing I need to do to run my network is to create a channel. To do this the client needs to contact the orderer. That's exposed using a NodePort service. My call fails to reach the orderer. 
The java client gives me this: 
```
org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.exception.TransactionException: Channel xxx-block-channel, send transactions failed on orderer OrdererClient-xxx-block-channel-orderer0-orderer(grpcs://localhost:30020). Reason:  timeout after 10000 ms.
	at org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.OrdererClient.sendTransaction(OrdererClient.java:210) ~[fabric-sdk-java-1.2.0.jar:na]
	at org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.Orderer.sendTransaction(Orderer.java:158) [fabric-sdk-java-1.2.0.jar:na]
	at org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.Channel.sendUpdateChannel(Channel.java:509) [fabric-sdk-java-1.2.0.jar:na]

	at org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.Channel.createNewInstance(Channel.java:324) [fabric-sdk-java-1.2.0.jar:na]
```

It never hits the orderer. Logs end at `[channel: genesischannel] It's a connect message - ignoring`

The properties passed to the orderer look like this:
`pemBytes=[B@8037787, negotiationType=TLS, sslProvider=openSSL, hostnameOverride=orderer0-orderer`

pemBytes comes from the generated crypto - found in the usual `ordererOrganizations/{DOMAIN}/orderers/{NAME}/tls/server.crt` location

With these generated certs and TLS I need to pass in the hostnameOverride flag set to the name of the orderer. 
As I (clearly not well) understand it that allows it to accept the cert as being valid. 

Until K8S. I've added the javax extensions to debug SSL and they give me nothing, so it's not even getting to logging that whole handshaking part it does.
*I'm not sure where to even start looking to see what it's not liking* 
I thought I read K8S has a different certificate management system and that might be affecting this, but I'm at the I don't know enough to even ask the right question stage. 
If anyone can give me a clue where to start I'll try to figure it out - I'm just looking to short circuit as much of that process as possible.

I do not recommend using NodePorts for your services.  I recommend using a headless service bound directly to your orderer (or statefulsets) so you can have a consistent DNS name and port in your configuration that is easier to reason about.  Depending on how you deploy your orderer workloads you can use the DNS names of stateful sets or make a service with specific selectors for each order if you are using a deployment with each specific orderer instance.  When diagnosing DNS issues I like to run an instance of the CLI [hyperledger/fabric-ca-tools] and install dnsutils `apt update;apt install -qq -y dnsutils` to check my connections and resolution. 
```
root@cli-0:/# nslookup orderer-0
Server:		172.16.0.10
Address:	172.16.0.10#53

** server can't find orderer-0: NXDOMAIN

I do have headless services for all of the internal inter-pod comms - it's only the ones that I need to hit from my client externally that have NodePorts. 
It was my first go around and this was the first time I had to deal with Kubernetes :( I'll add an ingress when I figure out how it works. 
Although if I understood all that documentation for it correctly it seems that inter-pod TLS isn't supported without adding something like a reverse proxy.

Hello.  We have been using Fabric on Docker swarm, but I now have some time to look at K8 as an option for us.   I have played around with it via Minikube, but have hit an issue with pods not being able to hit their own service.  e.g. a peer talking to itself via it's service.  It appears to be a hairpin related issue on the virtual device, but moving forward, we don't intend to use Minikube for production, so it's probably not worth spending time to find a fix, unless someone has one to hand ;-)   There seem to be lots of options for installing a cluster.  We are looking primarily to use it on AWS, and maybe Azure.  Can anyone recommend an approach to K8 with Fabric in mind?

I have a doubt, as I am working on Hyperledger fabric

So 
How to deploy chaincode  in multiple organisation environment,
where all organisations in the environment has a peer node each,

so that any transaction that happens on single organization peer is reflected on the peers of other organizations 

 i.e how to keep the peers in each organization in sync ?

Or how to setup Hyperledger fabric in multiple organization environment ?

Anyone use dind? We just hit a problem with disk pressure despite the /var/lib/docker omg that box being gigantic. 
It looks like it's writing to the root file system - is that expected behavior or are we missing a parameter somewhere?

EDIT: NM it looks like it is. Something to be aware of if your SAs set your root filesystem size to 1Gb with a "but nobody every uses that" comment.

`Error: error getting endorser client for channel: endorser client failed to connect to liqvis-service-peer2:30210: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded`  i am getting this error while trying to run commands. if i even put the IP of the service, it does not connect. But if i give that of the pods in /etc/hosts, it connects. Peer1 is able to communicate with Peer1 via the service and I am able to curl the service as well but from inside the pod, the service connected to it is unreachable.

Guys, I'm trying to run fabric network on kubernetes and looks like have an issue with any chaincode execution ... for example - trying to `peer channel getinfo -c ANY` and got `2018-09-30 10:50:43.335 UTC [endorser] ProcessProposal -> ERRO 1d7 [][a28ec38c] simulateProposal() resulted in chaincode name:"qscc"  response status 500 for txid: a28ec38c7d9cfa6e63940173b454a9c93dafb4bf588f8ad1ccd11308977ff722` how can i check that docker VM with system chaincode works? any HOWTO? tricks about mounted docker socket? I'm using GKE cluster

I’m currently working on adding the possibility of exposing the orderers to the internet via ingresses. I’ve gotten as far as setting up the ingresses (using the NGINX-ingress controller) to accept GRPC connections for the Orderer and Peer:

https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/master/docs/examples/grpc

Using internal addresses works fine and is all dandy where the whole network lives within a single Kubernetes cluster.

However, I’m seeing issues when trying to connect from the peer to the orderer:

If I include the full address in `configtx.yaml`, including `https://` procotol for the ingress, I see errors like this (actual address replaced with `example.com`):

```
2018-10-10 13:04:29.940 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 368 grpc: addrConn.createTransport failed to connect to {https://ord2.example.com:443 0  <nil>}. Err :connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing dial tcp: address https://ord2.example.com:443: too many colons in address". Reconnecting...
2018-10-10 13:04:29.940 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 369 pickfirstBalancer: HandleSubConnStateChange: 0xc422645640, CONNECTING
2018-10-10 13:04:29.940 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 36a pickfirstBalancer: HandleSubConnStateChange: 0xc422645640, TRANSIENT_FAILURE
2018-10-10 13:04:30.418 UTC [ConnProducer] NewConnection -> ERRO 36b Failed connecting to https://ord2.example.com:443 , error: context deadline exceeded
```

If I remove the `https://` protocol, I instead see this:

```
2018-10-10 13:54:10.579 UTC [deliveryClient] connect -> DEBU 7d7 Connected to ord2.example.com:443
2018-10-10 13:54:10.586 UTC [deliveryClient] connect -> DEBU 7db Establishing gRPC stream with ord2.example.com:443 ...
2018-10-10 13:54:10.590 UTC [deliveryClient] connect -> ERRO 7dc Connection to  ord2.example.com:443 established but was unable to create gRPC stream: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = all SubConns are in TransientFailure, latest connection error: <nil>
2018-10-10 13:54:10.590 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 7dd grpc: addrConn.transportMonitor exits due to: context canceled
```

It looks as if there is an issue either connecting or maintaining connection to the Orderers when these are external. Has anyone run into this issue, and how did you solve it?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 16:55:45 GMT):<br/>
You can't specify the https scheme because the peer is coded to make a GRPC connection.  More details starting at about line 160 of `github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/comm/client.go`
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 16:57:05 GMT):<br/>
You need to investigate kubernetes ingress for GRPC services... https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/master/docs/examples/grpc
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 09:12:32 GMT):<br/>
Hi @iramiller, thanks for the reply. That is exactly the example I used, the example for kubernetes ingress in `ingress-nginx`, and this works fine for their example.

My current hypothesis for the issue in the second case is that the fact that we have SSL/TLS throws the Peer client off, which does not expect to be connect to a protected service. I guess I need to start by getting mutual TLS working internally in the cluster and then try my luck with K8S Ingresses again.
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 13:05:42 GMT):<br/>
If you get mutual TLS working I'd be interested in hearing how you did it. I sorta gave up once I read about K8S requiring a reverse proxy in every node. Fortunately we have our own data center, but if we ever cloud hosted it I'd have to go back and look and I'm not looking forward to it.
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 13:53:20 GMT):<br/>
Hi @aatkddny. Yes, the documentation is rather sparse on many of these questions, unfortunately. If I succeed, I will try to ping back here.

@alexvicegrab  - the issue is likely the fact that the peer does not trust the issues of the TLS certificate being using by the orderer (technically I suppose being used by nginx).  Did you include the root / intermediate CA which issued the TLS certificate in your orderer org's MSP in the the channel definition?

The other possibility is that the TLS certificate does not have any SANS matching whichever hostname you are adding in your configtx.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:04:44 GMT):<br/>
I assume that you did not actually enable TLS on the actually orderer node(s)?  Just at the ingess / nginx layer?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:05:49 GMT):<br/>
How did you actually create the crypto material?
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:08:00 GMT):<br/>
Hi @mastersingh24, you are correct, I did not enable TLS on the actual orderer at that point (looking into getting this working now on my Helm charts). The NGINX TLS certificates to access all the ingresses were generated for each orderer and peer with Let's Encrypt, by using a Helm Chart (K8S application package) called `cert-manager`. I did not (nor could) include these TLS certificates as they are generated after launching the orderers (which require a genesis block containing these).
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:08:42 GMT):<br/>
OK
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:08:57 GMT):<br/>
Are using cryptogen at all?
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:09:00 GMT):<br/>
No
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:09:07 GMT):<br/>
Only the Fabric CA
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:09:22 GMT):<br/>
How did you create the MSP info for your orgs?
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:09:27 GMT):<br/>
I use that to create all the crypto material
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:09:27 GMT):<br/>
I use the Fabric CA that to create all the crypto material.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:10:02 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:10:28 GMT):<br/>
Except of course the TLS material of the NGINX ingress, which uses Let's Encrypt as the CA
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:13:07 GMT):<br/>
So  what you will need to do is to add the root and intermediate CAs for Let's Encrypt into the `tlscacerts` and/or `tlsintermediatecerts` directory for your orderer organization prior to running `configtxgen`.   If you also plan to expose the peers as well, you should do the same for your peer orgs.   And of course make sure that the hostname(s) you use for the orderer endpoint(s) in `configtx.yaml` match the external hostname for your ingress
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 11:14:03 GMT):<br/>
Cool, thanks @mastersingh24, I will attempt to do this and get back to you

Hi, I am deploying a hyperledger network inside k8s
</p>
<p><strong>CarlosRL</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 17:58:33 GMT):<br/>
I have a question, once a hyperledger fabric network is deployed with kafka as consensus algorithm inside a kubernetes cluster. Such network is configured with three kafka brokers within the configtx.yml. Is it possible add new kafka brokers to the deployed network?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 10:22:46 GMT):<br/>
@CarlosRL  - Yes ... just follow the Kakfa docs on how to add brokers to a cluster.  You don't actually have to update the channel config as the brokers listed there are simply used for bootstrapping the embedded Kafka client. 
</p>

@mastersingh24. I'd like to ask your advice again.

I've tried to work through the issue by trying to get the orderers to use TLS. For this I stopped using the ingresses, and simply enabled TLS on the orderers. As you suggested, I added the `tlscacerts` and `tlsintermediatecerts` to the Peer and Orderer admin MSP directories prior to running configtxgen.

I managed to create and join the channel on the peers, by adding the relevant options: `--tls` `--ordererTLSHostnameOverride` and `--cafile`. However, despite successfully joining the channel, the peer has similar trouble connecting to the orderer.

On the orderer side, I see this:

```
2018-10-19 23:14:40.513 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 60c grpc: Server.Serve failed to complete security handshake from "10.244.0.218:45782": tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake

```

And on the peer side I see this:

```

```

In this case the TLS communication is internal to the Kubernetes cluster, and there are no ingresses. I'm guessing that somehow the Peer is trying to communicate unsecured, despite me using the TLS mode to join the channel, etc.

What am I missing?

Thanks!

P.S. I've tried both with and without `CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED` option set to `true` and `false` in the peer.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=33gvhmQb5b5szago7) @alexvicegrab Do you have `CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true`?
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 21:17:44 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24, yes, both `CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true` and `ORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED` as either `true` or `false`
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 21:18:52 GMT):<br/>
For each of Peers and Orderers, I obtained their TLS certificates from intermediate Fabric CAs (one for all Orderers, another for all Peers), which share a Root CA.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 15:12:56 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=pQmyBMWAi4G38yEk5) @alexvicegrab One thing I forgot to mention earlier was that you need to make sure that the TLS certificates have a CommonName or a SAN (Subject Alternative Name) matching the hostname you use to address them in the cluster.  There is no hostname override available for peer to peer or peer to orderer communication
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 17:07:13 GMT):<br/>
Aha... OK, that is very useful to know, thank you @mastersingh24. I will have a go at checking the certificates and re-issuing them if necessary.

Hi everyone. Which is the best approach to deploy fabric network on multiple hosts? Kubernetes or Docker Swarm?
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 09:56:55 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24  I have setup swarm network on 4 machines for fabric and successfully created channels and all other peers able to join channels. When I am trying to instantiate chaincode , it doesnt spinup ccenv container thus resulting in timeout failure .  ccenv image present in a system but not spinning up any container . What could be possible reasons for that ? I ain't getting any errors in peer logs . I increased timeout to much larger value but  nothing works so far.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 11:15:34 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid  - is it launching ccenv but then not able to either build or launch the actual chaincode container?
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 11:43:47 GMT):<br/>
No it is not launching ccenv . I aint getting any ccenv stopped container  .  cli just wait and then throw timeout error if it hits timeout value
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 11:43:47 GMT):<br/>
No it is not launching ccenv . I aint getting any ccenv dev image like (dev-peerfirst-mycc-v0) neither any  stopped container  .  cli just wait and then throw timeout error if it hits timeout value . Should'nt I get any errors on peer logs except timeout error ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 12:22:00 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 16:12:38 GMT):<br/>

@waxer  where in peer container files or in orderer container.yaml files ? All my services are running on same network . 
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 05:24:29 GMT):<br/>
Do I manually need to run ccenv container and link it with peer ?

<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 11:46:45 GMT):<br/>
Hey @mastersingh24 any feedback from your side ? I am still stuck in same issue :(
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 11:51:41 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid , I mean the CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE env variable of the peer. Is correctly set to the docker-compose network name of your container?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 16:30:55 GMT):<br/>
You definitely need to set the ` CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE` to the name of the Docker overlay network being used by the Swarm cluster.  You also need to make sure you mark that network as "attachable" else only containers started via Swarm will be able to connect to the network
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:04:34 GMT):<br/>
Hey @waxer @mastersingh24 thanks a lot for helping me out . Those two things were the missing part in my network . After making network attachable and including that environmental variable , I am able to invoke chaincode :)

@ddhulla  - in order to mount the Docker socket (`/host/var/run/docker.sock` )  from the host / worker node, you either need to be root or you need to be in the docker group.  Assuming you are passing in a uid and gid, you should make sure that the GID corresponds to the host / worker node group which owns the Docker socket (the group is usually name `docker`)

Hi everyone. Is there any way that we could make a downloadable image for each peer that can be installed on each peer so they become part of the blockchain network and these peers can then communicate in a fabric network?

Hello, I've created a Hyperledger Fabric Network over Kubernetes with 4 Orgs, 1 Peer each, + 1 orderer, and I'm trying to use a policy -P "AND('Org1.member','Org2.member','Org3.member','Org4.member')" but I'm not having success. People told me I would not be able to fire a transaction from command line for a policy like that because I need to collect endorsement from every organization, so I've tried with Node SDK, but it is still not working. Any help would be much appreciated. I have all the config files and log files available if needed.

Need a sanity check. I'm thinking about TLS - which was my first mistake.
To get into a peer (or orderer or whatever) I ~think~ I can use nginx as an ingress - setting an image as a pod in each of the deployments and handling the SSL ugliness there. 
But will that mean I need to expose a nodeport for each deployment, or is there a more elegant way to do this?

Hey guys, how Can we maintain the state of orderers and peers (so that if they crash, they can come back in same state).  I know that couchdb data and ledger data(production folder) are to persisted. What else steps are required? Do i need to make the peer join channel again, do i need to install chaincode again?

**Create channel error in Kubernetes job**
Hello! 

I'm trying to create fabric network in kubernetes cluster using this samples: https://github.com/IBM/blockchain-network-on-kubernetes

But when I run create_channel.yaml, I see this error in logs:
```
2018-11-23 10:20:52.633 UTC [common/tools/configtxgen] main -> INFO 001 Loading configuration
2018-11-23 10:20:52.646 UTC [common/tools/configtxgen] doOutputChannelCreateTx -> INFO 002 Generating new channel configtx
2018-11-23 10:20:52.646 UTC [common/tools/configtxgen] main -> CRIT 003 Error on outputChannelCreateTx: config update generation failure: cannot define a new channel with no Application section
```

But really I have Application section and configtx.yaml works fine without kubernetes. Very strange.
my configtx.yaml: https://gist.github.com/VadimInshakov/fafb9788e53c19caf73ddb0b0228d00a#file-23434553yer

Hello guys! I have a question regarding a couchdb instances needed for production scenario in K8S. We currently have 2 peer x organization but only one instance of couchdb acting as ledger x organization. Both peers connect to the same couchdb instance. Is this approach correct or each peer should have its own couchdb instance? Thank you guys!

Hi everyone. I have set CORE_MSP_CONFIG PATH to /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/example.com/users/Admin@example.com/msp ..............in my peer deployment file. But when the pod is created for this peer, it keeps on crashing and I have checked the logs of this pod and it says that:  Cannot run peer because cannot init crypto, missing /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/example.com/users/Admin@example.com/msp folder
Can anyone tell me the solution of this?

@feitnomore , great doc.
The only thing that makes me wonder if it is a good idea to have 3 replicas of  an Orderen behind a Service.
Those orderers may eventually by out of sync in the block height, and I'm not sure if the balancing between them of the service could lead to some unexpected situation to a leader peer. Since the peer has been notified about block number X, and then maybe latter  if the service chooses another replica that could have the latest block be X-1.
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 09:47:29 GMT):<br/>
Im not aware if the implementation details, but i guess it shouldn't be an issue since the 'deliver' interface asks always for newer blocks from peer POV.
</p>

Maybe someone could check this

Hi, I'm running hyperledger fabric on kubernetes for the past couple o months. Now, I getting this error on my peer
```

```
By reading the hyperledger FAQ's this is due an error on the kafka/zookeeper
kafka logs show the following error
```
[2018-12-02 03:53:08,050] ERROR [ReplicaFetcherThread-0-1], Current offset 0 for partition [testchainid,0] out of range; reset offset to 4010 (kafka.server.ReplicaFetcherThread)
```
So, I changed offset auto reset to smallest, on the zookeeper by setting an environment variable. I didn't have luck. Any suggestions, thanks in advance

Hi everyone. I have a query that If a pod containing peer fails in Kubernetes and as scalling feature of Kubernetes allows automatic healing capability. So if a pod crashes and recreated by Kubernetes then Is there going to occur any change in the certificates assigned to that peer OR Is there going to be any effect on the chaincode installed on that peer I mean is there any possibilty that our network crashes because of any of these cases? Actually I want to understand that how the Fabric network is going to behave in Kubernetes if some of it component's pod or container crashes? 
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Mon, 03 Dec 2018 02:04:46 GMT):<br/>
@yousaf, the most important thing is that when the pod is recreated the pod.can have all the necessary artifacts as it had when you ran it he first time. Dont worry about the ledger or world state because it will reprocess all the blocks again.
</p>
<p><strong>waxer</strong> (Mon, 03 Dec 2018 02:05:32 GMT):<br/>
As you say, consider as 'artifact' the chaincodes too...

I have another query. If we have deployed fabric on Google Kubernetes Engine then how to use each VM instance for each connected host to the cluster, as a peer of fabric network? and how each of that peer being a physical host is going to perform queries against chaincode w.r.t to its own rights.? Can somebody explain it briefly?

@julian , if you consider the peers genesis block channels it belongs too as artifacts, you can make a init script that makes the joins.

<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 10:29:20 GMT):<br/>
Afaik you can avoid that only by ensuring there is enough disk space. Also, are you sure it's due to disk space? I've had instances where the node wasn't responding within an expected time-frame which prompted the eviction. Setting a resource-limit on your containers might help resolve that issue.

one was showing low imagefs and another low disk before it evicted. of course the desktop may not have been reporting accurately, but...

Need to wave my ignorance about a little as I'm doing some work with configuration and want to only do it once.

I have a question about chaincode instantiation. 

We've been doing it using docker in docker, so each pod has a peer, a couchdb and a dind container. 
It seems to be working fine.

We went that way because frankly the only documentation I saw where people had it working said they used dind, and when I figured out the 
```        - name: CORE_VM_ENDPOINT
          value: tcp://localhost:2375
``` 
trick it was pretty straightforward.

So time marches on and it's a bit more mainstream deploying in k8s. people must be hitting the it doesn't fit in a docker instance and swarm is incomprehensible to mere mortals problem. 

I'm now seeing helm charts popping up all over the place. 
Not a single one uses dind, instead it's all /var/run/docker.sock.
Is the accepted standard now to not use dind, but to go back to using the host? 

And here's where I have to start showing my ignorance  - istr that to get it to work one has to modify the docker config scripts as described here `http://www.think-foundry.com/deploy-hyperledger-fabric-on-kubernetes-part-1/`. 

So a little more poking about has our friends at ibm doing it the same way we are `https://github.com/IBM/blockchain-network-on-kubernetes/blob/master/configFiles/docker.yaml`
Which doesn't help.

Is there an accepted standard, or is it just use what works?
If the latter I'll stick with dind - it's not proving to be a pain point.

We did it from a java app. Or more accurately wrote something inside the app to run the crypto and then generate the yaml from a configuration file.

@aatkddny Here's a list of reasons not to use DIND https://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/ . Currently the unix-socket approach is also a hack until Fabric provides a means to bring chaincodes under the management of K8s afaik. There are some JIRA issues that provide more in depth information on what needs to be done for this but I don't have them at the ready right now.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 22:24:36 GMT):<br/>
I released a npm package that takes care of the whole shabang about half a year ago. It generates the crypto files, creates the necessary k8s objects from that and uses HLF's config files to create the network. Only down side is it only deploys to GCE.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=EdmTrNYzqNY2Pz6uG) @RobertDiebels Thanks Robert, we have a standalone process that creates our networks soup to nuts from very simple configuration files and a few rest calls. I never extended it to automate kubectl'ing the yaml files it generates (which I did for the docker-compose version) - but using the desktop means there's only 4 steps for creation, so it isn't too bad. 

Neither docker option is exactly how one would want this to work if one were to actually design this from a clean sheet - which is why I'm trying to figure out which is the best option for me. When I started this the only jira that seemed relevant was FAB-7406 which mentioned DIND. It doesn't appear that it's moved very far since I was looking at the end of summer though. 

The IBM git I referenced above is far more recent, which drove my question, although given they seem to be the primary driver of this project at this time and given the paucity of opinions I think I'm leaning to sticking with what I have working until something better comes along.

Hi, I have been running hyperledger fabric in a staging environment and I noticed that when the chaincode container remains idle for some time I get this error `14 UNAVAILABLE: TCP Write failed` with the first request. The next requests are executed just fine. I using `fabric-peer:1.2.1`. Any ideas how to address this? Thanks in advance

Hi everyone. I have a query that I have deployed a hyperledger fabric network on GKE instances. I want to join a peer to this fabric network so that it accesses one of these instances and becomes a part of fabric network and user can use it to perform transactions etc...??

Hi *, this is a message / request to the Fabric architects:
for Hyperledger Fabric v1.1.0 I've managed to create a custom controller (openshiftcontroller) which implements the dockercontroller's interface. I've had to do 2 or 3 minor changes to the peer's code and I'm able to run Hyperledger Fabric on OpenShift in non-privileged mode :-)
Of course - I've had to create some custom images to be able to let everything run, but: it works :-)
Now my question / request:
would it be possible, to create a kind-of-a standard interface for custom controllers as well as a configuration setting by which the desired runtime environment (e.g. docker vs. openshift vs. k8s vs ...) could be selected? Right now I want to migrate from HLF 1.1.0 to HLF 1.4.0 and I have to put significant effort in finding the places where I can select the openshiftcontroller instead of the dockercontroller (and I'm hoping that the controller's interface hasn't changed that much).
What do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:20:33 GMT):<br/>
@tocosonic we have a similar solution with a kubernetescontroller on our own internal fork ... I noticed there would be a lot of little changes everywhere with the protobuf definitions to properly add our Kubernetes controller if we followed the docker controller architecture currently in place... I expect that we will see such support at some point as HLF sees more production usage. 
For our purposes we have minimized the effort required to support our fork by isolating our changes to HLF into our own controller and using a small shim to inject it within the standard docker controller.
```
// From core/container/dockercontroller/dockercontroller.go : line 104
// NewVM creates a new DockerVM instance
func (p *Provider) NewVM() container.VM {
	// At this point check to see if we are in kubernetes
	if !kubernetescontroller.InCluster() {
		dockerLogger.Info("Kubernetes not detected.")
		return NewDockerVM(p.PeerID, p.NetworkID, p.BuildMetrics)
	}
	// In a cluster so replace the docker connection with a kubernetes one.
	dockerLogger.Info("Kubernetes environment detected. Using K8s API.")
	return kubernetescontroller.NewKubernetesAPI(p.PeerID, p.NetworkID)
}
```

Hi guys, my issue is that my fabric peer pods in the kubernetes cluster get evicted due to this error message: "The node was low on resource: ephemeral-storage." Im using fabric v1.3.0, kubernetes v1.13.1-00 and docker v18.06.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu. For some reason, kubernetes did bring up the evicted peer pods again but the chaincode containers are no longer in the node anymore and i have to do a join channel and install chaincode again. Does anyone knows how to fix this issue?

Hi guys, I am using `kubernetes` to deploy fabric network in gke. It is working fine, but I want to be able to use ingress instead of services with type `LoadBalancer`. I want to have for example `peer0.org1.example.com` instead of `x.x.x.x:7051`. GRPC is supported by nginx, but only under ssl connections. 

Here is an example `https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/master/docs/examples/grpc`. 

The ingress requires the certificate and the key generated by `openssl`
Any ideas how to make it work

i know solve this error in docker, but in kubernetes i dont. I think that is because dns-server(default cluster dns) isn't work, i tried to put ip directly but either work

I am trying with this repo https://github.com/feitnomore/hyperledger-fabric-kubernetes  and i am stuck on step 12

I have a cluster with 1 node(only way to make it work) and instead of nfs-server i am using a shared folder( this folder works fine so i think this isn't error)

Hi Team, I have done fabric network setup using Docker swarm and now I want to do the same thing using Kubernetes. So is there any guide/reference material available which one can follow to achieve this ?
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 07:00:48 GMT):<br/>
@raj_shekhar did you correctly set up the Cert-manager?
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 07:02:09 GMT):<br/>
You know you can ping us on Github to ask about issues with CA setup, etc. So that the issues are centralised there and we can look at more promptly. Are you using the HGF workshop examples?
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 07:03:16 GMT):<br/>
@HLFPOC, yes, check our public repositories on github.com/aidtechnology, particularly Nephos, and the HGF workshop and LF webinar

<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 18:55:42 GMT):<br/>
Fair enough, but the point of Helm charts is not having to micromanage individual manifests. I also don't intend to make other people's life difficult in the long term
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 18:56:41 GMT):<br/>
You are free to set up your own K8S manifests without helm charts and there are examples of this elsewhere, but it's not my road to walk 
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 18:58:13 GMT):<br/>
A helm chart is ultimately a grouping of Kubernetes manifests with the possibility of using a very simple templating language. And it's why we made the workshops and Webinar. If anything is unclear do leave comments on the relevant repos we created. We tried to document as well as we could but doubt we have been perfect in everything

look at a nodeport if you want a simple setup

<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Mon, 04 Mar 2019 18:23:43 GMT):<br/>
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

You'd send grpc to port 30201 for peer0 of myorg.

Anyone manage to get 1.4.0 with gossip working?
No matter what I try I'm getting:

`2019-03-05 15:51:05.059 UTC [gossip.discovery] func1 -> WARN 035 Could not connect to Endpoint: peer1-myorg:30061, InternalEndpoint: peer0-myorg:30061, PKI-ID: <nil>, Metadata:  : context deadline exceeded`

So I have two peers for myorg and a pair of services that puts peer0-myorg at 30051 and peer1-myorg at 30061.

The setup is mirrored with stuff pulled from the 1.4.0 docker fabric-sample first-network setup, so for peer0 it looks like this:
```
        - name: CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT
          value: peer0-mediaocean:30051
        - name: CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER
          value: "false"
        - name: CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP

        - name: CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION
          value: "true"
``` 
The setup for peer1 mirrors this with the `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP` property pointing to its counterpart at 30051.
I've tried both service name and 0.0.0.0 and get the same error. 
What did I do wrong here?

Hi folks! Could anyone give own thoughts or provide link: what are the advantages of deploying Fabric with kubernetes? I see so many problems people face, but I don't understand why they are choosing kubernetes. Thanks for any help!
</p>
<p><strong>raj_shekhar</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 11:02:54 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=RELnXsizbbvqQqvqe) @krabradosty I am also exploring this particularly, the main benefit I think is the better container/resource management and release management ,,,, 
</p>
<p><strong>raj_shekhar</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 11:03:20 GMT):<br/>
Let me know what issues others are facing in it... 
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 11:13:46 GMT):<br/>
@raj_shekhar Mainly these issues are caused by a bad understanding of kubernetes. It is not a problem of Fabric.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=Fp9fmt74BAkKciq4q) @krabradosty right 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 14:31:59 GMT):<br/>
@krabradosty deploying a production system based on containers means that orchestration is a required line item for any non-trivial system.  While the learning curve for Kubernetes is steep given the number of containers required for even a single Org fabric system there really isn't a better solution out there—especially if you are going into a public cloud.  Our company has a fabric 1.4 deployment with several organizations spread across GKE and AWS (soon to include Azure).  At this scale there really isn't any other way.  Unfortunately in 1.4 the Fabric chaincode scheduling is not sufficient for our needs which required us to implement Kubernetes native scheduling of pods instead of using the docker.sock approach.  It appears that Fabric 2.0 has a major goal of streamlining this area (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13582).
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 14:38:07 GMT):<br/>
The impression [assumption] I have of your familiarity with Kubernetes and container orchestration for production systems based on this question leads me to believe I should warn you that acquiring proficiency in kubernetes is an extremely non-trivial undertaking which will require a great deal of time to achieve.  Further there are many places where getting it wrong (ingress, volumes, security) could result in grave risks to your deployments. That said it is a very worthwhile skill to acquire for any systems deployment in the cloud.
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 15:12:18 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=77ENDFkJ4DamqWeJN) @iramiller Could you please provide some real use-cases of orchestration you mentioned here? I understand the advantages of using kubernetes with stateless applications. But Fabric nodes are stateful. Moreover, to run for example a new peer,  some prerequisites have to be done (registering a peer identity in CA, ...). So as I see it, Fabric will not work with kubernetes out of the box. And my point is maybe it would be easier to implement own orchestration tool for Fabric network (based on ansible for example) rather than trying to "integrate" stateful and complex Fabric with k8s?

Also, I'm curious, do you deploy your databases, message brokers, etc on k8s cluster? I googled this question a lot, but can't find a strict answer with pros and cons. Only answers like "you can if you want".
And thanks for the warning :grinning:
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 15:37:17 GMT):<br/>
@krabradosty well... 'out of the box' is a somewhat vague concept here given the extensive set of tools available and the variety of use cases.  I would consider our environment to be very close to the Fabric software as released.  We added about 100-120 lines of Golang to our fork for kubernetes integration in the peer process itself but everything else is based on released binaries.  We do have extensive systems tooling in TerraForm, Ansible, and good old bash scripts to make our environment manageable.

Orchestration uses that are most valuable to us are the ability to define the resource requirements of the various components of our system and rely on Kubernetes to correctly schedule these components across the available nodes.  All of our peer deployments run as StatefulSets which Kubernetes handles in a more appropriate way for scheduling.  For databases we prefer to use solutions like Google's Cloud SQL outside of Kubernetes although for certain situations we do run small databases (postgres, Redis, etc) as containers within Kubernetes.

In a public cloud the machines these systems are deployed on WILL be restarted/fail/migrate with downtime.  A solution that pretends the machine will be up consistently is going to have a bad time.  As a concrete example there was a recent CVE issued which required all of our nodes to be rebooted for patching.  This was handled without impact to our production workflows (other than some additional retries occurring for some transactions).  We also run a very large Kafka cluster within Kubernetes with good results.  The Kafka/messaging architecture has been crucial to our success as a Request/Reply architecture is not very compatible with a distributed system.

It is better to jump in from the start believing that pieces can and will fail unexpectedly.  For reference our scale is around a dozen fabric orgs each with multiple peers and an ICA.  We have instances in every AWS availability zone across North America and many GKE zones as well.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 15:57:16 GMT):<br/>
One more important point... Our scale and environment is driven by business requirements related to our 'distributed trust problem' which the blockchain approach solves and not be technical requirements for this size environment.  We absolutely do not need all of this hardware for throughput nor would we scale in this way strictly for availability.
</p>
<p><strong>krabradosty</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:14:14 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=Tkity2ZXND64KBuj6) @iramiller You mean that with Kubernetes we can achieve required availability without high redundancy of hardware?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:22:47 GMT):<br/>
@krabradosty that really isn't the take away I was going for here.  My point was that I wouldn't choose to have 30-50 machines in this environment spread across the continent solely for the sake of availability or capacity.  Kubernetes scheduling does let us minimize the size of hardware we use, supports the use of preemptive nodes on GKE which are much cheaper, and scale out more hardware seamlessly as load dictates.

@iramiller do you run kafka in a single organization or in several ? 
</p>

or - do you run it in diff. avail. zones?

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:49:46 GMT):<br/>
Our consensus Org is as single dedicated centralized 5 node Kafka/ZK cluster ... we have a separate cluster for our application layer ... and member orgs of course can do their own thing as well.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:50:05 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:51:54 GMT):<br/>
Additionally we believe internally that we may need to migration our system to a service mesh (think Istio, similar) to streamline various aspects.  Currently we use a Wireguard and dedicated namespace architecture I designed which allows all of the distributed clusters to appear to be a single uber cluster.

</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:52:57 GMT):<br/>
The service mesh migration is further influenced by the proposed 2.0 changes to the chaincode/peer relationship proposed in HLF 2.0

that's a very polite way of saying that the current peer<---> docker is not cloud friendly 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:53:50 GMT):<br/>
you might use mutual TLS but you should beware of TLS terminating proxies
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:54:04 GMT):<br/>
you're going to need TLS passthrough proxies 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:54:25 GMT):<br/>
because when node A contacts node B, node B infers its ID from the TLS client certificate of node A
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:54:39 GMT):<br/>
just a heads up, of course
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:54:47 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm we rewrote the peer code to use a kubernetescontroller injected to replace the docker controller which makes our deployments cloud friendly

further in our environment any member node can access services in by dns name of `peer-0.membername.svc.cluster.local` ... which is on the TLS certificate (or the simplified `peer-0.membername`)

```
All TLS certificates have an expiration date that is determined by the issuer. These expiration dates can range from 10 years from the date of issuance to as little as a few months, so check with your issuer. Before the expiration date, you will need to rotate these certificates on the node itself and every channel the node is joined to, including the system channel.```
The TLS management and rotation are one of the major potential benefits we expect to see when migrating to a service mesh.  Our infosec group would like to see the rotation time driven down significantly to ensure the process runs smooth and is well managed.  Given the operational complexity of running a hyper ledger fabric production environment will increase with Raft and the future Peer/Chaincode refactor it would seem that adopting a recommended deployment pattern that is tested and supported maybe in the best interest of the project.  My personal preference is obviously for a kubernetes driven solution such as Istio however I also am acutely aware that such a solution is incredibly daunting for a small team without resources that are familiar with all of these external components.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=9LrxWNDXptGaBFQa4) To clarify on the peer scheduling requiring registration with the channels, CA, etc.  We do not scale the number of peers up/down in kubernetes.  We schedule the peers on nodes relying on the resource scheduling capabilities of Kubernetes.  To support management of secrets and configuration we store all of the config and certificates in configmaps and secrets within kubernetes.  We do use a PVC for the chain data.  Further we use multiple containers within the same pod, one for the peer and the second for couchdb which means that the couch connection is always localhost to the peer for performance.  These are some of the useful aspects of Kubernetes orchestration even for stateful workloads like a peer process.  Additionally we schedule our chaincode as one off pods managed by the peer itself via Kubernetes API calls and rely on NetworkPolicy configuration to ensure the scheduled peer chaincode containers can only talk to their owning peer container.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 17:55:48 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller why do you need a service mesh for fabric? I don't understand... can you enlighten me please?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 17:56:07 GMT):<br/>
Fabric manages security and load balancing and failover on its own
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:41:56 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm the areas we are exploring a service mesh for to solve are 1. -- TLS management (a quick scan shows nearly 600 instances of pem files for MSPs, TLS, mutual TLS identities in our environment). 2. -- Secure cross cluster connections, we may be able to integrate our Wireguard VPN system into a service mesh for more automated rollout and administration. 3. -- Service routing solution for the updated chaincode/peer architecture proposed for HLF 2.0.  We require control of the versions of chaincode used within our consortium and we must have multiple versions deployable and a single version instantiated across the entire network.  Using a service mesh we can handle routing between these version.  Additionally we use a custom end-to-end encryption system that encrypts the entire contents of every transaction.  This approach uses customer managed keys so the platform itself does not have access to the data.  As part of this approach the client that submits a transaction determines which of the many peers available it wants to use and includes an ephemeral public key from the chaincode instance allowed to process the transaction.  I am simplifying this a little bit but the short of all of that is that we have our own service and instance discover system with key management and we believe that a service mesh could potentially be used to streamline this process further. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:43:32 GMT):<br/>
Additionally I would like to point out that the adoption and potential migration to a service mesh is in the research, scoping, and prototyping phase.  We have not committed to this direction although there are a few initial promising aspects associated with it.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:44:24 GMT):<br/>
i don't see how application level encrypted is remotely related to service mesh
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:45:25 GMT):<br/>
as for VPN - I understand why someone would want to use a VPN
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:45:27 GMT):<br/>
service discovery and registration/rotation of the ephemeral public key for the chaincode endpoint is the overlap we have annotated
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:45:48 GMT):<br/>
I listed it last as it is the least of the priorities
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:45:48 GMT):<br/>
are the peers also running behind istio?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:46:02 GMT):<br/>
because it might interfere with fabric's native service discovery 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:46:07 GMT):<br/>
unless you don't use it 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:46:36 GMT):<br/>
we would potentially run upto 100% of the inter container connectivity through Istio ... and no ... we are not currently using the service discovery offering in Fabric
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:46:49 GMT):<br/>
why not?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:50:29 GMT):<br/>
We already needed to have a system that captures a generated public key from the chaincode container instance within a member.  By design this key is maintained in memory and rotated frequently as it is associated with transaction processing and is the single point within our environment when a customers transaction is decrypted.  We have integrity monitoring controls wrapping all of these instances to further protect this environment with a forward looking design intended to work with a TEE when that matures.  As part of all of this our centralized key management server maintains a definitive list of authorized chaincode containers within the environment (subject to revocation based on security controls and policy).  No transactions can be submitted to our network and processed by chaincode without contacting this kms.  As such we did not see any benefit in adopting the discovery service (at this time).
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:53:52 GMT):<br/>
what fabric's service discovery is, is a service that the client (SDK) asks it "which peers should I ask endorsement from for chaincode *foo*?" and it returns an answer based on the endorsement policy
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:54:30 GMT):<br/>
I don't really understand how your TEE and encryption use case is making it useless
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:54:49 GMT):<br/>
that is consistent with our understanding of it as well...
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:55:06 GMT):<br/>
it is not useless... only largely redundant in our environment ... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:55:26 GMT):<br/>
ok so when you change the endorsement policy do you rewrite the application?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:55:39 GMT):<br/>
and when you add new peers do you have the application query k8s or something?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:55:40 GMT):<br/>
why would we do that?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:56:01 GMT):<br/>
Our KMS maintains information on every active peer and chaincode instance across the consortium
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:56:26 GMT):<br/>
further is is aware of the current status of security policy with regards to which instances are authorized
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:56:28 GMT):<br/>
let's say you have chaincode *foo* and it has endorsement policy *org1* and *org2*  and now you add a new org to the channel - *org3*.
and you upgrade the chaincode and change the endorsement policy to be *org1* and *org2* and *org3*
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:56:34 GMT):<br/>
how does you application adapt ?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 19:59:32 GMT):<br/>
Our KMS is aware of the endorsement policy ... it is queried for a set of potential peer/chaincode instances for the associated operation ... the results of this query include the public keys for those chaincode instances... the client can make its own determination of which of the members to use or not use based on their own internal policies for which orgs they wish to have potential exposure to their information (however brief).  The client the encrypts the transaction and includes a collection of keys encrypted with the public keys of audience members allowed to decrypt the payload (which includes peers, other identities, etc)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 20:00:15 GMT):<br/>
ok i see
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 20:00:20 GMT):<br/>
our KMS concept was in place before we migrated from 1.1 ... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 20:00:31 GMT):<br/>
your company is light years ahead than 99% of fabric deployments I would presume
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 20:01:15 GMT):<br/>
We do have a large investment in blockchain and a vested interest in ensuring the continued success of HLF
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 21:00:21 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm 
```
As we noted in the conceptual documentation, leader elections in Raft are triggered when follower nodes do not receive either a “heartbeat” messages or an “append” message that carries data from the leader for a certain amount of time. ```
 ^^^  monitoring network performance with Istio would be pretty useful for this reason -- https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/istio-samples/tree/master/istio-stackdriver

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 21:28:44 GMT):<br/>
how can you do that @iramiller ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 21:29:05 GMT):<br/>
Raft uses TLS 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 21:29:18 GMT):<br/>
and fabric uses ephemeral diffie helman key exchange 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 21:29:32 GMT):<br/>
so you are not supposed to be able to see what is going on in the connection
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 21:50:02 GMT):<br/>
well... the TLS is managed by an Istio sidecar container... Istio understands all of the routes in the network and captures metrics and instrumentation on them.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 21:50:46 GMT):<br/>
essentially if migrating to a service mesh the ideal situation is a separation of concerns between the network and transport related aspects of a program and its endpoints/internal logic
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 21:52:01 GMT):<br/>
As one can quickly imagine migrating to such a setup is non-trivial and potentially an invasive change to the software architecture.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 21:53:10 GMT):<br/>
And yet if this is done all of the TLS related concerns fall away as they are abstracted out (minus some sort of bridge which would be required to memorialize the official current configuration in the blockchain that reflects the known identities.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 22:00:55 GMT):<br/>
For those following along it maybe helpful to read the overview of Istio security: https://istio.io/docs/concepts/security/ [covers mutual tls, etc] and further contemplate the benefits of separating the traffic management concerns out of fabric by reviewing  https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 22:02:13 GMT):<br/>
These capabilities are the true power of a cloud orchestration platform and are really a next level solution.  This is likely more that almost all users of HLF are looking for... but if you have a production system in the cloud of any significant size then it is absolutely where you want to be
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:11:16 GMT):<br/>
> well... the TLS is managed by an Istio sidecar container... 
but you can't run Raft orderers without TLS. It is just impossible code wise 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 15 Mar 2019 15:34:14 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm the TLS certificates are generated and managed by Istio and saved as secrets in Kubernetes which are then mounted into the container... the HLF processes will not see any difference from any other pem file when loading their secret.

Cross post from the #fabric-sdk-java channel. I'm trying to switch from NodePort to Ingress on my test setup. 
The first one I tried was the CA - so I mapped localhost/ca to the correct service, added a little rewrite code and it works fine. 
Until I try to do it from the sdk - which requires urls of the format host:port. 
Kubernetes isn't my strongest subject, so I'm wondering if there's a workaround here that'll let me get to these - and the peers and orderers - without the port count restrictions of the NodePort, and with the handy SSL/GRPCS features I can get from the Ingress.

Sadly it's less wonderful when I try to do it from the sdk - which requires urls of the format host:port.

Any K8s on AWS guides out there? New to k8s and HLF. Making for an interesting few days!

In my experience AKS is not quite as nice as GKE ... but the deployments are quite similar if you are using nodeports for your services.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 23:37:51 GMT):<br/>
@LeeJCherry if you find a guide for kubernetes installs of fabric on any platform it will probably be worth a look even if they are not targeting AWS/AKS specifically

@LeeJCherry, you can also try https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/nephos

@LeeJCherry, you can also try https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/nephos
It should work fine for deploying Fabric on AWS & GCP (tested on Azure and Minikube)

One of the (many) good points of Kubernetes is to make deployments cloud-agnostic

Hi, someone receive this error in k8 ? Error: could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg cannot get package for chaincode(cc:1.0)
</p>
<p><strong>LeeJCherry</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 17:40:46 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @iramiller.
</p>
<p><strong>LeeJCherry</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 17:42:51 GMT):<br/>
@alexvicegrab I've been following one of the other aid tech Github repos readme and a you tube video they have. Getting all sorts of errors which I think is due to the guide being a little out of date. There is mention of the Nephos repo as well. What's the difference? I'm not using EKS, I'm going for k8s purely for the cloud agnostic benefit 
</p>
<p><strong>LeeJCherry</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 17:43:39 GMT):<br/>
@alexvicegrab actually just noticed! It's your video I have been watching!! 
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 17:58:57 GMT):<br/>
@LeeJCherry, the GitHub webinar and workshop are a bit older, but should work. Yes, they are my videos. Nephos basically automates the tests. We have unit tests, integration tests, documentation, code coverage and code quality monitoring with SonarQube and security auditing with Snyk. It *should* work, even though it's a late alpha or early beta
</p>
<p><strong>LeeJCherry</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 18:28:58 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @alexvicegrab I'll give it a spin!

Hi everyone. I am deploying HL fabric network on kubernetes & facing the error below on joining peers with the channel.
For org1peer0 and org2peer0, joining is successful. But for org1peer1 and org2peer1 joining gives the error below.
  	Error: error getting endorser client for channel: endorser client failed to connect to blockchain-org1peer1:30112: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded


Any suggestions or fixes about the issue above?

Hi all! I have HLF running on Kubernetes  and got a problem during nodejs chaincode instantiation:
fabric-ccenv container hangs with "npm sill install loadAllDepsIntoIdealTree" message.

On the host "npm install" for the same chaincode works good, but it hangs in container.

Can anyone help?

Hi,
I am getting below error while installing chaincode from the peer.
Command - kubectl exec $PEER_POD -n peers -- bash -c 'peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 1.0 -p /var/chaincode/'

Error - error getting chaincode code mycc: command : failed with error: "exec: "go": executable file not found in $PATH"

Do I need to install GO in the peer container or machine, please suggest.

Hello everyone! I am trying to set up a multiple orderer with raft consensus with kubernetes. I have managed to bootstrap them and it seems that the first chain `testchainid` seems to connect with each orderer node but after somewhile it says that its no longer a TLS handshake happening. Some logs here when starting the orderer nodes:

Hi Fabric & k8s experts

I have a connection profile
`grpc://<ip-address>:<port>` works successfully
but `grpc://<k8s-service-name>:<port>` does not work
but I am able to ping and telnet `<k8s-service-name>:<port>`
in k8s, the ip address pods keep changing
thats why I am using service name
is there any work around or any solution to that?

Hey guys! We are running Hyperledger Composer and Hyperledger Fabric on Kubernetes. When Upgrading the Chaincode we suddenly get the error: ```Upgrading business network definition. This may take a minute...
Error: Error trying to upgrade business network. Error: No valid responses from any peers.
Response from attempted peer comms was an error: Error: failed to execute transaction bb7a720bccc7b646c4fa57774d0f72ae9e52898f364321b78a87c811ae4ffe30: error starting container: error starting container: cannot connect to Docker endpoint

@akshay.sood what type of service are you using?  Does your kubernetes service definition include a load balancer?  The following is from a working service in my environment
```
apiVersion: v1

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 14:49:36 GMT):<br/>
@akshay.sood I recommend starting with a "cli" pod in kubernetes and using the `peer` and `discover` command line programs to test out your network before troubleshooting further.  We use a pod with various configuration and certificates/msps stored in a PVC for management tasks (such as joining new members, upgrading/installing chaincode.  This setup has provide very helpful for a divide and conquer approach to troubleshooting internal vs external connectivity issues.  We use slightly customized version of  hyperledger-fabric-tools:amd64-1.4.0 for this purpose.

<p><strong>AndresMartinezMelgar.itcl</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 16:03:49 GMT):<br/>
Hi @iramiller  how work that "peer discover"
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 16:05:02 GMT):<br/>
`discover --configFile /tmp/savedconfig.yaml config --channel CHANNELNAME --server peer-0.NAMESPACE_NAME:7051`
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 16:05:44 GMT):<br/>
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/discovery-cli.html
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 16:06:59 GMT):<br/>
From a "cli" pod using `kubectl exec -it cli-pod-name-here -- bash` you can run the above command (subject to your config, etc -- if you need help with that I recommend reading the docs above)
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 16:10:56 GMT):<br/>
`discover --configFile /tmp/savedconfig.yaml  --peerTLSCA msp/tlscacerts/ca.pem --userKey msp/keystore/admin\@ORGNAME-key.pem  --userCert msp/admincerts/admin\@ORGNAME-cert.pem  --MSP root.ORGNAME saveConfig` will create the saved config if you have the right certs/setup ... look for the details in that docs page ...

Does the Fabric 2.0 Alpha include support fr k8s or is it stil the same bringup ?
</p>
<p><strong>NicolasHuray</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 19:47:05 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner Fabric is designed to run on any environment so I don't think the community is specially targeting Kubernetes. Nevertheless, the proposal for deploying chaincodes in  cloud native environment is a step in the right direction to streamline chaincodes deployment and should bring scalability and performance as well. Please read the document for more info : https://docs.google.com/document/d/14l-0jjxw0SLrkpgEuXr0ZxAn0BtTJAQTupXvVkeIL2s/edit

Pod won't start after installing the hlf-ca chart - anyone had this problem?  Error is 

Warning  FailedScheduling   11m (x4 over 12m)      default-scheduler   pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims (repeated 3 times)
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 14:36:06 GMT):<br/>
@LeeCherry you need to look at your list of PVCs in your cluster... you have something wrong with your storage provider/capacity which is causing a PVC to not bind to a PV.
</p>
<p><strong>LeeCherry</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 14:53:03 GMT):<br/>
Well, i'm new to k8s, but looking at the dashboard, it all looks ok, 1gib in size as the chart provisioned and a big green tick :-)
</p>
<p><strong>LeeCherry</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:18:22 GMT):<br/>
The PVC issue has gone away after deleting the helm chart, the other issue is that the dependant postgres db wants 256 memory and my memory limit "kubectl describe limitrange memory-limit-range" is 128.  Does postgres really need 256?
</p>
<p><strong>LeeCherry</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:29:49 GMT):<br/>
For anyone else with this issue, I fixed it with https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/memory-default-namespace/

</p>
<p><strong>AndresMartinezMelgar.itcl</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 06:28:38 GMT):<br/>
@duwenhui 
then look at the 2nd photo. There is a value called clusterip, which refers to the ip inside the cluster. It also lets you point to a specific port.
When you put loadBalancer and execute the service it returns a public IP from which you can access from outside the cluster

If you *just* want a nodeport, something simple like this will work
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: peer0-myorg
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - name: listen-endpoint
    protocol: TCP
    nodePort: 30011
    port: 7051
    targetPort: 7051
  - name: profile-endpoint
    protocol: TCP
    nodePort: 30012
    port: 9443
    targetPort: 9443
  selector:
    app: peer0-myorg
```

Exposes 7051 on 30011 and the metrics endpoint on 9443 on 30012. You can hit any of the ip addresses of the nodes in your cluster and it should just work.

Assumes your selector on the peer is `app: peer0-myorg` obviously. Change as required

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 15:22:41 GMT):<br/>
@duwenhui for external traffic routing you need to be looking at a loadbalancer and not nodeport... technically a load balancer will likely use node ports and iptables underneath and you are certainly welcome to implement your own load balancer from scratch but I suspect this is not what you are looking for.  Additionally I would not recommend exposing that operations endpoint (9443) to the public internet.  If you are just attempting to connect to this peer for development purposes from outside of your cluster have a look at the `kubefwd` project.

@iramiller  @aatkddny     @AndresMartinezMelgar.itcl   Thanks for Responding to my question.  I hava solved this problem . In fact,  the problem I met is about deployment. If you  set  spec.ClusterIP: None at the start with helm, Whaterver you modify the config online, k8s don't allow this.   So  I delete service, delete spec.ClusterIP,  set type: NodePort and It  works fine.

I am using fabric-ca to generate all the identities
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 18:38:35 GMT):<br/>
@ygnr peer memory usage depends heavily on the client API connecting to it and that programs use of connections (the Java SDK has caused us some challenges at times).  Additionally the usage patterns matter quite a bit ... adding new peer with a 100k blocks will be a much different load than 100s or 1000s of blocks.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 18:39:41 GMT):<br/>
That said we have been able to function very well with a range of memory utilization between 2-4GB (includes couch container which is in the same pod as our peer container)... during intensive activities our memory usage will trend as high as 10-20GB.

Hello all ,
On cli when i run 
`peer channel list`
i get below error 
`Error: Failed sending proposal, got rpc error: code = Unknown desc = access denied: channel [] creator org [Org1MSP]`

And when i am checking logs for peer0 
`MSP error: the supplied identity is not valid: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

What is the issue here. seems like certificate is not valid but i have generated them as per docs. I have deployed network on kubernetes
</p>

@Dhiraj1990 make sure you are passing the correct CA cert arg.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 22:32:06 GMT):<br/>
```

```
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 22:33:06 GMT):<br/>
and that any client auth certificates you are using are signed by a CA known to the peer.

And last ... you would have more luck with these types of questions that are not specific to the Kubernetes environment and the operation of Hyperledger Fabric in Kubernetes by posting them in a more appropriate channel.

Hi experts, I have setup a fabric cluster on kubernetes using helm charts. I could join the peers to a channel and install chaincode on it. However when I 'm instantiating the chaincode, I am not getting any error the chaincode container also starts successfully on the peer node but it's not registering himself with the peer container somehow. So when I do peer chaincode list --instantiated -C mychannel... I don't see anything. Am I missing some env here?

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 02 May 2019 15:54:41 GMT):<br/>
@JorgeNavarro you need to ensure that your current user that is applying that configuration has the appropriate RBAC roles granted. Your user must have all of the permissions listed that you are attempting to grant to that new service account.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 02 May 2019 15:56:58 GMT):<br/>
The easiest way to get all of those rights is to make sure your user has ClusterAdmin (or equivalent role depending on your Kubernetes install).  If you are not the owning system administrator (or group) then you are going to need to ask one of those members to create this for you.

you need to put cordns cluster ip in docker configuration default path
</p>
<p><strong>Ramrockez143</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 09:21:23 GMT):<br/>

# Docker configuration

  Since instantiating chaincode requires a container created by docker And this container needs to communicate with the peer svc in k8s, so additional configuration is required.


# Configure docker configuration to modify the docker option DOCKER_OPTS 

 Add --dns in the DOCKER_OPTS to add the ip of the dns in k8s

# Use DOCKER_OPTS to modify the daemon startup options in file /etc/default/docker

DOCKER_OPTS="--dns=10.96.0.10 --dns=172.17.0.1 --dns-search kubernetes --dns-search kubernetes.default --dns-search kubernetes.default.svc --dns-search kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local  --dns-search ec2.internal --dns-opt ndots:2 --dns-opt timeout:2 --dns-opt attempts:2"

@Ramrockez143 thanks. That worked, but having with mTLS with the same n/w. Have you ever tried mTLS with kubernetes?
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 09:45:52 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller and @yacovm very informative discussion thanks. @iramiller I wanted to have a similar setup, I did try with nginx ingress controller with cert manager to automatically manage the tls certs. Though I want a service mess but I feel it would be overkill for our small deployment. Nginx thing didn't work both while trying to terminate the tls at the ingress and even on the peer container. Always failed with a tls handshake error. 

So I am thinking of giving isitio a try with tls being managed by istio/envoy. Does that work in your setup w/o code changes in peers/orderers? I am afraid for mTLS since the Kubernetes NATing might do something with the hostnames/Ips. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:24:03 GMT):<br/>
We are using Istio with the rest of our systems but have not integrated it with Hyperledger (yet).  If I were going to attempt this I would use the Citadel to generate certificates and store them in a secret/configmap and mount this into the peer container.  The peer would then start and use these certificates per the normal process.

The approach of using the sidecar will not work with the peer as the peer expects the secure communication to be terminated directly with the peer.  The Istio mesh will work with the other end of the connection (depending on the caller) to inject mutual TLS certificates which the peer is expecting.

My current project is a custom BCCSP integration for HashiCorp Vault that provides certificate storage as well as PKI integration.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:29:10 GMT):<br/>
For our needs the Hyperledger Fabric project unfortunately does not align well with an enterprise cloud systems approach and we are continually applying quite a bit of software development effort to make it do these things (native Kubernetes chain code pods and infrastructure, real load balancing and failover, routing, advanced monitoring, etc).
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:30:52 GMT):<br/>
For anyone else who wants to integrate Fabric into their environment in this way (strong Kubernetes support, Istio, Vault/PKI)  I caution them to understand that it will be a significant amount of work that will be ongoing.

I agree @iramiller but also for a complex production solution it's completely necessary
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:34:14 GMT):<br/>
It is my opinion that the majority of resources for the Hyperledger project are (or at least were) focused on small demonstration system projects that run on a developer workstation in docker and are not meant for long term production use.

<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 04:46:18 GMT):<br/>
I think Fabric can very well cater to large production systems already. It has all the building blocks, its just that scaling the components being a permissioned blockchain is a pain and GRPC loadbalancing didnt work for me as I was expecting it to for the orderers, so everytime I add an orderer I need not update the channel defination.

HI,
I have configured peer node to expose metrics on 127.0.0.1:9443 and I am able to access it from inside the peer container (wget 127.0.0.1/metrics). 
I tried exposing it using loadbalancer service(by confguring 9443 port in service) but not able to access metrics.
HL Network is on Kubernetes.
Is there any better way to expose them to outside.

<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 10:31:27 GMT):<br/>
@Ramrockez143  Is it working? How are you authenticating the client against the server. Say my client here is the peer and orderer is the server. Also are you using any ingress controller? I am always getting a TLS handshake error. 
</p>
<p><strong>Ramrockez143</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 12:01:15 GMT):<br/>
no 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:04:10 GMT):<br/>
It is absolutely possible--I am part of a several hundred million dollar blockchain company using Hyperledger as part of its solution.  As you say, the building blocks are present and yet a deeply experienced team will be required to make them work. Further, in a few specific cases rewriting and replacing components of the system is required.  And don't forget that a significant amount of operational support infrastructure will be needed for ongoing management (scripts, installation/configuration files, etc).

Did anyone run Fabric 2.0 alpha on K8s yet? Etcd with tls pinning would be a challenge. 
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 11:13:37 GMT):<br/>
I have managed to deploy Fabric 1.4.1 with Raft consensus in K8s, which implements etcd only in TLS mode. Haven't got time to look for 2.0 alpha but does it make a huge difference with TLS pinning? I am not familiar with the concept of TLS pinning. Would that help?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 11:14:02 GMT):<br/>
@AshishMishra 1  why is TLS pinning a challenge? 
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 11:29:58 GMT):<br/>
@vanitas92 etcd used TLS pinning by default. So you are already using it. :) 
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 11:33:03 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm because I 've been already facing issues with mutual TLS in fabric. So was skeptical about etcd would go down easy with the tls. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 11:35:16 GMT):<br/>
what are the issues? do you have TLS termination?
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 12:03:39 GMT):<br/>
No, I 'm using a nginx ingress with nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "GRPCS" 
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 12:03:54 GMT):<br/>
which is supposed to proxy the grpc traffic directly to the peer container. 
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 12:06:48 GMT):<br/>
and even my peer is having trouble to connect to itself... Like the peer channel list throws a tls error.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 13:41:40 GMT):<br/>
@Ramrockez143 you can certainly stand up multiple orderers but you won't be making a kubernetes load balancer work in the traditional sense (one dns round robin across all available instances) due to issues with mTLS.
</p>

My recommendation would be to follow the design and setup guides and keep kubernetes aspects contained in the pod/container scheduling areas and try to stick with one-to-one mappings on the DNS side. (orderer-0.namespace, orderer-1.namespace, etc).

in general though even though the approach is working very well for us it isn't an approach (managing a fabric fork) that I would recommend for most people.  The 2.0 platform has improvements planned for this process which will hopefully make things better for everyone.  These changes are not compatible with the approach we are currently using for Kubernetes and as such we will have to re-engineer our approach

@vanitas92 we have 10 different production kubernetes clusters communicating across Azure, Amazon, and Google Kubernetes services.  We use a private VPN solution implemented with Wireguard.  We have explored Istio as well (and are using it with other services in our infrastructure) but we have not implemented it with Fabric at this time.  Based on my initial research  Istio would be severely limited in capability when integrated with Hyperledger as designed today.  The TLS certificate management pieces of Istio would likely be the only real benefit at this point.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 14:33:58 GMT):<br/>
While it is arguably more work we are not exposing any of the blockchain service endpoints (orderer, peer) directly to the internet but instead run custom API instances inside our network and expose those instead.  This provides an interface we control, exposed over protocols that are friendly to the network load balancers, and run over Istio for enterprise level features.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 14:39:58 GMT):<br/>
The most useful integration capability that Istio could bring to Fabric (without extensive modifications) is probably certificate management.  A separate evaluation of certificate management needs within our consortium have lead us to explore a Hashicorp Vault integrated with a custom MSP/BCCSP plugin.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 14:44:27 GMT):<br/>
My experience working directly within the Hyperledger code base on this plugin has lead me to believe that this type of work is a little bit ahead of the curve and will be substantially easier once the Fabric code base matures.  The HLF team is well aware of these issues and is actively working to make things better: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-12246

@iramiller - in Fabric, the channel  certificates used for verification of transactions are stored in the Blockchain, so you cannot use Istio or anything like that to manage them.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 19:56:31 GMT):<br/>
root / intermediate TLS CAs that are used to trust other organizations, are also (currently) derived from the Blockchain. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 19:57:34 GMT):<br/>
the whole point of Fabric is that it has decentralized management - you can make it so you can only modify the channel configuration if the majority of organizations vote on it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 19:57:50 GMT):<br/>
isn't Istio centrally managed? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 19:58:45 GMT):<br/>
another issue is that while Fabric uses x509 certificates _ now _, the MSP design doesn't tie you to use only x509 certificates

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 21:12:21 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm (1,2) the PUBLIC keys are stored in blockchain, how the PRIVATE keys are managed is the primary concern of those who would be interested in a Hashicorp Vault or Istio Citadel solution. (3) the member is free to manage their certificates in a secure and well controlled way while distributing the public keys for updates in the normal hyperledger way (votes on updates). (4) Istio is a useful method for securing and monitoring infrastructure communication.  While I often describe the members in my network as 'mine' I use this characterization because I have defined the processing and architecture used by members. The members would be in control of their own instances of Istio.

why are they not designed for HA ? can you give an example? 
The latest v1.4.1 comes with a Raft orderer, and peers monitor each other and can tell the SDK (via service discovery) which peers are alive and which peers are not, etc.

The difficulties being discussed in the 'cloud native' FAB-13582 design document for load balancing and additionally the issues raised for a implementing Raft with external TLS management stem from a fundamental design issue.  If these concepts were implemented with high availability in mind the transport layer would not be the defining identity, the signature on the content would be instead
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 14:26:14 GMT):<br/>
A payload signed by an identity is equally valid when delivered by any common transport (secured or not -- although I am absolutely not advocating abandoning TLS).  Proper isolation of the concerns of transport security from the blockchain functional operations would greatly simplify cloud deployment while providing additional flexibility.

> by focusing on the specific instance being connected to by name (i.e. peer-1.org) instead of a common endpoint (i.e. peer.org) the high availability and load balancing concepts of cloud platforms break down.

So that's exactly why I think the cloud approach of having a common endpoint that abstracts out the "backend" endopoint is simply wrong for a permissioned Blockchain platform like Fabric.
If everything is hosted in your home cloud environment - the cloud approach you describe works very well.
However - the endpoint can belong to a different organization than yourself, and when that endpoint "changes location" - that organization is not going to update "your cloud" about its new location, right? Now, if you have a small amount of organiztions - 2 or 3, it might be useful to model the peers as logical endpoints and not have them mimic real servers (such as Fabric does), however - as the number of parties in the channel grows - the advantage for this diminishes. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:19:33 GMT):<br/>
You're basically asking - why does Fabric treat endpoints as servers, and not as resources like everywhere in the modern world
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:20:00 GMT):<br/>
so first of all - the orderer endpoints that are client facing can be modeled like this
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:20:33 GMT):<br/>
peer.domain.com doesn't change ... the signature of blocks delivered should be  `peer of member` ... that doesn't change ... the instance doing the work (one or more) is what can change ... that detail does not matter to a calling member.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:20:33 GMT):<br/>
but in Raft - that's not going to work, because we require mutual TLS between endpoints, because every replica "counts"

There is more to Fabric node authentication than signatures and verification.

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:22:19 GMT):<br/>
For instance, gossip enforces mutual TLS because Fabric is x509 independent, but we use mutual TLS. That means, that to identify a peer you have to bind the TLS certificate to the peer's non x509 (in theory, right?) identity
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:24:47 GMT):<br/>
I agree, btw - that the chaincode deployment and runtime architecture can improve
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:24:50 GMT):<br/>
Raft is a different animal by its very nature ... in a cloud of course instances need to be free to come and go and in fact that is the essence of the algorithm.  Making that work at all was a hard job and kudos to the team for getting that done.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:25:24 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:25:29 GMT):<br/>
I don't know that there would be an elegant solution in the cloud environments for that that still provides the guarantees a blockchain needs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:25:29 GMT):<br/>
there are no API calls for Raft
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:25:39 GMT):<br/>
it just "knows" what it needs to replicate, and replicates it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:26:15 GMT):<br/>
each replica figures out which channels it should join, and replicates them when it joins the cluster as a fresh node
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:26:35 GMT):<br/>
The ideal of a cloud environment is no special specific instances ... any instance can come and go at any time... that doesn't fit well with any solution that targets a specific instance
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:27:03 GMT):<br/>
well, you know that classical consensus algorithms dictate certain conditions. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:27:37 GMT):<br/>
one of them, is that a replica has state and an identity and cannot be replaced by another identity.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:27:46 GMT):<br/>
this has very severe implications for DR 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:28:04 GMT):<br/>
if you run Raft you better have 3 or more availability zones, or a backup of some of the private keys
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:28:25 GMT):<br/>
because if half of the nodes are destroyed forever, the cluster is dead 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:29:10 GMT):<br/>
the classic example I use locally is that a blockchain is super secure when it is running ... and make sure you doing 'lock your keys in your car' or it is a very secure and useless large object

You might want to look into Terraform ... we have been using this to handle our multi-cloud deployments.  Shipping a Terraform script to a new org to bootstrap their cluster is great because there are so many steps required that a script is the only way to ensure things are done the same way every time... also good for quickly building/rebuilding test and development environments.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 14:36:26 GMT):<br/>
Related: microk8s has been fantastic for our development kubernetes environments.  We spin up a large VM in the cloud and lay down a full cluster on it then turn the keys over to a developer.  This gives them a very easy to reset environment for testing chaincode/channels/new applications without impacting others as would be the case if they were using our integration or QA networks.

We use our own self-signed root/intermediate CA.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 14:32:59 GMT):<br/>
We do not have issues with TLS (or mutual TLS) in our setup.  The external facing APIs which provide business methods on top of the blockchain run as standard HTTP(S) web services and use a public CA root to pin their certificates
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 14:41:37 GMT):<br/>
Our configtx (system-channel configuration) endpoints are all using internal DNS names.  As a private blockchain network we have not needed to expose hyperledger endpoints directly to the internet.  

Business processes that invoke chain code are exposed with custom REST APIs which are easy to handle with traditional Kubernetes orchestration.  While a message/event based API would be really powerful and a closer match to what the blockchain is actually doing we have contained that complexity behind basic request/reply methods that are easier for a wider audience of developers to integrate with. The more specific needs of routing and load balancing against various peer and orderer endpoints are wrapped up in our own internal SDK which is shared out for members to use when connecting to Hyperledger to build their own APIs.

Hi all, if the peer pods in the kubernetes cluster is down, what is the best way to bring it up again with the same msp?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:24:18 GMT):<br/>
@JayJong ... not much to go on in your statement ... but I would recommend that your MSP files are stored in a secret which is mounted into the peer pod.  This is also how you should handle configuration, either through extensive ENV vars mapped from a configmap or as the configfile mounted into the peer pod.

Can you plz share your configtx.yaml file.

<p><strong>raj_shekhar</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:19:41 GMT):<br/>
To enable ssl using ingress you can do below.
1. Get cert and keys from the letsencrypt (open source and free)
2. create secret of cert in K8s - kubectl create secret tls ${CERT_NAME} --key ${KEY_FILE} --cert ${CERT_FILE}
3. Configure the ingress with hosts and secret like below
   tls:
- hosts:
- app.example.com
secretName: cert-secret

Does anyone have a yaml file for a raft orderer they'd be willing to share? I'm struggling to parse the changes vs the kafka setup and would dearly love to kickstart this process without a bunch of trial and error.  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 14:20:55 GMT):<br/>
@aatkddny just look at the section of etcdraft in orderer.yaml and the cluster section in orderer.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 15:15:46 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm - I was referring to the actual k8s yaml definition file.  
I've been looking at the config file you checked in on mar 23 in sampleconfig/orderer.yaml. 
I need to relate that to a real k8s deployment file. The one I have for kafka externalizes all the overrides, rather than passing in the configuration (since I never figured out how to do that) and I was trying to avoid a trial and error time suck moving that to this. My kubernetes-fu is more of the "if stack overflow didn't work, google is your friend" variety here.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 15:16:12 GMT):<br/>
ah... no, don't have such a file, sorry.

@aatkddny I am not exactly sure what kind of k8s file you are looking for ... but you can embed the yaml config files from hyperledger inside of a configmap yaml file using the standard indentation method for scope ... then map that configmap into the container as  a file ...  is that what you are trying to do?

<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:29:11 GMT):<br/>
I wasn't - mainly because I was set up to override the defaults using viper(?). 
Mostly because I hacked at my docker-compose files until they worked. 
If there's a pattern to embed the config files directly I'd happily pivot to do that.

</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:35:37 GMT):<br/>
in your deployment use
```
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /etc/hyperledger/peer
          name: my-config-file
```
then make your config files roughly like this helm example

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:36:39 GMT):<br/>
the issue we found with relying on the ENV configs is mostly due to the fact that settings are not discoverable nor are there any consistency checks for misspelled entries
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:37:21 GMT):<br/>
so we put a bunch of work into creating config files set the way we wanted so that a platform default wouldn't accidentally step in and break our production or test environments
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:37:34 GMT):<br/>
I autogen all mine from an application I wrote. We have quite a number of these things and management was an issue. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:37:54 GMT):<br/>
of course all of our deployments are scripted/managed
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:38:08 GMT):<br/>
but it is still very nice for auditing to have everything in the config file consistent
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:39:26 GMT):<br/>
You are way ahead of us in that department.

You are way ahead of us in that department. 
I do have code to generate the scripts, but here the problem is I need to change the templating every time there's a new version and that's where the rub is. 
I'm struggling to figure out where to start in this case. It's probably very simple if I can find a -compose version to hack at but even that I'm finding tough to find. Too new.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:42:03 GMT):<br/>
honestly we lost quite a bit of ground building on the docker-compose and script file approach a year ago ... eventually I did a parallel build up of helm charts and HashiCorp Terraform scripting for the major components (peer, orderer, etc) and when test was working we did a full cut over
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:43:10 GMT):<br/>
so many headaches just getting a clean repeatable deployment prior to investing in that process.  it isn't that it can't be done its just that the Kubernetes environment for production is quite a bit different use case than the proof of concept docker-compose systems
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:44:06 GMT):<br/>
the unfortunate part of what we have done is that our scripts and charts are highly specific to our environments and not very useful for the community at large ...
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:44:49 GMT):<br/>
but I am happy to share pieces or experience to those doing something similar ... as a startup there just isn't time with how fast we are moving to build up a good generic system ... 
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 18:54:01 GMT):<br/>
I may have not been as clear as I might have been. I used the docker-compose examples to give me the parameters I needed to build templates for my kubernetes setups. my app generates the k8s yaml files for each of the orgs from these - so i can deploy everything with kubectl - and a set of bash scripts that i can run to do this in 3 stages - i found i needed to let the mysql ca db(s) initialize because i couldn't get them inside the same pod as the ca and i needed to let kafka settle down before starting the orderers, so it required 3 scripts in all. We don't use a lot of containerization in house, and we are just starting using helm a year or so after this was developed, so it is all a bit of a hack. 
If I ever get time I'll do proper helm templates for it all, but right now I just need to get orderers with raft up and running.   
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 19:02:21 GMT):<br/>
we are still not using Raft yet internally for various reasons ... probably similar story to why you haven't built up helm charts for everything .. broken stuff gets first priority followed by features that make money ... refinements are always down the list until something makes them critical...
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 19:03:19 GMT):<br/>
from what I saw of the orderer piece with regards to raft it will require a completely new deployment setup that doesn't use much of our existing orderer deployment setup... 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 19:04:25 GMT):<br/>
the pinned TLS and blockchain updates to make changes will require a pretty significant investment in scripting/integration to adopt as our TLS certificates have typically rotated on a more frequent basis.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 19:06:03 GMT):<br/>
when we finally get around to fully working through the raft upgrade process I am sure I will know more.  At the moment the CA challenges you mentioned our of a greater concern to us and we have been working to adopt HashiCorp Vault instead of fabric_ca as it's feature set makes the security team happy and the many cloud environment backing stores make DevOps happy.

@aatkddny and anyone who is interested, find here my config using a RAFT cluster in Kubernetes that is working. Apart from setting the genesis block to etcdraft consensus and node names, the config for each orderer is as follows:
```yaml

<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 21:09:51 GMT):<br/>
The most important setting is the last three options: `ORDERER_GENERAL_CLUSTER_*`, they enable the certificates necesary to establish a RAFT cluster
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 21:10:21 GMT):<br/>
Is the same certificates if you enable TLS in your network
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 22:32:00 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller so basically none of your fabric end-points are exposed to public. So in case of a multi-org scenario where the other party is hosting their own fabric can't communicate with your fabric n/w unless they use a VPN kind of thing? 
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 22:35:30 GMT):<br/>
@vanitas92 did you try something like envoy or linkerd ? I did a POC about a year ago to proxy the grpc traffic transparently to the peer node. It worked but created a lot of overhead to maintain it, so dropped it. Sadly I don't have any configuration with me. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 22:50:11 GMT):<br/>
@AshishMishra 1 ... as a private blockchain consortium there are many steps that would be required before someone could participate (including the generation of certificates).  The setup of a secure wireguard tunnel actually simplifies the integration story between some of our members as approving internet access to these endpoints is a more complicated process than the private network config.
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 23:58:19 GMT):<br/>
@vanitas92 Thanks for that. Let me see if that gets me any further forward.

</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 19:36:03 GMT):<br/>
@hanubc7743 maybe ask in the #fabric-peer-endorser-committer channel as that doesn't have anything to do with kubernetes.  Before you ask though you might take a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/ledger/util/couchdb/couchdb.go and think about what it would take to write your own interface to Oracle
</p>
<p><strong>iamksseo</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 08:00:48 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for that.
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 09:43:16 GMT):<br/>
My case completely relies on internet since each organization is hosting their own infraestructure on premises or public clouds so need to protect the endpoints somehow. We are already using TLS over grpc but the endpoint is directly exposed to the internet and this concerns me.
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 09:44:52 GMT):<br/>
@AshishMishra 1 so with envoy is possible to proxy to peers? how does it handle with TLS over grpc? Any remarkable experience? Thanks guys!
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 18:14:38 GMT):<br/>
@vanitas92 yes, I did make that work with envoy but it was a one to one mapping. So for each peer you need to have one envoy running. If I remember correctly I did use some SNI or some hostname overwriting to make it transparent to envoy. I wish I had the configurations with me. :| 
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 18:17:38 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller yes, what you are saying is absolutely correct but what I am looking to achieve is more of a C2C model and not a B2B, so having a vpn or firwall based rules would be an overkill. What I wanted is users to freely run peers exposed to internet but via a proxy which would provide an additional layer of protection to prevent against attacks such as DDOS or TCP flood etc. 
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 18:20:44 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller how is the vault working for you? I was thinking also to adopt something like vault which is more secure than k8s secrets which I am using right now. Also did that need any changes in the fabric code? thanks. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 18:28:18 GMT):<br/>
@AshishMishra 1 the wireguard vpn connection works similar to what you describe ... an internet facing port and traffic secured by preshared EC keys.  I use a NAT style methodology implemented with IPTables to route traffic avoiding any Layer 7 incompatibilities.  Ideally this entire configuration would be wrapped up in a custom Kubernetes ingress controller...  I have not done this though nor have I looked for an implementation of it recently.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 18:30:49 GMT):<br/>
back when I designed our network architecture I was very surprised that no one had implemented a wireguard ingress controller (that I could find).  The expedient method for implantation in a cross cloud way was using a small VM that was dual homed on the pod and external networks.

<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 20:24:08 GMT):<br/>
@AshishMishra 1 ok thanks! That is exactly what i want to achieve, kinda like a microservice architechture so its okay to have one to one mapping. At least would be some improvement for now. The certificates are the same in both peer and envoy server in front of him?
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 20:54:33 GMT):<br/>
@vanitas92 I think I used the tcp_proxy filter in envoy which acts as a pass through for tls traffic, so envoy doesn't have to do anything for the TLS. It's been a long time and I barely remember anything. Maybe some with a good experience with Envoy will be able to help better.

</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 12:26:44 GMT):<br/>
The problem for those following along was that I was trying to put my orderers in with the peers - I have a consortium requirement. 
There's a mismatch in the configtx org definition when you put the peerOrganization msp in the MSPDir profile in the org because you have peers but then have it use ordererOrganization certs to generate the genesis block because you want it to have orderers too. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 21:22:40 GMT):<br/>
configtxlater is in the `us.gcr.io/provenance-io/hyperledger-fabric-tools` image ... you should be able to start and run an instance using that image ... or just run it locally via shell/shell scripts as needed ... at least that has been our approach.

you are using peer cli to perform these operations? Just check the PEER MSP ID tag there .

I'm not sure it's the correct answer, but I got round this by having my crypto config files look something like this:
```
      - Hostname: raft0
        CommonName: "{{.Hostname}}-{{.Domain}}"      
        SANS:
          - "{{.Hostname}}"

Has anyone managed to get the java sdk to talk to a raft orderer inside k8s up to the point where you create a channel (which I can do) and then install and instantiate chaincode (which doesn't work so well)? 
Or am I the first - which explains why I keep running across problems.

@yacovm This is a single node k8s install running locally on my mac. 
The fabric touchpoints - peers and orderers are exposed as nodeports. 

This part of the my application is running on the same machine and using the HFClient in the java sdk to create a channel dynamically - which appears to work - and then load and instantiate chaincode on the same - which is running into problems. You need to read the second entry to get to where my real issue lies here.

And anticipating your question - the sdk doesn't support using an ingress. There's a chunk of code with a TODO in it for same.

To help clarify - inside k8s the two peers for this org - peer0-org and peer1-org are at 10.1.6.240 and 10.1.6.241 respectively. 

And since I spent a little time looking at it this morning, the problem here was that I switched to using core.yaml to define the peer and the chaincode listen address was commented out.
Setting it to localhost:7052 fixes this error and gets me to this one instead. This is the log from peer1- now at 10.1.6.243 with peer0- at 10.1.6.242

The error in the SDK is coming from the X509 Cert - `java.io.IOException: No extension found with name NetscapeCertType`
It's in the peer eventing stuff, which means the machine keeps throwing threads as you try to look at it, but it all stems from it trying to send a discovery request.

@aatkddny so I opened a JIRA to make peers publish custom endpoints for discovery to publish along with what it publishes now

so you can configure peers to use localhost and the ports

<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:49:41 GMT):<br/>
I really need the java sdk to support an ingress tbh. I have a jira for that in already. FAB-15877.

This problem - now I have a few minutes to look at it - is coming from service discovery in peer eventing inside the java sdk. 
I'll move my observations and question over there. It's out of scope for this.

My question here still stands though.
I know the java sdk is the read-headed stepchild of fabric, but has anyone managed to get it working talking to the latest hlf inside kubernetes. 
By working I mean up to and including adding orgs dynamically, creating channels and installing and instantiating chaincode working.
Ours was fine until moving to raft - mostly because we glossed over the complexities of securing everything. Now it's been a litany of problems and a total time suck.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 17:07:41 GMT):<br/>
@AndresMartinezMelgar.itcl multiple nodes meaning multiple Kubernetes clusters? That is going to be a complex thing to do at least until FAB-15877 is completed and/or support for ingress methods is in place.
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 03:59:44 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller I have deployed it
</p>
<p><strong>AndresMartinezMelgar.itcl</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 06:06:49 GMT):<br/>
Hi iramiller
I do not mean multiple Kubernetes clusters, but rather that the network is distributed on several computers and that the information is shared through the network, not a shared folder.
The vast majority of examples I have seen are done with docker using shared volumes for the information (so the network is not distributed but is centralized)
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 14:50:53 GMT):<br/>
I believe the helm charts that someone made will do away with the shared volume configuration... those are published in the central helm registry and are a good reference if you are just getting started building up a HLF install in kubernetes.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 14:52:48 GMT):<br/>
@pankajcheema -- we have a dozen different cloud instances for member orgs all working together each with 3 peers, etc. distributed across Azure, AWS, and GKE ... it is certainly possible to do but not something that should be considered straight forward.

do mean some sort of actual specific physical disk or simply assign a consistent PVC/PV ?

<p><strong>JorgeNavarro</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:21:32 GMT):<br/>
i mean, i assign a disk to a pv, but if i have more than one pv with a disk assigned, my pvcs goes to a pv randomly, can we specify in which pv the pvc should go?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 16:41:10 GMT):<br/>
you could get specific with sizes ... but I am not sure why you care which pv goes to which PVC as they have to be bound first before they can be used and once bound they should stay linked...

I need a little help to figure out where to stick a jira.
Has anyone had any luck with service discovery and k8s at all?
The reason I'm asking pertains to my post a few above this. If I run without SD I can install and instantiate some chain code (I'll get round to actually testing it later today).
If I run with SD it fails miserably with a bunch of this stuff

I just got back to HLF. Had to take a detour onto a different project. 

I need a little help to figure out where to stick a jira.

Has anyone had any luck with service discovery, raft ordering and k8s at all?
The reason I'm asking pertains to my post a few above this. I found that if I run without SD I can install and instantiate chaincode just the same as I could before I detoured into raft hell. (I'll get round to actually testing it later today).

```

If I look in the peer logs it doesn't seem to like the IP address that it has - it's giving a bunch of stuff that looks like this `authentication handshake failed: x509: certificate is valid for 127.0.0.1, not 10.1.6.241`

So my question boils down to whether this has worked for anyone that doesn't use the java sdk, or if it is an actual hyperledger - vs that particular sdk - issue. It obviously needs to be fixed, I'm just unsure which particular group needs to know about it.

<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 00:27:31 GMT):<br/>
NM - it happens with a kafka setup without tls too. Can't imagine that hasn't been tested, so it's most likely either the SDK or user error.

Hello! Two questions: 1. What would happen to instantiated chaincodes and the ledger itself if peer is restarted on different pod or being rescheduled? Did anyone test such behaviour in k8s. 2. Is there way do decouple peer's state DB to keep it separately as persistent data?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 16:00:07 GMT):<br/>
@ihormudryy you will want to setup your kubernetes peer deployments with all of their state on mounted volumes so that when the peer restarts / moves to another node the state information follows.  If you are using the <=1.4.x series of HLF with peer managed chain code instances scheduled via docker on the host itself then you will likely find chaincode instance management within a kubernetes cluster to have some additional challenges especially if you are on small instances where resource limitations come into play.  For our environments we patched that docker scheduling of chaincode containers out for one that used kubernetes managed deployments so I can not provide much advice on those pieces.  There are others in this channel that are running the stock HLF though with success so it can be done.
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 00:18:54 GMT):<br/>
WRT the state database - you can run a couch database for state and map to a pvc. We run in the peer node as a secondary container. 
I'll throw you a bone - the config looks like this for a single peer-db instance. 
```
- name: blockcouchdbpeer1
        image: hyperledger/fabric-couchdb
        env:
        - name: COUCHDB_USER

WRT 1: iirc - to get round the chaincode issue we map the dind directory to persistent (local on my machine or nfs in a cluster) storage. It seems to survive peer restarts without too much angst that way. I'll need to go back and see what we did for that - it was a while ago - if you can't figure it out.

Why do you use NFS for DinD storage. Can we use just persistent directory or this storage should be shared between all peers?
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:34:03 GMT):<br/>
Because I can't control which peer it gets mapped to. This allows me to not care if it restarts on another peer.

I would like to know how you guyz are dealing with "." notation with the hostnames in kubernetes deployment
</p>
<p><strong>Chandoo</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:33:22 GMT):<br/>
How the dns alises being used in the deployment
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:40:21 GMT):<br/>
@Chandoo ... We use `pod_name.namespace` i.e. `peer-2.memberorgname` in our environments ... we route all of our blockchain platform call on the inside of the Kubernetes network and do not expose these services directly on the internet which makes things much easier... 
</p>
<p><strong>Chandoo</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:47:59 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller : thank you, I got it
</p>
<p><strong>Chandoo</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:50:36 GMT):<br/>
I am migrating from docker swarm to kubernetes. in swarm they created wired names that includes hostname.env.extraname.domainname, all the bootstrapping scripts are being auto generated with that wired name. I am dealing with it right now. I am recommending changes to similar to what you suggested.
</p>
<p><strong>Chandoo</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:51:50 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller : how you are routing the service layer that is comming from internet into the cluster reaching the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 17:00:16 GMT):<br/>
@Chandoo we use a wireguard VPN connection on a host that is dual homed with the pod network/public internet in each of our member cloud environments  and then point other member services (peers, ca, etc as well as orderers) using the `service.membername` format for services that have custom endpoints point to addresses on the wireguard vpn IP ... which then forwards this traffic directly into the destination member cluster to the kubernetes service reference that points to the pod/container instance ...  this in effect means that any member can resolve any other member's services in any of the other clouds [GKE, EKS, AKS] and route directly to them all while using a fully encrypted single IP/port tunnel interface
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 17:02:08 GMT):<br/>
This environment has worked very well for us especially with certain banking partners that have extremely tight network access control policies.  We have well over a dozen different member org instances in different public clouds/availability zones all over that are built on this setup.
</p>
<p><strong>Chandoo</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 17:41:54 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Salaria_77</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 04:39:15 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller No i am creating replicas of the single peer.  I have a org with single peer0 and i am creating 3 replicas of single peer0, but couchdb is only addressing single replica at a time.

@iramiller No i am creating replicas of the single peer.  I have a org with single peer0 and i am creating 3 replicas of single peer0, but couchdb is only addressing single replica at a time. It looks like concurrency is not supported.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 14:41:41 GMT):<br/>
make sure that you are separating your peers and couchdb instances by namespace (one namespace for each org) and then verify your peer configuration uses  `couchdb.orgnamespace` for the connection
</p>
<p><strong>Salaria_77</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 04:41:57 GMT):<br/>
I am working with only one organization right now.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 14:33:47 GMT):<br/>
If you are only working with a single org then you would have a single namespace ... and each peer should be uniquely named, and have its own state store ... in my setup I use a stateful set with each instance having two containers--one peer and one couchdb.  This approach ensure that the state store is local to the peer instance and provides some additional scheduling restrictions within kubernetes for how the instances are scheduled and disks are assigned.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 14:35:00 GMT):<br/>
With the above setup set to 3 replicas I have `peer-0.namespace`, `peer-1.namespace` and `peer-2.namespace` where the `namespace` is the name of my organization (by convention)
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 21:33:39 GMT):<br/>
You can always stick a couchdb instance inside each pod for the peers. That way it'll self-segregate. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 23:17:58 GMT):<br/>
@aatkddny - that is what I am referring to with the two container approach above. This setup means it is a localhost call to talk to couchdb which is a useful optimization as well.
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 12:03:22 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller that's what i figured, but the bit where you started talking about namespacing confused me to the point that I wrote my own response... 
</p>
<p><strong>Salaria_77</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 12:14:36 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller - It means i have to add new peers to the org with newly generated crypto material and those peers will be identified as diff entities inside the organisation.  What i want is to use replicas feature in deployment or statefulset so that i can have single peer entity replicated inside the cluster. 
</p>
<p><strong>Salaria_77</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 12:24:07 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller - I think in my case one peer replica  is locking the couch or level db, that's why only one replica work at one time reset enter CrashLoopBackOff .
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 14:52:58 GMT):<br/>
@Salaria_77 if you are trying use a single peer registration and the replicas feature to load balance or provide fault tolerance I don't believe you are going to have any success... those questions should probably be posed to the #fabric-peer-endorser-committer channel.
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 18:39:46 GMT):<br/>
just aheads up in case anyone is using - or gets "upgraded" to a newer version of docker:dind as a sidecar. 
be aware that docker set tls as a default after 18.09 so if you were using port 2375 without any env overrides it stops working unless you revert to an older version. 
</p>
<p><strong>Salaria_77</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 03:51:44 GMT):<br/>

Hello,

I’m currently trying to deploy a fabric network on kubernetes (which I’m learning while doing that so I might have missed something ^^) and I’m struggling with one part …

I don’t want to use cryptogen to pre-generate all the certificates and then mount them into the different pods but use fabric-ca to generate them .

So … how the hell am I supposed to do that ? Like ok, I can generate the certificates via the fabric-client enroll command on those CA but then how can I take the generated certificates and put them into the peer/orderer pods ?

Thanks :)

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 12:55:54 GMT):<br/>
You can create a kubernetes secret from an MSP folder on your local system and then mount that as a volume on your peer and orderer nodes.  See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-files-from-a-pod for more info on using secrets as files.

You can also use an init container to run the fabric-ca-client to enroll the user and generate the secret there as well.

You can also choose to only store the private key as a secret and all of the public key material can be stored on a mounted persistent volume

@DennisM330 assuming you are running Fabric V1.x you will hit several issues around permissions and the docker in docker problem.  These workarounds have worked for me. 
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 13:58:53 GMT):<br/>
Look to use Secrets and ConfigMaps to replace host mounts

Use NFS mounts where needed
  oc adm policy add-scc-to-user hostmount-anyuid -z default
Replace docker-compose, docker calls with:
  kubectl , oc, podman,Buildah, kompose
Convert docker-compose.yaml files with kompose
  kompose convert --provider=openshift -f
  Then edit and merge files

HLF on kubernetes using more native methods of embedding MSP crypto material into secrets and config maps is a bit more of a dark art for the GO SDK clients. Core HLF components are fairly easy to get going with the hlf helm charts.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 17:57:25 GMT):<br/>
A useful technique I use for configmap/secret work in Kubernetes peers has been to use a custom startup script for the peer containers that performs some additional setup prior to invoking the peer command.  This script itself is stored in a config map mounted into the container to avoid the need for custom packaging.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 17:58:50 GMT):<br/>
in my humble opinion, the hlf helm charts are 100000 x better than the IBM kubernetes examples 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 17:59:10 GMT):<br/>
Depending on your requirements you can use this type of script to directly load kubernetes secrets/configmaps into your container (using `curl`) at startup versus the typical pod/container specification approach...

If you are . . just run another peer to duplicate the data.

No the actual ledger

<p><strong>mbanerjee</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 01:52:55 GMT):<br/>
not the state database

Ledger data can be backed up as either you make one more peer up as suggested by @dsessions . 
or else if you want to take the back up of the peerledger folder completely in some remote servers you can check the below link

<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 09:42:02 GMT):<br/>
how? on ibm kubernetes cluster?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:05:51 GMT):<br/>
Kubernetes clusters no longer run Docker as the container runtime so you can no longer try to mount the Doker socket on your peer pod
</p>
<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:06:47 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24  thanks for answer any workaround?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:06:48 GMT):<br/>
You will need to have a Docker daemon running somewhere  ... either on a node outside your Kube cluster or by running Docker in a container (Docker in Docker)

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:09:12 GMT):<br/>
and of course you need to configure the peer to be able to communicate with the DinD container / pod
</p>
<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:09:39 GMT):<br/>
i am running this container in same pod where peer and couchdb container is created and provide 
core_vm_endpoint=localhost:2375 but still cannot connect to end point

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:10:05 GMT):<br/>
localhost will not work

<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:10:20 GMT):<br/>
clusterIP of pod?
</p>
<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:10:38 GMT):<br/>
or nodeIP:nodeport?
</p>
<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:13:44 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:14:57 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:14:57 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 13:08:05 GMT):<br/>
oh ... note that is it 2376 and not 2375 ... looks like it is running using TLS 
</p>
<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 13:08:56 GMT):<br/>
i have tried 2376 but it gives tls handshake error
</p>
<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 13:09:28 GMT):<br/>
But certs are fine all other operations are done through these certs
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 13:09:57 GMT):<br/>
right ...  that is going to be trickier as you will need to add settings in the peer config for Docker TLS

CORE_VM_DOCKER_TLS_ENABLED

and possibly
CORE_VM_DOCKER_TLS_CERT_FILE
CORE_VM_DOCKER_TLS_KEY_FILE

I'd actually advise trying without TLS first ...
</p>
<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 13:16:18 GMT):<br/>
thanks i give them try . and i have to use same certs that are already in use right?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 13:18:24 GMT):<br/>
So the dind image will automatically generate the certs for you (and by default it will only expose a TLS endpoint) ... 

Looks like you can set `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR` for the dind container to use a shared directory for the generated certs
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 13:18:40 GMT):<br/>
The Dockerhub page has a good description of this
</p>
<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 13:20:25 GMT):<br/>
ok i'll have look on it secondly if i am going without tls will i have to start things from scratch or simply disable it and instantiate chaincode

</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 13:31:47 GMT):<br/>
Mount a share. Stick the block into that. If you are using core.yaml it's here - /share in this case is my share.
```
    # Genesis file: The file containing the genesis block to use when
    # initializing the orderer system channel and GenesisMethod is set to
    # "file". Ignored if GenesisMethod is set to "provisional".

Hi,
I have one query specific to Kubernetes, if the default service account of the kubernetes cluster got unbounded and if I restore it using below command as given in this link https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/troubleshooting#gke_service_account_delete
will it delete the existing kubernetes cluster and data will be lost or it will just restore the service account and old cluster will be fine.??? I am using GCP.

What is the best way to configure the ORDERER_URL environment variable in the peer? I am currently using the Orderer POD IP. Wrapping the orderer in clusterIP service with protocol type TCP gives an error. I am not sure if grpcs works with service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local IP
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:48:40 GMT):<br/>
@adityanalge we use Kubernetes service names and DNS everywhere ... no pod ip addresses
</p>
<p><strong>adityanalge</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:51:49 GMT):<br/>
So you are not seeing any issues with GRPCS?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:52:53 GMT):<br/>
@adityanalge to be clear we are _not_ exposing those endpoints outside of the cluster ... but internal routing within GKE, AKS, EKS clusters as well as our Wireguard private network between clusters are all working just fine for GRPC ...
</p>

How are you dealing with the no such host error? Say orderer0 is in a different pod and orderer1 is in a different pod, they will communicate through TLS. Their host and port names are configured in the configtx.yaml. However, this gives me a no such host error as the ip address for orderer1 is not known to orderer0 and vice versa. As the pods are ephemeral, there is no way to know in advance the IP with which orderer0 and orderer1 pods will be created
</p>
<p><strong>adityanalge</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:11:17 GMT):<br/>
How are you dealing with the no such host error? Say for RAFT, orderer0 is in a different pod and orderer1 is in a different pod, they will communicate through TLS. Their host and port names are configured in the configtx.yaml. However, this gives me a no such host error as the ip address for orderer1 is not known to orderer0 and vice versa. As the pods are ephemeral, there is no way to know in advance the IP with which orderer0 and orderer1 pods will be create

@adityanalge no such host error indicates you have a DNS issue... do you have a kubernetes service in place for each orderer? if you have dns utils installed in a pod in the same namespace try doing a DNS lookup for your orderer instances ... they must resolve correctly for this to work
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:01:14 GMT):<br/>
@adityanalge if it makes you feel better I have both raft and Kafka based ordering systems working in my environments so it is certainly possible...
</p>
<p><strong>adityanalge</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:03:16 GMT):<br/>
Please indulge me for a moment here. I think the solution will be, to use the service name and port in configtx.yaml as   ```Addresses:
        - blockchain-orderer:<orderer-port>``` Will it be okay if the service is of type ClusterIp instead of port?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:04:39 GMT):<br/>
```
    Addresses:
        - orderer-0.consensus:7050
        - orderer-1.consensus:7050
        - orderer-2.consensus:7050
        - orderer-3.consensus:7050
        - orderer-4.consensus:7050```
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:05:04 GMT):<br/>
indeed that is how I have configured the orderer network in my channel configs.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:17:38 GMT):<br/>
`.svc.cluster.local` is part of the standard dns suffix search order for kubernetes hosts

```  EtcdRaft:

</p>
<p><strong>adityanalge</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:30:42 GMT):<br/>
Using orderer-service.default in address, gives me a tls error saying the tls certificate is valid for orderer0 and not for orderer-service. 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:32:21 GMT):<br/>
that is because as a typical kubernetes service the endpoint you are using points to any one of the set
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:32:47 GMT):<br/>
but what you really want is a service that points ONLY to a single orderer instance with the same name and TLS
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:33:03 GMT):<br/>
per my example above `orderer-0.consensus:7050`
</p>
<p><strong>adityanalge</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:33:11 GMT):<br/>
so service name has to match orderer name?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:33:22 GMT):<br/>
there is a service with the name `orderer-0`
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:33:38 GMT):<br/>
there is a service with for each orderer ... so 5 of them
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:33:53 GMT):<br/>
and the service selector is
```
selector:
    statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name: orderer-0
    app:  orderer-consensus
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
```
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:34:13 GMT):<br/>
for the `orderer-0` svc so it points to the correct pod
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:35:00 GMT):<br/>
Which supports this config from a running channel
```
"ConsensusType": {
            "mod_policy": "Admins",
            "value": {
              "metadata": {

```
</p>
<p><strong>adityanalge</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:35:25 GMT):<br/>
I see you are adding the namespace along with orderer0.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:35:39 GMT):<br/>
yes... that is my environment configuration
</p>
<p><strong>adityanalge</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:35:41 GMT):<br/>
Can I skip it if everything is under default name space?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:35:44 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:36:02 GMT):<br/>
I recommend using a namespace matching your organization name for other reasons
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:36:18 GMT):<br/>
but default is fine if you have a single org in your environment(s)

@heenas06 -- kubernetes is an extremely deep technical product on its own... hopefully you are not trying to learn how Hyperledger Fabric works at the same time.  At any rate a good place to start researching how to run Hyperledger inside Kubernetes is to review the helm charts. https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/ce6f5f931b32d6b5d92080df9a59953dd10cdd4a/stable/hlf-peer
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:40:12 GMT):<br/>
@heenas06 I feel like I should also mentioned that Hyperledger Fabric in the 1.x series is not an easy fit for the Kubernetes (or other cloud native) environments.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 16:00:50 GMT):<br/>
There are a ton of gotchas with Kubernetes . . especially once you try and start using fabric-sdk-go
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 23:06:04 GMT):<br/>
All of the Kubernetes issues that Fabric has are surmountable if you are willing and able to put in enough effort.  That said it might require a fork of the code base if you are working with 1.x...  I hold out hope that Fabric 2.0 will make things much easier.

<p><strong>adityanalge</strong> (Fri, 27 Sep 2019 17:12:34 GMT):<br/>
I agree with what @iramiller has said. Almost every Fabric requirement can be satisfied by Kubernetes. I think what's lacking is a proper end to end tutorial/video designed specifically for beginners in both technologies.

<p><strong>adityanalge</strong> (Fri, 27 Sep 2019 17:15:08 GMT):<br/>
What is the best way to mount certificates onto an orderer/peer? It is my understanding that the certificates have to be present on the orderer/peer before the pod starts?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Fri, 27 Sep 2019 19:02:00 GMT):<br/>
@adityanalge we use secrets/configmaps to bring the certificates into the pod.  This type of approach positions the system well for integration with tools such as Hashicorp Vault that protect sensitive configuration in larger enterprise cloud environments
</p>

@ahmad-raza does your second cluster have routing/dns entries to the first cluster?  Specifically can you resolve the `ordererX.example` hostnames and route to them?  When troubleshooting these types of issues I will often use `nc -z hostname.namespace 7050` which uses netcat to test for an open port ... this lets you quickly see that the dns is set and the port is accessible... the command will hang if it is not able to reach the port ... it exits immediately upon success
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 14:37:43 GMT):<br/>
(the above netcat command being executed from a shell opened in the pod/container that appears to be having network issues reaching other parts of the network)

</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 15:06:23 GMT):<br/>
you will need to build a network route between the clusters if you wish to resolve those entries... you could create a Kubernetes service with a custom endpoint that directs `ordererX.namespace` to an external IP address of the orderer if you source cluster has that orderer exposed to the internet
</p>
<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 19:59:27 GMT):<br/>
exposing orderer through service type "NodePort" to the internet. is it a good practice??
</p>
<p><strong>ahmad-raza</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 20:02:10 GMT):<br/>
although i am using nodeport type services to expose all  peers CAs and orderers 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 21:02:15 GMT):<br/>
For my environments there is no reason that these services would ever be invoked by entities outside of our consortium -- therefore all of ours are only exposed on an internal network.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 21:02:51 GMT):<br/>
You may wish to explore either making a private network between your nodes and/or using mutual TLS to further harden your configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 30 Sep 2019 21:04:45 GMT):<br/>
In either case above you can use kubernetes services to assist with the name resolution requirements.  Some further reading here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname

Im considering using Hashicorp Vault for storing safely certificates and secrets in conjunction with Kubernetes. Have you managed to use vault in kubernetes and fabric? Is it really difficult? Can you share some useful guides on how to use vault for this or similar? Thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 15:21:49 GMT):<br/>
We are using Hashicorp vault for secret storage/mangement and issuing PKI certificates for TLS and identities.  (currently we are also using the Fabric CA but the intention is to remove Fabric CA entirely)
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 15:24:47 GMT):<br/>
While I have created a direct Vault integration for Fabric the provides MSP and crypto functions we are not using it and this project is on hold pending the improvements in Fabric 2.0
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 15:28:33 GMT):<br/>
Integrating a Vault solution into Kubernetes is an extremely complex process that should be driven by operation requirements... I don't really have a great way to help you get started with that beyond saying that you should expect to do a bunch of Google research and reading.  The Fabric Kubernetes channel is not really the best place to dive into this either.
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 15:30:25 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for your responses! Indeed it is not the best place to deep dive Vault here but was interested on your experience. I have not seen any updates or improvement announces regarding Fabric CA in 2.0, what are they planning to feature in the new release?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 15:32:47 GMT):<br/>
The updates I am interested in are the improved source code structure and focus on breaking up the monolithic source in such a way as to better support plugins.  The current setup does not lend itself well to replacing functions with external modules that are build separately.  Until the core project actually starts building a system using a modular approach maintaining a fork is really the only way to replace/customize these major components
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 15:34:31 GMT):<br/>
Having implemented a replacement for the MSP system that uses vault the determination was made that this required far too many deep changes in the source tree to maintain in our fork long term... the cost/benefit/overhead of integrating upstream changes just isn't there.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 14:20:46 GMT):<br/>
above portion of a helm chart that uses the `.Values.peer.replicas` setting (typically 3) to iteratively create a set of secrets... this chart is using the stateful set concept in Kubernetes for peers...

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 14:47:21 GMT):<br/>
I would like to re-evaluate replacing/augmenting the dockercontroller in Fabric 2.0 with my custom kubernetescontroller given the many updates in master for the container runtime and build abstractions that are included.  For reference this controller provides direct kubernetes scheduling of chain code containers for proper cloud native deployment and orchestration.  We have successfully used this extension in several dozen Kubernetes clusters on various public clouds.  Ideally this effort could be repackaged into a plugin without a fork.  The current peer serve method is a whopping 600+ lines of hard coded initialization wrappers around the docker VM.  I see that @jyellick is one of the primary developers in that area of the code base.  Perhaps @jyellick or someone else could open a discussion with me directly or in this channel to discuss the best way to do this?  Perhaps the time isn't quite right due to in progress refactoring?

@iramiller I'd suggest that you look at the 'external builders' proposal from the contributor calls or in JIRA https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13584
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 18:26:27 GMT):<br/>
This separates the packaging/build from the core peer functions, and allows arbitrary implementations, such as one based on k8s to be implemented in userspace.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 19:29:34 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick I am familiar with the FAB-13584 proposal and FAB-13582... I am reflecting on those initiatives as well as what I see in the codebase currently... neither of those tickets have recent updates/status reports reflecting the state of code changes that are in progress.  This is why I am asking about how stable the break down is based on what is currently in the peer serve method specifically.  If a high rate of churn is still expected for the 2.0 release then that is all I need to know for now.  Conversely if the code base is considered to be stabilizing then I will have more specific questions to ask as I look into it further.
</p>
<p><strong>adityanalge</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 01:00:46 GMT):<br/>
How are you handling backing up peers and orderers? I understand that you have to back up the production folder and certificates. However, can the production folder for peer0.org1.example.com be used to bring up peer1.org1.example.com?
</p>
<p><strong>adityanalge</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 02:23:28 GMT):<br/>
Also, do all 5 orderers in RAFT have to be backed up or backing up one is enough?

The code is mostly present and should be fairly stable at this point, but, probably best to wait for the documentation which should become available in the next few weeks.

@iramiller , @yacovm  and all are open to answer , Guys is it possible to scale peer or ca pod to make it highly available service ? if not why?
</p>
<p><strong>shivraj</strong> (Sat, 26 Oct 2019 14:19:32 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller in the sense, handling huge loads... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 27 Oct 2019 14:52:29 GMT):<br/>
@shivraj each peer needs to have its own certificate. As for CA - I guess it's possible to scale it, but I would still give each CA its own key, for security reasons.
</p>
<p><strong>shivraj</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 08:29:15 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  @iramiller   is there any way to create a setup where there is logical grouping among peers pods so there is a load distribution happening on top  of it ? 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 14:23:28 GMT):<br/>
@shivraj ... have you done any testing to determine how your infrastructure responds to your workloads?  Have you considered the structure for your chaincode (both the code itself as well as the data structures and the balance between what is on chain and what is stored off of it?  A read heavy workload will have different infrastructure requirements than a write heavy workload ... The amount of read/write contention in your workload will be another significant consideration.  The latency in your network between orderer nodes as well as from orderers to peers and intra-peer gossip are all critical.  If the distribution of committed blocks is slow then you are prone to MVCC errors.  The CA pod has essentially no load on it in a production network.  Your question for how to scale this pod leads me to believe that you may need to do some significant systems architecture research and testing before you pursue scaling the peer workloads further.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 14:24:54 GMT):<br/>
@shivraj in short if you have a more tightly scoped question regarding scaling with specific directions you are looking to increase capacity or throughput in then the members of this forum can likely provide a more helpful answer.

is there any tutorial to provide basic understanding of how to use kubernetes  in HLF ?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 15:00:26 GMT):<br/>
that is a very broad question... one starting point for you would be to review the Helm charts for HLF (https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/hlf-peer) and examine how those were implemented.

Hello everyone, how are you? I have a question for you that have been bugging me for a few days now: I have a free IBM Kubernetes Service cluster running, and I want to run some fabric containers there. My problem is: IKS doesn't use docker anymore, as it now uses containerd. how should I set the CORE_VM_ENDPOINT for the peers if I don't have a docker.sock available?

Hey everyone - I'm trying to get a gauge for how people are actually dealing with crypto management in production. The best strategy I've been able to come up with is manually deploying specific secrets for tls-ca/ca, then every thing else being dynamic through initContainers on peers/orderers/etc against your organizations existing secrets. All shared organization crypto identities could be shared through secret volumes with nodes being restarted as needed when new identities become available

I haven't seen any kubernetes examples that aren't using toy crypto material. Service discovery seems to solve part of the problem for client applications, but you still wind up with some amount of hardcoded assumptions around core peers

Looks like my proposed solution is basically what the WIP blockchain-automation-framework lab is doing. Generate crypto pseudo-manually through fabric-ca CLIs and upload to vault. Use initContainers to distribute relevant crypto material before launching peers. This seems finish if peer growth rate is relatively low. Hooking in client applications can still use service discovery to reduce their overhead, so backbone infrastructure remains the biggest pain point

Hello people, I am facing a problem and I hope you guys can help me. I'm trying to communicate a Orderer node running on IBM Kubernetes Services with a peer running on docker on my machine. When I try to create a new channel, I am getting a TLS handshake failed and on my peer I can see this: `2019-11-19 16:55:35.867 UTC [grpc] createTransport -> DEBU 03f grpc: addrConn.createTransport failed to connect to {<IP>:30000 0  <nil>}.

</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:53:53 GMT):<br/>
you need to use a DNS name that matches one of the SANS on the certificate used ... (or an IP address entry on the certificate as the error message indicates which I would not recommend unless that address is not expected to change [ever])
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:55:05 GMT):<br/>
inside of Kubernetes you can leverage custom services to create a DNS resolution if this is for an outbound connection... on your localhost a hosts file entry can be used for development name resolution...

Hello!
I am working on raising a Hyperledger Fabric network production ready on kubernetes. I use a pod with Docker-in-Docker (dind) for the deployment of the chaincode. Because of this, the security team does not allow me to deploy on-premises. I have been asked to think of ways to secure it. What kind of settings can I apply to minimize the risk of using dind?
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the information. I have seen that in this example they are mounting the Host’s Docker socket. I’m not allowed to do this kind of setting. Due to this I’m using DinD

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 16:05:48 GMT):<br/>
@Esegarra your best bet is to fork and patch out those portions of the system with a native Kubernetes controller (that is what we did about a year ago) or more reasonably wait a few more weeks for 2.0 to come out which should make it easier to build out a proper cloud native system architecture for chaincode instances.

@iramiller Thank you for your answer. Only three questions more… :grin: Do you have an example of this patches what you mention?  Are there approximate date of the release of the version 2.0? Are there official documentation explaining the new chaincode model cloud native? I have read the new lifecycle but nothing about this cloud approach. Thanks!!

@razasikander you should be able to list services in the org1 namespace of your cluster and see peer0 listed ... additionally you may wish to start a container with dns tools in your cluster in the same namespace as your peer pods/containers for troubleshooting DNS resolution.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:35:19 GMT):<br/>
what I believe you will see based on the configuration you have above is a service with the name `peer0-org1-in` ... this name will not resolve as you have intended unless this name is what you are using in your configuration (compared to the dot separated version)
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 15:36:16 GMT):<br/>
additionally the external name reference requires an external valid dns name ... and `org.in` is not an externally valid dns name ...

based on the output in your log file this isn't a Kubernetes issue... it appears that your request is not signed by a certificate which is part of the expected MSP.  ... The lscc is looking for buyer/seller MSP members but the request was submitted with a lender MSP signature.

invoking "curl --unix-socket /host/var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/events" inside peer container Im able to get responses. So I assume, peer has the correct value of "CORE_VM_ENDPOINT".

debugging these kinds of errors can be quite difficult ... based on what you have in your log I would look at the DNS resolution _inside_ your chain code container... by default the DNS resolution inside this container will not know the proper address of the peer it is attempting to talk back to.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 15:54:51 GMT):<br/>
Verify that the hostname `chaincode -peer.address=peer1.lender.routingtest34.zeeve.net:7052` resolves to the correct interface inside the chaincode container so that it connects to the host peer.

(this privileged docker inside kubernetes thing is the worst part of Hyperledger Fabric in the 1.x series and reflects the lack of systems engineering for cloud based environments, the 2.x version has extensive rework of the peer/chaincode architecture to address these issues.. hopefully we can start building on the 2.0 series in the next few months)
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 15:58:54 GMT):<br/>
(in the mean time you will encounter some challenges getting this to work and without a fork that properly schedules kubernetes workloads your security architecture will be compromised, but know that others on here have persevered and deployed production systems of Fabric in Kubernetes on the 1.x branch)

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 18:22:48 GMT):<br/>
@sandman ... the issue here is that you are thinking about network connectivity from the pod perspective and cont from a container attached to the node itself (outside of kubernetes) which is how the chaincode container will be scheduled when directly interacting with the docker.sock endpoint.  You need to modify the DNS settings on the docker host VM itself to make this work.  If you are on the pod itself when the chaincode request comes in... and you have a container running with the docker tools installed, and a mount of the host docker sock ... then you can use the docker tools to inspect the running chaincode container (attaching to it even) and run the DNS lookups from there...
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 18:23:43 GMT):<br/>
you will find that within that context your DNS resolution will not work UNLESS you have updated the DNS settings that docker is using in that context to point to the kube-dns servers... and also included the appropriate DNS suffix search orders
</p>

I am not able to instantiate chaincode from the peer. It would be great if some one can guide me as I'm pretty new to using Kubernetes. I am not able to figure out whether to create a separate container to instantiate the chaincode or the peer could do it on its own. Also, I'm confused on using docker.sock for instantiation. I'm using eks and have simple setup of one peer and one orderer. Peer is able to create and join the channel. Peer is able to install the chaincode however, peer is not able to instantiate the chaincode. Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59288613/chaincode-instantiation-fails-in-aws-eks-network

<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Mon, 16 Dec 2019 15:09:26 GMT):<br/>
Has anyone tested the EXTERNALBUILDERS feature for chaincode in 2.0.0 beta release?
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Mon, 16 Dec 2019 15:39:09 GMT):<br/>
From the code shared in stackoverflow, you are mounting the docker socket into the peer container, now this implementation could not be working depending on the AMI you are using for your EKS nodes. I would suggest using the Docker-indocker approach as it would be difficult to know when your chaincodes are up and and running or down. You can find more info here: https://medium.com/kokster/simpler-setup-for-hyperledger-fabric-on-kubernetes-using-docker-in-docker-8346f70fbe80

<p><strong>mrudav.shukla</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 11:17:12 GMT):<br/>
If we use dind approach, do we still need to mount docker socket to host?
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 12:18:03 GMT):<br/>
you do not need to mount the socket
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 12:18:58 GMT):<br/>
can you share the code of your implementation? so i can further help you

<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 12:41:52 GMT):<br/>
fine for now, i just have one think different, the value of `CORE_VM_ENDPOINT` is `tcp://localhost:2375`, i have it as `http://localhost:2375`

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 26 Dec 2019 22:07:45 GMT):<br/>
if anyone else was reading through this and considering DinD for Kubernetes ... an alternative approach (if you have go experience) would be to build upon my work for a Kubernetes controller that schedules chaincode containers properly (until 2.0 comes out and we can rebuild into a nice add on module) https://github.com/FigureTechnologies/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/container/kubernetescontroller/kubernetescontroller.go
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Thu, 26 Dec 2019 22:08:58 GMT):<br/>
note that the above approach isn't plug and play ... and it relies our our approach of releasing chaincode containers built by our Jenkins pipeline internally ... but any external chaincode build process could do the same.

@AbhijeetSamanta make sure you can hit your CA service from the pod you are running your code in above ... verify that your DNS name (if you are using one) resolves correctly...  some times it is easier to isolate the infrastructure and make sure it is working as expected before trying to further debug the Hyperledger Fabric software

Hi there! Thanks for this forum, it already helped a lot :pray: 
Now I wanted to setup Hyperledger Explorer on my cluster, and the guide by feitnomore (https://github.com/feitnomore/hyperledger-fabric-kubernetes thx at this point) uses a Network file system (NFS). 
Until now, I always used K8s secrets to inject certs and other information into my Peer and Orderer pods as described in the great guides by AidTech (https://github.com/aidtechnology/hgf-k8s-workshop) and APG and Accenture NL (https://github.com/APGGroeiFabriek/PIVT).

2 questions arose:
How to distribute the crypto material securely in a production environment? 
Of all three guides shared above, only AidTech doesn't use the cryptogen tool, but the actual HLF CA Container to issue keys and certificates. However, they still copy the keys from the CA Pod to the local machine, and then inject it into the Peer/Orderer Container. It doesn't seem very secure to me if private keys ever leave the pod for which they are meant for.

Regarding the solution by feitnomore using NFS "Note: Crypto materials, configuration files and some scripts will be saved on this shared filesystem." : looks like all Pods can access the crypto material of other Pods, doesn't seem very secure (although I don't have any clue about NFS). 

Do you know a solution to enable Hyperledger Explorer without NFS? I guess the NFS is mounted on the  Hyperledger Explorer Pod because it needs some information that is inside the shared filesystem, but maybe this can be replaced somehow?

Any answers or some fruitful discussion is very much welcomed! :slight_smile:

<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 07:45:06 GMT):<br/>
Hi @kirikiri. It depends on how you setup your HF network on K8s. I personally asked myself the same question last week. For the setup, I used the guide for a production environment by AidTech (https://github.com/aidtechnology/hgf-k8s-workshop). By using the helm charts hlf-peer and hlf-orderer, services for each Peer are automatically generated. Also the great guide by APG and Accenture NL (https://github.com/APGGroeiFabriek/PIVT) creates a Kubernetes service for every pod. That way you can access the Peer and Orderer Pods over their respective service :slight_smile: . 

So you just need to install the nginx ingress e.g.
`helm install nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress`

and then create an ingress with a file ingress.yaml similar to this
`apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress

<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 07:49:05 GMT):<br/>
In the property "serviceName" as in `serviceName: peer1-hlf-peer`you have to specify the service that corresponds to your pod.

</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 08:07:06 GMT):<br/>
But as I found out, you can also assign an ingress directly in the values.yaml file for installing the helm chart. AidTech does it like this to enable an ingress for their CA Pod (https://github.com/aidtechnology/hgf-k8s-workshop/blob/master/prod_example/helm_values/ca.yaml), and in the other helm charts of Peer and Orderer there is also the possibility to inject ingress.enabled=true into the chart. This way the chart automatically creates an Ingress for your Pod :smile:

howver Idk whether it's safe to expose the peers and orderes outside the cluster
</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 10:51:31 GMT):<br/>
Yes absolutely, that's an important thought, I overlooked this until now :sweat_smile: 
Currently I'm using Digital Ocean (DO) managed Kubernetes, and there you can set inbound rules for Requests. I guess an easy first precaution would be to whitelist only known IP addresses for my loadbalancer directly in DO.

However, shouldn't it be possible from anyone wanting to use the sdk to connect to my peer? The application that connects to the HF network could reside in any part of the world, shouldn't it?
This would indicate that it's safe to expose the peer outside of the cluster, because requests are anyway only executed if they come from trusted entities, i.e. parties that have a certificate that's trusted by the HF network.
Does this make sense? Or do I misunderstand something?
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 10:53:13 GMT):<br/>
No that is perfectly correct, I have the same thougts too. I am also using Digital Ocean managed Kubernetes

I had the same question @lionelronaldo. Thank you for framing it so aptly. Curious as to how more people are not talking/worried about this. 
.
On a high level it is a simple problem of moving the CA root certificates from the CA pod to the Orderer/Peer pod and figuring out the most secure way to do it.
</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 12:29:54 GMT):<br/>
@gentios 
So i figured out how to adjust the helm charts hlf-ca, hlf-peer and hlf-orderer so that the installation of them automatically creates an ingress. :yum: 

At first I wanted to use the same secret of the TLS certificate across ca, orderer and peer. So just one certifiacte for mydomain.com, and to redirect the requests to the specific services via paths like mydomain.com/ca,  mydomain.com/peer and mydomain.com/orderer. Guess what, the problem was the fabric-ca-client. 
When you call `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=./config fabric-ca-client enroll -u https://ord-admin:OrdAdm1nPW@$CA_INGRESS -M ./OrdererMSP` (as in the AidTech guide https://github.com/aidtechnology/hgf-k8s-workshop/tree/master/prod_example), the $CA_INGRESS would be in our example mydomain.com/ca. Unfortunetaley the fabric-ca-client binary cuts off everthing before the last slash, and instead of https://mydomain.com/ca/enroll it always tried to call https://ca/enroll which obviously doesn't work.
I couldn't find a way around that. :disappointed: Please tell me if you know a solution that this issue!

Next try was to use a wildcard certificate for *.mydomain.com, so I only need to generate one certificate in my cluster and I don't run into the letsencrypt rate limits that easily. However, for that you need a special ClusterIssuer with a dns solver that can connect to your domain registrator. I didn't have that because I'm currently using free domains without such api service.  
:feet: 
So in the end, I just used the subdomains ca.mydomain.com, orderer.mydomain.com and peer.mydomain.com and generated for each one of them a TLS certificate issued by letsencrypt.

After you have a ready ClusterIssuer for the cert-manager (let's say it is "letsencrypt-production), you need to add an ingress section to each of the values.yaml files of the charts:
ca:
`ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
  path: / 
  hosts:
    # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name
    - ca.yourdomain.com
  tls:
    - secretName: ca--tls
      hosts:
        # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name
        - ca.yourdomain.com`
peer:
`ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production 
  path: /
  hosts:
    # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name
    - peer.yourdomain.com
  tls:
    - secretName: peer--tls #tls-secret
      hosts:
        # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name
        - peer.yourdomain.com`
orderer:
`ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
  path: /
  hosts:
    # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name
    - orderer.yourdomain.com
  tls:
    - secretName: orderer--tls
      hosts:
        # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name
        - orderer.yourdomain.com`

I only included this ingress section in peer1 and ord1, as I was ok with connecting to just 1 peer and orderer. This creates 3 ingresses, which should be accessable via your domains with https. :heart_decoration: 
Until now I'm not sure how to use the ingress for peer and orderer. 
I guess with this setup it's possible to enable a HF network with multiple K8s clusters. :slight_smile:  That will be the next step.

Another question that arose during my work with the hlf helm charts developed by Aid:Tech:

The hlf-ca helm chart uses a requirements.lock file, which has a dependency on the postgresql 2.6.1 and mysql 0.10.2 helm charts. However these helm charts use apiVersions that are not compatible with the apiVersions of K8s 1.16 , so I cannot use them with Kubernetes 1.16 . 
*Is there any possibility in K8s to override this requirements.lock file from a remote helm repo? 
* :pray: 
In the values.yaml for hlf-ca, I can specify the image tag of postgresql and mysql, but I cannot specify the helm chart version..

For now, I forked the repo, adjusted and ran the chart locally.

By the way, maybe your right that it's bad to open up your Peers and Orderers so openly to the internet. An attacker might not be able to attack via the HF network, but he might be able to attack via the K8s network. However I don't know yet a lot about K8s security.

I have a CA container running within Pod in an amazon EKS cluster. I am exposing this using service type load balancer.  It has TLS enabled. Now, since this pod is exposed using amazon’s load balancer, this load balancer will need to have an SSL cert. My question is, should this SSL cert be the certificate of the CA and be explicitly imported into amazon’s ACM or this load balancer would have a different SSL cert?
</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 08:09:50 GMT):<br/>
Typically the LoadBalancer would have his own cert, not the one from the CA or some other HF component.

Hi all, I am trying to implement HLF network on k8s with aws EKS.

<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 21 Jan 2020 18:42:27 GMT):<br/>
@AbhijeetSamanta if all of your clusters are managed by a single team ... perhaps relying on namespaces for separation is sufficient vs the extra infrastructure for all those extra clusters.  We used ICAs (and loaded those into Fabric CAs) for each org in our network.  You would want to discuss that further in the #fabric-ca channel I suspect.

So my post about how to setup ingress gave ingresses, but I don't know how to work with them for a multicluster setup (https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=KcpdQiPMmHi5BqZ6Y). 
Could anybody give me a hint how to use the public domain names instead of cluster specific domain names?
Is .spec.hostAliases helping for this issue? Because it only translates inner cluster domain names to ip addresses, I would need a translation to public domain names (my public LoadBalancer IP uses ingress for the different services).
:thinking:

@lionelronaldo thank you for sharing your setup, I did an initial research on this and I found some links from the at-charts of Aid:tech.

As you can see in this link: https://github.com/aidtechnology/at-charts/blob/master/hlf-peer/values.yaml#L21

In order to expose a peer we have to pass the "GRPC" annotation and if you want to use the TLS you have to pass the following config: https://github.com/aidtechnology/at-charts/blob/master/hlf-peer/values.yaml#L64 and following secrets: https://github.com/aidtechnology/at-charts/blob/master/hlf-peer/values.yaml#L84

I haven't still tested it with TLS, I am still having a problem connecting to the peer after the ingress enabled, in order to install the chaincode.

Still evaluating how to expose it correctly, if someone has setup this would be good to share some answers 


</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 09:26:27 GMT):<br/>
Regarding the multicluster setup, I don't have such experience yet tbh
</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 10:33:48 GMT):<br/>
Great catch! I always overlooked the 'nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "GRPC"' part! 
Just tried it out without TLS and without CA in a minimalist setup of 1 peer and 1 orderer (using cryptogen). 
It doesn't work just with the additional annotation of backend-protocol, but I think we are one step further. 

In the peer logs there is 
"External endpoint is empty, peer will not be accessible outside of its organization"
With "helm template stable/hlf-peer -n peer1 --namespace peers -f ./helm_values/peer1.yaml" I found out that the environment variables "CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT" and "CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP" are not set, as they should be indicated by this article https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/gossip.html .

In https://github.com/aidtechnology/at-charts/blob/b0bb623da5b864a6ffc176261909494df789f2ab/hlf-peer/values.yaml#L60 I found that it's able to set the endpoints in values.yaml. Maybe we have to set the right values there?
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 10:35:40 GMT):<br/>
@lionelronaldo no I think that is for the gossip protocol has not to do with the external url
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 10:35:56 GMT):<br/>
The thing is that if we specify the service type to LoadBalancer as here: https://github.com/aidtechnology/at-charts/blob/b0bb623da5b864a6ffc176261909494df789f2ab/hlf-peer/values.yaml#L11
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 10:36:21 GMT):<br/>
It will be exposed to public without a problem, however it's not safe for prod since the communication is not protected by TLS
</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 10:48:20 GMT):<br/>
@gentios ok very interesting, thanks for the info! Guess my K8s are still not good enough.
If I enable LoadBalancer for the service instead of ClusterIP, do I still need to enable the ingress?

Or how do I connect orderer and peer if I exposed them via a LoadBalancer? It's ok to start without TLS. Did you ever get it to work without TLS with LoadBalancers or Ingresses?

<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 11:44:53 GMT):<br/>
If you pass a LoadBalancer it will assign an external IP Address where you
</p>

can connect from the fabric-sdk or however you will use it 
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 11:45:14 GMT):<br/>
like: grpc://ip:address

</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 12:25:22 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 12:26:39 GMT):<br/>
I guess only either LoadBalancer or Ingress is needed. In their prod example they set up an ingress for the CA, but leave the service with ClusterIP and do not change it to LoadBalancer.
</p>
<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 12:27:01 GMT):<br/>

Ok with enabling LoadBalancers for Peer and Orderer and pointing the domain names to their IP addresses I have the same result as with ingress enabled and 'nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "GRPC"'.

Both versions return "Error: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing" when trying to create a channel or do something different.

<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 07:03:59 GMT):<br/>
Hey @gentios Thanks a lot for your tips!! I got a minimal network running with the peer/orderer services exposed via a LoadBalancer :yum: 
The next step is now to do it with the nginx-ingress controller instead, but that's more complicated. For nginx-ingress controller it's necessary to use TLS, because they only serve http/2 over the 443 port (https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/3897).
GRPC communicates over http/2. 
I guess also something else needs to be adapted, because I couldn;t get it to work even with valid TLS certificates.

<p><strong>gentios</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 08:21:34 GMT):<br/>
@lionelronaldo did u just pust the service.Type=LoadBalancer for both peer and order and it worked ?
</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 08:44:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes. 
I also changed the k8s service names like peer1-hlf-peer.peers.svc.cluster.local to my actual domains like peer.toonu.com and orderer.toonu.com, In configtx.yaml, crypto-config.yaml and in my setup script. 

Of course, I also changed the the paths to my crypto-material in my setup script to reflect the domains. E.g. from `MSP_DIR=./crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/orderers.svc.cluster.local/orderers/ord1-hlf-ord.orderers.svc.cluster.local/msp` to `MSP_DIR=./crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/orderer.oliveris.happyforever.com/orderers/ord1-hlf-ord.orderer.toonu.com/msp`

Then I installed my peer and orderer, and waited for the LoadBalancers to be created. Once they were created and I got their ExternalIPs, I headed over to my domain name service provider and changed the IPs of peer.toonu.com and orderer.toonu.com to their respective LoadBalancers. Then I had to wait again until the domain names actually resolve to the new IP addresses. Once they did, I could create a channel, install, instantiate and invoke an example chaincode.

E.g. from `MSP_DIR=./crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/orderers.svc.cluster.local/orderers/ord1-hlf-ord.orderers.svc.cluster.local/msp` to `MSP_DIR=./crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/orderer.toonu.com/orderers/ord1-hlf-ord.orderer.toonu.com/msp`

Then I installed my peer and orderer, and waited for the LoadBalancers to be created. Once they were created and I got their ExternalIPs, I headed over to my domain name service provider and changed the IPs of peer.toonu.com and orderer.toonu.com to their respective LoadBalancers. Then I had to wait again until the domain names actually resolve to the new IP addresses. Once they did, I could create a channel, install, instantiate and invoke an example chaincode.

Great that is perfect, with what you installed the chaincode with node sdk ?
</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 08:53:15 GMT):<br/>
With `kubectl cp` I copy the chaincode into the pod, and with `kubectl exec -- bash` I install, instantaite and invoke.

Installation:
```
PEER_POD=$(kubectl get pods -n peers -l "app=hlf-peer,release=peer1" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  
kubectl cp ../../../chaincodes/chaincode_example02/  peers/$PEER_POD:/var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes
  
kubectl exec -n peers $PEER_POD -- bash -c 'CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=$ADMIN_MSP_PATH peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 1.0 -l node -p /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/chaincode_example02/node'
``` 
Instantiaten and invocation:
```
kubectl exec -n peers $PEER_POD -- bash -c "CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=\$ADMIN_MSP_PATH peer chaincode instantiate -n mycc -o orderer.toonu.com:7050 -C mychannel -l node -v 1.0 -c '{\"Args\":[\"init\",\"a\",\"100\",\"b\",\"200\"]}' -P \"OR ('PeerMSP.member')\""

kubectl exec -n peers $PEER_POD -- bash -c "CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=\$ADMIN_MSP_PATH peer chaincode invoke -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{"Args":["invoke","a", "b", "30"]}'"
```

Hi! Does anyone have any tips on how to communicate with peers and orderers over an ingress? 
It works great when I use a LoadBalancer, but I can't seem to configure the nginx ingress controller right so that it behaves the same as if I use the plain LoadBalancer :pray:

Why are people here trying to mount Fabric with Kubernetes if peers communicate P2P through gossip and load is balanced by the SDK itself using the discovery service? I don't see any benefits from using Kubernetes for peers or orderers, I would only use it for de SDK services, not for the nodes. Or can someone mention why they think it is better to use Kubernetes and  not just launch a machine per node, create autoscaling groups with good monitoring but without orchestration? I feel like people are just using Kubernetes because they know it and not because it is fit for Fabric....just my thoughts, it could be an interesting discussion...

Hi everyone, i would like to setup the peers 2.0 version in kubernetes yaml the `CORE_CHAINCODE_EXTERNALBUILDERS` through env vars but i am contslanty getting the following error `Error: '': source data must be an array or slice, got string`. I put the following input:
```
        - name: CORE_CHAINCODE_EXTERNALBUILDERS
          value: '[{name: golang-builder, path: /builders/golang}]'
```
 I think that is because env var do not support arrays but i am not completely sure. The docs suggest to modify the `core.yaml` file itself but that does not have a good approach with kubernetes as it is the only config option to be modified in `core.yaml` file itself, though i have tried that and it works:
> Modify the chaincode stanza of the peer core.yaml file to include the externalBuilders configuration element:
```
externalBuilders:
     - name: myexternal
       path: <fully qualified path on the peer's env>  
```
Does anyone have a better approach on this?

Has any one had any luck hooking up HLF in k8s with istio? I'm trying to add just observability support (not mTLS yet), but once I have sidecar injection in place I can't seem to get traffic to my orderer
</p>
<p><strong>rpocase</strong> (Mon, 10 Feb 2020 18:31:06 GMT):<br/>
@iramiller maybe? Found a discussion back from May. I don't think anything has really changed in the landscape unless we were running HLF 2.0 (not there yet, the migration path is pretty steep). I really expected this to be pretty seamless if mTLS isn't deployed, but the best I can tell is the sidecar is preventing traffic from reaching the orderer

@braduf we picked Kubernetes, at least for preproduction, to avoid having to setup a large number of EC2 instances (we're in AWS) - we can run the workload on 5 servers instead of the 27 (three orderers, six orgs, two peers per org, two CAs per org) we need if we do standalone EC2. We also selected K8S because it makes the platform slightly more cloud agnostic (we're planning to eventually leverage AWS, Azure and GCP) - no need to reinvent the wheel for each cloud provider - just have to reinvent the K8S deploy part. And while you can do Autoscale groups, you essentially either have to work out some complex cloud init scripts to auto-detect or do one ASG per system which I've done before but is a bit tedious, IMO.
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 18:17:34 GMT):<br/>
When running peer commands, even on the local peer, we're seeing occasional `Error: error getting endorser client for list: endorser client failed to connect to peer-01.org.env.domain.com:7051: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded` messages for our setup. We're using HLF 1.4.4 on Kubernetes; each deployed node (orderer, peer) is fronted by an ELB in TCP pass through mode so we can use mTLS. Has anyone else run into this problem? It happens frequently enough to be concerned but not enough that the system fails completely. Note that the hostname points to the LB, so any peer commands run on the peer itself will reach out to the ELB -> K8S Service -> K8S POD.
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 18:48:46 GMT):<br/>
But so everyone who is using K8S is not having a decentralized network from what I hear. All orgs are managed by the same "operator", I think this should not be the standard way Fabric is promoted... I think it is better to start building opensource IaC for different cloud environments to make it easier for every organization to deploy it's own peers and orderer without Kubernetes. Since Fabric is supposed to be a descentralized peer-2-peer network and Kubernetes is not build for peer-2-peer...
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 18:50:06 GMT):<br/>
I think with good IaC, you also eliminate the manual setup of EC2 instances.
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 18:55:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes with IaC but that still is more to manage, been there, done that and it only simplifies a bit
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 18:56:11 GMT):<br/>
our K8S setup is separate namespaces per org when we run the orgs but separate K8S clusters in different AWS / Azure / On Prem accounts when the org is an external party

Try running `peer channel join ...` multiple times, let me know if that works. I had a similar issue back in December and found that if I ran `peer channel join` multiple times, it worked

let me check. give me a minute
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:41:04 GMT):<br/>
the logs on the orderer does not say anything when I do the join channel for the peer0-org1

is FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=debug set on the orderer?

<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:45:34 GMT):<br/>
to be clear, I am on the fabric-tools pod, and I call "peer channel join" for the peer0org1
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:46:25 GMT):<br/>
did any peers successfully join the channel ?
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:48:04 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:48:11 GMT):<br/>
channel creation was ok

<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:48:15 GMT):<br/>
but not joining

<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:48:26 GMT):<br/>
and I cannot list the channels either, thing

<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:48:52 GMT):<br/>
channel creation happens on the orderers effectively, IIRC

yes
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:49:32 GMT):<br/>
it's a certificate problem with the peers, I think
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:49:55 GMT):<br/>
do you have a cert file in `$DIR_CRYPTO_MATERIAL/peerOrganizations/org1-example-com/users/Admin@org1-example-com/msp/admincerts` ?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:50:04 GMT):<br/>
it should be the same cert that is in `$DIR_CRYPTO_MATERIAL/peerOrganizations/org1-example-com/users/Admin@org1-example-com/msp/signcerts`
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:52:15 GMT):<br/>
no, nothing there indeed

<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:53:21 GMT):<br/>
in /signcerts, I have the following file: Admin@org1-example-com-cert.pem

I put it all in scripts and don't have to think about it anymore, like what you're doing... bad news is I forget. But I had the exact same issue
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:03:07 GMT):<br/>
the thing is that I find a lot of things about old versions of Fabric, but as I am starting a new project, I would like to do it with 2.0. And there, I don't find much. But maybe my issue is not at all related to the version.
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:03:34 GMT):<br/>
this issue is old / common
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:03:46 GMT):<br/>
you're missing a CA file somewhere
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:06:14 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:09:05 GMT):<br/>
You don't have CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH set inside the peer nodes
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:09:17 GMT):<br/>
looking at https://github.com/woodyjon/fabric-test-network-k8s/blob/master/k8s/peer0-org1-deploy.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:10:47 GMT):<br/>
no indeed. I have FABRIC_CFG_PATH
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:10:47 GMT):<br/>
no indeed.
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:12:02 GMT):<br/>
but when I try the "peer channel join" directly when I am in the peer node, I export it
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:12:32 GMT):<br/>
I will retry with the env variable
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:12:56 GMT):<br/>
so there are two things I *think* I dealt with when I had this problem and I can't recall which relates to the endorser
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:13:28 GMT):<br/>
can I just delete the peer deployment and redeploy it with the new config or do I need to destroy everything and restart?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:14:00 GMT):<br/>
1) the admin cert sent from the tools container is signed by a CA that the peer doesn't recognize (I'd have to sort through all the configs you have to see what you're using where)
2) the cert sent by the peer to the orderer is signed by a CA that the orderer does not recognize
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:14:22 GMT):<br/>
#2 seems more likely given that typically the Admin cert is signed by the same CA that signed the peer certs
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:14:42 GMT):<br/>
those CAs are all embedded in the genesis block and then again in the channel creation blocks
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:16:10 GMT):<br/>
but I used cryptogen to generate the ca stuff
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:16:33 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I see you used separate files; I always used a single file, but I would think it doesn't matter
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:16:46 GMT):<br/>
and would it be possible that the peer does not have read access to the certificates ? Everything is on a common nfs server
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:17:13 GMT):<br/>
those are the same files as the test-network of the fabric-sample folder
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:17:30 GMT):<br/>
the only thing I changed in those files is change the dots to dashes
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:17:47 GMT):<br/>
when I had this problem, I also went through *all* of my certs and ran `openssl x509 -noout -text -in` and validated *everything* matched :(
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:17:51 GMT):<br/>
it was tedious
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:17:54 GMT):<br/>
peer0.org1.example.com to peer0-org1-example-com
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:18:05 GMT):<br/>
ok I could do that
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:18:12 GMT):<br/>
how do you check that it matches?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:19:00 GMT):<br/>
the short way is to validate timestamps are the same / near (off by 1 second or 2) and make sure the CA names in the issuer field matches the name on the CA cert
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:19:08 GMT):<br/>
the long way is to calculate MD5 sums
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:20:31 GMT):<br/>
I do see that https://github.com/woodyjon/fabric-test-network-k8s/blob/master/k8s/peer0-org1-deploy.yaml has `CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED` set to true, but https://github.com/woodyjon/fabric-test-network-k8s/blob/master/k8s/fabric-tools.yaml has it set to false, do you manually set that when you use the CLI?
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:21:53 GMT):<br/>
yes, I manually set it to true
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:22:01 GMT):<br/>

:pray: 
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:24:12 GMT):<br/>
ho shit
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:24:14 GMT):<br/>
;-)
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:24:27 GMT):<br/>
wait, was trying to double check inside this chat
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:24:30 GMT):<br/>
but it's harder to read
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:24:32 GMT):<br/>
```export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=$DIR_CRYPTO_MATERIAL/peerOrganizations/org1-example-com/users/Admin@org1-example-com/msp
#export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=$DIR_CRYPTO_MATERIAL/peerOrganizations/org1-example-com/peers/peer0-org1-example-com/msp/
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0-org1-example-com:7051```
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:25:27 GMT):<br/>
ok, no that's fine, I was thinking it was using org1 MSP and org0 for the peer address
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:25:48 GMT):<br/>
i
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:25:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm not a fan of mixing zero based and ones based numbering (e.g. first peer is peer0, first org is org1)
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:26:24 GMT):<br/>
HLF started that trend, drove me nuts reading stuff
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:27:37 GMT):<br/>
yes I agree. that's also from their test-network
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:27:38 GMT):<br/>
have you tried this command:
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:28:01 GMT):<br/>
```peer channel join -b $CHANNEL_NAME.block -o orderer-example-com:7050 -c $CHANNEL_NAME --tls $CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED --cafile $ORDERER_CA```
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:29:08 GMT):<br/>
usually the channel create and channel join should be the same basic commands
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:29:11 GMT):<br/>
I ran into that issue too
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:29:56 GMT):<br/>
yes I did that too
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:30:37 GMT):<br/>
and you get the same error ?
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:31:41 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:32:24 GMT):<br/>
would it be possible that it is an issue of the peer trying to connect to himself for endorsement?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:35:02 GMT):<br/>
I don't believe so, even if that were the case the peer should already be talking to itself
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:35:08 GMT):<br/>
since you installed all the certs
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:36:20 GMT):<br/>
the certs, they are just put by the fabric-tools pod on a shared nfs server
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:36:34 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:38:49 GMT):<br/>
I'm very grateful that you take the time to look at this. Big thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:39:31 GMT):<br/>
sure, it's hard to troubleshoot over chat ... HLF tends to output important information long before the actual error 
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:39:47 GMT):<br/>
you almost need to post the entire output when you run the command with debug mode
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:39:52 GMT):<br/>
but ... that is a lot of info
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:40:07 GMT):<br/>
I've solved many problems by scrolling up 20, 30, 50 lines
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:40:32 GMT):<br/>
can you run this and paste the output:
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:40:34 GMT):<br/>
```peer channel join -b $CHANNEL_NAME.block -o orderer-example-com:7050 -c $CHANNEL_NAME --tls $CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED --cafile $ORDERER_CA```
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:41:29 GMT):<br/>
this is what I use to create the channel (I have mTLS enabled)
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:45:22 GMT):<br/>
No, I haven't had to change that so I haven't read up on it
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:45:39 GMT):<br/>
I don't do CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTROOTCAS_FILES
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:45:42 GMT):<br/>
do I need it?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:45:52 GMT):<br/>
no because you're not using mTLS
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:46:29 GMT):<br/>
client TLS, you mean?
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:47:10 GMT):<br/>
ha ok, mutual TLS, so client as well
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:47:13 GMT):<br/>
yes / Mutual TLS 
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:48:10 GMT):<br/>
your setup is also on kubernetes?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:48:23 GMT):<br/>
yes, but a full cluster and I use the helm charts
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:48:32 GMT):<br/>
well, highly customized versions of them
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:49:03 GMT):<br/>
and I run the peer commands on a peer node in k8s or in a local docker container with all the ENV vars set
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:49:07 GMT):<br/>
I did not manage to get deployments with dots in the names, that's why i changed every names and addresses to dashes
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:49:11 GMT):<br/>
you should try running the join command on the peer itself
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:49:23 GMT):<br/>
if that doesn't work, then it probably is that the peer can't talk to the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:49:39 GMT):<br/>
I tried on the peer itself, and same error
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:50:13 GMT):<br/>
doesn't make sense that the create works but not join ...

do you know why in the error (access denied: channel [] creator org [Org1MSP]) the array seems empty, it does not give the name of the channel?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:52:21 GMT):<br/>
not sure
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:52:42 GMT):<br/>
I feel like I've seen that ... but I've seen so much that it all is a blurry picture
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:53:12 GMT):<br/>
the other answer I've found is to sometimes just wipe the entire thing out and start over (aka reboot)
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:53:31 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it will fix the issue, but maybe it will knock an idea loose
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:53:47 GMT):<br/>
I would also turn off TLS for now
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:53:53 GMT):<br/>
get the most basic thing working
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:53:55 GMT):<br/>
then add TLS back
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:54:34 GMT):<br/>
leave the RAFT TLS on, but turn off TLS between CLI / Peer / Orderer
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:55:42 GMT):<br/>
you can also decrypt the genesis block and the channel create blocks
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:56:06 GMT):<br/>
that will output JSON, then you have to extract the certs from the JSON and compare them to what you have on disk
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:56:18 GMT):<br/>
ok I will try that
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:56:28 GMT):<br/>
wiping out, I've already did it many times
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:56:42 GMT):<br/>
tls cannot be turned off, I think, for raft
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:56:50 GMT):<br/>
I think I tried
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:57:13 GMT):<br/>
thanks a lot anyway!!
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:57:19 GMT):<br/>
are you running > 1 orderer ?
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:57:23 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:57:25 GMT):<br/>
if not, turn off RAFT and TLS
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:57:40 GMT):<br/>
so use kafka?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:57:48 GMT):<br/>
yes, I was trying to remember if TLS was required for RAFT only or if it had to be on for the entire orderer
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:57:59 GMT):<br/>
at any rate, I think you can leave TLS on for the orderer if you need, but turn off on the peers
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:58:10 GMT):<br/>
I think you can do standalone, let me look
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:58:14 GMT):<br/>
no rAFT no Kafka
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:58:19 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:58:31 GMT):<br/>
```Orderer: &OrdererDefaults

    # Orderer Type: The orderer implementation to start
    # Available types are "solo", "kafka", and "etcdraft"
    OrdererType: etcdraft
```
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:58:40 GMT):<br/>
set that to `solo` not `etcraft`
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:58:45 GMT):<br/>
ok I will try solo then
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:58:48 GMT):<br/>
thank you
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:58:59 GMT):<br/>
pull to bare minimum, then add one or two things at a time
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:59:08 GMT):<br/>
yes, exactly
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:59:33 GMT):<br/>
when you wipe it out, do you delete all the .block files and all the TLS files ?
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:59:37 GMT):<br/>
but the pb does not seem to be tls here, right?
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:59:45 GMT):<br/>
yes, I delete everything
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:59:52 GMT):<br/>
I delete minikube
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:59:58 GMT):<br/>
I don't *think* it is tls, but I would disable and confirm
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:00:08 GMT):<br/>
yes ok
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:00:23 GMT):<br/>
when you delete minikube, does it wipe out the contents of the NFS volume?
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:00:33 GMT):<br/>
I delete it manually
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:00:36 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:00:46 GMT):<br/>
try those things, see what you find out
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:00:54 GMT):<br/>
yes I've done it many times. I change small stuff then I retry

do you know what I should check in there?
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:06:01 GMT):<br/>
mmm ok, it's quite long but I'll check it
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:07:07 GMT):<br/>
I compared the CA certs for the orderers and the orgs to the files on disk; it's a long shot for you, but in my case K8S seemed to be caching the TLS certs or my process (more likely) was failing to update them correctly in K8S
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:07:19 GMT):<br/>
sometimes the file in K8S didn't match what I had on disk locally
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:07:42 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:07:49 GMT):<br/>
(I generate a lot of the material locally and upload to K8S via secrets)
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:07:54 GMT):<br/>
but even if it does not match, what could I do?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:08:13 GMT):<br/>
if it doesn't match, then your process is wrong and you need to fix it
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:08:46 GMT):<br/>
:thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:08:58 GMT):<br/>
for example, if you generate the crypto files, then generate the configs, then regenerate the crypto material, the system will be broken because you distributed old crypto material with the genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:09:10 GMT):<br/>
ok I see
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:09:39 GMT):<br/>
does the version of cryptogen matter?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:10:15 GMT):<br/>
more specific generate crypto -> generate genesis -> generate crypto -> launch services and in that situation, the services have old crypto material from the genesis block that doesn't match the stuff on disk, so things don't work; that happened to me too when I tried to take short cuts and selectively regenerate broken crypto files
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:10:27 GMT):<br/>
the version of crypto gen should match the HLF system
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:10:37 GMT):<br/>
ok

Hello everyone
I am trying to deploy fabric on kubernetes in a GKE cluster.  I could not make the nfs folder mounting work on the k8s cluster nodes from different nfs VM. So, now I have deployed nfs server in a pod.
Still, the orderer and peer pods are not getting deployed and the 'kubectl describe pod' command shows the error as 'Failed mount'
</p>
<p><strong>ShrutiHK</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 05:49:25 GMT):<br/>
Can someone suggest what needs to done to resolve the issue?
</p>
<p><strong>ShrutiHK</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 05:52:57 GMT):<br/>
the detailed logs of the orderer pod show :  'Kafka version unset. Setting to 0.10.2.0'
</p>
<p><strong>ShrutiHK</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 05:53:08 GMT):<br/>
But, I am not using KAFKA at all

I think it is related to the docker container that is supposed to run the chaincode.

Hi all, i have setup fabric with kubernetes and wish to ask about high availability. When my peer pod goes down in the cluster, kubernetes will bring the peer pod up again but i have to manually do a command from the CLI to join channel and install chaincode on the peer again, is there any way i can do it automatically after it is down and brought back up?
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:41:57 GMT):<br/>

@vanitas92 i think u may have been mistaken, im not asking how the data can be persisted but rather some way for the peer pod to join back the channel instead of me typing into the CLI pod
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 10:35:32 GMT):<br/>
if you persist that data, when the pod restarts you wont need to do that manually when u back up the data

</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 09:18:59 GMT):<br/>
so you need to mount a volumemount inside the pod and then map it to the backing storage that you are using, see an example of that by using hostpath:
```
volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/hyperledger/production
          name: peer0-persistentdata
volumes:
      - name: peer0-persistentdata
        hostPath:
          path: /yourPath
          type: DirectoryOrCreate
```

isn't it easier to just juse statefulsets instead of deployments, so that the persistence aspect is built in?
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:03:00 GMT):<br/>
Statefulset is just a way on handling k8s pods in case of restarting or worker faults, it is recommended for stateful applications rather than stateless apps. Peers are stateful in that sense. However, statefulsets DO NOT guarantee persistence by themselves alone, you have to backup the data somehow using the type of storage your application might need.
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:03:43 GMT):<br/>
That could be NFS, block storage or whatever your application might need
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:05:04 GMT):<br/>
you can read more on that here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/

I'm interested to know - for anyone using K8S, are you using external LBs to access the HLF nodes (service type LoadBalancer)? If so, which LB are you using? Thinking I may need to move off AWS NLB... :/
</p>
<p><strong>lionelronaldo</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 06:05:46 GMT):<br/>
Currently I'm using one external LoadBalancer per k8s service that I want to access on my cluster (on DigitalOcean).

I.e. one LoadBalancer for each Peer and Orderer that should be accessible from outside the k8s cluster.

However, I want to move away from this complex and costly solution.

My goal is to use one external LoadBalancer per k8s cluster with an ingress controllers behind, which distributes the requests. 
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do that with nginx-ingress controller yet, maybe I'll have a look at different ingress-controllers.

I've tried to get it working with Traefik, however while Traefik supports gRPC, the AWS ALB does not. The ELB provides some, but not full support. Another issue that I've encountered is that none of the AWS LBs provide mTLS support.
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 15:16:57 GMT):<br/>
I did open a ticket with AWS about the NLB issues we're seeing, apparently it is a known and very specific situation. The only work around is to make the NLB a public NLB and ensure the K8S worker nodes are in a private subnet, then use IP whitelisting in the NLB security group to limit access.

the peers have services, and the peers appear to be able to connect with each other without issue, as I can install chaincode, invoke it,... This is what a peer service looks like:

<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Tue, 25 Feb 2020 13:28:03 GMT):<br/>
I have a question about the CAs. When you deploy a ca on kubernetes, it will generate the tls files. How do you share the tls-cert.pem file with the peers so that they can connect with the CA?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Tue, 25 Feb 2020 18:55:57 GMT):<br/>
Hey @woodyjon what I have done is generate the TLS files outside of the CA so our CA is not using it's own certificate; also you should distribute the TLS _chain_ not the cert itself
</p>
<p><strong>woodyjon</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 07:37:48 GMT):<br/>
Ok thanks. Ho man, this stuff is hard ;-)

Hi All,
</p>
<p><strong>ShrutiHK</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 10:14:58 GMT):<br/>
I have deployed 5 orderers in raft and other peer nodes in pods
</p>
<p><strong>ShrutiHK</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 10:15:26 GMT):<br/>
while creating the channel, I am facing this error -
*error validating DeltaSet: policy for [Group]  /Channel/Application not satisfied: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Admins' sub-policies to be satisfied*
</p>
<p><strong>ShrutiHK</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 10:16:40 GMT):<br/>
Requesting anyone who has faced this error to kindly help me out on this
</p>
<p><strong>ShrutiHK</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 10:17:20 GMT):<br/>
Also, have another query - Do we need to install go on the k8s cluster separately?
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 13:14:47 GMT):<br/>
Inside the K8S worker nodes - no, inside the Fabric Peer nodes, also no
</p>
<p><strong>ownspies</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 13:16:50 GMT):<br/>
I've had this when the configtx.yaml does not have correct policies, so would suggest starting there... That said, I also get this for no good reason and simply regenerating the configs using configtx-gen fixed it magically. Our setup currently includes six channels and typically when I create them, two - three fail with this error; I simply regenerate the config and then re-run the create for the failed channels and voila, it works I have been wanting to open a bug report, but the I don't have an easy way to reproduce
</p>
<p><strong>ShrutiHK</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 07:25:19 GMT):<br/>
Okay, thanks

Hi @ownspies , this error seems to be gone now. I created the crypto materials and other artifacts using fabric 1.4.2 (earlier I was using 1.4.3).
</p>
<p><strong>ShrutiHK</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 07:20:27 GMT):<br/>
But, I get another error which I don't know what to do about -

IIRC that is displayed when you're using TLS mutual auth but don't have the right cert chain specified for CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTROOTCAS_FILES

Hi everyone, a colleague and I have made a post on how to implement the new feature of External Chaincodes in Kubernetes environments, take a look and happy to receive some feedback from it. Thanks! https://medium.com/@pau.aragones/how-to-implement-hyperledger-fabric-external-chaincodes-within-a-kubernetes-cluster-fd01d7544523

Hello, I'm trying to install chaincode onto a 2.0 network and I encountered this error: Error: error getting chaincode deployment spec for transactive-energy: exit status 1. Does anyone have any idea what caused this?

@vanitas92 I am trying out this external-chaincode feature with your repo but I am stuck at one issue where I am not able to invoke the transatcions. When I checked the peer logs it says error while intantitating the chaincode. The error is given below

<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Sat, 21 Mar 2020 09:13:05 GMT):<br/>
hmmm i see there is a different sequence number, you have a value of  5. I have not tested it when upgrading or modifying this value so i cannot asess on that. However, i would make sure all peers have the same sequence and ccid of the chaincode so that signatures are valid. Just a guess here but if you find it out, please come here and share your experience!
</p>
<p><strong>javrevasandeep</strong> (Sat, 21 Mar 2020 10:09:40 GMT):<br/>
Finally I get it to working. Issue is in the invoke statement where the first  time invocation requires --isInit flag but in documentation this flag was missing.

Peer,cli and dind containers run in the same pod, docker certificates are valid as `docker --tlsverify ps` works as expected both from peer and cli containers

Hi all, im using kubernetes CA to approve the orderer's CSR but it seems like the orderer has an issue trying to create the CSR, the error is 
`  "message": "certificatesigningrequests.certificates.k8s.io is forbidden: User \"system:anonymous\" cannot create resource \"certificatesigningrequests\" in API group \"certificates.k8s.io\" at the cluster scope",`
i have checked that my orderer pod is in the same namespace as that was given the create rights. I had no issue with the kafka pod creating the CSR.

`kubectl create clusterrole cluster-edit-csr --resource=certificatesigningrequest --verb=create,delete,list,get`
`kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-edit-csr-bind01 --clusterrole=cluster-edit-csr --group=certificates.k8s.io --serviceaccount=orgorderer1:default`

Hi everyone, i would like to setup the peers 2.0 version in kubernetes yaml the CORE_CHAINCODE_EXTERNALBUILDERS through env vars but i am contslanty getting the following error Error: '': source data must be an array or slice, got string. I put the following input:
```
        - name: CORE_CHAINCODE_EXTERNALBUILDERS
          value: '[{name: golang-builder, path: /builders/golang}]'
```
I think that is because env var do not support arrays but i am not completely sure. The docs suggest to modify the core.yaml file itself but that does not have a good approach with kubernetes as it is the only config option to be modified in core.yaml file itself, though i have tried that and it works:

> Modify the chaincode stanza of the peer core.yaml file to include the externalBuilders configuration element:
```
externalBuilders:
     - name: myexternal
       path: <fully qualified path on the peer's env>  
```
Does anyone have a better approach on this?

Hi All,

I am trying to setup fabric network on kubernetes using existing cryto certs that i have from my previous work. I have migrated those certs to my kubernetes setup. While i try to create channel with my existing tlscacerts, i get error on my orderer logs saying this: ServerHandshake -> ERRO 024[0m TLS handshake failed with error remote error: tls: bad certificate server=Orderer remoteaddress=10.28.2.11:40992
Any idea, if migrating the certs to kubernetes is not expected and if i am required to generate new certs on premise?
any thoughts on this

I am trying to set up fabric network on Kubernetes using existing crypto certs that i have from my previous work. I have migrated those certs to my kubernetes setup. While i try to create channel with my existing tlscacerts, i get error on my orderer logs saying this: ServerHandshake -> ERRO 024[0m TLS handshake failed with error remote error: tls: bad certificate server=Orderer remoteaddress=10.28.2.11:40992,
seems like the certs arent being accepted here.
Any idea, if migrating the certs to kubernetes is not expected and if i am required to generate new certs on premise?
any help around is highly appreciated.
any thoughts on this @iramiller

Hi, I am trying to setup HLF in K8s, when I run instantiation command, its starting the chaincode container successfully. But the instantiation step is exiting with EOF. When I perform any query execution I am getting the following error:
Error: endorsement failure during query. response: status:500 message:"make sure the chaincode test_cc has been successfully instantiated and try again: chaincode test_cc not found"

We are planning to run single blockchain deployed on single k8s cluster  per one customer. The next step is to have distributed communication between many customers with their own k8s clusters and deployed blockchains there. How do you guy perform the following scenario? I'm mostly interested in authentication mechanisms used between k8s clusters

Check your orderer node logs as well. Is your instantiation transaction log successfully broadcasted and committed?

Hey guys!
As you probably realized, there are far more people needing help with HF + K8s (Hyperledger Fabric + Kubernetes) than there are people who have the knowledge and time to help. :astonished: 

Just wanted to post again the amazingly awesome PIVT repository: https://github.com/APGGroeiFabriek/PIVT  :fire: :rocket:
They have ready to use scripts and config files, and a README that walks you through every step. :person_climbing: 
They offer production-ready setups for Kafka, RAFT, TLS, adding Orgs and even Cross K8s Cluster! :exploding_head: 

This repo is open source and single handedly saves the HF K8s community. Huge thank you to these Devs! :heart_eyes: 
Check it out, give it a star, learn some argo basics, and send the guys a donation/your gratitude! :pray: :shamrock:
</p>

just replace the container version with 2.0 and replace the old chaincode lifecycle with the new one

Hello.  I have setup a fabric on AWS EKS, version: v1.15.11-eks-af3caf.  I have created a channel, and joined multiple peers.  Next I tried to deploy a chaincode package using peer lifecycle chaincode install, but it fails with the following message: "2020-07-27 10:14:26.622 UTC [dockercontroller] buildImage -> ERRO f85 Error building image: docker build failed: Error returned from build: 1..." The full error message is here: https://pastebin.com/C2Ju906w

This looks like a name resolution error.  Pods on the EKS cluster have connectivity to the internet.  From the peer I'm able to download https://registry.npmjs.org/fabric-shim/-/fabric-shim-2.0.0.tgz without issue.

Looking through this Rocket.Chat channel I see others using IBM's K8 offering mention docker is not longer used as the container runtime, and docker in docker is required.  Could this be the same for AWS EKS?

After further investigation I can see a chaincode container is being created on one of the EKS nodes.  Therefore it's not a container runtime issue.  I have inspected the chaincode container which starts and falls over, and I see the following config: https://pastebin.com/rEE4wfjA
It looks like the network mode is incorrect: "NetworkMode": "default".  Previously in earlier version of fabric I had used the peer env var CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE to set this as required.  It doesn't appear to be working this time around.  I have attempted to set this to none, but it still shows as default when a chaincode container is started.  Can anyone help?

<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Mon, 03 Aug 2020 14:18:01 GMT):<br/>
Hi Julian, I would not suggest to use the docker daemon from the EKS workers nodes themselves, as you will have no control about the chaincodes within the EKS domain. I would suggest to use the Docker-in-Docker approach if you are still using the legacy chaincode lifecycle, which i would not also recommend as it is currently deprecated. As you are using version 2.1.1, i would suggest using the new lifecycle chaincode installation and build your chaincodes as docker containers that are available with EKS domain. See the following documentation: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/cc_service.html
</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong> (Tue, 04 Aug 2020 09:10:05 GMT):<br/>
@vanitas92 Hello.  I had seen the external service option, but I haven't researched it.  I will read about it now.  Thank you for your reply.
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Tue, 04 Aug 2020 09:11:37 GMT):<br/>
I have made a tutorial about this if you need further help with some examples and code templates https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-implement-hyperledger-fabric-external-chaincodes-within-a-kubernetes-cluster-fd01d7544523

<p><strong>julian</strong> (Tue, 04 Aug 2020 17:10:46 GMT):<br/>
@vanitas92 On further reading I see the chaincode as an external service is currently only available for go.  Our chaincode is written in node.  I will probably have to take the docker in docker route.
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 14:15:34 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that might be the best approach for non golang based chaincodes for now, until they support the external chaincode feature :)

have a new error (posted it in fabric-java-sdk) but thought it might have happened somewhere else using a different language. 

go chaincode is failing to upgrade. this is in a long standing network with multiple prior successful upgrades. logs are inconclusive. 
i'm thinking it's a resource issue but can't see anything obviously awry. anyone have this happen to them?

Hello guys, I'm successfully running HLF 2.2.1 locally with docker & docker-compose but I would like to migrate it k8s. I have problems establishing connection from peers to a single raft  orderer. I was trying to use the IBM https://github.com/IBM/blockchain-network-on-kubernetes. First question I have is are you all using TLS internally in k8s network this examples does not set that option when creating the genesis.block and channel tx.
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 13:50:03 GMT):<br/>
You can take a look at my repository on setting up a k8s based hyperledger fabric network with external chaincode feature, i think it also includes your answer on how you can generate TLS artefacts that match the inner services of K8s, although it is not the center theme of the article. See if that helps: https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-implement-hyperledger-fabric-external-chaincodes-within-a-kubernetes-cluster-fd01d7544523

Hey guys i am new to Fabric but as of some requirement I am stuck at a point and looking for help ```
*The setup below is all done on Google Cloud.*

Setup 1: Docker 

I have a Docker setup running on a VM instance having a Hyperledger Fabric Network(1.4.2) of 3 Orderers(etcdraft) and 2 peers(peer0, peer1) of a single organization.

As part of Docker setup the crypto-material generated is using Fabric CA. The channel that i have on the network is "mychannel"

Setup 2: Kubernetes

I have a Kubernetes Cluster running on GKE having just 1 peer pod(peer2). 

The setup files realted to this pod are: 

1. peer2 Deployment File
2. peer2 Service File
3. peer2 CLI
4. peer2 CouchDB

What I want to achieve is:

I want the peer pod of Kubernetes to be able to communicate with the network setup in Docker.

i.e. I want atleast 1 peer of the Kubernetes should be able to join the network channel(mychannel) on the Docker Network and be able to perform some transaction/query 
like instantiation of chaincode and query the same.

Till now what I have done is exposed the services of the peer pod in Kubernetes i.e. ClusterIP -> NodePort.

Any help would be appreciated.

```

<p><strong>HansrajRami</strong> (Tue, 22 Dec 2020 15:51:34 GMT):<br/>
For peers issue new TLS certificates from the same CA which issued their current certs
replace the existing certificates (or update core.yaml to point to the new certificates if using different paths/filenames)
restart the peer(s)
For orderers using Raft, what you can do is for orderers is use their existing private keys to generate new CSRs and then have the CA issue a new public certificate. You will then replace / update orderer.yaml the public certificate and restart the orderers one at a time.

Hey Folks, I have one doubt related to the deployment of my fabric network on kubernetes. I am planning to deploy my peers as statefulsets with 1 replica and in the near future i would be scaling them to 3 . I want to how the data replication between these statefulsets will happen and will scaling up work as they will not be in sync.

Hi everyone,

I am trying to deploy HLF 2.2 on Kuberentes as part of a research project, but I have some issues with the configurations.

I started converting the docker-compose files from the test-network into k8s deployments, but there are a lot of configurations to create channels,join peers, not to mention installing CC plus pod to pod communication that has to be done makes things even more difficult.
 Are there any configuration files or a guide how to do that? 

I have already read about this article: https://kctheservant.medium.com/test-network-script-walk-through-95ca973bc676
but unfortunately it runs with errors on my machine after following the instructions at the point of starting the orderers:

e.g. `Hyperledger fabric:TLS handshake failed with error remote error: tls: bad certificate server=Orderer remoteaddress`


Any help/hint is highly appreciated! 

Thanks!

Hello, I would like to deploy fabric ca server on Google Kubernetes Engine and the `fabric-ca-server-config.yaml` requires the `csr.hosts`. How can I get the hostname of the pod running in k8s cluster in order to put the hostname in the file?
```
csr:
   cn: fabric-ca-server
   keyrequest:
     algo: ecdsa
     size: 256
   names:
      - C: US
        ST: "North Carolina"
        L:
        O: Hyperledger
        OU: Fabric
   hosts:
     - localhost
```

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=E3HYbDtNfNFD8AphP) I have a tutorial video on YouTube on how to do this here: https://youtu.be/PbMxqH6bNB8

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=mgNojYghE5ka2Mvye) I have done this and it works great.  You will need to use the new peer chaincode lifecycle, and the new osnadmin commands.  You do not need a system channel either.

Hi All,

I am trying to setup a fabric network (v2.3.1) in AWS EKS environment using chaincode as an external service but getting below error message after running the `peer lifecycle chaincode install` command:
Error:
```
Error: chaincode install failed with status: 500 - failed to invoke backing implementation of 'InstallChaincode': could not build chaincode: docker build failed: docker image inspection failed: Get "http://unix.sock/images/dev-peer0-org1-mycc -4e09ca97183ec70be708a4db7bf87295adf37c86f5d991ad82024a27f5df8d80-4794d06c41d224a533fdc93cfa93ed46abc5c4e679d0a803ad908a7e62ddfe54/json": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: no such file or directory
```

As per https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric/topic/77402508?p=Created,,,20,2,0,0::recentpostdate%2Fsticky,,,20,2,0,77402508, it seems this error is because of some update by Docker desktop and it can be resolved by switching off the gRPC FUSE settings, but not able to figure out what needs to be done in case of managed kubernetes cluster (v1.19 EKS). Can anyone suggest how we can fix this error ?

You folks know what you need to do to get a peer cli running on your machine talking to an orderer/peer running in k8s via kubectl port forward when tls is on ? do i have to do anything special ? i am getting disconnection. and i see my localhost is listed in the logs of the peer but then the connection gets dropped
</p>
<p><strong>HansrajRami</strong> (Sun, 02 May 2021 19:00:10 GMT):<br/>
This happened with me as well few times
One reason can be that your build packs not having execute permission

And other that chaincode package in not packaged correctly so peer will assume that it normal chaincode build

Because if any of the configs doesn't match peer start building it as normal docker build

I am running Hyperledger fabric network on Kubernetes with ClusterIP services
Can anyone suggest how to use ingress with peer and orderer to access them outside of cluster?

  name: orderer1
  namespace: hyperledger
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: orderer1
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 30004
      nodePort: 30004
      targetPort: 7050
```

And I create a configmap for the genesis.block:
```
kubectl create configmap genesis --from-file=artifacts/genesis.block --namespace hyperledger
```

Update
These are the contents of the `/var/hyperledger/orderer/` directory inside the pod:
```
drwxrwxrwx    6 root     root          4096 Jun 10 10:06 msp
drwxrwxrwx    3 root     root          4096 Jun 10 10:06 orderer.genesis.block
drwxrwxrwx    3 root     root          4096 Jun 10 10:06 tls
drwxrwxrwx    3 root     root          4096 Jun 10 10:06 tlscacerts
```
And the genesis.block file is `d`.

Error: Post "https://192.168.49.2:30004/participation/v1/channels": x509: cannot validate certificate for 192.168.49.2 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs

Could you please help? The up is my cluster ip for now and 30004 is a nodeport svc that connects with the orderer pod

Hello everyone.
I am deploying a fabric network to Kubernetes with external chaincode service. But I met a quite  weird problem.
I am using the same `detect` `build` and `release` script as [fabric-samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-external/sampleBuilder/bin), and the connection.json is like
```
{
  "address": "chaincode-org1.fabric.svc.cluster.local:3000",
  "dial_timeout": "10s",
  "tls_required": false
}
``` 
The chaincode install works fine but after installing I found that there is a connection.json under `/var/hyperledger/production/externalbuilder/builds/{{chaincodeID}}/release/chaincode/server/` but nothing in the json file. So the chaincode invoke will failed because the peer does not know the url of external chaincode service.
But if I manually add the content to the empty connection.json file, the invoking works fine.

I tried to debug the external builder by redirecting stdout to stderr in release script. The script do copy the `connection.json`(not empty) to /tmp/{{chaincodeID}}/release but for some reason it is not correctly copied back to /var/hyperledger/production/....
Any one has solution for this?
Thanks!
