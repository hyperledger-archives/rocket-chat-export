I am testing the performance of fabric by timing the start of invoking a single transaction on node A to the end of quering the same transaction on node B. I wrote a shell script to run the invoke.js and query.js in the fabcar sample. The result was 3.9 seconds for the writing and reading to complete. \nI have 2 questions:\n1. Am i testing it correctly? Is that the right way to calculate tx per second? Fabric is said to be able to do 3500 tx per second and ethereum is able to do 15 tx per second. Should I be pushing 10,000 or more transactions to the blockchain and see how long it takes and divide 10,000 by time taken?\n2.

{"msg":"Hi all!! I'm working in developing a simple Fabric application using the Node SDK on Kubernetes. Firstly, I've deployed a custom kubernetes cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine and created a simple network using this repo from steps 4 and 5 (https://github.com/IBM/blockchain-network-on-kubernetes). Note: I skip the IBM Cloud Steps because I'm using my own cluster. \n\nAfter the deployment, I'm able to perform invokes/queries inside one peer, without problem. However, if I use the Node SDK (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.1/fabcar) I'm only able to perform enroll/register and queries. The invoke requests fail.

It appears to be a hairpin related issue on the virtual device, but moving forward, we don't intend to use Minikube for production, so it's probably not worth spending time to find a fix, unless someone has one to hand ;-)   There seem to be lots of options for installing a cluster.

While the learning curve for Kubernetes is steep given the number of containers required for even a single Org fabric system there really isn't a better solution out there—especially if you are going into a public cloud.  Our company has a fabric 1.4 deployment with several organizations spread across GKE and AWS (soon to include Azure).  At this scale there really isn't any other way.  Unfortunately in 1.4 the Fabric chaincode scheduling is not sufficient for our needs which required us to implement Kubernetes native scheduling of pods instead of using the docker.sock approach.

I understand the advantages of using kubernetes with stateless applications. But Fabric nodes are stateful. Moreover, to run for example a new peer,  some prerequisites have to be done (registering a peer identity in CA, ...). So as I see it, Fabric will not work with kubernetes out of the box. And my point is maybe it would be easier to implement own orchestration tool for Fabric network (based on ansible for example) rather than trying to \"integrate\" stateful and complex Fabric with k8s?\n\nAlso, I'm curious, do you deploy your databases, message brokers, etc on k8s cluster?

{"msg":"@krabradosty well... 'out of the box' is a somewhat vague concept here given the extensive set of tools available and the variety of use cases.  I would consider our environment to be very close to the Fabric software as released.  We added about 100-120 lines of Golang to our fork for kubernetes integration in the peer process itself but everything else is based on released binaries.  We do have extensive systems tooling in TerraForm, Ansible, and good old bash scripts to make our environment manageable.\n\nOrchestration uses that are most valuable to us are the ability to define the resource requirements of the various components of our system and rely on Kubernetes to correctly schedule these components across the available nodes.  All of our peer deployments run as StatefulSets which Kubernetes handles in a more appropriate way for scheduling.  For databases we prefer to use solutions like Google's Cloud SQL outside of Kubernetes although for certain situations we do run small databases (postgres, Redis, etc) as containers within Kubernetes.\n\nIn a public cloud the machines these systems are deployed on WILL be restarted/fail/migrate with downtime.  A solution that pretends the machine will be up consistently is going to have a bad time.  As a concrete example there was a recent CVE issued which required all of our nodes to be rebooted for patching.  This was handled without impact to our production workflows (other than some additional retries occurring for some transactions).  We also run a very large Kafka cluster within Kubernetes with good results.  The Kafka/messaging architecture has been crucial to our success as a Request/Reply architecture is not very compatible with a distributed system.\n\nIt is better to jump in from the start believing that pieces can and will fail unexpectedly.  For reference our scale is around a dozen fabric orgs each with multiple peers and an ICA.  We have instances in every AWS availability zone across North America and many GKE zones as well.","username":"iramiller","ts":"2019-03-14T15:37:17.147Z"}

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=9LrxWNDXptGaBFQa4) To clarify on the peer scheduling requiring registration with the channels, CA, etc.  We do not scale the number of peers up/down in kubernetes.  We schedule the peers on nodes relying on the resource scheduling capabilities of Kubernetes.  To support management of secrets and configuration we store all of the config and certificates in configmaps and secrets within kubernetes.  We do use a PVC for the chain data.  Further we use multiple containers within the same pod, one for the peer and the second for couchdb which means that the couch connection is always localhost to the peer for performance.  These are some of the useful aspects of Kubernetes orchestration even for stateful workloads like a peer process.  Additionally we schedule our chaincode as one off pods managed by the peer itself via Kubernetes API calls and rely on NetworkPolicy configuration to ensure the scheduled peer chaincode containers can only talk to their owning peer container.","username":"iramiller","ts":"2019-03-14T17:49:43.323Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=9LrxWNDXptGaBFQa4","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-kubernetes?msg=9LrxWNDXptGaBFQa4","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

{"msg":"@yacovm the areas we are exploring a service mesh for to solve are 1. -- TLS management (a quick scan shows nearly 600 instances of pem files for MSPs, TLS, mutual TLS identities in our environment). 2. -- Secure cross cluster connections, we may be able to integrate our Wireguard VPN system into a service mesh for more automated rollout and administration. 3. -- Service routing solution for the updated chaincode/peer architecture proposed for HLF 2.0.  We require control of the versions of chaincode used within our consortium and we must have multiple versions deployable and a single version instantiated across the entire network.  Using a service mesh we can handle routing between these version.  Additionally we use a custom end-to-end encryption system that encrypts the entire contents of every transaction.  This approach uses customer managed keys so the platform itself does not have access to the data.  As part of this approach the client that submits a transaction determines which of the many peers available it wants to use and includes an ephemeral public key from the chaincode instance allowed to process the transaction.  I am simplifying this a little bit but the short of all of that is that we have our own service and instance discover system with key management and we believe that a service mesh could potentially be used to streamline this process further.

Have you considered the structure for your chaincode (both the code itself as well as the data structures and the balance between what is on chain and what is stored off of it?  A read heavy workload will have different infrastructure requirements than a write heavy workload ... The amount of read/write contention in your workload will be another significant consideration.  The latency in your network between orderer nodes as well as from orderers to peers and intra-peer gossip are all critical.  If the distribution of committed blocks is slow then you are prone to MVCC errors.  The CA pod has essentially no load on it in a production network.  Your question for how to scale this pod leads me to believe that you may need to do some significant systems architecture research and testing before you pursue scaling the peer workloads further.","username":"iramiller","ts":"2019-10-28T14:23:28.749Z"}

The best strategy I've been able to come up with is manually deploying specific secrets for tls-ca/ca, then every thing else being dynamic through initContainers on peers/orderers/etc against your organizations existing secrets. All shared organization crypto identities could be shared through secret volumes with nodes being restarted as needed when new identities become available\n\nI haven't seen any kubernetes examples that aren't using toy crypto material.

{"msg":"Hi @kirikiri. It depends on how you setup your HF network on K8s. I personally asked myself the same question last week. For the setup, I used the guide for a production environment by AidTech (https://github.com/aidtechnology/hgf-k8s-workshop). By using the helm charts hlf-peer and hlf-orderer, services for each Peer are automatically generated. Also the great guide by APG and Accenture NL (https://github.com/APGGroeiFabriek/PIVT) creates a Kubernetes service for every pod. That way you can access the Peer and Orderer Pods over their respective service :slight_smile: . \n\nSo you just need to install the nginx ingress e.g.\n`helm install nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress`\n\nand then create an ingress with a file ingress.yaml similar to this\n`apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: peer-ingress\n  namespace: peers\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: peer.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /request\n        backend:\n          serviceName: peer1-hlf-peer\n          servicePort: request\n      - path: /event\n        backend:\n          serviceName: peer1-hlf-peer\n          servicePort: event`\n\nwith `kubectl create -f ingress.yaml`","username":"lionelronaldo","ts":"2020-01-13T07:45:06.834Z"}

The application that connects to the HF network could reside in any part of the world, shouldn't it?\nThis would indicate that it's safe to expose the peer outside of the cluster, because requests are anyway only executed if they come from trusted entities, i.e. parties that have a certificate that's trusted by the HF network.\nDoes this make sense?

{"msg":"I had the same question @lionelronaldo. Thank you for framing it so aptly.

{"msg":"@gentios \nSo i figured out how to adjust the helm charts hlf-ca, hlf-peer and hlf-orderer so that the installation of them automatically creates an ingress. :yum: \n\nAt first I wanted to use the same secret of the TLS certificate across ca, orderer and peer. So just one certifiacte for mydomain.com, and to redirect the requests to the specific services via paths like mydomain.com/ca,  mydomain.com/peer and mydomain.com/orderer. Guess what, the problem was the fabric-ca-client. \nWhen you call `FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=./config fabric-ca-client enroll -u https://ord-admin:OrdAdm1nPW@$CA_INGRESS -M ./OrdererMSP` (as in the AidTech guide https://github.com/aidtechnology/hgf-k8s-workshop/tree/master/prod_example), the $CA_INGRESS would be in our example mydomain.com/ca. Unfortunetaley the fabric-ca-client binary cuts off everthing before the last slash, and instead of https://mydomain.com/ca/enroll it always tried to call https://ca/enroll which obviously doesn't work.\nI couldn't find a way around that. :disappointed: Please tell me if you know a solution that this issue!\n\nNext try was to use a wildcard certificate for *.mydomain.com, so I only need to generate one certificate in my cluster and I don't run into the letsencrypt rate limits that easily. However, for that you need a special ClusterIssuer with a dns solver that can connect to your domain registrator. I didn't have that because I'm currently using free domains without such api service.  \n:feet: \nSo in the end, I just used the subdomains ca.mydomain.com, orderer.mydomain.com and peer.mydomain.com and generated for each one of them a TLS certificate issued by letsencrypt.\n\nAfter you have a ready ClusterIssuer for the cert-manager (let's say it is \"letsencrypt-production), you need to add an ingress section to each of the values.yaml files of the charts:\nca:\n`ingress:\n  enabled: true\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx\n    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production\n  path: / \n  hosts:\n    # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name\n    - ca.yourdomain.com\n  tls:\n    - secretName: ca--tls\n      hosts:\n        # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name\n        - ca.yourdomain.com`\npeer:\n`ingress:\n  enabled: true\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx\n    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production \n  path: /\n  hosts:\n    # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name\n    - peer.yourdomain.com\n  tls:\n    - secretName: peer--tls #tls-secret\n      hosts:\n        # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name\n        - peer.yourdomain.com`\norderer:\n`ingress:\n  enabled: true\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx\n    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production\n  path: /\n  hosts:\n    # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name\n    - orderer.yourdomain.com\n  tls:\n    - secretName: orderer--tls\n      hosts:\n        # TODO: Change this to your Domain Name\n        - orderer.yourdomain.com`\n\nI only included this ingress section in peer1 and ord1, as I was ok with connecting to just 1 peer and orderer. This creates 3 ingresses, which should be accessable via your domains with https. :heart_decoration: \nUntil now I'm not sure how to use the ingress for peer and orderer. \nI guess with this setup it's possible to enable a HF network with multiple K8s clusters. :slight_smile:  That will be the next step.","username":"lionelronaldo","ts":"2020-01-16T12:29:54.434Z"}

{"msg":"Statefulset is just a way on handling k8s pods in case of restarting or worker faults, it is recommended for stateful applications rather than stateless apps.
