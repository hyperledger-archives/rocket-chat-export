{"msg":"Hi, anyone have any experience using minifab on a restricted network? At work, we use decrypt to decrypt and inspect all HTTPS traffic going into and out of the firm's network. This means that every docker image we use needs to install and trust our root certificates in order to access the web. I'm attempting to extend the images needed for minifab and I've edited \"apply.yaml\" so that all of the `docker run` commands launch my custom containers instead of the fabric official ones. This has a few issues: (1) I can only target one version of fabric at a time because I don't have an automated way to extend the images (2) I've had to install an additional package (ca-certificates) on fabric-peer and fabric-orderer in order to install the certificates I need, not sure if this would cause any issues (3) it doesn't work - I can bring up a network but I can't get past the 'create channel' step (see thread). \n\nWe are attempting to build a HLF developer environment at my workplace and this is currently a blocker for us, if anyone has any time to help me out I would greatly appreciate it. Since HLF is targetting enterprise, I think minifab users can expect to encounter this issue in their own workplaces so a general solution may be of significant value.

I've fixed a few things with my code and am continuing to work on it.  I don't mean to bug you about my bugs :)  But I noticed a few things about minifabric that you might be interested in:\n1.  If you $ minifabric initialize and it has been run before, it will give you an error about the parameters.  You have to $ minifabric initialize -p '' to clear the parameters.  Is this expected behavior?\n2.  If you modify my code and add a var emissionsAmount = 0.0; at https://github.com/opentaps/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/master/utility-emissions-channel/chaincode/node/lib/emissions.js#L15, then try to deploy, it crashes the peer nodes.

{"msg":"According to minifabric's official github repository - If you would like to learn Hyperledger Fabric or develop your smart contract, or just want to get a feel of Hyperledger Fabric, Minifabric is the tool to get you started. Minifabric can stand up a Fabric network on a small machine like a VirtualBox VM *but can also deploy Fabric networks across multiple production grade servers*. Minifabric has been tested on Linux, OS X, Windows 10 and supports Fabric releases 1.4.4 or newer. So i think it can be used.","username":"sumiteshnaithani","ts":"2022-01-25T04:57:07.265Z"}
