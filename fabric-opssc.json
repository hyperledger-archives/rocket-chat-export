{"msg":"Thank you again for your great presentation and contribution to the OpsSC project.\n\nI mostly agree with your motivation and suggestions.\nI believe that the following features listed on p.8 of my deck at HGF correspond to your proposal.\n  - Full support for workflow state transitions (e.g., Rejecting a proposal)\n  - RBAC/ABAC for OpsSC chaincodes\n  - Voting policy configuration\n\nWhat I am trying to say is your proposals are important to make OpsSC more practical.","username":"tatsu-sato","ts":"2021-06-14T08:15:51.581Z"}
{"msg":"Here are my comments on what I have noticed at this moment:\n\n- *About voting Enhancements*\n   - I think it's a great idea.\n   - As an initial step, it seems like a good idea to implement it without making any changes to the policy of Fabric itself (as you mentioned in your presentation).\n\n- *About consortia management*\n   - I agree with the importance of consortium membership management in your proposal. However, I still don't understand the intent of the design.\n  　It seems that it could be implemented by managing the ops-channel as the consortium on channel_ops. So, could you clarify what are the benefits to have a separate consortium management as consortia_ops?\n\nIf you already have a more detailed design or initial implementation that you can share, I think I can better understand your intentions and we may be able to have a more in-depth discussion.","username":"tatsu-sato","ts":"2021-06-14T08:20:02.395Z"}
{"msg":"I don't have a more detailed design or initial implementation.  I may need to understand the channel_ops chaincode a bit more as I don't really recall anything that deals with consortia membership as a higher level thing than a channel configuration.","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2021-06-14T19:42:57.858Z"}
{"msg":"@toddinpal Thank you for your reply.\nAs per your comment, the current channel_ops does not deal with a higher level thing than a channel configuration.\n\nIMHO, all the organizations which join the consortium can be assumed to join ops_channel, and the operations by channel_ops for ops_channel can be also treated as those for the consortium.\nSo, I think there is an option as the implementation to enhance channel_ops to also manage the consortium (ops-channel is handled as a special channel in channel_ops).\n\nIn order to understand which implementation option makes more sense,  I would like to discuss the advantages of the option of adding consortia_ops as a separated chaincode to manage the consortium. I would be happy to get your opinion.","username":"tatsu-sato","ts":"2021-06-16T04:58:09.121Z"}
{"msg":"I should clarify.  I see channels as basically separate ledgers that one or more members of a consortia can join.  The proposed enhancements elevate a consortium to a higher level entity that leverages the existing API server and Agent.  As I believe consortia management is different from channel management, I thought it made most sense to have a separate chaincode for it.","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2021-06-16T23:24:48.445Z"}

{"msg":"That's a really good question.  Not sure how a single channel where the consortia_ops is instantiated could be part of multiple consortia.

{"msg":"As far as I can tell it looks good.   The diagram is a little complicated so I'm not entirely sure it matches my proposal.  Not sure what the x-y' operations are.

{"msg":"Thank you for your comments.\n \n>Is that the case as I'm not sure why it would need to do that as its requests are basically being proxied through the temporary credentials provided for Org1.\n \nFirst, we assume that adding a new member (e.g., NewOrg) requires approval from multiple existing organizations (e.g., Org1 and Org2)　(the terms of which depend on something like the consortium policy).\n \nIf there were no x-y' operations, then Org2 would vote on a proposal to add NewOrg as in the 1-4 operation in the current implementation.\nIn this case, in terms of the correctness of NewOrg's information (including MSP),\nOrg2 would need to either trust Org1, or obtain MSP information from NewOrg separately and compare it and the information in the proposal as in the 0-1' and 1-3 operations in the current implementation.\n \nThe x-y' operations help to turn this into system processes on OpsSC. Does it make sense?\n \n>A more detailed sequence diagram showing just the new flow would really help, but I think we're very close to agreement.\n \nAlso, we are going to try to draw a more detailed sequence diagram about the new flow.

{"msg":"I tried to make a sequence diagram (the step numbers correspond to the slides I made the other day) as I attached.\n \nWhile creating the diagram, I noticed that it would be hard to realize the sub-flow of adding NewOrg to ops-channel automatically via channel_ops (See the NOTE in the diagram).\nThis flow shows only one example scenario. Because channel_ops only provides a simple feature to handle ConfigUpdate transactions,\nit would be consortium_ops that is responsible for supporting multiple specific scenarios (such as adding, removing organizations, renewing certificates for organizations).\n\nYour other suggestion \"voting enhancements\", on the other hand, seems to be relatively less difficult, with a smaller scope and impact on the current implementation. \nI think that the patches may be easier than ones for consortium_ops. In addition, I expect the consortium_ops will also need the enhanced voting function and will reuse its internal sub-functions.\n\nSo, my idea is to start by considering Voting enhancements.
