</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 05 Feb 2017 18:51:59 GMT):<br/>
does this mean that when sending over a deploy from say the NodeJS SDK that a Dockerfile should / must no longer be included in the archive?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 05 Feb 2017 19:05:16 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 "should not" is most appropriate
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 05 Feb 2017 19:05:24 GMT):<br/>
if you add one, it will be completely disregarded
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 05 Feb 2017 19:05:41 GMT):<br/>
but nothing will break, at least at the peer level
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 05 Feb 2017 19:06:10 GMT):<br/>
(obviously if you were somehow taking advantage of the dockerfile for your chaincode to do something for you, that would break
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 05 Feb 2017 20:12:53 GMT):<br/>
cool - that's what it looked like to me as well - but just wanted to make sure.  And of course with the ccenv container we no longer need to vendor the fabric / shim src?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 05 Feb 2017 20:24:04 GMT):<br/>
Correct.  If you do not vendor the shim, it will implicitly give you the one that matches the peer
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 05 Feb 2017 20:24:25 GMT):<br/>
If you do vendor it, the vendor should override

@greg.haskins  - https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2046   - I imagine that this was likely a point in time statement?  I have not tried this using snapshot builds, but I assume that this was likely caused by the fact the the published ccenv image(s) have not been updated since we added these packages?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 13:37:28 GMT):<br/>
your assessment sounds reasonable to me
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 13:38:29 GMT):<br/>
basically, we _still_ dont support anything but building from source (FAB-678) and if you do, the shim should be tightly coupled to the peer/fabric by virtue of sharing the source
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 13:39:02 GMT):<br/>
once FAB-678 is in place, we will continue to have that tight coupling even with dockerhub images and binary deployments
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 13:39:18 GMT):<br/>
cool
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 13:39:21 GMT):<br/>
until then, any mismatches are probably people pulling incompatible things together
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 13:39:30 GMT):<br/>
that's what I figured
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 06 Feb 2017 13:41:12 GMT):<br/>
one thing @mastersingh24 ... this is besides the main point ... but ACL api's would likely change too (and they don;t work now). So one option would be to just release note that for alpha

@kenzhang  - we have not yet hooked up TLS on the orderer as none of the other components will be able to talk to it if TLS is enabled
</p>

Hi Guys

In fabric 1.0 we can create multiple channels. But wanted to know if there is a way where we create a dedicated channel between 2 peers, such that the third peer is prevented from joining the channel?

Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>siddhid</strong> (Wed, 15 Feb 2017 04:28:47 GMT):<br/>
 what is the command prompt command for specifying the peer certificates to be included/avoided while creating the channel?

we should have an e-2-e test

it will be fixed when 5989 and 6021 are merged afaik

A few questions on endorsing peers. How does a client look up endorsing peers for a chaincode transaction? Presume the client can send the transaction proposal to multiple endorsing peers in parallel? Also presume channels are only needed for ordering services (consensus). Does a client have to use to a channel to submit requests for endorsement?

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 16 Feb 2017 22:04:26 GMT):<br/>
@s.narayanan As to the multiple endorsers in parallel, yes.  As to who the endorsers are, that is more involved.  It depends on the configuration of the channel and it's MSP/policy setup.

Hi - I'm getting some in depth questions about what are the triggers for a peer to know it is out of date and needs to resync either with the channel or with another peer? Does it check the block height with the channel and therefore know it's out of date? If a peer tries to resync with another peer, how does it know the other peer is up to date?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 12:44:42 GMT):<br/>
a peer knows it is out of date by having other peers tell it their ledger height.
Also, a peer can query for the latest block from the ordering service https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/protos/orderer/ab.proto#L37-L43
</p>
<p><strong>gormand</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 12:55:35 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @yacovm !!

@muralisr I pulled the latest this morning.  Now instantiate fails as follows:

I have seen this @dave.enyeart 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 15:30:05 GMT):<br/>
I had to destroy vagrant and restart
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 15:30:09 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 15:30:24 GMT):<br/>
I assumed some fundamental change
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 15:30:56 GMT):<br/>
but let me pull latest and try too (have to do that anyway) @dave.enyeart 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 15:52:14 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr After vagrant up it fails with a different error:

@dave.enyeart I'm seeing a different error `Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = 2 desc = failure opening codepackage gzip stream: EOF` 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:21:37 GMT):<br/>
( @greg.haskins something with the filter changes.... investigating )
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:26:29 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr @dave.enyeart Dave's error looks like a stale-container problem
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:27:28 GMT):<br/>
I changed the launch sequence recently from "$GOPATH/bin/$name" to "chaincode" where the chaincode binary is in /usr/local/bin
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:27:49 GMT):<br/>
the fact that its not finding "chaincode" implies the container was not rebuilt after the update
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:28:27 GMT):<br/>
a vagrant destroy/up would fix it by virtue of destroying the docker cache
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:28:38 GMT):<br/>
but there are lighterweight options im sure
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:29:05 GMT):<br/>
as far as that gzip decode error @muralisr, thats a mystery
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:29:37 GMT):<br/>
indeed... I'll look at that as I can recreate and update @greg.haskins 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:29:43 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:30:07 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr did you see that error in the context of UTs or run-time ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:30:24 GMT):<br/>
when I was doing end-2-end
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:30:44 GMT):<br/>
so basically CLI commands
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:31:08 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking some code needs to be modified in that path

im not sure how you would get into this circumstance, but its hitting this: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/platforms/golang/platform.go#L115
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:33:25 GMT):<br/>
the code is hardwired to expect cds.CodePackage is a tar.gz
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:33:35 GMT):<br/>
is it possible that it may sometimes be empty, such as LCCC?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:33:54 GMT):<br/>
thats the only legit scenario that I can think of
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:35:40 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr assuming the theory is right, I think an "if cds.CodePackage && len(cds.CodePackage) { return }" should fix it
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:36:05 GMT):<br/>
I think that's exactly right @greg.haskins 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:36:30 GMT):<br/>

on current master, what does `[gossip/comm#-1] func1 -> WARN 02c 0.0.0.0:7051, PKIid:[] isn't responsive: EOF` in the logs from the peer mean and what can be done to address it?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 11:00:47 GMT):<br/>
@murrekatt remove the 0.0.0.0:7051 from https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/peer/core.yaml#L72
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:01:55 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thanks, what is needed from the system with the current value? could i e.g. put in a peer there or how does it work?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:34:26 GMT):<br/>
you can put a peer there instead
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:34:36 GMT):<br/>
if you run a single peer, you can simply not put anything and leave it empty
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:34:42 GMT):<br/>
if you run some peers in the same organization
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:34:56 GMT):<br/>
you can just select some peer among them
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:34:59 GMT):<br/>
and put its ip:port
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:35:03 GMT):<br/>
@murrekatt 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:35:09 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:43:11 GMT):<br/>
thanks @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:44:40 GMT):<br/>
btw, the `core.yml` file is that a container build time thing or can that be provided from outside the container? @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:46:39 GMT):<br/>
so, the core.yml is also copied at the build time
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:46:42 GMT):<br/>
but it can be overrided
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:46:46 GMT):<br/>
by the docker-compose environment params
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 12:55:17 GMT):<br/>
to give a whole new yml file?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:01:26 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean?
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:04:07 GMT):<br/>
can i provide an env variable that says use this other core.yml file or you meant that i can override some of the configs one by one using env variables?
</p>

the latter
</p>

ok then i knew all options :)
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:10:31 GMT):<br/>
one more thing related to the bootstrap, in a multi-peer setup (say a test setup on one machine) if a peer doesn't have a bootstrap endpoint do the peers still connect?
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:10:50 GMT):<br/>
i'm atm looking at the example compose files in `fabric/docs`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:22:04 GMT):<br/>
so, in this case
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:22:12 GMT):<br/>
it'll take the endpoint from the anchor peer set
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:22:16 GMT):<br/>
when you create a channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:22:27 GMT):<br/>
invoke: `peer channel create -h` and you'll see, there is a `-a` flag
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:44:45 GMT):<br/>
ok, yes i saw that one. what's the bootstrap peer config vs anchor peers that you mention?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:45:59 GMT):<br/>
so, the bootstrap is at startup
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:46:05 GMT):<br/>
the anchor peer list is when you join a channel
</p>
<p><strong>lohitkrishnan</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:47:59 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:59:36 GMT):<br/>
right. and the bootstrap can be for any channels, even those the peer cannot access?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:13:00 GMT):<br/>
so
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:13:17 GMT):<br/>
the bootstrap peer is something you define in the configuration and isn't related to channels
</p>
<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:34:23 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=L93zzvGQ6BFN8CbwC) @muralisr i think so ... that's what becomes `policyMarhsalled` in peer/chaincode/common.go ?
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:51:22 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm ok, so joining a channel must be explicit and will not happen when a peer connects with another peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:51:35 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:53:26 GMT):<br/>
so bootstrap just provides a way to find other peers but that doesn't mean they exchange any info like channels
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:53:32 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:54:08 GMT):<br/>
just coming from the situation when a peer needs to join the very first time or for some reason lost track of channels it should be on
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:54:38 GMT):<br/>
as i understand you the peers must know that themselves and there is no way they find that out just by using their say certificates
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:55:40 GMT):<br/>
a peer joins a channel manually
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:55:41 GMT):<br/>
remember reading somewhere about the system channel that keeps some info about this in some special cases...need to see where i read that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:55:42 GMT):<br/>
*not* automatically
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:55:48 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:55:50 GMT):<br/>
no no noi
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:55:54 GMT):<br/>
the system channel is not in the peers
</p>
<p><strong>murrekatt</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:56:00 GMT):<br/>
yes in the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:56:03 GMT):<br/>
yeah

@tuand  - what configuration are you using for the peer?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 23 Feb 2017 16:39:33 GMT):<br/>
and ordering service?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 23 Feb 2017 16:40:19 GMT):<br/>
and actually I think instantiate might require "admin" not "member"?
</p>
<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Thu, 23 Feb 2017 16:41:04 GMT):<br/>
I tried with both DEFAULT.admin and DEFAULT.member  with same result

oh - I guess you are having problems after you've already instantiated?

ok. might be a bit slow responding,  might need to do some fixup as java sdk is finicky with latest fabric commits

Hi -- I can run inst/init/invoke/query on the testchainid chain.  Recycle orderer/peer and first create an 'foo'  chain and join the peer.  From that there's no idication that I can see anything went wrong. The proposal for joining the peer is succesful.  I then start running that scenario on this new chain. Install is ok but instiate proposal  fails.  peer dies.

@jeffgarratt  do we ( will we ) have an "official tool" for users to create the bootstrap blocks, policies and what not ?  I'm asking since the SDK is supposed to be fed these artifacts as binary files or byte arrays. Want to see if there's any conventions like standard filenames, output directories, etc..  yet
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 21:54:28 GMT):<br/>
@tuand I am in hold mode until the system has stabilized a bit.  I am hoping to clarify the usage a bit more before make determinations on tooling.
</p>

I just tested the latest, the sdk definitely still suffers the “signature invalid” problem that was reported two days ago. from inspecting the golang source where this happens, it’s actually past the validation of the cert, indicating that as far as msp config is concerned it seems fine. but it failed as the signature verification step, which never happened before, this implies a problem in the crypto layer. @adc @aso would need your help to investigate

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 25 Feb 2017 20:41:51 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix the right  MSPID and matching crypto needs to be used
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 25 Feb 2017 20:43:17 GMT):<br/>
so we could generated config tx with DEFAULT using msp/sampleconfig (generated from fabric-ca so should match the crypto being used in SDK)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 25 Feb 2017 20:43:19 GMT):<br/>
what's the value for the "testchainid"?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 25 Feb 2017 20:43:27 GMT):<br/>
ah yes
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 25 Feb 2017 20:43:54 GMT):<br/>
so there are two options there... best to create a chain ("foo") and join it
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 25 Feb 2017 20:46:36 GMT):<br/>
need to play with the testchainid option a bit (have been focusing on using "real" channels for a while)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 25 Feb 2017 20:48:30 GMT):<br/>
i wonder how that got past cert validation before the signature verify, if the msp wasn't set up right...
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 25 Feb 2017 20:52:03 GMT):<br/>
good question.. let me check something (I assume you were using default testchainid ?)

i think the "invalid signature" problem mystery was caused by the fact that peer node uses SHA3 (instead of SHA2) 256 hashing, which was recently changed. changing the signing to use SHA3 256 got me past that error

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 07:34:48 GMT):<br/>
the next error was comparing the tx ID where the peer reconstructed the id based on creator and nonce. it failed because the peer uses SHA2 256 for this particular step
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 07:35:18 GMT):<br/>
I've got node SDK to change the hashing algo according, and that got me a little further
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 07:35:49 GMT):<br/>
and now encountering this:
```error: [Peer.js]: GRPC client got an error response from the peer. Error: Illegal file detected in payload: "."```
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 07:44:12 GMT):<br/>
that's the first entry in the tarball for the install proposal. seems harmless to me, why should that be considered "illegal"? @greg.haskins ?

http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/6543 for the signature (and txId generation) issue related to using SHA2/3 256 at various points
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 12:37:23 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix "Illegal" was probably too strong of a word.  "Invalid" would have been a better choice.  Bottom line, the only valid content is text files that end with (go|c|h).  Anything else (like the directory ".") has no business in that payload and is just slop on behalf of the payload creator
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 12:38:37 GMT):<br/>
Considering that the payload has implications in multiple dimensions (security, network strain, etc) we really want to discourage slop
</p>

@jimthematrix Regarding dlv, try "dlv exec" against the binary built by "make peer" instead

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=nu52dehrrc6cRs9B3) @greg.haskins i briefly searched for a tarball packer that doesn't include the "." but haven't found one. i think that's how most tarball packers work though (including the "." entry). can we be more practical on this one? what harm can the "." entry do?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 18:48:16 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix Every byte is a liability so unless there is no other way we should strive to be as efficient as possible.  I don't think we have crossed the "there is no other way" threshold yet.  I am not aware of any fundamental tendency of tar encoders to include the dir/symlink.  I already have patches underway for the SDK to clean up how we generate the golang package.  Let's see if it can be solved first before punting.

yes I'm working on this, got past the illegal file entries error by forcing the "entries" to be src/chaincodePath on the tarball packer. now need to set the files to have -rw-rw-rw- mode

dealing with a weird UT failure now related to fs.copy() that I do not understand
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 22:03:11 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins to make sure I understand...the suggestion in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2493 is at the collection time (say in the SDK) and not in the peer at executing the install correct ?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 22:03:15 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 22:03:42 GMT):<br/>
not a filter on the peer
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 22:03:50 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr correct, it would be done by the entity assembling the codepackage, namely the SDK or CLI
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 22:04:05 GMT):<br/>
makes sense, @greg.haskins ...thanks
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 22:04:36 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins what UT failure are you seeing?

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 22:13:57 GMT):<br/>
i am confused what it is telling me
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 26 Feb 2017 22:14:22 GMT):<br/>
it seems like either fs.mkdtemp() or fs.copy() isnt recognized, but I dont understand why that is different from the original impl
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 27 Feb 2017 01:34:22 GMT):<br/>
hi @greg.haskins those two methods are from the "fs-extra" module
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 27 Feb 2017 01:34:42 GMT):<br/>
if you swap the "fs" for "fs-extra" the error should be fixed
</p>

In the new fabric 1.0 model, where/how are Byzantine faults handled?  Specifically who or where is a faulty endorser detected?  In other words if an endorser presents a different ReadWriteSet from other endorsers, how/where is that caught?

@mastersingh24 nice ! I know WIP... but if we can eliminate one user error prone path and also generate configtx.yaml, would be a very nice to have. Just a  thought (and does not ahve to be done in this CR...)
</p>

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:03:26 GMT):<br/>
that's actually next on the agenda
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:03:46 GMT):<br/>
I think I can generate all the org stuff, etc in the configtx.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:07:08 GMT):<br/>
right! .. only thing will be user may have to go in and change the MSP path if he has too ... but then he shoudn't have to if he chaose is input directory param wisely
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:08:22 GMT):<br/>
well I'll generate the file in the same structure and point the absolute paths in the file
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:08:37 GMT):<br/>
so should be able to run the configtx tool and just point it at the file
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:08:50 GMT):<br/>
for bonus points, I want to also spit out a compose file  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:13:19 GMT):<br/>
Just to make sure I have got it correct. We will be using tool to generate configtx.yaml file which will be fed into another tool to generate genesis block, which will be input into third tool to generate/create channel. Is this correct?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:15:47 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:23:11 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin  - I think that's right.  I'll look to simplify things as best I can over time
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:26:39 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Although this much easier than manually handling configtx.yaml, sounds pretty complex ;) why not to generate config block instead of intermidiate config file?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:27:21 GMT):<br/>
yeah - that's doable as well
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:27:21 GMT):<br/>
yeah - that's doable as well - just had to read the directions  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:28:27 GMT):<br/>
I can generate the crypto material, configtx.yaml (in case someone wants to modify it), the genesis block and the blob needed for create channel
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:30:43 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 19:29:15 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix I checked the code and you are right.  Block events get sent from normal committer path.  joinChain() is a separate path that doesn't go through the normal committer path, and therefore no block event.  @muralisr @binhn Should joinChain() be calling producer.SendProducerBlockEvent(block)?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 19:31:53 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart the event is / should be emitted on the round-trip when the genesis block delivered to the peer who joined the channel
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 19:37:03 GMT):<br/>
@binhn the block event is currently not emitted for genesis blocks, since it goes through joinChain() rather than normal committer flow.  I can add it to joinChain().  Agreed?
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 19:39:34 GMT):<br/>
no, it should be on the commit side like any other block;  when a peer joins a channel, it eventually receives the GB and we should emit block event when we process that GB
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 19:39:53 GMT):<br/>
if that path is not there, we should defect it
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 19:49:20 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  - I recall that's there a check in place for the type of block/transaction during commit?  so perhaps config blocks don't make it to where we actually emit the events after commit?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 20:02:00 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 config blocks do emit events in general.  genesis block is a special case though.  tracking it down with binh and artem now.
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 20:03:05 GMT):<br/>
GB, block commit directly into the ledger during the channel creation
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 20:03:21 GMT):<br/>
otherwise there is a chicken and the egg problem
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 20:03:39 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 20:15:25 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix @C0rWin @binhn Ok, Binh says that Artem will add the gb event emission in joinChain() as a temporary workaround.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 20:17:59 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin Just make sure the event emission is at the very end of joinChain(), so that all the infrastructure is ready before the event goes out
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 20:18:49 GMT):<br/>
In fact, if this is not a new chain, SDK would prefer that all known blocks are delivered before the event goes back

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 22:24:58 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin @jimthematrix I was thinking the event should be sent out at the end of joinChain(), to ensure the createChain() and InitChain() initialization steps completed before the event goes back to SDK.  Otherwise SDK may try to use it before its initialized.

@mffrench working to get behave tests passing with latest updates.  Can watch https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1141 for updates

@jeffgarratt : thank you for this input. I'm currently on my way to learn fabric in deep and I think these bddtests - and related problems - are perfect for my learning curve. 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:16:37 GMT):<br/>
good deal
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:16:46 GMT):<br/>
should be an update today
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 15:20:40 GMT):<br/>
about the orderer problem it seems to come from a standard conf parameter missing : IngressPolicyNames (I did update the error message -> https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/compare/master...mffrench:behave_py2)

seems to me bddtests generated protobuf py files are not sync with last fabric proto definitions  ... it would be great to manage such protobuf python files generation on the makefile (the protos target on the makefile works for go only as far as I understand)

@mffrench this is not currently done so we can understand the changes prior to modification of py code.  In general the developer should have re-generated the proto files prior to checkin of go code.  We are out of sync at the moment.

<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 17:50:21 GMT):<br/>
because the compiled peer binary is not in the path 
(
executed command is :

```
['peer', 'chaincode', 'package', '-n', u'example02', '-c', '{"Args": ["init", "a", "100", "b", "200"]}', '-p', u'github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02', '-v', u'test', 'tmp/a19eecde04e811e7a1993c18a00389c0/deploymentspec-golang-github-com-hyperledger-fabric-examples-chaincode-go-chaincode-example02-example02']
```
)
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 17:53:37 GMT):<br/>
then when I add build/bin to my path I get following error :

```
      Error Message:

<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 17:55:19 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 16:55:17 GMT):<br/>
@mffrench subsequent runs should be faster if you use the cache for deployment spec flag
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 16:55:42 GMT):<br/>
also, you can turn off the doNotDecompose flag if you wish to keep your system around (which I always do, as I use for dev)

@DannyWong : 16GB. Many of them where not running any more (there were the results of previous failing bddtests) but yeah this could be considered as a resource leak in some way and should be monitored...
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 17:09:02 GMT):<br/>
the latest feature file has the doNotDecompose tag commented out

Question: Hi, we used to use v0.6 and intend to migrate to use v1.0. We are new to touch v1.0. Membership service seems to be gone and replaced by COPS? or endorser? (Sorry, would you kindly explain a bit what is endorser or if it is related to membership ?) Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:17:45 GMT):<br/>
@AlanLee the equivalent of "membership service" in 0.6 is "fabric-ca" in 1.0. In 0.6, the peer used to interact with membership service directly while in 1.0 peer does not directly interact with the fabric-ca. Membership information is specified to the peers for each channel it participates with. That information is used for validating requests coming in on a channel (say from SDK based apps). So it is the application (using the SDK) that would interact directly with fabric-ca to get the credentials to send to the peer for executing those requests. The peer executes the request using a chaincode and if succeful endorses it with its signature. Hence, in that role, the peer is called an endorser.

<p><strong>AlanLee</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:23:38 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @muralisr . Great thanks for your explanation. Do we have installation steps (on Documentation) on how we can use it (or migrate / try)?  Previously, we have troubles connecting the peer(the endorser) to the "COPS" before (we haven't tried out fabric-ca yet). Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:25:16 GMT):<br/>
@AlanLee i would check in fabric-ca and fabric-sdk-node. I think the READMEs in both projects are good place to start
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:25:53 GMT):<br/>
let me know if you need links to both
</p>
<p><strong>AlanLee</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:25:53 GMT):<br/>
By the way, we need to convert the previous chain-code to use fabric-sdk-node now?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:26:25 GMT):<br/>
there have been some changes to the API but for most part should be painless
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:27:20 GMT):<br/>
for example, `Invoke(...) ([]byte, error)` is now `Invoke(...) Response`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:27:30 GMT):<br/>
changes of that magnitude
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:29:02 GMT):<br/>
the biggest changes to chaincode are in ACL ... this is still a work in progress. If you are using ACL in chaincode, refer questions in fabric-crypto please

@jimthematrix ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 18:48:37 GMT):<br/>
I verified that no issue connecting between python nodes using RSA key based certs
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:21:59 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix  - currently I've been trying to get the e2e_cli scenario working 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:22:12 GMT):<br/>
but I was also able to connect via openssl as well
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:22:56 GMT):<br/>
I think I have the last "fix" in place to get through instantiate
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:25:56 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 ok i'll try updating openssl as you suggested and give it a try again
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:29:31 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt wow that's interesting, the errors i've been seeing (connecting from sdk or openssl s_client) ranged from "wrong version number" or "unknown protocol" or "tlsv1 alert protocol version", were you seeing any of these?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:32:10 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix @mastersingh24 should we upgrade openssl in our environments?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:32:16 GMT):<br/>
if so, to what version?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:33:20 GMT):<br/>
it's really only a problem running native on OSX - which uses patched version of openssl 0.9.8
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:33:39 GMT):<br/>
all of the Linux-based env look to have openssl 1.0.2 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:34:00 GMT):<br/>
here's my WIP on updating the e2e_cli to work

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:35:24 GMT):<br/>
not sure if chaincode deployment will work yet or not but you shoud be able to get all the way through create channel, join channel and install chaincode.  Oh - and no TLS for the orderer yet - working on that
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:35:31 GMT):<br/>
need to step out for a bit tho
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 20:06:26 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 I am trying something similar to the fix in platforms.go. It currently assumes self-signed certs I think (at least current UT works with "peer.tls.cert.file") so using "peer.tls.root.file" could break that... experimenting with it.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 20:23:13 GMT):<br/>
on the plus side, I was able to instantiate chaincode on a single peer  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 20:23:21 GMT):<br/>
I think I'm failing on the orderer now
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 20:23:27 GMT):<br/>
will get on that in a bit
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:12:43 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr  - I think I have a fix to make sure the test passes (just set the tls.rootcert to the same value as the tls.cert).  I'm thinking that we should probably use rootcert if it exists and fallback to tls.cert if not
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:13:22 GMT):<br/>
right. That's what I was trying too 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:13:35 GMT):<br/>
but I didn't have luck with that
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:13:41 GMT):<br/>
so will take what you got :-)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:13:49 GMT):<br/>
do you want me to try your patch ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:14:02 GMT):<br/>
oh
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:14:13 GMT):<br/>
`just set the tls.rootcert to the same value as the tls.cert`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:14:17 GMT):<br/>
I didn't do that part
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:14:26 GMT):<br/>
let me try that 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:14:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm running the chaincode tests right now to see if they'll pass
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:14:54 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:15:16 GMT):<br/>
next step is on to the orderer  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:15:18 GMT):<br/>
This all or nothing TLS is crazy, we should've used different listeners and ports :( 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:15:29 GMT):<br/>
that was the fallback
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:15:31 GMT):<br/>
;)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:20:31 GMT):<br/>
shouldn't be too difficult to separate out peer from orderer for TLS so we have 4 combinations (beginning to sound like a broken record, I know :-) )
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:36:35 GMT):<br/>
the good news is that I elminated the need for serverhostoverride for for the CLI container and for chaincode in the e2e_cli setup
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:36:49 GMT):<br/>
(I'm tricky like that  ;) )
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:42:32 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr 
```
func getPeerTLSCert() ([]byte, error) {

	if viper.GetBool("peer.tls.enabled") == false {
		// no need for certificates if TLS is not enabled
		return nil, nil
	}
	var path string
	// first we check for the rootcert
	path = viper.GetString("peer.tls.rootcert.file")
	if path == "" {
		// check for tls cert
		path = viper.GetString("peer.tls.cert.file")
	}
	// this should not happen if the peer is running with TLS enabled
	if _, err := os.Stat(path); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	// FIXME: FAB-2037 - ensure we sanely resolve relative paths specified in the yaml
	return ioutil.ReadFile(path)
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:43:54 GMT):<br/>
that'd make the UT pass for sure
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:44:02 GMT):<br/>
(BTW - the previous code in there would actually fail if there was nothing in the peer.tls.cert.file setting
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:44:14 GMT):<br/>
it works with e2e too ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:44:24 GMT):<br/>
the logic was kinda backwards
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:44:31 GMT):<br/>
I got chaincode to deploy in e2e
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:44:36 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:44:45 GMT):<br/>
on 1 peer
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:44:48 GMT):<br/>
I could have sworn I tried the above
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:45:49 GMT):<br/>
could have easily done something wrong though... I was trying different things
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:46:18 GMT):<br/>
`CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=e2ecli_default`  is the other trick to eliminate the need for serverhost override
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:46:47 GMT):<br/>
this deploys chaincode on the same bridge network as the peers so hostname (e.g. peer0) works
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:48:18 GMT):<br/>
`CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0:7051`  - which as you know is what chaincode will use if set  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:49:00 GMT):<br/>
what is `e2ecli_default` ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:51:21 GMT):<br/>
ah
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:51:26 GMT):<br/>
well - good question
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:51:59 GMT):<br/>
so with docker-compose, it will create a bridge network - and it names it `{folder}_default`
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:52:16 GMT):<br/>
hence `e2ecli_default`
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:52:32 GMT):<br/>
so basically I tell the chaincode containers to join the e2ecli_default network
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:52:55 GMT):<br/>
and all works like a charm since containers can use hostnames when on the same network
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:54:45 GMT):<br/>
with the above change, chaincode tests are passing  :clap:

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:59:26 GMT):<br/>
so @mastersingh24 let me summarize and you can correct me (I'm betting on that :-) )
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 21:59:36 GMT):<br/>
(for my own understanding...)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:00:18 GMT):<br/>
1) the fix to getPeerTLSCert fixes UT (we basically keep using `path = viper.GetString("peer.tls.cert.file")` in UT)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:02:22 GMT):<br/>
2) the fix to use `path = viper.GetString("peer.tls.rootcert.file")` in getPeerTLSCert together with `CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=e2ecli_default` fixes CLI -> peer (and CLI -> Orderer too ?)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:02:47 GMT):<br/>
it does not fix the orderer (yet)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:02:58 GMT):<br/>
ah
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:03:00 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:03:20 GMT):<br/>
but it puts us on a path to avoid the serverhostoverride stuff which can create problems
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:03:27 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:03:31 GMT):<br/>
understood
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:05:01 GMT):<br/>
the key thing was figuring out how to get the chaincode to communicate with the peer using the hostname(s) (peerX) which are in the certificates.  I also needed to change to the rootcert since this were not self-signed certs
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:06:58 GMT):<br/>
right ...I had to continue to fight using serverhostoverride.. this should help get to the next step for sure
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:07:23 GMT):<br/>
I was able to talk TLS with orderer and peer with a simpler setup
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:07:35 GMT):<br/>
let me see if I can use your trick to get to next level
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:07:51 GMT):<br/>
will pull the CR and try
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:47:13 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7141/  - just posted an update
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:47:36 GMT):<br/>
with this, you can get all the way to instantiating chaincode on a single peer
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:48:00 GMT):<br/>
NOTE:  I don't execute the script in the CLI container right now
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 22:48:41 GMT):<br/>
so after you run `docker-compose up -d`  you can run `docker exec -it cli /bin/bash` and then run `./scripts/script/sh`

I updated the JIRA as well, but I now have the orderer configured for TLS and am able to create channels and also issue commands from the CLI.  I believe the last issue is to properly connect the peer delivery client to the TLS-enabled orderer
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 14:10:42 GMT):<br/>
I think with all the changes in the delivery part shouldn't be close no ? Like you said -  just hook up the root cas from MSP to the client connection ?
</p>

one suggestion @mastersingh24 (and I can tell how much work has gone into this so don't shoot me :-) )
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:48:53 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:49:12 GMT):<br/>
instead of -cafile, can we add a section to to core.yaml ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:49:18 GMT):<br/>
orderer: ca
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:49:33 GMT):<br/>
(upto you ...)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:50:14 GMT):<br/>
I thought about that, but since we just removed any orderer config from core.yaml, I figured using flags was the way to go
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:50:46 GMT):<br/>
we did but that was for "starting orderer"
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:50:54 GMT):<br/>
but this is more about connecting with it
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:51:02 GMT):<br/>
also even for communicating with it
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:51:13 GMT):<br/>
you need to pass in -o now?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:51:16 GMT):<br/>
and it'll make the docker config uniform with ENV usages
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:51:26 GMT):<br/>
Oh
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:51:32 GMT):<br/>
WELL
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:51:45 GMT):<br/>
we don't need those certs except for the CLI
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:51:54 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:51:58 GMT):<br/>
that's true
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:52:18 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 12 Mar 2017 18:52:22 GMT):<br/>
I figured it was more obvious that we need them to put them in as flags

Is there a timeout on a chaincode instantiate INIT call ? We have chaincode that can take 2 minutes for the INIT to run and it fails with some strange errors
```
Error: [80914958]No ledger context for GetState. Sending ERROR
```
If that is the case is this timeout applicable to Invoke as well ?

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 18:01:06 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel theres a timeout of 30 secs. I think you are running into the situation where the requester cleaned up the context and returned error back. When the chaincode requested GetState, the context was no longer there (and you get the above error). We need to remove the hardcoded timeout and return...would you mind open a JIRA item for that please ?

@muralisr thanks for the quick response. I can open a jira for that.

@davidkel do you need this at highest priority ?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 19:04:03 GMT):<br/>
 @muralisr It does stop our system tests from passing unfortunately and don't know of any other way round it
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 19:05:34 GMT):<br/>
Without this it really does stop any meaningful Fabric Composer business network from being deployed onto V1
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 19:24:09 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel ok.. if you want to quickly unblock you can change this  line `timeout := time.Duration(30000) * time.Millisecond` in core/chaincode/exectransaction.go and rebuild. Not ideal but may unblock while waiting for the fix
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 19:25:33 GMT):<br/>
the reason for the hardcoding was the hope to not make it a system wide param but a chaincode specific one which would need more work
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 19:25:54 GMT):<br/>
but clearly we could as well have made the 30000 a param
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 13 Mar 2017 21:25:17 GMT):<br/>
@binhn @muralisr @mastersingh24 @jimthematrix have worked through most of the issues wrt TLS certs and the behave system.  Down to trusted roots for the chaincode to allow connect back to associated peer
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 00:45:44 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt on the node sdk front we have a breakthrough, @mastersingh24 got me to realize that why node sdk client was terminating the session after successful handshake ( got both @bmos299 and @ashutosh_kumar to scratch their heads when they saw this behavior in wiresharks trace), was because it saw the server cert and didn't like it due to hostname mismatch (CN=orderer0 but I was setting hostnameoverride to `localhost`), should've looked more closely at the server certs

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 00:54:51 GMT):<br/>
I still had an issue even with proper hostnames and overrides
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 01:25:45 GMT):<br/>
that did not click my mind @jimthematrix . So stupid , I was like always.:cry:

</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 01:27:21 GMT):<br/>
so on nodejs, even with hostnameoverride, it still reject of the cert contain different host,  right?
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 02:06:34 GMT):<br/>
@binhn , I think hostnameoverride is TLS client setting. @jimthematrix must have changed the code to do hostnameverifition on Node js to match server cert.

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 14 Mar 2017 02:34:41 GMT):<br/>
@binhn @ashutosh_kumar (this is only relevant in testing environments) the sdk needs to set the hostnameoverride in grpc call options to match the server cert on a per-endpoint basis, the API design already accommodates this (Remote.js class), and it'll be able to connect to all the different orderer/peer nodes

@jimthematrix @ashutosh_kumar @binhn we implemented sni in bluemix with wildcards and had great success.  I am sure at some point this will be a requirement for us...not sure when..but at somepoint.  It can make like life pretty easy as the server is told what cert to send in the handshake.

is the `- CORE_NEXT=true` env variable still in effect? i didn't have that in docker-compose but maybe that's needed to get the builder to use the right level of golang?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:31:55 GMT):<br/>
@divyank  - yes - this is terrible.  I believe that there is a CR out there which should help with this.  In the meantime, there are 2 options:

1) run the CLI from within a Docker container
2) create a special GOPATH for your chaincode project

@tuand that typically means that the instantiate's commit did not go through

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 18 Mar 2017 16:28:58 GMT):<br/>
@tuand are you listening to the events from the instantiate transaction? that'll allow you to know with certainty when its committed
</p>
<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Sat, 18 Mar 2017 18:06:33 GMT):<br/>
i ( well, the code ) has received the event for the instantiate ...  I'm getting the error on the subsequent invoke proposal  randomly on some subset of the peers I send the proposal to  
</p>
<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Sat, 18 Mar 2017 18:07:17 GMT):<br/>
which makes me suspect that the cc container hasn't completely come up  yet on some peer

<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Sat, 18 Mar 2017 21:40:00 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Sat, 18 Mar 2017 21:41:33 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Sat, 18 Mar 2017 21:41:58 GMT):<br/>
hi @latitiah  ... I think it's because one of the (not anchor) peers did not get the block delivered   ... reading through logs now  ... more details later

Yes, the cc container never starts on the other peer... I'm getting some strange error in the log (itzmine is both the channel and chaincodeID):

@tuand what's the value of CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_LEADER_ELECTION in both peers, and what's the value of CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER in peer2?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Mar 2017 23:27:20 GMT):<br/>
also what's org2? You're not using the example/e2e_cli ? orgs start from 0 there
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 18 Mar 2017 23:28:31 GMT):<br/>
another thing- if  the peers are in debug, and you say there is hardly any gossip messages in the orgs- it smells to me like the anchor peer of the org isn't set correctly in the configtx.yaml 
</p>
<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Sun, 19 Mar 2017 00:00:47 GMT):<br/>
hi @yacovm  ... peer2Org2 CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=true ... CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USERLEADERELECTION(?)  is from core.yaml
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=ntpqrikMQ4ggMTvrm) @yacovm I take that back, I'm actually using a copy of the sdk-node e2e-2Orgs setup  , had assumed it was the same as e2e-cli
</p>
<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Sun, 19 Mar 2017 00:10:31 GMT):<br/>
back in a bit, familial duties call
</p>
<p><strong>tuand</strong> (Sun, 19 Mar 2017 02:16:58 GMT):<br/>
You are correct @yacovm , the problem was in `configtx.yaml` . I'm running all peers/orderer/fabric-ca in vagrant and sdk-java locally.  The port for the Org2 anchor peer was set to the mapped vagrant port instead of the normal peer `7051` port.  Gossip msgs are flowing and all peers are updating their ledgers now.   happy, happy

"Endorser related Issue"

While referring video "V1 Chaincode install and instentiate" from "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itn2Ps8sarE", all worked fine but we are facing one issue during the following "query" command:

CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0:7051 peer chaincode query -C myc -n mycc -v v0 -c '{"Args":["query ","a"]}' -o orderer:5005

Error: "Error endorsing query: rpc error: code = 2 desc = failed to obtain cds for mycc - transaction not found mycc/myc"

Any clue please?

Thanks.

@SyneBlockChainTeam since that video there have been a  few changes. The error basically says trasanctions aren't getting committed. Try adding "-o orderer:7050" to the instantiate and invoke commands please

@muralisr , we tried adding orderer to instantiate command but we are getting --- Error: Error getting broadcast client: Error connecting to orderer:7051 due to grpc: timed out when dialing

@muralisr , We are using  docker-compose channel.yml file from docs/source folder. Here orderer is configured on 5005 so hence we used  CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0:7051 peer chaincode query -C myc -n mycc -v v0 -c '{"Args":["query ","a"]}' -o orderer:5005 for instantiate and invoke as well. We dont get any error during install and instantiate commands.

@SyneBlockChainTeam in step T4 after the the instantiate, I'd wait for a bit for the commit to take place on peer0. you should see a "Commit" log on peer0 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 22 Mar 2017 14:10:44 GMT):<br/>
I'm assuming you are using docker-2peer.yml ? id make sure CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=true is set
</p>
<p><strong>SyneBlockChainTeam</strong> (Thu, 23 Mar 2017 06:27:11 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr  - still we are getting same error - "Error endorsing query: rpc error: code = 2 desc = failed to obtain cds for mycc - transaction not found mycc/myc"
</p>
<p><strong>SyneBlockChainTeam</strong> (Thu, 23 Mar 2017 06:27:11 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr  - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=true is already there in docker-compose-channel.yml. We tried using docker-2peer.yml as well.
Still we are getting same error - "Error endorsing query: rpc error: code = 2 desc = failed to obtain cds for mycc - transaction not found mycc/myc"

hi  guys
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 01:59:16 GMT):<br/>
 i thought could we enhance peer channel join command
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:00:09 GMT):<br/>
such as peer channel join $channel_name
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:01:06 GMT):<br/>
first it check if channel exist, if exist just join, if not create channel first
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:01:52 GMT):<br/>
that will remove channel.tx, channel_name.block files
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:11:58 GMT):<br/>
hi murali
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:13:05 GMT):<br/>
@grapebaba one might argue in the spirit of being "minimal" interface, a few simple separate commands may be ok ....
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:13:49 GMT):<br/>
better to use SDKs when we can
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:16:41 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:33:25 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr if i create a blockchain admin tool, i am not sure responsibility of channel management own by admin tool or by user app
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:34:31 GMT):<br/>
you said better to use SDKs ,  I assume it is more like the responsibility of user app
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:35:58 GMT):<br/>
however my previous thoughts was that a admin user just write a yaml include peers, orgs, orders, channels, and execute one command
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:36:19 GMT):<br/>
we can create well-defined blockchain network for him
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:37:33 GMT):<br/>
if using SDK, admin tools seems must provide a UI interface to operate 
</p>
<p><strong>grapebaba</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 02:38:19 GMT):<br/>
however i want a command interface as well

you'd have to create the peer images to refresh that change ... `make clean;make peer;make peer-docker;make orderer-docker`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 24 Mar 2017 19:48:13 GMT):<br/>
the peer was attempting to create a connection to orderer at `127.0.0.1:7050`

@Amjadnz  - what exactly are you running?  you might just want to pull down the 1.0.0-alpha images from Dockerhub and run with those in your compose file
</p>
<p><strong>SyneBlockChainTeam</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 05:58:56 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr - We followed same steps mentioned by you but getting same error for query - "Error: Error endorsing query: rpc error: code = 2 desc = failed to obtain cds for mycc - transaction not found mycc/myc"

Thanks and I have another question for you on fabric channel. If you are spare some time there - I would appreciate that. This is regarding CouchDB and Fabric (for state database). Parameters set in docker.yaml file are not getting set in PEER\core.yaml file - I guess so I always get the "connection refused - no route to host issue". 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:14:48 GMT):<br/>
@SyneBlockChainTeam I did  get it working after I made the changes outlined above... it is important to make sure the the images are bulit afresh after the address change `orderer:5005`
</p>
<p><strong>SyneBlockChainTeam</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 14:07:57 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 16:05:29 GMT):<br/>
and added the extra change to configtx.yaml along with the cleanup
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 16:06:19 GMT):<br/>
one thing after the instantiate you should wait for a "Commit" message to show up in the peer logs before you try the query
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 16:06:37 GMT):<br/>
if no "Commit" message shows up then we have a problem
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 16:45:16 GMT):<br/>

@Amjadnz Docker compose yaml properties will not update core.yaml directly.  Rather it overrides core.yaml properties at runtime.  For a docker compose yaml that is known to work with couchdb, see: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/docker-compose.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 17:30:19 GMT):<br/>
You would need to uncomment that couchdb properties as described in the instructions for Using CouchDB: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/end-to-end.rst

@garisingh I read your answer at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43017514/roles-readwrite-in-hyperledger/43030473#43030473:
>Additionally, if you don't have access to write to a channel, you cannot send endorsement proposals to peers for chaincode which is deployed on channel you don't have write permission for.
Seems that read permission should allow you to call chaincode read-only functions (e.g. queries). I guess this would be a good reason to re-introduce Query at chaincode level in the future (@muralisr)?  Then if you have read-only permissions you could call chaincode Query functions but not Invoke. Or would you rather expose the query functions outside of chaincode in the future?  (i missed this channel permissions aspect last time we discussed).  Will the ACL enhancements under discussion allow us lockdown such queries outside of chaincode in the future?

<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Mon, 27 Mar 2017 19:42:25 GMT):<br/>
I asked this in #fabric-questions but it's also a relevant question for here. How is it determined how a transaction (as submitted by the client through their SDK) falls under the specific endorsement policy that governs it?
Does the client/SDK decide which endorsement policy is relevant? Does a specific endorser (or group of endorsers) decide? Is there a smart contract that determines it? 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 13:38:50 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart (sorry for the late reply...a bit sick and not able to think clearly is my excuse :-) ) ... we could reintroduce the notion of "query" where change to the chaincode state won't be allowed and that way we can just require a weak "read" permission on the caller. However, for now - IIUC - the "read" capability refers to queries that don't involve chaincode such as those provided by the "block" query functions in QSCC
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 28 Mar 2017 13:46:43 GMT):<br/>
ok, so eventually I think we'll either want to expose state db queries to QSCC, or re-introduce Query on chaincode for these queries (and have an associated role for Query vs Invoke).  We were going down the path of the former before people raised concerns and we therefore pulled that out of v1. Can somebody explain the vision for ACL?  Would ACL be applied to things like QSCC queries? That will likely help us make a decision (most likely post v1).  @muralisr @mastersingh24 
</p>
<p><strong>mgk</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:26:46 GMT):<br/>
Hi @dave.enyeart can you explain what was pulled out of V1? Are you saying that Direct DB Application Queries (via the SDK) have been removed or is it something else?
</p>
<p><strong>SyneBlockChainTeam</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 10:21:36 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr  - Its working now....thank you for your help. You owe a treat from us...:-)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 11:15:21 GMT):<br/>
@mgk Currently you have to do queries such as GetStateByRange and GetQueryResult from within chaincode. There was discussion of exposing these types of queries directly to SDK via Query System Chaincode (QSCC).  However there was some concern over access control, which future ACL enhancements may resolve.

Found that the missing image was the fabric-ccenv for the latest snapshot (not yet on docker hub).  Required additional logging to dump variables to be able to determine which image was unavailable.  So may help others if the logs (and documentation) could be more specific.

Hi. Where could someone go to find an overview of Events, for a user to learn what and how they work in hyperledger-fabric, with examples? If someone wanted to hook up a monitor process/tool to register for all events to count and summarize them by category, could they do it? What is the interface? etc...
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 06 Apr 2017 23:38:43 GMT):<br/>
@scottz one place would be examples/event/block-listener (it has a read me as well).. for using events from SDK please check in fabric-sdk-node
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 07 Apr 2017 00:24:46 GMT):<br/>
thanks, but that directory has an example from v0.6, using pbft, discover-root-node, etc. When's the last time you used it? An operations user could really use a better readme and example to desribe more about events- Any objections if I create a jira for improving that readme and maybe adding a section in the new v1.0 documentation pages?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 07 Apr 2017 02:28:38 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Fri, 07 Apr 2017 13:24:12 GMT):<br/>
@steigensonne  There is no theoretical limit that I am aware of, but of course there will be practical limits based on your hardware and configuration. The size and complexity of your business logic in your chaincode and policies, database and world state, and participants in the channel, will all impact the TPS numbers.

@binhn @muralisr question on events. so I'm working on adding signature check to event registration (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1738), as discussed with @adc and @aso on Monday, since at the moment the registration is channel-agnostic, will need to use local MSP to validate Creator and verify signature on the Peer side.

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 08 Apr 2017 19:37:26 GMT):<br/>
but my question is this: if we are doing the above then it means an app can only register with peers in their own org. this can be a problem. because it was nice before to be able to monitor events on all the participating peers in the channel to be ensured that the transaction has been successfully committed in all peers, such that the app can now safely send the next transaction that requires a previous transaction to have been committed
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 08 Apr 2017 19:37:46 GMT):<br/>
if we are doing local MSP based checks during registration, the above won't be possible any longer.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 08 Apr 2017 19:38:39 GMT):<br/>
as a result, an application can not be sure if it's OK to send a transaction that depends on the previous transaction to have been committed in all endorsing peers
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 08 Apr 2017 19:38:48 GMT):<br/>
any thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 08 Apr 2017 19:41:30 GMT):<br/>
one idea is to require channel ID on the registration, so the peer can use channel MSPs to validate Creator, that'll allow the app to monitor on all peers on a per channel basis. but it'll be more work to support per-channel eventing. it can be done but just more than what we originally discussed for v1.0 scope
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Sat, 08 Apr 2017 20:15:36 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix I would reason this way:  Since a peer knows the channels that it has joined, the verification of event registration signature  on the peer side should be against all channel MSPs. A bit more work than local MSP, but it would help resolve the problem @adc @aso thoughts? 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sat, 08 Apr 2017 20:16:57 GMT):<br/>
hmm interesting, logically the idea is sound
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 08 Apr 2017 21:29:36 GMT):<br/>
@binhn @jimthematrix - shouldn't assume that an app can only register with peers in their own org.
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Sun, 09 Apr 2017 02:48:22 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda right, so if an app registers with an ID belong some other MSP than the peer local MSP, the peer would have to look for the channels that the ID belongs to and only delivers events from those channels. I think that's safe.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 09 Apr 2017 13:29:17 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda definitely agree, that's why I brought this up here for discussion. @binhn @adc @aso unless there are objections I'll start modifying my CR to work in that direction
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 09 Apr 2017 13:30:32 GMT):<br/>
Once channel reconfigurations are implemented, though- an org could be evicted from the channel, and if no checks will be made in the event-hub server - a security hole will be created.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 09 Apr 2017 14:02:50 GMT):<br/>
So - if Artem is doing it, then IMO it would be needed to extend the signature of the event helper https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/events/producer/eventhelper.go#L35 
with a boolean that says whether this block is a config block or not.
If it is- then all active subscriptions to the event hub would be needed to be re-validated because an org might be evicted from the channel.

@binhn @adc @aso not sure if you guys have seen the discussions b/w @yacovm and myself in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7905/ (still WIP), but Yacov pointed out a security hole in the current approach which I agree: using all channels to check for identity-based permission does not work well when the registration request is made to a peer in a different org
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 02:53:47 GMT):<br/>
we can be certain that an app has rights to all channels when it attempts to listen on a peer in its own org. But a peer in a different org may have channels that the requesting app is not part of. yet as long as the requesting app is part of one of the channels, the registration is allowed and as a result blocks from all channels will be sent to the app.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 02:55:04 GMT):<br/>
hence the security hole, which Yacov pointed out
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 02:58:06 GMT):<br/>
I had thought that channel-specific eventing can be done separately from the registration security. but looks like that's not possible due to the above
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 02:58:31 GMT):<br/>
I'll start adding that to 7905
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 19:15:44 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix : that's good to know. reading your comments on gerrit, my understanding is, until channel-specific events impl (post-v1.0), we have to take care on peer functional split across orgs (ie: be sure a peer is installed through orgs for exactly the same channels and final apps) to avoid this kind of sec hole. can you confirm ?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 23:29:20 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix  - I thought that we were going to go with an approach that the eventhub was locked down to the "localMSP" of the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 00:38:46 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 - can't assume that clients are in the same org as the peer.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 03:51:20 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 see my comments from last Saturday about this: https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=NHdnCLPGq5drQWQBn
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 03:55:34 GMT):<br/>
if that's what we are going with the code is pretty easy (patch 1), but it'll make it difficult for apps to coordinate among endorsers to submit transactions that act on output of previous transaction(s)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:10:40 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic yes what you said is logically correct but difficult to implement because the peers would have to send transactions in events as opposed to blocks. not that it's impossible but just non-trivial work to support another kind of event payload at this point
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:22:13 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix my 2c... all other apis at a peer level, ie across channels (such as via the query scc) allow access on certain conditions 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:22:49 GMT):<br/>
will be good to make sure there isn't another path (via events) that violates that

Ledger- The Jira board updated for ledger, we have good idea of what defects we think need to be addressed
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:39:13 GMT):<br/>
I also cleaned up fabric-peer and endorser to help Murali- i cleaned up 40% of those that were outdated and invalid and I assigned to some other components. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:39:50 GMT):<br/>
For fabric-peer/fabric-endorser there is still a lot out of it- i need help to figure out what is 1.0 and 1.1, maybe @binhn could help with that given Murali not able to look at it right now. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:40:11 GMT):<br/>
in ledger- there is less than 10 defects, for endorser for 10, in fabric- peer therre were about 30, but probably should be deferred but need help from Binh
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:41:27 GMT):<br/>

We would like to really get all coding done by next Friday-- ie finishing out some of the pieces that community thought we need to complete. Ie these are final touches and code was "mostly" done already
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:42:21 GMT):<br/>
really primary focus is bugs and quality and stabilizing
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:44:54 GMT):<br/>
Murali did indicate that he has to look at the comments from chaincode packaging- but if everyone reviews that once they are addressed... it would help him. Binh commented- the base one Chris is asking for the test on that.  part 1 of the 2 parts above that uses a lot of panic, and I'm concerned and I do have a question.  Murali indicated he will explain why the panics are ok. I will put the responses there and we can decide next step.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:45:56 GMT):<br/>
Will- I want to figure out what we are thinking about error handling framework- i have 2 changesets out there- 1 functional and 1 documentation. If we want to make that into v1- we need to get that reviewed if everyone is going to use this. Binh really wants to get that in to address serviceability and code hardening that makes the fabric more useable. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:47:35 GMT):<br/>
Will asking that 2 maintainers to look at the change sets - it's on review list in maintainer list 7745 and 7845.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:48:36 GMT):<br/>
Do we have time to adjust our code for error handling? don't we need to catch where we have an error and surround it with this code from Will? yes, the intention is that each developer will look at this as part of development and bring it in - but it can NOT be a breaking change. But serviceability is really important.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:49:00 GMT):<br/>
We should start with the most important and common errors in.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:51:02 GMT):<br/>
Yacov- my 2 changes - the peer is reconnecting to ordering service- or the ordering service- it does a failover. I'm also working on gossip security hardening.

My primary focus right now is to focus on document for side db-- the gossip part of that- for overall design.  That is post 1.0, but we have to at least look at it for now to see if any implications moving forward.

</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:53:52 GMT):<br/>
1 of them was reviewed by Murali and everything was addressed in comments.

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:54:11 GMT):<br/>
This is expiration of the message- Murali said was fine, but it's not what I had in mind, but we can talk about it.

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:55:38 GMT):<br/>
we are proceeding with the change- we need to coordinate

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 13:57:02 GMT):<br/>
The orderer config, channels config, and then SDK support for channel config has to be coordinated

Security- Angelo is devoting energy to access control- Ale/Angelo looking at new tools to understand if system chaincode is invoked by external proposal or something that comes internal to peer itself. this gives us granularity the proper access control for each function. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:00:20 GMT):<br/>
Binh reviewed his changes yesterday- I know you have responded to some, but I've asked Murali to respond to 1 of the questions.  Angelo did indicate we have to wait, because there is a change that Ale has to submit.  We have to wait, and I need function that tells me if invocation from peer itself especially for sscc- I don't know how to do this otherwise.  this system chaincode does not understand who is invoking and that could be a problem. For now, do not merge.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:00:49 GMT):<br/>
Ale- Binh did review the CRs with a couple of comments.. there is a to do so it's been -2ed until addressed. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:00:52 GMT):<br/>
(Ale is out today)
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:02:16 GMT):<br/>
For access control- once that is in place- my understanding is that this enforces policies that have been specified. is that right? yes absolutely, it's that but in certain places i just figured out in certain places in code- where we should not enforce any access control if a certain code is coming from peer itself- so if peer invoking system chaincode to be able to execute certain function.. this is what the hold up is.  
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:02:42 GMT):<br/>
What is impact to other areas? since specification of the policies is in place- your work would not require any components to react- the policies that are already in place are the only ones that we need, that's correct
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:04:03 GMT):<br/>
Matthias- one thing that I found- when you deploy chaincode, what you do first is an install, install version 1, instantiate version 1, install version 2 and upgrade to version 2- but what the upgrade command does is that it checks whether the chaincode that you specify when you upgrade whether the version you supplied is the same as the one instantiated. so i instantiated to version 2 and specify version #2- it won't let me, but I can go back and do an upgrade to version 1- tracking back. that has to be fixed.   
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:06:46 GMT):<br/>
we do need to think what does it mean if you want to revert back to original cloud- we should discuss this in the channels on what to do here
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:06:56 GMT):<br/>
open a JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:08:19 GMT):<br/>
2931- chaincode instantiation- there is multiple options to validate this- we should discuss and settle on one in terms of what we want to implement.  If we don't do a policy here- we may have to do additional checks for this function.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:10:24 GMT):<br/>
the other thing is the check that the orderers on genesis block for MSP configuration- we have created JIRA item for Kostas and whether we consider important for feature or bug- the orderers when they receive channel creation- they have to do a check on MSP configuration- that the MSP id maps to the system channel for that particular MSP.  That's the orderer's organization. Is that correct? Can't anyone create channels? they might not joined by any peers if the peer disapproves the channel.. only someone in orderer in org create channels?  orderer has to decide whether they create the channel- don't we want to bind the MSP id configuration- but of course that is the case what you said- if I approve the channel, i'm not going to ask peers to join the channel-
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:11:07 GMT):<br/>
how does this impact the application? as of now- anyone can create the channel- anyone can propose a channel, but this channel is useless unless your partners have joined- so anyone can propose a channel and call the create channel- if we change that design- we need to talk to the maintainers about that
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:12:00 GMT):<br/>
Binh- somehow we really need kostas/gari on this call. the channel creation policy on the orderer system channel- Elli- are you saying we have no checks there even though we have that policy?  We don't have a check to ensure that MSP that is related to freshly created channel have the same configuration . Let's open a bug and discuss there then.  
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:12:06 GMT):<br/>
there is a policy for channel creation
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:12:29 GMT):<br/>
it's up to the founders of network to decide-yes? yes it's part of the bootstrap
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:12:48 GMT):<br/>
it's also part of the series of the configuration crs that we have been talking about that deals with consortium
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:13:43 GMT):<br/>
Kostas- there is a question- given that on the orderer there is a channel creation policy- is there a security check on that today?  Binh suggesting we should create a defect for that. (this is regardless of recent changes.. also got question from Keith in community on that) I can double check on this and I will create defect for this if it's open to all. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:13:52 GMT):<br/>
Current config tx tool does accept all for now
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:14:06 GMT):<br/>
But that is accept all given the MSP list which is zero identity for now
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:14:17 GMT):<br/>
as long as we still allow policy based- we are ok

Jeff is offering to help on this
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:15:51 GMT):<br/>
Elli- i have a question on events- i see you posted CR for event access control- Jim said this is work in progress. ever since i tried to support registration with different org- there is a lot of security issues that we should hash through. having said that- what is your concern?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:16:48 GMT):<br/>
Elli has 2 main comments- so you do some signature checks at event message using an MSP of the chain?  one could use some function Angelo has already built that can be done faster/smoother.  When peers does a channel- do you want us to help you Jim? yes, that would be ideal.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:17:08 GMT):<br/>
Jim said there is discussion on scope of work, so let's talk on chat after the call on this 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:17:13 GMT):<br/>
Jim on SDK side:
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:18:01 GMT):<br/>
Node- there are 2 pieces of work going on. Brett working on supporting channel creation policy from SDK so you don't have to rely on configx tool.  It also has benefit of full control of all the configs you can do through the api versus generating a lot of config contents as defaults.  That's coming along
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:18:45 GMT):<br/>
Jim said he's been working on the event piece and it took an interesting turn. in beginning- check with local msp- listner can only register peer from their own org, but then that exposes a pretty serious limitation and i wanted to allow cross org registration, and that may turn out more work than what we want to do with version 1.0 and I need input from the maintainers
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:19:55 GMT):<br/>
Rick- for Java- there are 2 things I want to point out.  I have a work item that is initaiated to do the read/write set- i've started to work on that.. i'm getting to the part where i'm supposed to see read/write set and I can't figure out what is going on there is fab26789 (number?).  I can't introduce this if we don't do this in the event hub. I need a decision on that.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:20:10 GMT):<br/>
someone in community is really pressing hard on that- 2679 is the number
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:20:29 GMT):<br/>
this is one that was assigned to Will- but clayton/him felt this was not a requirement and we addressed in a different way. That's why this was put on 1.1
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:20:39 GMT):<br/>
We might want to circle back to the person in the community on this.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:20:53 GMT):<br/>
they felt they needed this to be there, but if there is a workaround we need to discuss what that was suggested.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:21:19 GMT):<br/>
they want read/write set as part of the event was the original request, but at least some point in discussion, we thought they should try the return result instead- they felt this was more appropriate and not relying on read/write set.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:22:09 GMT):<br/>
because of concern on performance and network impact- Gari had at one point suggested to have 2 different kind of events. the client can register knowing what asking for- one would be event including everything and one that we currently have
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:23:40 GMT):<br/>
ok- so I'm going to mark it 1.1 then.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:25:04 GMT):<br/>
Rick just got the latest fabric server code- and I'm sending stuff to orderer and I'm not seeing any errors- but I'm not seeing events come back- this was passing, and now they are failing- something got introduced that is a breaking change. we need to investigate this...

@troyronda @jimthematrix @aleksandar.likic that all makes sense and a complex thing to tackle.  Currently we are looking at a very simple solution for 1.0 so that we can address quickly and provide a useful infrastructure for putting in the detail later on (post 1.0). The key restriction at this point is that the event listener must be in the same organization (MSP) as the peer that it is subscribing with. This allows delivering events in a secured way.

The flow of the event channel is:
a client connects, and sends a registration descriptor.
You're asking that the peer would know based on that descriptor, to publish a transaction status to the client, while the TxId isn't passed.
Currently from what I know- the event infrastructure doesn't even support channels. 
More work is needed there.

Commented on https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2679 - There should be a way to restrict what's being sent back to clients. i.e., so that they only find out that their transaction has been committed.
And the SDKs shouldn't be depending on having this amount of information.

@troyronda  - Not really.  Currently all access is basically channel-scoped  by organization (and each organization has their own MSP credentials).  We don't differentiate peer organizations from client-only organizations and organizations have read and/or write access to channels (we also don't differentiate peer identities from client identities).  While we can add the concept of "roles" (e.g. add an attribute to certificates), without having a central authority who issues these there is really no way to ensure that a peer is really a peer and a client is really a client (i.e. if an org has it's own CA it can issue peer and client certificates as it sees fit).  Even with a central issuing authority it would have to be trusted as well but at least there would be one place that is accountable  (I guess you could still hold individual CAs accountable as well but it makes it harder to enforce proper issuance).

I'll save discussion on options for locking this down more, but suffice it to say we can do things such as create separate endpoints for endorsement, gossip and possible even chaincode, leverage a combination of mutual TLS and/or roles to lock down communication on the gossip channel, etc
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:45:27 GMT):<br/>
So in 1.0 - can a client that was issued a certificate join a gossip channel?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:45:41 GMT):<br/>
1) Gossip currently supports mutual TLS 
2) I think that such discussions are more suitable for the #fabric-crypto  channel

1) Gossip currently supports mutual TLS 
2) I think that such discussions are more suitable for the #fabric-crypto  channel 
3) Indeed if we just run the gRPC server that gossip binds to on a different port- the problem can be solved with firewalls

>  So in 1.0 - can a client that was issued a certificate join a gossip channel? 
If you have the peer binary and you just give it a client's credentials (private key + certificate) - the answer would be- if the peer's MSP can validate that certificate , then I'd say yes. 
Now, if the peer can validate the certificate of a client - that depends on the MSP that is used and also on the certificate. 
Maybe @elli-androulaki can shed some light on the subject. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:58:46 GMT):<br/>
Now, if we had mutual TLS then that'd mean that the client (dressed as a peer) would need a valid TLS cert to connect to a peer

> So in 1.0 - can a client that was issued a certificate join a gossip channel?  
Yes, but unless the client belongs to an organization that have access to a channel (read) it is not able to receive messages that are channel-scoped for that channel.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 18:12:51 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda can you explain the *confidentiality/security* concern behind taking a client's cert and using it to start a peer? As Elli said- since the client came from the same org as the peer, that _ fake _ peer can only get the information (channel-wise) that he could have gotten as a client, not anything more.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 18:13:15 GMT):<br/>
The client isn't authorized to see blocks or RW sets
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 18:13:31 GMT):<br/>
this absolutely breaks confidentiality
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 18:13:57 GMT):<br/>
aha

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 18:16:33 GMT):<br/>
i would imagine there are security concerns as well, with the client able to interrupt the network behavior
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 18:17:02 GMT):<br/>
(as an attacker who steals the client's certificate as client certs are typically less protected than peer certificates)

</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 09:30:06 GMT):<br/>
If so, one could give clients write access to the chain, but no read access. Then there can be a chaincode that checks the transaction status that the clients can query to check of whether their transaction has been validated/included to the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Fri, 14 Apr 2017 09:30:18 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:12:36 GMT):<br/>
Binh brought up config update- I'd like to be able to complete our work and that means to have some support from the SDK and the BDD available for folks to review and we tee that up.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:13:38 GMT):<br/>
Binh brought up documentation- one document I'm working on with a draft from Murali is related to the chaincode lifecycle and meaning of chaincode and what the chaincode is used for. i need the developers to look at the document. we have so many entries but almost all of them are work in progress- they are 1 to 2 paragraphs and we need to fill that out for this release- this is part of work that we have to continue to do
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:13:47 GMT):<br/>
this is all part of the quality of release we have to address
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:14:40 GMT):<br/>
WE need to walk through config update with Elli- what Keith brought up- this is the revocation of the certificate- we are now on verge of merging config update and we have to walk through  so to be able to clearly communicate this.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:15:02 GMT):<br/>
Keith- we do make one config update to orderer- and the orderer broadcast that to all channels- is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:15:05 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:15:16 GMT):<br/>
ON receiver side- it knows how to filter out 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:15:40 GMT):<br/>
the channel side- the bug artem working on, but eventually config update end up in cscc and call in MSP to update- and then MSP update to validate whether it's validated or not
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:15:58 GMT):<br/>
And if each MSP has the variable to keep track of the certificate.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:16:36 GMT):<br/>
Keith- if you have an MSP that is a member of 2 channels- and they know the CRL entry only needs to go on one channel- it's going to end up going on both.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:17:02 GMT):<br/>
again- if there is a revoked entry- a crl with a revoked cert that needs to go onto the list- it may not really gon on all channels associated with that entity.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:17:41 GMT):<br/>
if we do broadcast- a crl list from one participant is going to go onto all channels- where is the control?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:18:11 GMT):<br/>
the certificate revoked A and B- both A and B channels needs to be aware. IT's safe to say a revoked identity related to update needs to go to all channels
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:18:54 GMT):<br/>
because otherwise you say this identity does not have channel C- the access policy sits on top of the MSP and is configured independently from the MSP- 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:19:18 GMT):<br/>
i suspect there needs to be different design where MSP - if some client has cert revoked needs to sent to subset of channels- 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:20:04 GMT):<br/>
Elli- they won't to control where update goes to- or they want to be automated?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:20:49 GMT):<br/>
they want to control where update goes,.. but not their job to automate- ours
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:21:19 GMT):<br/>
we could potentially do some optimization on orderer... 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:21:45 GMT):<br/>
but this seems post 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:23:54 GMT):<br/>
Will the crl update for every certificate - is it accompanies with MSP ID? I thought MSP ID corresponding with cert is out of band knowledge isn't it?  The MSP ID is out of band knowledge that the invoker of the CRL needs to know? yes... it needs to send along with the cert with the update request. I'ts a configuration request associated with that MSP item. and then the orderer take it and validates it against the application administrator policy according to branch,.. and then create config block merging the change with the previous config block and submit all together
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:25:41 GMT):<br/>
when CRL is updated through orderer, a new block will be created- when that arrives on the peer, the client needs to be notified and update the corresponding MSP config in the client.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:27:27 GMT):<br/>
typically each organization may have their own application- if 1 participant submits crl request- the other application and other orgs have to be notified of the change.   Does thte SDK not get a config block update today? yes,.. it does .. crl and other channel update has to be reflected in application layer
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:27:47 GMT):<br/>
MSP is just one component of config update- wouldn't it get it for free without having to do anything? yes, think so
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:30:04 GMT):<br/>
OU support (organizational unit support- ability to support endorsement policy with OU field) - 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:30:18 GMT):<br/>
As of today- neither java/node support ou-- our endosrement policy is only based on roles
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:30:26 GMT):<br/>
if OU needs to be supported- that's new features for SDK
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:31:22 GMT):<br/>
since sdk does not have to evaluate endorsement policy- if sdk has to know different structure- se treat it as a string from SDK perspective- any time we update policy- it's only change to orderer ... the msp code itself- that's a suggestion.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:31:37 GMT):<br/>
could we do the OU ? it's easy to add for the sdk to pass a string through
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:34:45 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix @elli-androulaki I need you guys to post some of this more on the channel on the ou discussion

Vlad- I'm not sure if anyone knows we are building our executable in docker with static flag- Greg Haskins added that but this is a lot of problem with PKCS11 libraries
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:39:39 GMT):<br/>
I'll ping you on slack about it specifically
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:40:47 GMT):<br/>
I mentioned to Yacov- the PKCS11 as I wrote a script where you can generate an end to end test case of sizes of peers and orgs and generate crypto and oderer blog- and I checked under work

@weeds thanks Sharon for posting the discussion. regarding the discussions on OrganizationUnit support, @elli-androulaki has posted on the #fabric-crypto channel

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 19:51:50 GMT):<br/>
@weeds @elli-androulaki  `Upgrade of chaincode- security work has to be combined with installation security work.` -  we have to be careful with terminology....there are two ways to get a chaincode onto a channel (1) install and then instantiate (2) install and then upgrade. The "install" part is now chaincode packaging and is common to both to the instantiate and upgrade work flows. In other words any security work for the upgrade should be identical to the instantiate and shoukd be common code (for example, linking the installed CC with the instantiation/upgraded CC)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 19:54:39 GMT):<br/>
(BTW, talking of upgrade ... https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7831 should be reviewed. @jiangyaoguo has completed the changes requested from previous review... I'll complete my review today)
</p>

Is there a way to remove running chaincode containers/docker images/install packages from the peer that owns and generated the environment ? I am assuming not at the moment as I can't find anything but I might have missed something. Is that something that is coming in the future ?

</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:38:24 GMT):<br/>
2907--> that is a bug... 2909-> that's a bug... all bugs we can still work on post sprint 16 as long as not features

</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:42:15 GMT):<br/>
2914- channel creation- creation does not rely on config gx - first part is merged, 2nd part is in review. updating channel is being worked on right now--> Bret just started working on this- expect early next week ETA
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:42:38 GMT):<br/>
This is a required capability and needs to go into next week
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:42:58 GMT):<br/>
966- this is same as 2914 (one should be duped to the other)- these go hand in hand
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:43:10 GMT):<br/>
2816- documentation is ongoing and must do and will go past 16
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:43:26 GMT):<br/>
2967- Ratnakar is working on it and at any point will be reviewed and merged 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:43:43 GMT):<br/>
3164- we have not started on this- by end of Friday this should be merged as not a big change
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:44:59 GMT):<br/>
2843- this may carry into next week, because we need to work on channel update first.. that blocks this.  not clear when we can get into this- this one is really hard to debug. 3 layers of problems we need to work. we are trying to figure out how to handle on the TCP part of it.  Gari has some ideas on this... and need some input from him @mastersingh24 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:45:17 GMT):<br/>
2555- the only thing left is read/write set that just became available- that is 1 day worth of work and should be done by Friday
</p>

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:46:18 GMT):<br/>
sorry mistake 287 is a to do- This is not in the sprint... it's ongoing tests for test coverage and will go past 16 as a result

623- again ongoing tests
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:47:34 GMT):<br/>
896- server side was just merged earlier this morning- the client side is in review, but must be rebased,.. there is a breakage due to fabric- ca.. we have to add a property in the config (Keith said- hey jim let's talk about this.. another guy merged it this morning)
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 13:48:49 GMT):<br/>
Networking one is the biggest one that is really unknown where i  marked Gari on it.  all should be done by Sunday

do we really think 2564 is must have? Jim said there is one must have- hash algorithim on per channel basis that must done. that is the minimum requirement... maybe this is what we need to do versus the bigger piece- Jim/Rick to talk about this afterwards

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:08:30 GMT):<br/>
198- this is our only true story- this is around supporting upgrade and validating that chaincode vesion is same when transaction executed- we are going through comments from Binh/Murali on what we need to do here.  We think discussion is rapping up... Binh did have comments on chaincode upgrade on comitter side- developer from Huawei- but I need to go through this.. if Murali is on call today or on rocket chat, we may need to try to discuss this.  we want to get this in and maybe enahancement later, but we need to discuss this more completely 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:09:23 GMT):<br/>
this one is moving slower. so this is because they are in China- so it's a little tougher.. this will go past sprint 16
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:09:35 GMT):<br/>
Binh said let's see what we can do on ledger side to help... but I need to have discussion with Murali and team on this

Binh you are suggesting that we delay 815-- are we ready to make that call?  or anybody else on call
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:12:49 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:13:26 GMT):<br/>
Binh's recommendation is to defer- because we don't have a mechanism or tool to allow members to sign a config transaction... Behave does that... it's a behave test. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:13:57 GMT):<br/>
We don't have something that a customer - customer would have to do it themselves- they would have to build the tool themselves as part of admin tool. instead of embarking on tool to do this, we should defer it.. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:14:09 GMT):<br/>
@mastesingh24 do you agree with that @binhn 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:14:47 GMT):<br/>
We should also put in comments what jeff mentioned- people can use the BDD as an example to build their admin tool to do this.. because the mechanics are in place. but they have to know how to collect signatures to put in protobuf
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:15:30 GMT):<br/>
NODEsdk has enough API so that you get the raw protobuf bytes and you send it to anybody and they can take a sig on it and send sig and we have tool to take sig and integrate into protobuf to send in config 9from Jim zhang) that is all we need- this is discussion with Varad in how we do for our own implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:15:52 GMT):<br/>
The same api can be used easily for admin type applications to do the same thing- send byte array around and collect the signature
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:16:04 GMT):<br/>
i don't think more is needed- it won't be there for Java, but Node sdk will have it
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:16:18 GMT):<br/>
we should put these comments in JIRA @jeffgarratt

2972- add query api support for java chaincode- is this something we have to have since Murali isn't on right now?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:17:23 GMT):<br/>
This is java chaincode query so we have to do this-- Binh said this would fall into similar to java support in general
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:17:28 GMT):<br/>
it's lagging behind the other languages
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:17:50 GMT):<br/>
so we need to keep working on this after sprint 16
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:17:59 GMT):<br/>
Maybe Luis is working on this already given Murali is out?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:18:29 GMT):<br/>
Do we know if anyone is using javachaincode- we know they are using Java SDK but we don't know anyone using java chaincode

people do want it- people are asking for it in community

@mastersingh24 do you have an opinion on this?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:19:48 GMT):<br/>
deferred meaning to post 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:21:06 GMT):<br/>
Here's the thing- we have a set of admin apis from version 0.6 and they have no security whatsoever in the structure in these apis- the apis being used by peer and node and peer login... peer node start or peer node login and you turn on different log in and so forth- from CLI- it will call into these apis.. in the new way to do this- in order to take advantage the security infrastructure in place and thought for this item and to convert this into system chaincode, but i think we do not have bandwidth to do this,.. and feel we should live with what we have now
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:21:30 GMT):<br/>
Aren't those APIs controlled by TLS?  Oh but that just gives you TLS- i thinkwe have to document with this.  Jeff agrees with this

This is a good time to remind everyone- for any of your CRs - we are not all making sure that any time you submit CR  that you put th eJIRA item in your CR so we can see the state of it- we will stop approving if we can not map it to JIRa/CR

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:26:02 GMT):<br/>
47- a review item to remind us that we review the upgrade process in parallell with 3155 and 2932 by Matthias - we are essentially reviewing security aspects of chaincode upgrade within channel- Matthias found some issues around it and we created a bug in bug log that we will tackle next week.. this isn't a feature code- but really reviewing to make sure it's secure.... so really only logging as we do deep security review
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:26:42 GMT):<br/>
2091- in review.. we have listed CR 6421 and needs to be reviewed. most recent update few hours ago. Elli about to review after CI verifies

2362- this one is also under review 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:29:21 GMT):<br/>
2421- this is not done yet, it's a crl setup optimization, we were talking about with Ale- this may be optimization for next week.. it's not a feature, it's how we do validation of identity more efficiently
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:29:27 GMT):<br/>
will this risk destabilize? Ale?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:29:37 GMT):<br/>
it's very small changes and would effect only tests that exercise revocation
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:29:49 GMT):<br/>
Binh or @mastersingh24 with this?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:30:59 GMT):<br/>
Binh feels that we do need to clean the plate monday next week, because monday we have hackfest and we want to talk with community that we are ready to go through test/documentation .. remaining work needs to be just quality when we with community to decide to release. we do not want too many things open at this point unless they are absolutely critical unless defects. if we can not address this- it seems this is something we should postpone to 1.1
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:31:15 GMT):<br/>
i suggest this two other items to defer- 3165 and 2989
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:31:26 GMT):<br/>
because the list of items is very long
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:31:54 GMT):<br/>
if we can not get this item in 2421- we should move it out.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:33:02 GMT):<br/>
sorry it was 3155- Elli indicated not just a review- it's work related to validation to transactions associated with chaincode instnatiation and upgrade- I already submitted a CR for which i listed here and for this item there is a CR on endorsement phase- so it's security work we discussed with Murali- we have to get it in as there is an exposure.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:33:08 GMT):<br/>
we can have CRs ready and done by tomorrow.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:33:19 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:33:29 GMT):<br/>
well, if you hvae a CR submit for  merge this week- i'm ok then

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:33:36 GMT):<br/>

Ale? on 2931 there is another change set that matthias is working one. on 3155 there is one more changeset fromMatthias, but on my side we can get this done  this week
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:35:17 GMT):<br/>
ale wants to push in now- but i'm trying to keep the changesets small for reviewers so need to factor that in
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:35:52 GMT):<br/>
if we have something that depends on Murali at this point- this is probably in jeapordy- lscc is important to secure otherwise people can modify entries associated with cc... 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:36:13 GMT):<br/>
Binh feels that this isn't a hole that has to be closed, @mastersingh24?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:38:01 GMT):<br/>
i see a lot of risk here and number of items and number of dependencies- there are 2 days- and we have time for review... and we are also lack of maintainers given different circumstances.. so feel there is a lot of risk to sprint 16 to make some of this this weekend for merge
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:38:26 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr Elli might need some help here, but she did feel security work can be reviewed.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:38:38 GMT):<br/>
We all think that these chainsets are important from security perspective and 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:39:04 GMT):<br/>
Binh's recommendation- CR that we have in for 2091 and 3155 I have not reviewed these yet, but I will go more deeply into review, but maybe we should defer the rest?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:39:17 GMT):<br/>
and defer 2989 and 2421?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:39:33 GMT):<br/>
2989 has been put on backlog- and this can be deferred (from Elli)
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:39:43 GMT):<br/>
2421- i already moved to backlog to be deferred (from Elli0
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:40:05 GMT):<br/>
so we can put 3155, 2091 after i review with current crs that are submitted, but remaining items, but create new jira issues and move to backlog
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:40:08 GMT):<br/>
Elli agreed
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:40:22 GMT):<br/>
is everyone ok with that? @mastersingh24 ? 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:41:09 GMT):<br/>
is it considered a security issue that a chaincode can modify another chaincode namespace without target chaincode endorsement policy not being checked/
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:41:15 GMT):<br/>
Elli feels this is a big problem
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:41:36 GMT):<br/>
yes- I wrote about that in fabric that we discussed in community when we implemented chaincode calling chaincode that it is something we can document
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:42:05 GMT):<br/>
again, there is stuff from security point of view we have to document and to make sure people understand and know what the shortcomings and our roadmap to cover them post 1.0- do not believe all will be addressed.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:42:39 GMT):<br/>
deployment of 1.0 today is within the control of some set of companies- it's not an open network that any chaincode can call any chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:42:56 GMT):<br/>
issue that i see- i'm just an org in channel, and I will get and deploy  my own chaincode by my own org.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:43:06 GMT):<br/>
my peer and i can collude to write in ledger an dwill not be stopped in any way
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:43:33 GMT):<br/>
so a peer is supposed to be trusted by other organizations- the whole trust model is based on CFT
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:43:43 GMT):<br/>
because the orderer is everywhere
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:44:01 GMT):<br/>
let's document it and is very clear and transparent and move to solve in next post 1.0 release
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:44:40 GMT):<br/>
regardless of this- security check needs to take place at commitment side when it comes to evaluate a transaction- we need to validate transaction changes the state of only invoked chaincode- otherwise one client has been compromised and can mess everything up
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:44:55 GMT):<br/>
I could try potentially say that i invoke chaincode i never invoked and --
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:45:00 GMT):<br/>
what chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:45:30 GMT):<br/>
i'm referring to invoking single chaincode- without endorsing policy of changing state to other chaincodes- i'm able to do so right now
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:45:40 GMT):<br/>
issue is bigger- endorsement policy means nothing- i create endorsement- everyone should sign
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:45:52 GMT):<br/>
but another chaincode on channel that requires one channel and can bypass the other endorsement policy
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:46:13 GMT):<br/>
who deployed the other chaindoes that someone else deployed? remember that it is the CFT- it is not byzantine and network is controlled by someone
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:46:31 GMT):<br/>
Let's take this offline
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:46:42 GMT):<br/>
we need to get Gari involved on this one please and maybe some other maintainers
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:46:52 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:47:05 GMT):<br/>
this is separate thing that we might list as bug if it's important and do it next week-
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:47:14 GMT):<br/>
the recommended fix is easy really
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:47:54 GMT):<br/>
we just need to ensure in the end to have committing peer and look and ensure that at least the chaincode whose state being touched have same endorsement policy is satisified- we only allow chaincode to chaincode that is within the same trust domain- it's the easy way to fix this. it's not something we realized until this morning. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:48:05 GMT):<br/>
this is conversations spawning from David/manish-- 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:48:11 GMT):<br/>
Ale realzied this today and reported it
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:49:14 GMT):<br/>
problem becomes bigger if you have chaincode to chaincode and modify chaincode state. we can of course claim the trust model is we don't allow for byzantine peers, but we do consider byzantine peers- for example in gossip- a peer has to authenticate another peer from same org before state or messages,etc,.. so this is an easy fix in our opinion 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:49:23 GMT):<br/>
we can claim to "some" extent byzantine peers- binh asking to take off line.

2862 from Jeff Garrat
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:50:20 GMT):<br/>
this is BDD work that Binh has been pointing to for the new config changes
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:50:40 GMT):<br/>
the reason is that this was created in preparation for config coming in or not
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:50:53 GMT):<br/>
we need to coordinate to merge these- there are 3 outstanding items
</p>

1 is this BDD 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:51:11 GMT):<br/>
the other one is the SDK (can't remember the number)
</p>

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:55:00 GMT):<br/>
Jeff/Jim is it possible to break into phases because we don't want to break things- yes i'm trying to get orderer - i've been able to get the orderer up but sometimes fails with submission of config,  but when I try to remove msp for application group- but it panics... so I'm asking kostas for his help in navigating this
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:55:23 GMT):<br/>
there might be bugs we found
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:55:36 GMT):<br/>
Jim- first step is to update proto- so is it updated? yes, it's done binh said
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:56:01 GMT):<br/>
we update that and so we can do the end to end which takes the binary input to create channel to make that work when you regenerate the config tx gen yaml to regenerate the channel config- that is first step
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:56:09 GMT):<br/>
next step is to update json create channel support and do the proper update
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:56:33 GMT):<br/>
what is the progress on that Jim? I need to tie out with Brett and I can find out @jimthematrix post here please what you find out

</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:57:59 GMT):<br/>
They fail with high probability... do we think this is infrastructure or a code change that cause fragility?

</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:58:53 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:59:31 GMT):<br/>

Will -- 2351 on logging
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 15:01:01 GMT):<br/>
this is one i have 2 crs and merged and reviewed up to this point- it will make it easier to set gossip/ledger to different log levels to default and allow you up and running to set components wiht one line call instead of having to lop through all the modules- it will touch a lot of files with a logger- but it will be a one character change so it uses my new method to start up the logger so we can keep track of it and update accordingly, and i will have out for review if all goes according to plan
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 15:01:23 GMT):<br/>
Binh- sooner we get merged the better provided gets past the code reviews
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 15:01:39 GMT):<br/>
put a note on the review channel on that so folks know
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 15:03:23 GMT):<br/>
on the ci- we can easily fail the verify if the maintainers want that.   When they look at the PR all the information and the jenkins link show the failure.  The e2e failing could be if any of the sdk's have an issue, so that is worth discussing, if one sdk is busted to we want to fail the verify.  If the behave fails, we can def enable the verify the -1.   Is there someone in particular that is interested? Whatever Binh want.  There have been a recent run of issues and Ramesh still opens issues Jira Bugs on the failures (from Barry)--- Binh is going to reach out to Barry

Hi @mastersingh24 there is no jira item/bug related to this. @aso is about to create one. 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:01:53 GMT):<br/>
ok - figured that was the case as I could not find it.  I assume the issue here is that we are not checking the endorsement policy for the called chaincode at commit time?  (i.e. we only checked the endorsement policy for the calling in chaincode)?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:02:01 GMT):<br/>
but I'll read the JIRA in any case
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:03:07 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:04:12 GMT):<br/>
and this goes even worse, cause from the moment an attacker is able to instantiate its chaincode (which now anyone can do) with its own endorsement policy, it can use this "gap" to push changes to other chaincodes in the chain without satisfying their endorsement policy
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:04:40 GMT):<br/>
@aso can give you more info on this.
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:06:18 GMT):<br/>
basically it somehow voids the protection afforded by endorsement policies - you'd think that the namespace of a cc can only be changed with enough endorsements for *that* chaincode, but in reality, enough endorsements for *any* chaincode in the channel can write anywhere in the channel
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:11:24 GMT):<br/>
not a feature
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:11:27 GMT):<br/>
yes, agree Jim- unless there is a change
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:11:58 GMT):<br/>
i have to go with what you/Gari and other maintainers suggest here
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:12:11 GMT):<br/>
(I mean, of course- that although we have said that we do not merge features, this should be considered as an acute bug)
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:18:38 GMT):<br/>
agreed - and it's a security bug, and so it's a vulnerability and not just a bug imho

agreed too
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:25:41 GMT):<br/>
you are making some big assumptions here
1) somehow the network is open that anyone can deploy chaincodes -- this is wrong and can be locked down
2) assumed #1, would someone be such malicious and put his ID on the private member-only network?

so I do agree that it's worth fixing if we can get to it; otherwise doc it

@binhn side topic- i got this weird suggestion that we move to use the newer golang 1.7+. i don't think that was planned for version 1.0 nor was it checked in- unless I missed it- correct? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:32:08 GMT):<br/>
@binhn  I think a more likely scenario is not someone who is malicious, but someone who is un-informed or doesn't understand how things work - writes a chaincode that has an endorsement policy of "anyone can do anything" - and that chaincode receives chaincode names as input or something
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:34:38 GMT):<br/>
[ I'm very confused here - unless I don't understand the bug.  If I call a chaincode from another chaincode within the same channel and we don't validate the endorsements for each chaincode against it's policy, then we have a security hole based on the model.  ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=e2nAJLRinTKQEw9ro) @binhn 
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:37:14 GMT):<br/>
that's my understanding too @mastersingh24 
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:48:05 GMT):<br/>
So, if i understand what @binhn is saying is that if we allow chaincode deployment within a restricted set of users that are trusted (lscc locked down) then we can say we trust them to pick endorsement policies approprietly for chaincodes that invoke other chaincodes. But currently now we do not have such lock down of LCCC (with Matthias' change the only thing that we allow is the chaincode instantiation policy that is defined by its creator that could be "also faked" to be satisfied by the attacker's certificate. 
The creator of course can be set accountable for its deeds due to the signature check, if the signature was checked by endorsement policy but endorsement policy can be also "accept all".

</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:51:10 GMT):<br/>
W.r.t. accountability, it is true the signatures of the invoker, and of the instantiator of the chaincode would be there. And any of them upon inspection of the chain can be set accountable. But in the mean time this state changes may have triggered other changes to other chains (that use cahincode to chaincode queries) that is hard to trace... 
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:51:45 GMT):<br/>
Maybe easier to fix it and be safe from this headache ... 
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:58:50 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 it is a security issue as discussed on the call but can be managed with a modified lscc acl
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:07:20 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure it can though.. sure, if you lockdown lscc you can't have just anyone pull this attack
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:07:55 GMT):<br/>
but you can still circumvent endorsement policies
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:08:29 GMT):<br/>
e.g. with the endorsement policy of cc1 I get to change cc2's state (bypassing cc2's endorsment policy checks)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:22:59 GMT):<br/>
Here's my suggestion(s):

1) Create a JIRA item explaining the issue
2) Within the JIRA issue write up the "proper" solution
3) Assess the invasiveness of the work - e.g. will we have to change any of the underlying structures (i.e. I have not looked deeply at the code but it does not look like things are as straightforward as one might hope)
4) If structures do need to change and we don't think we can be backward compatible with the changes (e.g. parsing events, etc), the best decision is to fix it
5) If the fix could be made later without breaking things, assess the seriousness of the vulnerability and decide if this can be deferred to a patch release (e.g. 1.0.1)

@SotirisAlfonsos  - how are you invoking the transaction?  Via the CLI?   I think you'll have an issue doing that because your policy requires endorsement from both Org0 and Org1

@mastersingh24, @muralisr 

we have followed e2e_cli example for v1.0. we are able to test it with Peers 0 and 1 joined to organization Org0MSP.

We tried joining Peer3 to Org0MSP with modifications in files [configtx.yaml] and [docker-compose.yaml] files but its giving error:

Thank you for the clarification @mastersingh24  . Yes i am doing it via the client, sending the invoke command to one peer, peer0 lets say. I thought maybe there was a way to send the same chaincode invoke to different peers. I will install the sdk then, i think it will solve my problem.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 20 Apr 2017 11:47:48 GMT):<br/>
yeah - I think that will be easiest because the transaction which gets sent to the orderer actually is a wrapper around the endorsement returned from the peer.  The SDK handles this case but the CLI will not

@rmohta  - 

`peer chaincode package` -  TLDR - it packages up you chaincode for installation on peers.  You can find details here - http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cc-packaging-and-signing.html?highlight=package   

the blocks are stored in a file-based ledger and the current value of any key is stored in either leveldb or couchdb.

Hi all, we've had a number of people expressing a desire to suppress certain log modules within their peer docker containers. For environments similar to the one created using `./network_setup.sh up`, I recommend the following:
1. connect to the CLI container `docker exec -it cli bash`
2. run the setlevel command with the CORE_PEER_ADDRESS environment variable provided to specify which peer you'd like to run the command against and the module name you would like to update: for example, `CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1:7051 peer logging setlevel gossip/discovery#peer1:7051 warning` (making sure to update the peer address in the environment variable (and, for gossip-related modules, in the module name as well) to the value for your environment). Note: the key for now is to specify the module name exactly as it appears in your logs. Very soon, updating the log levels via regular expressions will be enabled and it will no longer take a long series of commands to dynamically update levels.

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 23:12:29 GMT):<br/>
@rmohta "upgrade" is equivalent to "instantiate". First you "install" version 2.0 and then you upgrade a previously instantiated version 1.0  on a channel to 2.0. So just like "instantiate", "upgrade" command takes a -c parameter which will be used to call the Init method of the 2.0 version of the chaincode on that channel. It gives you the opportunuity to do any upgrade tasks

@wlahti @muralisr Before this weekend, when I ran `go test -v` for verbose mode, it would dump out all the debug statements from the code during the test.  This was very helpful for test development and debug.  Now when I run `go test -v` it does not print out the debug.  Is this related to the recent logging enhancements?  How to get debug during test execution now?

I think it's because the peer's initialization path does something that UTs don't

ledger tests typically load core.yaml into viper, so i also tried changing default from info to debug in core.yaml.  but still no luck.  I'm not sure how go testing works with loggers.  @wlahti could you investigate further?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=Gd4m4HWRq6r4SNQMY) @dbshah This helps. Thank You. Dumb question - do the certs generated by cryptogen signed by fabric-ca certs? Or that's not required?

Fabric_CA 2597  it's a small piece of work- changing of api prefix urls.. if this changeset was merged- it would allow/ with no prefix and / api/v1, but it would not support all 3... or it could support all 3.  with cffsl.  What i'm trying to not break anyone, but to go ahead and get in support so all those calling fabric /ca can call the right one,.. and then i can remove the urls that we no longer support.  What I can do-- i pushed this over a week ago- i will update merge set to support all three.. no way it could break anyone.  it's already merged... so need to move to done

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:57:32 GMT):<br/>
this should go into review.. but we have a document that we have to get done first
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:57:37 GMT):<br/>
before it can get in
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:58:00 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:58:32 GMT):<br/>

This release tar file that we are putting out there and instructing users to download using curl- will also have code that is not using consortium and outdated with configtx yaml files
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:59:23 GMT):<br/>
we can merge this without the document, yes?  We have to give folks out there document that belongs to the old code, so when they go to getting started it will work with them with the alpha level code.  
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:59:35 GMT):<br/>
We can merge consortium and documentation later on-
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:00:13 GMT):<br/>
Getting started doc in code tell people to clone the repo and build from the repo. so if we merge the new stuff and they try to clone and build it would not work- meaning that the config tx would not work- so we need to divert them from cloning first
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:01:05 GMT):<br/>

Do we have agreement whether we want node.sdk to support channel update?  I thought we needed this- but the merge was holding on node sdk to support that
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:06:45 GMT):<br/>
yes, Binh feels we need to support that - i thought you and @mastersingh24 had discussion- maybe we just "push" the data through- the app would set up the config update and give it to the SDK and the SDK would "push it through" , and we would not provide specific api level at sdk level.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:07:07 GMT):<br/>
we are buildling on top of JSON support-- and now for update- you have to use external tool, and I'm confused by this.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:07:29 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix needs to discuss with @mastersingh24 on this topic as there is confusion
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:08:11 GMT):<br/>
The api we have is a level 1 api, and if we start adding more things and we discover there are changes... we should keep it minimum and not have any dependencies. Certain apis we allow users to use JSON and some we are stating you are on your own- so there are some inconsistencies
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:08:27 GMT):<br/>
We are living with inconsistency so we don't overexpose our APIs
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:08:58 GMT):<br/>
We will adjust the CR to do this
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:09:19 GMT):<br/>
if we have everything coded already- then might as well do the appropriate action, but if there is still area that we need to do- maybe we should defer?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:09:41 GMT):<br/>
That CR is the first step,.. and there is a separate CR to support the consoritum- so it is not ready to go yet.

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:14:56 GMT):<br/>
from CI reporting point of view- we can then exclude the directories 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:15:06 GMT):<br/>
i'm asking the exclusion of bdd tests.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:16:12 GMT):<br/>
We have too many directories- we have a package that has one file in it- and sometimes no test in that file- because it's an interface- we should organize our code
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:16:38 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:16:57 GMT):<br/>
Jim zhang does feel we need to do that- the interdependencies it's not going to be done by end of today
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:17:20 GMT):<br/>
at least the first cut of this is to rename all our directories- some of us call test util, some mock test,.. can we consistently to mocks please.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:17:50 GMT):<br/>
2nd iteration- move all the code from prod code-- functions that call mocks test data that is a function in product code module.. so we need to move all of that out of the product code to the package that it belongs to,.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:18:01 GMT):<br/>
last iteration- consolidate mocks directory into a location that is easier to exclude
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:18:21 GMT):<br/>

 Hi, Can someone pls help clarify endorsement policy and how end users can approve/reject the transaction. Let's say there 2 peers for 2 different bank (Bank A and B ). Bank A initiate a transaction on chaincode X using Bank A client app. It has endorsement policy that says Bank B.Member should sign. The transaction hits endorsement peer of B, it creates R/W, validates transaction and sign of peer A. It then forwards a endorsement to client app which waits for a Bank B member to sign the transaction. Once Bank B users signs the transaction (by approve/reject on UI), its forward back to Bank B Peer which in turn sends endorsment to Bank A client app. Client A app collects endorsment and submits to orderer. Orderer orders and creates a block and sends it to commiting peer to update the state and ledger. Can someone pls confirm this is correct flow.

</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Fri, 28 Apr 2017 14:06:36 GMT):<br/>


Dave (Composer) - raised issue on rocket chat its on  alpha node sdk, related to grpc version, david to raise Jira

Unit test coverage
- Crypto up 3.5% nice work
- Crypto - Change set pending and should raise coverage to 85%+
- Resources added Endorser, Orderer to improve coverage
- Gossip - Change set pending and should raise coverage to 90%+
- Binh working on how to restructure protos files 
- We want meaning UT, NOT just for increasing numbers.   Stressed this point

Features
2843 - Gari looking at NW,  Mult host set up in lab using vlaunch, need to reproduce,  really should be a defect, there is no feature work,  its a extremely complex problem to solve
2967 - Examples;  4 of 5 complete.   Eta for the 5th one is  eod
648   - maven, no real update here.   need LF
2914  - update config, this is 'in review' but needs work because of fabric changes.   ETA EOD

Does the peer need to have a copy of a 1.0.0-snapshot-8f7bfc3 image?  Was working flawlessly before the changes with consortiums were pushed
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 30 Apr 2017 14:05:00 GMT):<br/>
@passkit a possibility is that the image version does not match 1.0.0-snapshot-8f7bfc3

Hello all. 
There is a bug I think we would want to fix for V1.0 that makes the peer's startup time linear with the size of its chains

@muralisr which image exactly should match.  The snapshot version is embedded in the peer binary at compile time, and I am using the fabric-ccenv image from the same build.  Looking at the code, it is not obvious precisely what image it is looking for to run syscc.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 30 Apr 2017 21:33:32 GMT):<br/>

Will plans to send some information on Hyperledger-fabric emailing list on guidance on this
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:53:49 GMT):<br/>
When you return error- we should log a corresponding logging statement in the log
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:53:57 GMT):<br/>
so you can correlate what client received and what happened on server side.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:54:10 GMT):<br/>
Sometimes we are getting client log- but no indication of when it happens and when.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:54:24 GMT):<br/>
The framework will help generate the call stack based on error received
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:54:32 GMT):<br/>
IF everybody follows the new approach.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:54:39 GMT):<br/>
We still need to LOG the error- this is part of the guidance
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:54:52 GMT):<br/>
Any time create an error- put a warning or error message.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:55:05 GMT):<br/>
Will may update the example and clarify this in the document
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:55:12 GMT):<br/>
Every error is returning a call stack.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 13:55:44 GMT):<br/>
Keith worried this may not be non-standard-- so like unexpected errors,.. but the framework gives you option wiht callstack and without.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:00:22 GMT):<br/>
make sure we are writing solid code (we should be done with features at this point unless it's serviceability), get good test coverage and do the right thing- tests should be covering both positive and negative testing... don't race to the end... 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:00:44 GMT):<br/>
it's more important to stop, do the right thing and do the right test coverage- versus adding test coverage to increase the percentages.

this is fabric sample config- configtxgen uses
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:09:56 GMT):<br/>
do you clone this in your repo? yes, i did a get pull 50 minutes ago...
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:10:27 GMT):<br/>
And then I do tweek something-> I tweek configtx.yaml which gets you orderer, channels genesis block.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:11:14 GMT):<br/>
there is a failure right now- orderer failing to complete security handshake. from peer side it's a time out.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:12:13 GMT):<br/>
they are looking at orderer-peer-tls-failure-pcping.txt
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:13:55 GMT):<br/>
Barry thinks this looks like a cyber suite issue.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:16:35 GMT):<br/>
In his- Client said 2B was his 2nd choice... but the first one is rsa for server
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:16:46 GMT):<br/>
the common name in the cert must match the host name in the http header.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:17:22 GMT):<br/>
wait- this is between peer and orderer
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:17:30 GMT):<br/>
the sending was from the peer and the other is from orderer
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:19:28 GMT):<br/>
Barry is thinking- maybe it has to do with the name?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:19:31 GMT):<br/>
they agreed on cipher suite
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:19:43 GMT):<br/>
The cert says- example peer zero.org 1. com
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:19:46 GMT):<br/>
but the host name is peer zerio
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:19:53 GMT):<br/>
how do we do the override from the peer side?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:21:09 GMT):<br/>
hi @mastersingh24 how to set the hostname override for TLS on the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:22:38 GMT):<br/>
you have to call the service name to match the host name
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:23:31 GMT):<br/>
Jim adding to see if that works
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:24:34 GMT):<br/>
so in this call- the peer is the client... it's the server name which is orderer that needs over-riding
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:31:01 GMT):<br/>
So Jim- put in docker compose when we set up the orderer- we had it be named- it has the same name as the cert from cryptogen
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:31:14 GMT):<br/>
Jim said this works--
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:31:27 GMT):<br/>
Ratnakar is indicating- we don't use cryptogen tool- we are using old certificates
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:31:31 GMT):<br/>
for the CLI
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:31:44 GMT):<br/>
we have to integrate what we did for DC hackfest to move to what Jim is doing
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:32:09 GMT):<br/>
basically, the service name in the compose file needs to match the CN in the certificate
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:32:25 GMT):<br/>
and the container name- yes?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:32:30 GMT):<br/>
you can also use cryptogen to not add DNS suffix
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:32:39 GMT):<br/>
yeah we just did that for the docker-compose.yaml in node sdk
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:32:40 GMT):<br/>
So the Nodesdk works with this change
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:32:41 GMT):<br/>
now
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:32:46 GMT):<br/>
well container name will equal the service name
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:32:46 GMT):<br/>
and that got us past the issue
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:33:14 GMT):<br/>
we also modified cryptogen to se multiple SANs - need to merge that change though
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:33:45 GMT):<br/>
at grpc level- is there any way to percolate that error message somehow?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:33:52 GMT):<br/>
because many people will run into this
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:34:17 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 any ideas on how to generate error so we can help people in the future?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:35:16 GMT):<br/>
1 Docker--> Binh feels we need to have a compose e2e cli,.. and we need another level for node and another level for java
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:36:18 GMT):<br/>
Jim feels he needs a nodesdk target that we need fabric and fabric ca... we need an e2e... should it be in fabric? or should it be somewhere lese? it should be in integration packet somewhere
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:36:51 GMT):<br/>
Say my compose has fabric ca in it? so we run a ci test that has this.. for node sdk- go start up and using that same compose image
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:37:07 GMT):<br/>
Let's consolidate this and optional components to turn on/off components like fabric ca
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:37:10 GMT):<br/>
or couchdb
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:37:26 GMT):<br/>
we know we start with docker compose- and we have to tweek environment variable and we know exactly 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:37:28 GMT):<br/>
what is happening
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:38:19 GMT):<br/>
We're going to start with the one in node sdk as it's more comprehenisve.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:38:28 GMT):<br/>
it has 2 orgs, heach has it's own fabric ca
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:38:43 GMT):<br/>
we only have 1 peer- but we need to add another peer to utilize gossip.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:39:45 GMT):<br/>
in DC hackfest- we have a local program that uses node as well as fabric-CA... it generates certificates and orderer block and creates channel,.. and the same docker compose file can be used by node sdk ..I just have to plug in the fabric ca parts.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:39:59 GMT):<br/>
we can still include the fabric ca--- for cli piece too.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:41:36 GMT):<br/>
For node sdk testing- As long as the files are generated in fabric- we can assume that the fabric repository will be sitting side by side. Node can use the file system itself. so if you could output to mounted folder.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:42:23 GMT):<br/>
node engine should be 6.9 or later
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:45:00 GMT):<br/>
Ratnakar feels he can get this sometime tomorrow-- given work ahead
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:46:32 GMT):<br/>
to get to one compose file
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 01 May 2017 14:47:34 GMT):<br/>
[ My take here is quite simple:

The base compose for all e2e should be the same - meaning we use IDENTICAL peer and orderer nodes.   

If the SDKs want to add additional nodes (e.g. fabric-ca, couch, they can do do but the based compose should be the same with all the same crypto material.

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Tue, 02 May 2017 13:36:59 GMT):<br/>
@HubertYoung the join channel requires the submitter have the admin role for the peer.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Tue, 02 May 2017 13:37:53 GMT):<br/>
this translates to either the cert of the signer is in the admincerts folder of the localmsp config of the peer, or their cert was signed by was one of the certs located there (or in the chain)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Tue, 02 May 2017 13:38:54 GMT):<br/>
not sure if there is an issue with e2e, or there is some config issue in your case

For 9;30 est call here's the structure
</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 13:24:23 GMT):<br/>
1) CI Build Status 
    - If there is a failure, we discuss and assign the breaking defect.  This defect will be the top priority for the team until resolved. 

2) Defect status 
   - We will discuss defects with priority=highest and overall backlog by component
   - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10409

3) QA status.  This will be any items from QA not covered already #1 and #2

4) Endgame items. 
    - We will review any outstanding items on the feature board.   This should be priority items in review and waiting to be merged
       - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10404
    - We will review end game items. E.G. serviability
       - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10410
    
5) Documenation status
    - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10406

6) After 1-5, engineers an stay on and discuss any follow up items.

<p><strong>HubertYoung</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:18:45 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt Thanks!I should have described more clearly.When i commit only one tx,it is ok.But in the upper case,i commit 20 txs,18 of them are marked invalid and the other two are sumbited to the blocks.All the txs are transfering from a to b with 1.I know it relates to the Concurrency Control Version Check.But i dont know how to make it right.

summary of scrum 
</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:20:36 GMT):<br/>
CI update:
- Everything passed with exception of Java SDK.  Bug 3378    This was expected based on recent Fabric changes that Java is catching up to

Bugs Priority Highest:
- 3550 - Ramesh to turn on logs for Jeff, Barry to follow up
- 3301 - Jim looking.  Murali to help as well
- 3940 - working on it very difficult eta eow
- 3300 - being worked
- 3301 - gari working it
- 3037 - doc, clayton to alert Nick
- 2843 - most likely dup of 3301

Discussion on how user updates policy
 - configtxgen generate binary with default policy
 - does sdk read binary and update, or used txgen somehow do this
 - Jeff's question how does user req get translated into a policy
 - take discussion offline - Murali to lead

CRs in review from feature board
- we reviewed each
- decision to defer jira 2362, 

Unit test coverage
- Anil working with Murali added some small items that will start increasing coverage
- Luis started and will check in CRs today

Serviceability
- Created features for each team for dashboard
- Each team to update status
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:22:42 GMT):<br/>
@HubertYoung are you doing this in parallel?
</p>
<p><strong>HubertYoung</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:22:59 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:23:02 GMT):<br/>
ahhh
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:23:09 GMT):<br/>
that will be problematic with the MVCC info
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:23:21 GMT):<br/>
the RW sets will fail checks in this case
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:23:45 GMT):<br/>
if you serialize the input I assume this works for you?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:24:16 GMT):<br/>
the issue is the RW sets are validated at the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:25:31 GMT):<br/>
the first through the orderer will succeed, and then a subsequent latter TX may happen to get the latest Read set and then also work.  In your case, the first and last may always work
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:25:54 GMT):<br/>
but if all submitted too quicjly, only first will pass
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:26:39 GMT):<br/>
also, you have to wait for the peer to validate and commit the TX
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:26:54 GMT):<br/>
before sumbitting subsequent for endorsement to the same peer
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:27:15 GMT):<br/>
you should submit proposal, then TX, and then wait for event from peer saying committed, then proceed
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:27:21 GMT):<br/>
does that make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>HubertYoung</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:28:13 GMT):<br/>
Yes.But i would be too slow for the batch process
</p>
<p><strong>HubertYoung</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:28:13 GMT):<br/>
Yes.But it would be too slow for the batch process
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:28:59 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr do we currently support multiple proposals in our TXs?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:29:19 GMT):<br/>
meaning, can @HubertYoung batch his proposal responses, and then submit in single TX?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:30:15 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt @HubertYoung only one proposal/response is supported currently
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:30:57 GMT):<br/>
@HubertYoung if your network requires more than a single endorsement, then the flow you are discussing can be problematic either way
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:31:55 GMT):<br/>
basically you have a concurrency issue not unlike any DB faces
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:32:10 GMT):<br/>
except the blockchain requires slightly more moving parts
</p>
<p><strong>HubertYoung</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:32:21 GMT):<br/>
Dose it has something to do with the key?If the proposals have different keys,would it be alright?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:32:26 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:32:47 GMT):<br/>
if each proposal touched a different key, should be fine
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:32:58 GMT):<br/>
I assume you are trying to perform basic perf testing?
</p>
<p><strong>HubertYoung</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:33:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:33:23 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:33:51 GMT):<br/>
k, have each concurrent proposal operate on a separate key and you should not have concurrency issues
</p>
<p><strong>HubertYoung</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:33:53 GMT):<br/>
Thanks.It helps a lot
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:33:58 GMT):<br/>
good luck!!
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:34:17 GMT):<br/>
and I would also recommend integrating the number of endorsements you plan to actually have
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:34:56 GMT):<br/>
@HubertYoung as this will also affect your throughput, latency, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:35:28 GMT):<br/>
particularly because network and crypto are heavily involved
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:37:43 GMT):<br/>
@HubertYoung and also consider your storage choice (leve vs couchdb, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:38:08 GMT):<br/>
default is level, assume couchdb may introduce overhead, but that is an 'assumption' :)
</p>
<p><strong>HubertYoung</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:38:23 GMT):<br/>
haha
</p>
<p><strong>HubertYoung</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:40:18 GMT):<br/>
Do you have any ideas about setting up a cluster?Is docker swarm a good choice?
</p>
<p><strong>HubertYoung</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:40:49 GMT):<br/>
The more peers,the better?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 03 May 2017 15:40:50 GMT):<br/>
I do

Reading the docs on endorsement policies regarding the policy if one is not specified, the docs say
```
NOTE - the default policy requires one signature from a member of the DEFAULT MSP
```
I can't find any description of what the default MSP is and how a proposal could be signed by this MSP. Anyone point me to some information ?

Hi everyone, peer (endorser/committer) scrum starting in a minute ... (1-888-426-6840 / 33682113)
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:29:21 GMT):<br/>
Murali- i can take some notes for you during the scrum.

ok
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:31:37 GMT):<br/>
The CI- any build breaks?  We have a new CI - building binaries on the fly.. compiling cryptogen.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:31:47 GMT):<br/>
We have one gossip test failing and the behave test failing- https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3550 (Behave tests failures)

We have FAB-3550 opened against @jeffgarratt 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:33:05 GMT):<br/>
end to end CLI should pass and unit test should be passing-- so there is a bug @C0rWin 
</p>

End Game items- where we are reviewing outstanding items on feature board-
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:40:58 GMT):<br/>
2681- this has to be rebased, and people can start reviewing
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:41:36 GMT):<br/>
3236- this is in review and has already been rebased
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:42:05 GMT):<br/>
3291- Murali to follow up with Kostas afterwards
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:43:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:43:41 GMT):<br/>
1309- coding is done, but it's a matter of now where to put it per Dave enyeart
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:44:18 GMT):<br/>
For error handling- 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:45:18 GMT):<br/>
discussion to occur with @cbf @mastersingh24 -- error handling and how do you make use of componetization piece.-- there is question whether we should do or not?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:47:03 GMT):<br/>
For documentation status from @nickgaski - instead of walking through all fabs- here's quick summary  We don't have anything on configuration updates that is missing.. We need some stuff on using cryptogen tool and using the template.  We plan to reshuffle getting started with new images making use of the new configuration that is needed for ordererer block and transactions. We have to really improve the login piece.  We need event listener documentation for SDK as well as demos.  there are JIRA items for all of those items. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:47:36 GMT):<br/>
What Nick did- he added readme the refactored end to end code- We believe @cbf want it ported into getting started. For time being, I do need this merged so they can get end to end work for now.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:48:14 GMT):<br/>
There is marbles documentation- which we think is good sample application for people to see- but we need the maintainers to make a decision having an application with a UI versus CLi in the terminal and would like some help merging @mastersing24
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 13:48:23 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski can you post the #'s

FAB 3678- Elli requesting help for people to look- and comment on fabric-crypto.  This is way we evaluate expiration of certificate and a bug we had and want some extra eyes on it... Keith has reviewed it already.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 14:00:49 GMT):<br/>
Arnaud is suggesting --> We need to document what unit test should be and what unit test should not be.  We should collect best practices and have contributer check list.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=bGfboTnewxfYZKzp3) @weeds it is pretty simple - unit tests should be capable of being run without any external dependency from within the directory in which they reside
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 14:12:49 GMT):<br/>
as for end2end README vs Getting Started - I disagree that we should just merge this. It is confusing to have Getting Started when it is really end2end that is Getting Started and Getting Started is actually for code that is over 2 months old.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 14:34:48 GMT):<br/>
"Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. Unit testing can be done manually but is often automated."

http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/unit-testing
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 14:35:24 GMT):<br/>
key words here are "individually" and "independently"
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 14:36:36 GMT):<br/>
in a go project, one should be capable of running "go test" in the directory in which the code they are working on resides and it should run without any dependencies
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 19:13:51 GMT):<br/>
understand Chris- I don't know why Arnaud felt it needed to be documented and sent to the community
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 19:13:56 GMT):<br/>
@cbf  
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 19:14:06 GMT):<br/>
I'll let you reach out to him-- as it's a pretty standard definition
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 08:36:12 GMT):<br/>
@weeds @cbf: @binhn made the point that people are adding unit tests against private methods and while it increases coverage it will create additional work later on when internals change, instead we should only have unit tests against the public APIs. All I'm saying is that if that's the agreement we need to document or people won't know and will continue doing the same.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 06 May 2017 08:42:17 GMT):<br/>
I think we have a lot of undocumented things like this that we ought to write down so it's easier for people to become contributors

@here We hold a peer scrum Monday, Wednesday, Friday for Hyperledger-Fabric.  The dial in for today at 9:30 EST is 1-888-426-6840  with passcode 33682113.  We review what has passed or failed out of the daily build from CI, the highest priority bugs that must be addressed, CR's that need special attention from maintainers, unit test coverage, and serviceability. Also at the end of the call, developers sometimes talk about additional technical questions that should be addressed to stabilizing release where interlock needs to occur.
</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 13:32:40 GMT):<br/>
Here's the format of the Peer scrum going forward.   I want the keep them as short and focussed taking long discussions off line.  

1) CI Build Status 
    - If there is a failure, we discuss and assign the breaking defect.  This defect will be the top priority for the team until resolved. 

2) Defect status 
   - We will discuss defects with priority=highest and overall backlog by component
   - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10409

3) QA status.  This will be any items from QA not covered already #1 and #2

4) Endgame items. 
    - We will review any outstanding items on the feature board.   This should be priority items in review and waiting to be merged
       - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10404
    - We will review end game items. E.G. serviability
       - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10410
    
5) Documenation status
    - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10406

6) After 1-5, engineers an stay on and discuss any follow up items.

@muralisr @binhn @mastersingh24 @jeffgarratt do you guys know what have changed recently that would break node SDK (and java SDK) e2e set up such that the peers are not able to connect to the orderers any longer?
```peer0.org1.example.com    | 2017-05-08 19:57:57.145 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 390 grpc: addrConn.resetTransport failed to create client transport: connection error: desc = "transport: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority"; Reconnecting to {"orderer.example.com:7050" <nil>}

As suggested/request, I have just created https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3775 to document what we have just discussed on the call...
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 14:11:41 GMT):<br/>
What was discussed is guidance on how to handle JIra, what fields to fill out etc,.. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 14:12:17 GMT):<br/>
We've asked help from maintainers to get those best practices documented to share with new people joining community

So far the progress is very good- we only have 1 more to do -- will talk to Gari to see if we need this item, rest we have CR's . the remaining are 4 and have been in review 4 times over
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 14:22:46 GMT):<br/>
if there are comments on this list- please get with the maintainers  per request of Binh Nguyen
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 14:24:14 GMT):<br/>
Feature board--> Publish artifacts with Maven , working with Linux foundation--- 1678--> Tool... talked with Gari-- need to run it by Varad and Paul... and design... we need to post on e-mail thread to make sure the community knows about it.

System channel is whatever name you want- by default it's test chain id.. we've done a lot of bad things relying on test id chain is existing. The name of it specifically.  Murali is fairly certain that when I use test chain id as proper channel and do things- it does not work.  Maybe it's Murali... And we can take decision if test chain id does not work at all- and maybe we don't need it
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 14:34:21 GMT):<br/>
Ordering system channel is required for orderers- it's not required for peer transactions for legacy sake- nothing but orderer should go through that. if you start peer, create a channel... start a pper and join test chain id- Murali thinks this does not work. I would not expect it to break (per Jason).. and if that's true- than noone using it.  Then I will add a JIRA item--- @muralisr please add the JIRa channel
</p>

`Murali is fairly certain that when I use test chain id as proper channel and do things- it does not work. Maybe it's Murali... ` - right. I have a todo to make sure we understand `testchainid` behavior. It was used when in the pre-channel days as a means to use bootstrap the system and excercise end-2-end without having proper channel implementation

if it continues to work (and its just user error on my part) there is some value in keeping it (and documenting it ). If not there's an opportunity to remove using `testchainid` as a default channel for e2e.

How many peers must a client access to get a proposed transaction endorsed?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 15:57:45 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal this is determined by the endorsement policy of the chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 15:59:59 GMT):<br/>
the current bootstrap mechanism I believe use a N_of policy with 1 of the writers defined in the latest channel config
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 16:00:39 GMT):<br/>
if you wish that to require endorsement by all, then you can specify that during channel config
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 16:01:03 GMT):<br/>
in that case, the number of channel members (MSPs) will determine the number of endrosements you will need I believe
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 16:01:17 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt I understand the endorsement policy, I'm just curious if it is the client's responsibility to seek the required endorsements or does a peer do that on the client's behalf
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 16:01:35 GMT):<br/>
ahhh, that is a @jimthematrix question or perhaps @muralisr 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 16:01:35 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 16:12:13 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal The client would implement the biz requirements (endorsements, etc) using the peer. Fabric would not try to automatically figure out "what endorsements are needed for the this Proposal" ... hope that helps a bit ?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 17:26:35 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal ideally the client should be able to discover this from the instantiated chaincodes, there is a query available for that (and is supported by node and java SDK) but it currently doesn't return the endorsement policy associated with the instantiated chaincode. so at this point the client needs to know for a specific transaction what is the expected endorsement policy (1-of-3, 2-of-2, etc) and decide how many peers to send the proposal to

Is it possible to use more than one orderer for a channel?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:00:36 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix So is it the application's responsibility to seek the endorsements, or does the SDK do this for the application?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:02:48 GMT):<br/>
when you call Chain.sendTransactionProposal(), the SDK send a request to the list of peers in the chain object to solicit endorsements
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:03:16 GMT):<br/>
the peer's endorsements are included in the ProposalResponse objects returned from that function call
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:03:55 GMT):<br/>
which you then use to send to the orderer for consensus and validation/commit by calling Chain.sendTransaction()
</p>

1) CI Build (Ramesh) Green - couple of inconsistent behave tests working on today. Posted on CI channel of Rocket

2) Defects (use 2 widgets)
   - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10409
3669 - Go unit test failure - WIP, failure inconsistent
3320 - No block received from peer - Won't be resolved anytime soon part of bigger issue of network connectivity like 3310. Have to have cloud deployment between network devices between components. Working with Scott and his environment. Not a show stopper
3310 -  gRPC timeout - Want to upgrade gRPC to the next version to see if it works. Will reproduce with current. 
No blockers for Composer

3) QA - 
Nothing further

4) Unit test 
Is it ok to get unit test into Alpha 2 or hold out? We need to continue to work on unit test, but no merging for Alpha 2.

5) Endgame items. 
    - We will review any outstanding items on the feature board.   This should be priority items in review and waiting to be merged
       - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10404
    - We will review end game items. E.G. serviability
       - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10410


6) Documenation 
    - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10406
Nothing at this time. 

Using FAB-3040 for tracking the Alpha 2 status, epics are getting mixed. We need to retitle it. 
Please review Barry's email propose on test.

Elli - helping with fabric-ca testing coverage and with Vlad on HSM. 
Peer needs more coverage. There is a lot of code in the peer package for the cli, so the code has been exercise, just do not have UT to show the coverage. Murali working on server side with SHIM UT and hit on that as well. 

Fab-648 - has been marked as done

Power status - working with Oregon university, all power verification currently disabled.

<p><strong>rliu</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:40:52 GMT):<br/>
We are testing how to put multiple transactions into a block. Following the instruction from @jimthematrix, here is what I did:
1. Modify configtx.yaml at fabric-sdk-node/test/fixtures/channel to set BatchTimeout to 1200s. Copy this file to fabric/sampleconfig. 
2. Use configtxgen tool to generate "channel.tx".
3. Copy "channel.tx" to fabric-sdk-node/test/fixtures/channel.
4. Uncomment the code in fabric-sdk-node/test/integration/e2e/create-channel.js to load channel.tx, i.e. :
// use this when the config comes from the configtx tool
data = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, '../../fixtures/channel/channel.tx'));
....
I'm able to create a new channel. However, after I created two transactions using this new channel within 1 minute, I got 3 blocks. Each block still contains only one transaction. Here are the parameters I changed at configtx.yaml:
BatchTimeout:1200s
BatchSize:
MaxMessageCount: 100
AbsoluteMaxBytes: 99 MB
PreferredMaxBytes: 10 MB

We'd like to test how to put multiple transactions to a block. Could you advice how to make this happen? Thanks!

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 16:53:02 GMT):<br/>
@rliu Check the log for the orderer properties and see what batchsize is
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 16:54:33 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 16:59:01 GMT):<br/>
@rliu also, the first block of any channel should only have 1 TX, as this is controlled by the orderer who puts config_updates into blocks by themselves

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 11:48:13 GMT):<br/>
but turned out it it was not ... its advantages (lesser steps to get something up and running) are outweighed by the disadvantages IMO (hides basic complexity that users have to deal with anyway at some point,   "testchainid" has to be disabled in real deployments, etc)

<p><strong>rangak</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:16:36 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr That's a good idea. Will add that. Thanks.  It is a very coarse algorithm that relies on user relevant events being separated in time and deems clustered lines as belonging to the same "event". It could be much improved with knowledge of how fabric orderers and peers log. Please do feel free to improve it and send pull requests.

@here is it possible to have a policy where we can restrict asset creation to one organization. Another organization can only update asset after a certain state, etc. For example, in car-lease demo - a new car asset can be created only by manufacturer.

I had question on chaincode upgrade. I see we have to follow the install + upgrade pattern for upgrading the user-chaincode for the peer.
1.  If there are any in-flight transaction endorsed using old-version user-chaincode, would they be committed  by the time chaincode is upgraded to a new version?

1.  If there are any in-flight transaction endorsed using old-version user-chaincode, would they be committed  by the time chaincode is upgraded to a new version?

2. I tried upgrading to a new version user-chaincode using E2E Peer CLI for only 1 peer (peer0) and then tried invoking a new transaction on the 2nd peer (who is not yet upgraded - peer1); this fails saying invalid deployment spec. Can you explain - does this upgrade on  peer0 invalidates the deployment spec across that channel/chaincode thus mandating an user-chaincode upgrade?

3. Another case, where Peer0 is installed + running with upgraded chaincode (v2.0) however peer1 is installed with old chaincode (v1.0). Peer CLI is invoked on Peer0 and is set with self-endorsed policy. This will pass the endorsement, shouldn't the peer1 at the committing  time, can reject the block?

4. Is there best practice guide like i see `docker ps` and `docker images` shows the old chaincode running, can i stop the docker container and at the same time remove the image?

1. So upgrade block (assuming this will be a block holding a single upgrade transaction) will act as a marker and decided to reject or accept based on the chaincode-version information that should be available in each transaction.
Second thought - wasn't checking only the read-set version sufficient to accept or reject block transaction (as committer-only-peer will not have user chain-code installed-instantiated). which case resulted to have marker?  
</p>
<p><strong>jiangyaoguo</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 02:43:50 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde  upgrade block may have mutiple txs. commiter will invalid all the other txs which invoke the upgraded cc(no matter old or new version)  to avoid upgrade tx being invalided because of RWset conflict.  every tx has a  field that state the cc version it invokes, commiter will check the version match the latest version of cc qureied from lscc.

Can you acknowledge - do you say upgrade block can have multiple transaction. Do we mean a single block can hold transaction created as part of Invoke call + upgrade config transaction? 

If Yes - Do we say these transaction within this block (containing the upgrade transaction config) will be marked Invalid or not accepted?
If still  - Yes - Is it mandatory to Invalid the transaction which are part of the upgrade block as RW-Version must get independently verified by committing peer (think who is not even the endorser) irrespective of user-chaincode upgrade?

@rahulhegde orderer could receive invoke and upgrade (say from different peers) and put them in the same block and sent for committment.  So Yes to the first question. On the committer side, the Upgrade tx will go through (assuming it succeeds other checks such as endorsement policy) but the invoke transactions for same upgraded chaincode on the block with be marked Invalid. Since all committers on the channel will evaluate the block in the same manner, they all will end up with the same end result - valid upgraded transaction and invalidated invoke transactions that happened to end up on the upgraded transaction's block.

Considering a block of transactins for commitment;  "invoke txs generated from a CC ending up on the same block as a TX for upgrading the CC.."  in that statement, the "invoke txs" will be invalidated and the "upgrade TX" marked valid (provided it passed other tests)

@weeds: Got in touch with the team, in all of these defects the service doesn't look like it's set up right. Pointed the team to the right config settings, asked for reproduction, tagged all of these items with "reproduction-needed".

What unit tests fabs are opened on your components? What needs to be merged and still waiting for maintainers? Are all those crs/fabs address comments from maintainers and rebased if required... and cleaned up any work on dependencies that they may have as well?  Can you list those fabs/CRs int he peer review channel in next few hours so maintainers know what they need to do?

@weeds lehors has indeed made great progress.  I just chatted with him and we agree to assign FAB-4032 to him to drive the fixes into gerrit.  He's still trying to chase down some root cause vs workarounds though.

This line `logger.Infof("Invoke result: %v", proposalResp)`  should not print the payload of the *ProposalResponse* in my opinion. It's just `[]byte` anyway and doesn't give the user any useful information.
On the other hand, if the chaincode invocation creates a large WSet - it just fills up the screen...

<p><strong>hendry19901990</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 22:33:02 GMT):<br/>
is there a document to intro ??
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 23:07:28 GMT):<br/>
@hendry19901990 the alpha2 docs about to be released would be a good place to start ( @nickgaski ...could you help with pointing to the right doc while alpha2 is being published please ?)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 23:09:48 GMT):<br/>
while waiting for @nickgaski ...here's the docs link http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ... not sure how "latest" it is but should help get started
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 23:10:01 GMT):<br/>
hey we are updated now

awesome.  we are planning on publishing some higher level material with a more conceptual introduction into the various components and how they fit together.  However, for now we'll be happy with a stable getting started that leaves you with all your images and artifacts :)

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:54:49 GMT):<br/>
@rmohta check your orderer logs
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:55:09 GMT):<br/>
looks like perhaps an issue with the broadcast of the instantiate TX
</p>
<p><strong>rmohta</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:55:39 GMT):<br/>
When would we get `Error: Got unexpected status: NOT_FOUND`. Installed cc successfully.

<p><strong>rmohta</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:55:52 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=uwF3Nta7H7eedd5JT) @jeffgarratt Checked. No error. 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:55:57 GMT):<br/>
installed and instantiate are 2 different steps
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:56:13 GMT):<br/>
installation does NOT require orderer
</p>
<p><strong>rmohta</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:56:23 GMT):<br/>
right.. for some reason, I can see new docker containers. But I cannot invoke anything on them
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:56:24 GMT):<br/>
instantiate does
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:56:42 GMT):<br/>
guessing the install worked... but instantiate failed
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:56:54 GMT):<br/>
thus not ledger for the peer for that chanincode/channel
</p>
<p><strong>rmohta</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:56:59 GMT):<br/>
But won't the container start only when we instantiate it?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:57:05 GMT):<br/>
install may start it
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:57:18 GMT):<br/>
would need to check with @muralisr to verify
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:57:23 GMT):<br/>
but seems reasonable
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:57:33 GMT):<br/>
as this would prove the install worked
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:57:39 GMT):<br/>
and the chaincode can launch
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:58:10 GMT):<br/>
let me see if I can check real quick
</p>
<p><strong>rmohta</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:58:18 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt  anything specific I should look in my docker compose for broadcast and gossip?
</p>
<p><strong>rmohta</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:58:25 GMT):<br/>
okies. Thank You @jeffgarratt 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 18:59:53 GMT):<br/>
k, install does NOT seem to create the chaincode container
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:00:08 GMT):<br/>
so your instantiate seems to have successfully processed
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:00:34 GMT):<br/>
or perhaps at least partially succeeded
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:00:37 GMT):<br/>
would need the logs
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:00:49 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr may be your best bet at this point

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:04:26 GMT):<br/>
that appears to be from the deliver service in the peer
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:04:46 GMT):<br/>
but it may be the deliver attempting to search on the newly created channel
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:05:06 GMT):<br/>
so perhaps expected, as there may NOT be a block 1
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:05:09 GMT):<br/>
genesis is 0
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:05:20 GMT):<br/>
have you issued a subsequent TX?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:05:28 GMT):<br/>
on that channel?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:05:36 GMT):<br/>
assume the instantiate would be block 1
</p>
<p><strong>rmohta</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:05:45 GMT):<br/>
nope. nothing as of now.  @jeffgarratt

what kind of transaction should be done post join? @jeffgarratt

instantiate
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:06:57 GMT):<br/>
well, if you are the first to join and the channel is new
</p>
<p><strong>rmohta</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:07:55 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt two peers (from different orgs) join the channel. install cc on both the peers. And then instantiate on only one peer for the network. It's the last part which fails.

@rmohta this seems to me like the ordering service is missing the channel the peer is trying to seek

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:10:39 GMT):<br/>
this is definitely a post instantiate attempt issue

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 22 May 2017 19:11:01 GMT):<br/>

@rmohta consortia exist outside of the context of a channel.  Channels are defined with respect to a particular consortium, and must be some sub-set of that definition.

No exactly, apologies for the short description. 

Single peer can receive multiple endorsement request from multiple HFC in the same time instance and hence they will be processed by peer (to user-chaincode) in parallel. I would like to know if there is any identifier that can be logged by user-chaincode thus helping on debugging.

@rmohta slightly inverted to that.  Every channel refers to a consortium.  The members of the channel must either be the members of the consortium or a subset thereof.

Hi guys, I'm trying to setup fabric on a multihost setup, and have 4 orgs, with 2 peers each. I want to instantiate a chaincode (using node-sdk) that has already been installed on all of them. My endorsement policy is that 3 out of 4 admins of the 4 orgs should endorse (I don't fully understand this, but I'll come to that later).

Right now, I'm sending instantiate proposals to all the 8 peers (again, not sure if sending to all 8 is required, but that's not important right now). I get all the 8 endorsements, and this by itself starts the chaincode containers on all the 8 peers. I didn't even send the endorsements to the orderer. Why should this happen?

@muralisr @binhn 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:00:33 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 I would assume that you can not invoke the chaincode though on the endorsers?

<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:00:46 GMT):<br/>
Nope, I can't.

good
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:01:04 GMT):<br/>
you need to submit the instantiate to orderer to complete the process

<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:03:09 GMT):<br/>
Okay, it did so before. Now it's not doing. But the client doesn't hear any event from the peer about the transaction commit.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:03:38 GMT):<br/>
I have the transaction id, can I see if it has been committed?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:03:40 GMT):<br/>
until the TX is committed, the peers will not receive it

@muralisr @dave.enyeart do we expose the ability to get a TX by id? or the block it is in?

@muralisr @dave.enyeart do we expose the ability to get a TX by id? or the block it is in from the peer interface?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:06:43 GMT):<br/>
yes, query system chaincode has these functions:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:06:47 GMT):<br/>
```	GetChainInfo       string = "GetChainInfo"
	GetBlockByNumber   string = "GetBlockByNumber"
	GetBlockByHash     string = "GetBlockByHash"
	GetTransactionByID string = "GetTransactionByID"
	GetBlockByTxID     string = "GetBlockByTxID"```

<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:09:40 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt what will happen if we just instantiate on one peer and send the proposalResponse to orderer? Will all peer deploy the chaincode on a docker container?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:09:44 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 ^^ see above

@Senthil1 I presume they would fail, as they will not be able to perform the function.

<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:11:02 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @dave.enyeart and @jeffgarratt There was a bug in my event-receiving code. 
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:11:11 GMT):<br/>
It got installed.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:11:21 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 awesome!!
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:11:23 GMT):<br/>
Initally I was trying to instantiate on the anchor nodes
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:11:50 GMT):<br/>
you need to `install` chaincode on all peers
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:11:52 GMT):<br/>
But maybe it's required to instantiate on every peer?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:11:56 GMT):<br/>
How do things work?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:12:02 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, we installed on all peers.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:12:03 GMT):<br/>
you only need to `instantiate` once
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:12:12 GMT):<br/>
I see. @thakkarparth007 can you see what happens when we send instantiate to only one peer ?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:12:18 GMT):<br/>
Oh. Let me try that once again, I'm not sure if that was working.
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:12:26 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart that what I thought too.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:12:59 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 you should not be able to as you require 3 of 4 endorsements.
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:13:30 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt we got endorsement for 4 peers and submitted to orderer
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:13:30 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt we got endorsement from 4 peers and submitted to orderer
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:13:41 GMT):<br/>
but the chaincode was started only on those 4 nodes.. 
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:14:02 GMT):<br/>
Yeah
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:14:13 GMT):<br/>
The containers, that is.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:14:31 GMT):<br/>
Can you explain how it's supposed to work in my case?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:14:36 GMT):<br/>
chaincode containers can come and go as they are needed
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:14:36 GMT):<br/>
chaincode containers can come and go, as they are needed by endorsement
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:15:03 GMT):<br/>
you must first install the chaincode on the peers (requires local MSP admin priveldge).
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:15:15 GMT):<br/>
hmm.. make sense.. e2e cli has similar example.. 
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:15:27 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt yeah, chaincodes are installed on all peers. 
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:15:34 GMT):<br/>
My case being 4 orgs, each 2 peers. Endorsement policy: 3 out of 4 admins should endorse.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:15:57 GMT):<br/>
k, then as long as those peers have joined the channel, the instantiate should flow through as expected
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:16:23 GMT):<br/>
and policy met for endorsement, things should be good
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:16:52 GMT):<br/>
So I should instantiate on any 3 out of the 8 peers, is it?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:17:14 GMT):<br/>
as long as that meets the policy, it is up to you
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:17:35 GMT):<br/>
instantiate is only done once for the channel
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:17:52 GMT):<br/>
it puts an entry on the channel's chain
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:18:08 GMT):<br/>
gets replicated to all peers via normal block dissemination
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:18:08 GMT):<br/>
gets replicated to all peers on the channel via normal block dissemination
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:18:27 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 Can you check the following? Do instantiate on only 1 peer (say peer0 in our case) and submit the endorsement to orderer. Then, do an invoke on peer1. As dave says, chaincode container might come and go.. 
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:18:49 GMT):<br/>
Yup, doing that right now
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:23:09 GMT):<br/>
Okay, so here's what happened: I instantiated on one peer, and after some time the chaincode got launched on 2 other peers, but not on anyone else.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:23:50 GMT):<br/>
did you try an endorsment of that new chaincode on peer0?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:23:50 GMT):<br/>
My application that does instantiation waits for 'event' from its peer, and as I told that part is buggy (not sure what's going on there), so it doesn't display any output
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:24:21 GMT):<br/>
Now when I saw a container running on one of the peers (peer1 - which initially didn't have it), I stopped my application.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:24:51 GMT):<br/>
But all it was doing was waiting for the event from the peer, so it couldn't have stopped deploying chaincodes on other peers, could it?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:24:57 GMT):<br/>
I did.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:25:06 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=sXaaic6B54hM6ygPy) @jeffgarratt I did, that is
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:25:11 GMT):<br/>
response?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:25:33 GMT):<br/>
No errors, but didn't hear of any event from peer0 either.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:25:48 GMT):<br/>
And the containers got deployed on 2 other peers,
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:25:53 GMT):<br/>
but not one anyone else.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:25:56 GMT):<br/>
k, then the instantiate appears to have occurred then on peer0?
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:25:58 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 better use our fetch-block tool and inspect the block content.. we can find out more.. 
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:26:15 GMT):<br/>
@Senthil1  I'll do that.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:26:17 GMT):<br/>
you wont see a chaincode container until all three conditions are met: 1) chaincode is installed on the peer 2) chaincode is instantiated on the channel 3) chaincode is invoked on the peer
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:26:26 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt yes
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:26:45 GMT):<br/>
k, then working as expected, except for you lack of event from peer0?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:26:49 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart I didn't invoke the chaincoe on any peer
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:26:59 GMT):<br/>
wait, I just asked that
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:27:36 GMT):<br/>
wen I asked.,.. did you try an endorsment of that new chaincode on peer0?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:27:47 GMT):<br/>
that is asking if you invoked the new chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:27:56 GMT):<br/>
No, I didn't invoke it.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:28:02 GMT):<br/>
ahhh... give that a go
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:28:04 GMT):<br/>
I thought you meant if I instantiated it on peer0
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:28:16 GMT):<br/>
;)
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:28:39 GMT):<br/>
"Error executing chaincode: Error chaincode is being launched: generic-chaincode:1.0"
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:29:10 GMT):<br/>
hmmm.  try once again?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:29:12 GMT):<br/>
But nothing's really happening. The containers got deployed on 2 other peers long back. Others should've caught on by now.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:29:24 GMT):<br/>
k, will see if I can replicate
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:29:30 GMT):<br/>
latest code?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:29:54 GMT):<br/>
meaning, are you running from latest master?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:29:56 GMT):<br/>
or close?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:30:03 GMT):<br/>
I think so.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:30:06 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:31:08 GMT):<br/>
I assume would not have been fixed if this is an issue
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:34:38 GMT):<br/>
k, I am seeing same behavior
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:34:47 GMT):<br/>
The peer emits an event.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:34:53 GMT):<br/>
I confirmed it.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:34:54 GMT):<br/>
wait, I missed one step...
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:35:22 GMT):<br/>
@Senthil1, fetch-block detects the block
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:36:01 GMT):<br/>
This is when instantiating on peer0, though other peers haven't gotten the containers running yet
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:36:19 GMT):<br/>
where is the block json? is it in perfLog dir?
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:37:00 GMT):<br/>
found it..
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:40:41 GMT):<br/>
@Senthil1 @thakkarparth007 k.. I performed similar and it works as expected.  The endorsement takes a bit of extra time on the peer which did NOT endorse the isntantiate.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:40:57 GMT):<br/>
but appears to work as advertised
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:41:13 GMT):<br/>
:/ hmm.
</p>
<p><strong>Senthil1</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:41:23 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:29:23 GMT):<br/>
Hey, I can help with that @rmohta 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:30:48 GMT):<br/>
how are you running your environment, first of all?
</p>
<p><strong>rmohta</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:31:29 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti  Didn't get your question? Do you mean how I have started my peer? or how my docker-compose file is?
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:32:50 GMT):<br/>
are you just running the e2e_cli setup, alpha2 images, or something else? trying to get a sense for whether you need to override with environment variables or if you have access to sampleconfig/core.yaml to change the setting
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:34:11 GMT):<br/>
if you look at core.yaml: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/core.yaml at line 341, you'll see the logging section for the chaincode container and explanation of the currently available options
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:35:38 GMT):<br/>
depending on your environment, you can change the values there or by passing in the CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL and CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_SHIM variables for whichever one you need to modify
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:38:52 GMT):<br/>
if you've defined your own logger in your chaincode, you'll want to set CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug. otherwise, you can set CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_SHIM=debug or just set both to debug to ensure you get all logging levels in your environment

Hello All, could you please help me to know how to create new peers dynamically for any organization.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 28 May 2017 14:04:55 GMT):<br/>
you need to generate the content of the MSP folder
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 28 May 2017 14:05:10 GMT):<br/>
and assign an ip address / hostname for the peer
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 02:50:09 GMT):<br/>
Base on the checking of the existing code, we believe there's no usage of the peer.workers config in core.yaml
So will plan to remove this config.
Pls let me know if there's any purpose to keep it.
Thanks!

I wonder whether there's a config parameter to make a peer as endorser or committer? It seems there's no such config in core.yaml, but it's in dockefile https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/base/peer-base.yaml#L19

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:11:04 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr what's the intended workflow for testing chaincode in dev mode? i've tried the following:
- build chaincode locally
- start the peer docker with --peer-chaincodedev=true
- run chaincode with the following command:
```
CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=$PEERDIR/cacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem CORE_PEER_TLS_SERVERHOSTOVERRIDE=peer0.org1.example.com CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=end2endnodesdk ./example_cc --peer.address=localhost:7051
```
- the above process successfully registered with the peer: 
```
registered handler complete for chaincode end2endnodesdk
```
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:11:49 GMT):<br/>
now i assume we don't need to install, do we still need to instantiate for a channel? or invoke directly?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:13:38 GMT):<br/>
when I tried to instantiate:
```
Error: cannot get package for the chaincode to be instantiated (end2endnodesdk:v0)-cannot retrieve package for chaincode end2endnodesdk/v0, error open /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/end2endnodesdk.v0: no such file or directory
```
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:13:47 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix we do need to install unfortunately
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:13:56 GMT):<br/>
just to make LSCC happy
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:14:05 GMT):<br/>
the install itself wont be used
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:14:06 GMT):<br/>
oh, did not expect that
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:14:12 GMT):<br/>
yeah :-(
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:14:27 GMT):<br/>
but i see why this is needed as temporary workaround
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:14:31 GMT):<br/>
will try that
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:14:45 GMT):<br/>
don't have a switch in the lscc to say "don't look for package..you are in dev mode"
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:15:30 GMT):<br/>
one more thing
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:16:05 GMT):<br/>
I think you need the version also ..like `CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=end2endnodesdk:<version>`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:16:24 GMT):<br/>
in your case `CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=end2endnodesdk:v0`
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:23:51 GMT):<br/>
ah, good catch, was just wondering about that, getting this:
```
[chaincode] Launch -> ERRO 392 sending init failed(handler not found for chaincode end2endnodesdk:v0)
```
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:24:04 GMT):<br/>
will try adding the version to the registered name
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:25:11 GMT):<br/>
works better now!
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 30 May 2017 16:25:14 GMT):<br/>

I have a set up with a few peers, and while experimenting I found out that the number of times their blockfiles were modified was different for each peer. None of my peers had disconnected during the experiment, so it couldn't be due to the gossip data-retrieval. I don't understand why this should happen.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 16:36:05 GMT):<br/>
Can anyone explain?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 16:37:03 GMT):<br/>
I used inotify to monitor the blockfiles, in case that's relevant.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 16:37:36 GMT):<br/>
I'd been under the impression that the blockfile would be modified every time a new block needs to be added
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 16:38:07 GMT):<br/>
Or is this simply due to buffering of the 'write' calls?

i am not sure why, `peer cli` commands work so i guess peer-tls certs are good, and also for `peer channel create` the orderer does not complain

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 14:52:58 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix there were recent bug fixes based to what was returned. Let me check
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 14:53:38 GMT):<br/>
so to recreate, try to install twice and look at the second error ?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 14:55:30 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 14:58:00 GMT):<br/>
from what I've seen, the ProposalResponse.Response has the right status code (500), but the HTTP response status was 200
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:19:21 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:19:52 GMT):<br/>
long story short... previously we were reporting all chaincode errors as fabric errors
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:19:59 GMT):<br/>
and suppressing chaincode responses
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:20:28 GMT):<br/>
this was fixed in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9213/
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:21:28 GMT):<br/>
which basically says "if chaincode returns a response and is > ERROR_THRESHOLD don't endorse it but return the response directly"
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:23:32 GMT):<br/>
the problem was that if we returned error from the fabric users (and SDK) won't be able to tell if there was some non-chaincode related issue as well
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:24:04 GMT):<br/>
would it be better to return a HTTP response 500 with the special message "chaincode error" ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:24:14 GMT):<br/>
so you don't have to change code ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:41:31 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix ^^ updated the JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:41:39 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 15:42:11 GMT):<br/>
to @wlahti credit, he did raise the question when he fixed the bug.... 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 19:08:37 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr thanks for the response, I added my comments, using http status code 500 to indicate errors in chaincode (ProposalResponse.Response.status >= 400) makes sense to me.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 19:08:37 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr thanks for the response, I added my comments, using http status code to reflect errors in chaincode makes sense to me. I don't think always using 500 when the chaincode returns an error (>=400) is right. 500 is defined as "the server acted in unexpected ways", or "internal server errors", and it's typically not the client's fault. I don't think all chaincode error statuses can be characterized this way. for instance, if the chaincode checks the Creator field and applies access control, and returns 403, I would think an HTTP code of 403 is more appropriate than 500
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 19:31:05 GMT):<br/>
so your https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10135 (reflecting chaincode's status in http status code) as-is looks right to me
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 19:31:21 GMT):<br/>
+2'ed
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 04 Jun 2017 19:57:33 GMT):<br/>
we should definitely use the code range to direct error processing on client @jimthematrix

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:48:05 GMT):<br/>
@Rachitga the involved code sections are in core/endorser/endorser.go - in particular "simulateProposal" and "endorseProposal" where endorseProposal calls the ESCC system chaincode in core/scc/escc/endorser_onevalidsignature.go ... btw, endorser_onevalidsignature.go is a misleading name.. it should really just be escc.go
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:49:56 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 orderer pushes (or in orderer-speak, "delivers") blocks to the committer
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:50:55 GMT):<br/>
So is the orderer aware of the positions (#blocks) of different clients?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 11:52:32 GMT):<br/>
Or does it ask the client from which block it must deliver to the client?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 13:38:55 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 it is a mix of messages between the peer and the orderer through a stream.  The peer sends a seek request to the orderer and the orderere sends the requested blocks back
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 13:40:48 GMT):<br/>
Okay, so can you help me understand this - I'm trying to measure the performance of fabric components, and during one the runs, I found that the Ledger was not acquiring a write-lock in order to commit often. Could this be because the orderer is slow, or because the peer is too busy to pull?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 13:42:14 GMT):<br/>
Disk activity of orderer shows that it doesn't do much in that particular period, and hence I think that the orderer is the one causing trouble, but I'm not fully sure.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 13:43:48 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 I would run the orderer in 'solo' mode to reduce the latency of orderer to minimum
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 13:44:27 GMT):<br/>
Hmm. Right, I'll try that out. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 13:45:21 GMT):<br/>
yw!
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 13:47:08 GMT):<br/>
To do so, is it enough to set the `CONFIGTX_ORDERER_ORDERERTYPE` env-variable to 'solo'?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 13:57:14 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 check the log of your orderer, it will log the genesis type
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 13:57:19 GMT):<br/>
it may already be solo
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 13:57:46 GMT):<br/>
the default for most example scenarios is solo
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:02:08 GMT):<br/>
No, it was setup with kafka in our setup, but I hadn't set it up. I can't contact the people who set it up, that's why I asked here :P
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:02:50 GMT):<br/>
I see a script that starts the orderer and one of the environment variables that is passed to it is `CONFIGTX_ORDERER_ORDERERTYPE=kafka`. 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:29:48 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 that is for generating the appropriate genesis block for the orderer.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 14:30:41 GMT):<br/>
Oh okay then. I'll just wait for them then. Thank you!

Thanks for the reply @muralisr , so I went through the files you mentioned, so what I understand is that the escc.go just signs the proposal back, it doesn't read the fields of the proposal, all those checks happen in endorser.go. Simulate proposal in endorser.go is where the simulation is called, so how does the simulation go through? Which system chaincodes are involved there, how does it read the ledger on the peer that has been stored uptil now? Can you clear if I have understood correctly, and the aspects that I am missing.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 11:51:52 GMT):<br/>
@Rachitga simulate proposal calls the chaincode in the Proposal request. On successful execution, the results are collected and send to escc to create a proposal response and sign it.

@mastersingh24 I have been looking at the `Wireshark` trace of the grpc `keepalive` and I see only 3 blocks of TCP activity to the peer from the NodeApp exactly on the defined keepalive_time and then no more activity. Have you seen this, is this normal ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 18:46:44 GMT):<br/>

@here hi, i have problem with `GetState` in chaincode. i changed to use kafka ordering. the `batchSize` and `batchTimeout` are set as default, i.e. 5 and 2s. in the cli command script, sleep 5 is done after register 5 entities (5 invocation finished). but `GetState` always return nil, nil even though adding sleep 10 before querying. so my question is why `GetState` fails as the ordering block commit condition meeted (both batch timeout and count)?

what is the behavior of a (endorser/commiter) peer node when couch db fails or is brought down? does the peer return any error messages in response to endorsement requests or during validation/commit phase? ideally the peer can be marked unavailable and request routed to healthy peer in this scenario. Are there other approaches to detect such a scenario and route to healthy peer and to restore the routing to the peer when its underlying couchdb database becomes available?

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:41:20 GMT):<br/>
@s.narayanan I did a quick test, and it appears you get a timeout from a client.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:41:47 GMT):<br/>
the logs of the peer indicated the loss of conn to couchdb, and the attempts to reconnect.
</p>
<p><strong>s.narayanan</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:53:54 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt  is the timeout observed during endorsement or validation/commit?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:03:23 GMT):<br/>
@s.narayanan In my test I killed couchdb just prior to endorsement attempt, so I did not get a response for which I could create a TX (so just during endorsement)
</p>
<p><strong>s.narayanan</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:10:02 GMT):<br/>
@jefg
</p>
<p><strong>s.narayanan</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:13:29 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt thanks. If the client receives an error during endorsement (due to couchdb being down), then client can retry (presumably send request to another endorser node ). However,  I would like to understand what occurs during validation. I assume the peer cannot commit to the world state.  Until the couchdb is brough back up, the peer will remain unavailable (i.e. it cannot sync its ledger state) and then once the couchdb is restored, the peer can begin delivering blocks from orderer to catch up? 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:15:16 GMT):<br/>
@s.narayanan I would presume there are a several ways the client could recover once the ledger store has recovered.  @muralisr or @yacovm may be able to answer more definitively wrt to mechanisms emploed.

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:16:19 GMT):<br/>
in general this should not be dissimilar from a standard start up of a peer that is behind
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:16:30 GMT):<br/>
Validation is only a logical process (checking endorsement policy, validation of certificates of endorsements, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:39:15 GMT):<br/>
@s.narayanan `validation failed` is broad. Softer failures are invalid state changes, endorsement that does not meet policy etc. The scenario you have cited (couchdb down) is a hard failure.  In that case admin likely has to get involved, restore couch db and get the peer back up again. At that point regular mechanism of "catching up" ( @yacovm may help here ?) will take over

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:41:10 GMT):<br/>
basically if the DB is in a consistent state then the peer should be able to catch up via other peers or directly from the ordering service

Another question: Do endorsing peers asynchronously handle endorsements, in other words can an endorsing peer be simultaneously endorsing multiple requests?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:47:31 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal they can endorse in parallel, but the actual endorsement request from the client side is synch.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:48:22 GMT):<br/>
So endorsement request is synch, but proposal request is asynch?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:48:43 GMT):<br/>
not sure what a proposal request is
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:49:46 GMT):<br/>
```service Endorser {
	rpc ProcessProposal(SignedProposal) returns (ProposalResponse) {}
}

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:50:38 GMT):<br/>
that is the API, the request will block until the peer responds.  However, you can always invoke with asynchronous mechanisms.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:50:43 GMT):<br/>
And smart contract containers handle requests in parallel or serially?   Just trying to understand the level of parallelism
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:50:49 GMT):<br/>
and the peer can handle these requests in parallel
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:51:10 GMT):<br/>
and I also believe they are parallel against the chaincode

<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 18:43:36 GMT):<br/>
Or if I create a temp file in the vscc code, would it be created inside the docker container running that chaincode?

Nevermind, found a way using http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Setup/logging-control.html

@binhn Is there documentation yet on the leader/anchor roles for peers?
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 21:58:44 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal peer leader is a yaml config, so take a look at core.yaml in the sampleconfig directory;  anchor is a config tx info described in the configtx.rst doc
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 22:10:25 GMT):<br/>
@binhn I guess I meant in terms of the specifics of their roles.  I've been able to glean some of that from various places, but certainly the 1.0 architecture description in the documentation doesn't reflect it as far as I can tell
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 22:21:03 GMT):<br/>
they are not architectural topic but more on implementation -- specific configuration for connectivity 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 22:21:49 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps, although I generally like to define architecture as behavior that is held constant over time/releases.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 22:23:07 GMT):<br/>
For example the architecture document says the ordering service delivers the blocks to the peers, yet my understanding of the code is that in fact it is the leader peers that pull the blocks.  I think push vs pull is an architecture, not design issue.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 01:49:29 GMT):<br/>
What statistics if any are maintained by the peer/endorser/committer/orderer and how they accessed?

Hi all. 
When a peer is switched on TLS that means that all of the docker containers of the chaincode need to be re-built, in order to "pick up" the TLS configuration and possibly the certificates, no?
 @muralisr @binhn @greg.haskins  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 15:44:53 GMT):<br/>
If that is true - I wonder if that is documented somewhere? 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 15:58:52 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm that's correct
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 15:58:58 GMT):<br/>
and is not doced
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 15:59:38 GMT):<br/>
in fact currently the simplest way woud be to manually rmi the image
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:03:46 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm @muralisr this also recently manifested with the removal of the config sections for orderer, which required a make clean to clear the config tars
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:06:07 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I know the solution, I'm asking because I guess the average end user doesn't ;)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:08:32 GMT):<br/>
wait a sec, for TLS this should not be an issue
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:08:32 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm @muralisr  wait a sec, for TLS this should not be an issue
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:08:59 GMT):<br/>
the TLS settings are overridden at launch time with ENV vars
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:09:13 GMT):<br/>
so image rebuilds would be unnecessary in this case
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:09:50 GMT):<br/>
the orderer issue was different in that the config was not overridden but rather deprecated
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:10:17 GMT):<br/>
so I think it is not true that you have to rebuild images if TLS turned on
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:11:06 GMT):<br/>
this is predicated of course on referencing the certs through volumes and supplying the proper ENV var value to point to said volume
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:13:22 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the correction @jeffgarratt , @muralisr is that true? ^
But this also means that the chaincode needs to be relaunched, no?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:13:49 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm yes, you would need to relaunch the entire system
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:14:09 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt @yacovm the cert is packaged with the image I;m pretty sure
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:14:50 GMT):<br/>
as long as the certs are available, should be good to go

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:15:14 GMT):<br/>
good deal!!
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:15:21 GMT):<br/>
only enabling or disabling is "container time"
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:15:47 GMT):<br/>
and by default chaincodes exit on peer exit (which would be required to enable TLS)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:16:08 GMT):<br/>
and would relaunch when required (with the new TLS settings of the peer)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:16:56 GMT):<br/>
right. but would require the old image to be deleted so the new one could be regen with the new cert (if the change was new TLS certs)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:16:58 GMT):<br/>
the benefits of the client based nature of chaincodes wrt to peer
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:17:30 GMT):<br/>
correct, if you change certs, then all bets off
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:17:53 GMT):<br/>
wait, but how are the env vars passed to the container?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:17:58 GMT):<br/>
at launch?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:18:13 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:24:44 GMT):<br/>
Where in the code? `StartContainer` has `nil` for the `cfg *docker.HostConfig` 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:25:01 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr  or @jeffgarratt  can you shed some light?

Hello All, I was trying to read the propose transaction fields in the /core/endorser/endorser.go file, I could read all the fields, but what I found was that I was always ending up with nil in my data structure in the unmarshalled payload structure (unprop), and if I print the unmarshaled proposal(uprop) the ouptput file size increases to 86 MB. What could be the possible reasons for it, and am I making a mistake in reading my data?

Am using SampleSingleMSPSolo profile for orderer defined in /sampleconfig/configtx.yaml
and am using SampleSingleMSPChannel to create the transaction for the channel, and am running the marbles02 example

Here I indicate the piece of code that I am trying to print ( In /core/endorser/endorser.go)

'inline_code'
// ProcessProposal process the Proposal
func (e *Endorser) ProcessProposal(ctx context.Context, signedProp *pb.SignedProposal) (*pb.ProposalResponse, error) {
	// at first, we check whether the message is valid
	prop, hdr, hdrExt, err := validation.ValidateProposalMessage(signedProp)
	....
	....
	....

	// TODO: if the proposal has an extension, it will be of type ChaincodeAction;
	//       if it's present it means that no simulation is to be performed because
	//       we're trying to emulate a submitting peer. On the other hand, we need
	//       to validate the supplied action before endorsing it

	//1 -- simulate

        //Lines added by me
	marshalprop,err := putils.Marshal(prop)
	uprop,err := putils.GetProposal(marshalprop) 

	if err == nil {
		fmt.Printf("Unmarshaled proposal is\n\n%#v\n\n",uprop)
	}

	unprop, err := putils.UnmarshalPayload(prop.Payload)
	if err == nil {
		fmt.Printf("Payload is: \n%#v\n",unprop)
	}

       //Addition finished
	....
	....
	....
}
'inline_code'

A huge structure is printed in bytes where unmarshaled proposal is supposed to be there, and where unmarshaled payload is supposed to be, this gets printed:-
Payload is:
&common.Payload{Header:(*common.Header)(0xc4213d9e90), Data:[]uint8(nil)}

Can somebody explain the observations and how to get what I am looking for?

I am running on hyperledger beta fabric images and my chaincode instantiation fails, this used to pass on Alpha3 (19th May Images). Our chaincode refers to another package and seems there is something changed the way Peer CLI instantiates the chaincode.

@muralisr @rahulhegde @greg.haskins :

1) Rahul is correct - basically the packaging does not include the import itself but rather just the dependency - which is a bit odd - but that is what Rahul's fix above does

2) Greg - did you specifically NOT WANT to support vendoring or were you trying to avoid the need to do it by doing it under the covers?  (basically the packaging code today does not account for code already vendored)

I ran some tests and vendored code is not being picked up
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:12:26 GMT):<br/>
the intent was as follows
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:13:01 GMT):<br/>
given a package A, we would package up A, A/vendor, and any of A's deps (direct or transitive) _excluding_ the shim

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:13:09 GMT):<br/>
if that is not what is happening, its a bug
</p>

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:13:53 GMT):<br/>
I think @rahulhegde has the right fix but need to double check
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:14:13 GMT):<br/>
i need to review the whole function to understand what he is proposing
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:14:49 GMT):<br/>
The problem is that the code will not include imports which don't have dependencies or aren't a dependency
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:15:18 GMT):<br/>
what does it mean to be an import but not a dep?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:15:18 GMT):<br/>
Or basically top level dependencies (e.g. the imports) are not being considered
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:15:22 GMT):<br/>
that is what is confusing me
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:15:41 GMT):<br/>
ah, so basically we pick up transitives but not directs
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:15:42 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:15:56 GMT):<br/>
I would buy that...let me review
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:17:12 GMT):<br/>
correct - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/platforms/golang/platform.go#L246
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:17:37 GMT):<br/>
I think we need to add the direct import as a dep in the map
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:18:05 GMT):<br/>
ah, yeah, plain as day now that i see the whole thing
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:18:12 GMT):<br/>
I meant to merge imports -> deps
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:18:28 GMT):<br/>
which is effectively what @rahulhegde 's patch does
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:18:47 GMT):<br/>
I agree this is a suitable fix
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:19:16 GMT):<br/>
only general comment would be: should be commented, and ideally a test which captures my screw up
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:19:32 GMT):<br/>
I can do this if @rahulhegde is not willing

@mastersingh24 You also mentioned something about problems with vendored libs?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:22:27 GMT):<br/>
same problem
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:22:30 GMT):<br/>
or was that a false start on this problem
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:22:31 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:22:32 GMT):<br/>
fixes both
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:22:45 GMT):<br/>
ok...what was the problem with vendor?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:23:02 GMT):<br/>
it was a side affect
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:23:03 GMT):<br/>
(I mean, aside from the fact that I was failing to include _imports_ in the vendor folder
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:23:21 GMT):<br/>
^^^ right
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:23:27 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:25:21 GMT):<br/>
just tested an external package with / without vendoring (using the fix above) and all is good
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:30:07 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 16:02:52 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins one thing... the CLI `peer chaincode install` will make sure the external dependencies are vendored and packaged correctly but its currently up to the user to get all the dependencies in the env so the chaincode builds fine (`go build`) in the first place.  I remember you wanted to do the equivalent of "go get" as part of the `peer chaincode install` in future but its not there currently. Correct ?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 16:15:01 GMT):<br/>
that is correct
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 16:15:31 GMT):<br/>
the assumption is that your "peer chaincode install" has the same demands on your GOPATH as "go build" would
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 16:15:57 GMT):<br/>
we could automate this, but we decided it was better to let the user manage
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 16:23:28 GMT):<br/>

Hi everyone, we're currently trying to setup a network between 3 different servers. We managed to create and join channels and installed some chaincode. However we get a timeout when we try to instantiate the chaincode. Does anyone know what could've caused this error?

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 11:52:52 GMT):<br/>
@tomveugelers my guess would be the chaincode couldnt startup
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 11:55:43 GMT):<br/>
if you add CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true  and CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug env vars to the peer you might get more information from the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>tomveugelers</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 12:03:50 GMT):<br/>
Thanks! We'll try that now
</p>
<p><strong>tomveugelers</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 12:34:39 GMT):<br/>
We stopped the peer, added the env vars into the compose-defaults. We restarted the peer, succesfully installed the chaincode example 02 and joined the channel. After that we tried to instantiate the installed chaincode and we get the following error message:

2017/06/14 12:25:52 grpc: addrConn.resetTransport failed to create client transport: connection error: desc = "transport: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of \"x509: ECDSA verification failure\" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate \"serverhostname\")"; Reconnecting to {"peer0.serverhostname:7051" <nil>}

@tomveugelers `After these error messages the peer exits.` ... you mean the chaincode exits right ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 14 Jun 2017 12:46:55 GMT):<br/>
looks like an TLS issue

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:15:08 GMT):<br/>
@ryokawajp you could actually supply the certificate of the signer for the peer as that Identity
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:15:15 GMT):<br/>
then require that single signature
</p>
<p><strong>ryokawajp</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:16:59 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt thank you. Let me learn more on the endorsement policy specification. Do you mean that not only the role of the peers (member/admin) but also identities can be specified in an endorsement policy?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:17:08 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:17:28 GMT):<br/>
```message MSPPrincipal {

    enum Classification {
        ROLE = 0;  // Represents the one of the dedicated MSP roles, the
        // one of a member of MSP network, and the one of an
        // administrator of an MSP network
        ORGANIZATION_UNIT = 1; // Denotes a finer grained (affiliation-based)
        // groupping of entities, per MSP affiliation
        // E.g., this can well be represented by an MSP's
        // Organization unit
        IDENTITY  = 2;    // Denotes a principal that consists of a single
        // identity
    }
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:17:45 GMT):<br/>
ROLE is most often used.... but Identity is also an option
</p>
<p><strong>ryokawajp</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:20:06 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt Ah, the certificate of the signer ...  Is there any example? I still do not understand how to specify a certificate. By PEM format? or path of the file? 
</p>
<p><strong>ryokawajp</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:20:13 GMT):<br/>
Let me check the source code ...
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:20:34 GMT):<br/>
Not sure how well the CLI supports this at the moment... I work with the protobuf structures myself
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:21:36 GMT):<br/>
the protobuf simply has this field which should be the PEM bytes I believe
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:22:02 GMT):<br/>
jp meaning Japan?
</p>
<p><strong>ryokawajp</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:22:50 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt I see. Thank you for the info. The document in readthedoc site says that the support for ORGANIZATION_UNIT is in the future plan. 
</p>
<p><strong>ryokawajp</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:23:02 GMT):<br/>
yes!
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:23:37 GMT):<br/>
@ryokawajp correct... but IDENTITY and ROLE are there now.  It is late for me :)  But @muralisr should be able to help in the AM our time (US Eastern)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:24:00 GMT):<br/>
and I will be on a bit later than normal tomorrow as my main  computer crashed 
</p>

we will give you an answer then... just feel free to ping back any time
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:24:54 GMT):<br/>
but know technically this is feasible
</p>
<p><strong>ryokawajp</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 03:25:46 GMT):<br/>

Up to now, it seems that CLI supports ROLE only in the current version. I suppose this is the code which parses the command line. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/common/cauthdsl/policyparser.go
</p>
<p><strong>ryokawajp</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:25:52 GMT):<br/>
While, fabric-sdk-node seems to have some classes which corresponds to IDENTITY. But I am still not sure how to use it. I will continue the study.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/fabric-client/lib/Policy.js

How can we determine if a transaction is Valid or Invalid in  a block ?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:48:45 GMT):<br/>
@Ratnakar the metadata entry in the block contains one entry for Tx validation information.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:48:48 GMT):<br/>
```// This enum enlists indexes of the block metadata array
enum BlockMetadataIndex {
    SIGNATURES = 0;             // Block metadata array position for block signatures
    LAST_CONFIG = 1;            // Block metadata array position to store last configuration block sequence number
    TRANSACTIONS_FILTER = 2;    // Block metadata array position to store serialized bit array filter of invalid transactions
    ORDERER = 3;                // Block metadata array position to store operational metadata for orderers
                                // e.g. For Kafka, this is where we store the last offset written to the local ledger.
}

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:49:02 GMT):<br/>
index 2 contains the Transaction Filter information
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:49:24 GMT):<br/>

</p>

also take a peek at examples/events/block-listener/block-listener.go @Ratnakar ...although event based, it shows how to check for tx validity

Hi, we're trying to set up our own Fabric beta network. Everything seems fine until we try to join a channel:

_Error: proposal failed (err: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = chaincode error (status: 500, message: "JoinChain" request failed authorization check for channel [torchplatformchannel]: [Failed verifying that proposal's creator satisfies local MSP principal during channelless check policy with policy [Admins]: [This identity is not an admin]]))_

Even though we set the CORE_MSPCONFIGPATH to the admin users' msp and channel creation succeeds. Has anyone seen this before?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 19 Jun 2017 13:49:23 GMT):<br/>
@arner you will need to join using a cert that is located under the admincerts folder of the MSP config folder.
</p>
<p><strong>arner</strong> (Mon, 19 Jun 2017 13:53:43 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt we're using `crypto-config/peerOrganizations/example.com/users/Admin@example.com/msp` as CORE_MSPCONFIGPATH. Are you saying we need to somehow use `crypto-config/peerOrganizations/example.com/msp/admincerts`?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 19 Jun 2017 13:54:47 GMT):<br/>
@arner no, you need to join the channel using a privatekey/cert combination in which that cert is in the admincerts folder of the msp config folder
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 19 Jun 2017 13:55:12 GMT):<br/>
thus that identity has admin rights on the peer
</p>
<p><strong>arner</strong> (Mon, 19 Jun 2017 13:59:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm using the cli to connect to a peer. As far as I know I need to set the identity using `CORE_MSPCONFIGPATH=crypto-config/peerOrganizations/example.com/users/Admin@example.com/msp`. Or should it be `CORE_MSPCONFIGPATH=crypto-config/peerOrganizations/example.com/msp/` and will it find it by itself?

hi @arner I have to take care of somethings but will respond as soon as I can...  but I think @jeffgarratt is right ... one suggestion the docker-compose files under examples/e2e_cli give all the ENV variables and examples/e2e_cli/scripts/script.sh gives the way to override them for specific command (such as join)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 19 Jun 2017 15:16:54 GMT):<br/>
between the two hopefully you'll find the right settings to get this to work

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 19 Jun 2017 16:10:28 GMT):<br/>
@arner make sure you are setting CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=....
</p>
<p><strong>arner</strong> (Mon, 19 Jun 2017 16:34:43 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt I mean is the peer or something else relying on the use of `/etc/hyperledger/` or are we free to use any path?

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Mon, 19 Jun 2017 16:35:56 GMT):<br/>
how are you running?  If you are using e2e or behave the paths are determined based upon volume configuration for docker

are you setting up your own environment, then you are free to use whatever paths you wish

not sure if this helps we mounted keystore and signcerts from org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/msp/signcerts under Peer0 in Org2 in docker-compose-e2e.yaml to make Peer0 as admin

Are endorsement policies applied organization-wise or peer-wise?

Thanks,

As per the page, the endorsement policies look like ...  'Org1.member', 'Org2.member', 'Org3.member', etc. 
Could it be like 'Org1.Peer1.member', 'Org1.Peer2.member', 'Org2.Peer0.member', etc

hi all, must all the fabric docker containers set the environment variable `FABRIC_CFG_PATH`?
</p>
<p><strong>arner</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 09:34:08 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=wvF98YtpEHkoufaSh) @bh4rtp You just need to set it when using configtxgen (http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 09:38:02 GMT):<br/>
@arner i found the container must be set too, otherwise it will report an error: `Fatal error when initializing core config : Error when reading core config file: Unsupported Config Type ""`
</p>
<p><strong>arner</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 09:39:33 GMT):<br/>
@bh4rtp which type of container is this? 
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 09:40:45 GMT):<br/>
@arner hyperledger/fabric-tools, peer, orderer, and found that it must be set to be `FABRIC_CFG_PATH=/etc/hyperledger/fabric`
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 09:43:31 GMT):<br/>
because i want to deploy fabric network on multiple hosts. when exporting the docker images onto host2, the env variables will all disappear. and the 'FABRIC_CFG_PATH` must be manually set.
</p>
<p><strong>arner</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 09:44:21 GMT):<br/>
@bh4rtp, ok, interesting, I think in my project we don't set them and also don't run into errors. Is anyone else seeing this?
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 09:48:49 GMT):<br/>
if use the pulled images online, it will be ok. because i use `docker run -d hyperledger/fabric-tools` and `docker export CONTAINER_ID > fabric-tool.tar` on host1. and then copy fabric-tools.tar onto host2, import the image. the environment variables are lost. you can use `docker inspect IMAGE_ID` to see every image has the FABRIC_CFG_PATH set.

@mastersingh24 yes, that is my understanding too. but the instantiated docker containers cannot find any chaincode inside, even without go environment.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 10:27:37 GMT):<br/>

@mastersingh24 in `/var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes` of the peer node, there is a `chaincode_example02.1.0` file which is created at `peer chaincode install`. but this file is not golang source file. so is it encrypted or compiled?

Hi all, I'm trying to ascertain the current status and future plans for endorsement policies.  As far as I can tell, the endorsement policy is as described here: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endorsement-policies.html -- Apropos "future enhancements", I would like to see the ability for a chaincode instantiator to also specify chaincode (would this be ESCC?) that defines the endorsement policy, as I want total control over that aspect.  Is that planned?  I haven't found any Jira tickets specifically talking about that.

In V0.6, I was able to create a simple client application to make REST calls for invoke/query chaincode APIs.

In v1.0, as REST calls are not supported, instead Node SDK (gRPC) has come into picture, and it seems difficult to write test application to make gRPC calls.

Another point is ... same v1.0 blockchain application, which is easily tested with CLI, cannot be directly tested with Node SDK since the application folders need to be re-structured to support Node SDK. 

*It seems, that writing chaincode application is simpler than writing its test application*

Please let me know if someone has a simple step-by-step guideline/checklist that could help while converting v0.6 test application (REST calls) into v1.0 test application (Node SDK gRPC)

Thanks.

I am pretty sure there is logic to assure the same singature can not be used twice, thus this should require 2 sigs from the org.

You may also craft policies to be more specific, requiring particular certificates, or a particular OU for the certificate

Hello all,

I had doubts about the consistency checks in the various endorsements during the validation phase in the committing peers. How do these peers perform the consistency check among all endorsements? Do they check if all simulation results are same in all endorsements(if that was the case then even one malicious endorser could lead to no transaction being committed), do they pick the majority among the simulation result as the one that should be picked (if that was the case then say a policy that said that four out of ten endorsers should sign it, would not get passed if say four of them were correct and six were malicious), so is it then policy dependent but then each policy can be different how does it deal with ties (if there was a policy that four out of the ten endorsers should sign it, and lets say there are five with one simulation result blob, five with the other simulation result blob), how does it pick then? 

Can you please point to the piece of code where the committing peer checks this?

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 13:29:23 GMT):<br/>
@Rachitga as long as you get the number of endorsements with the same response that meets the endorsement policy it is sufficient.  I am not sure if you are really concerned with consistency vs correctness.  You get consistency guarantees wrt to the aforementioned process, but this does not of course guarantee correctness.  And yes your system could be effectively halted by a required endorsement returning variant responses, depending on your policy.  It is for this reason the N of support exist, to allow for progress in the face of inconsistent results.  Selection of the endorsements to choose is up to the requestor.  I believe there is also a majority option wrt to policy that will account for membership changes.
</p>
<p><strong>Rachitga</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 19:08:26 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt , thanks for your answer, so as long as the policy is satisfied then we can pick any one from the ties and it will be consistent. But we might not be sure of the correctness, so if a policy say 4 of support exists, and four malicious endorsing peers collude then they can prevent the correct endorsement from being chosen as ties are not dealt with. Am I correct in my understanding?

I found the code that i was looking for in the vscc system chaincode from where i found the file fabric/common/cauthdsl/cauthdsl.go , this is where a policy evaluation function is generated which takes all the endorsements as arguments and checks their consistency as well as the requirements with respect to the policy.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 19:10:36 GMT):<br/>
@Rachitga correct. This was the subtle difference I was trying  convey.  The consistency means it is consistent with the specification of policy, but is not 'correct' based upon desired outcome
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 19:10:36 GMT):<br/>
@Rachitga correct. This was the subtle difference I was trying  convey.  The consistency means it is consistent with the specification of policy, but is not 'correct' based upon desired outcome, which can also be subjective :) as the colluders got exactly what they wanted

The "Architecture Explained" document implies that we can customize the endorsing logic on an endorsing peer.

But I cannot find any references to how this can be accomplished. Does anyone know how can the endorsing logic be customized?

@mnosseir the endorsement is done by the system chaincode "escc" (search for "escc" in core/scc/importsyscc.go)... you can copy escc chaincode and customize it. escc can be specified at the time of  instantiation of a chaincode on a channel

@jeffgarratt , I get what you are saying but I wanted to know if the vscc does an explicit consistency check or not? What I mean is that after verifying the signature across the proposal bytes in an endorsement as correct, does it compare among the proposal bytes of different endorsements(which it is considering as correct).

The transaction response structure is something like this:

SignedTransaction
|\_ Signature                                    (signature on the Transaction message by the creator specified in the header)
 \_ Transaction
     \_ TransactionAction (1...n)
        |\_ Header (1)                           (the header of the proposal that requested this action)
         \_ Payload (1)                          (the payload for this action)
*/
And also at the committer, the changes in the ledger state will be made according to the read write set. Where in the code is the read write set that will be chosen in the end to be commited present?

@Rachitga wrt your second query "Where in the code is the read write set" - search for RWSetBuilder in fabric/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/rwsetutil - this is used by the committer while committing blocks. As far as I understand, the commiter takes a block, does signature validation on the whole block, then verifies the txs within the block, and while doing so, it adds all the writesets into a write-batch (can't remember the exact term) and once all txs have been verified, it writes the whole batch at once.

#1 happens in `Validate(block, doMVCCValidation)` in `fabric/core/committer/txvalidator/validator.go`. This gets called from `fabric/core/committer/committer_impl.go`.
#2 happens in: `ValidateAndPrepareBatch()` in `fabric/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/validator/statebasedval/state_based_validator.go` - you'll find what you're looking for. Here the validation that's being done is MVCC and intra-block read-write conflict validation and not the signature validation.

I'm a little confused about the "verifies the txs within the block, and _while doing so_, it adds all the writesets into a write-batch". Look at `ValidateAndPrepareBatch()` in `fabric/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/validator/statebasedval/state_based_validator.go` - you'll find what you're looking for. 

I'm confused about the "while doing so" part, because the validation is spread out throughout the codebase, and includes block validation, tx signature validation, tx policy validation (happens in vscc), and I can't really figure out what happens in which order.

@jeffgarratt , do you mean that the client submits only one proposal's bytes to the orderer, out of the many that it gets? @thakkarparth007 , thanks, the functions that you mentioned are helpful :relaxed: ! yeah, it is very confusing for me as well.

@Rachitga correct, the client should compare the proposal responses bytes for equivalence across endorsement requests, and then submit the single proposal response bytes along with the endorsements.

<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 18:28:42 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt @muralisr Hi, Quick question. If we write a endorsement policy such that a transaction will be only endorsed if a user approves it manually. As in this case, a proposal is already generated (RW set) and there can be other transactions that may get processed before this first one is approved by user. The RW set of the first transaction is really outdated and orderer or committer nodes may not process transactions in the same order as they were generated. Does fabric recreates a RWset if its updated in meantime or is there any other way to handle this scenario. Correct me if i'm missing something. 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 18:52:31 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi basically what you are saying is that an asset is modified by other transactions while another tx involving it is awaiting endorsement
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 18:56:38 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr Yes thats correct
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 18:56:54 GMT):<br/>
secondary TXs that use the same asset does get endorsed committed the first one will likely invalidated
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 18:58:48 GMT):<br/>
its hard to propose approaches without knowing details.. but the first question would be why would the secondary TXs get endorsed ?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 19:00:21 GMT):<br/>
yes so lets say all transactions needs "manual" endorsement. and user may not approve or endorse them in the same sequence/order of creation.
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 19:01:15 GMT):<br/>
or its waiting for other endorsements and secondary transactions may get endorsed before
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 19:03:37 GMT):<br/>
If first one is invalidated (thats my understanding as well), then how do we recreate or re-propose a transaction and then we'll need to begin endorsement process all over again.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 19:05:59 GMT):<br/>
sounds like some level control/sequencing from  application layer (as in SDK) may be needed (again, loosely speaking without knowledge of details)
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 19:16:48 GMT):<br/>
okay, I'm essentially trying to do a multi-party approval (M of N or N of N) process on the transaction. I can see another way is - to write user defined chaincode and manage multi-party approval process. But i thought endorsement policies are designed for the same purpose. In Multi-party approvals scenario, when users are doing "manual" endorsements (in financial market use cases specifically), its very likely that all transactions may not get endorsed completely in the same order as creation. I'm not really sure if we should do it as SDK level because we may have to go through endorsement process all over again. I think if we address this in the fabric itself, somehow reprocess the transaction considering endorsements are already done, that would be ideal (may be incorrect). 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 21:05:41 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi can you do it in two steps ? First step send a proposal / transaction to mark the asset as "in prgress" (no manual approval needed) and in the second do the multi-party endorsement... any other proposal coming in attempting to access the asset will be turned down with error
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 02:46:30 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=BT9Y5yggc7MfCwwo6) @muralisr Yup, correct, this logic will be required. Thanks for your help.

@nhrishi likely chaincode returned an error .... if you add CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug CORE_VM_DOCKER_STDOUT=true to peer's env vars you will get logs from chaincode streamed to peer's logs which might give more info
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 14:14:09 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi @muralisr Actually, to get the logging enabled for the `shim` which may be of assistance here, you need to set CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_SHIM=DEBUG. CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL does set the overall default level for the chaincode container but the shim value is set to warning by default in sampleconfig/core.yaml and will override the level.

 Hi. Maybe you've had this issue. As I was following the tutorial on ( http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html ). After successfully running [ ./byfn.sh -m generate ], I try to run [ ./byfn.sh -m up ] and I get this...
Starting with channel 'mychannel' and CLI timeout of '10000'
Continue (y/n)? y
proceeding ...
Pulling orderer.example.com (hyperledger/fabric-orderer:latest)...
ERROR: manifest for hyperledger/fabric-orderer:latest not found
ERROR !!!! Unable to start network
Error response from daemon: No such container: cli
I would greatly appreciate if anyone can lead me in the right direction. As I have not found this specific issue solved. Thanks!

Question about events: Can a client with an Org1 e-cert register for events from an Org2 peer?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 15:51:02 GMT):<br/>
@divyank if the org2 peer has configured their localMSPConfig to allow it, yes
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 15:57:30 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt How is that configured? I tried adding an Org1 root to the `cacerts` directory of the Org2 peer's local MSP config
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 15:58:09 GMT):<br/>
@divyank and after peer restart no go?
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:04:30 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt MSP ID validation appears to fail : `failed deserializing event creator: [Expected MSP ID Org2MSP, received Org1MSP]`
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:05:09 GMT):<br/>
this was from which process?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:05:16 GMT):<br/>
the peer your trying to get events from?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:05:29 GMT):<br/>
or the listener?
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:06:01 GMT):<br/>
Yes, this was the response from the event server on the Org2 peer that I am connecting to
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:09:04 GMT):<br/>
k, 2 secs..
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:10:46 GMT):<br/>
@divyank checking with murali, but the code seems to require membership in the peer's org
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:10:49 GMT):<br/>
```// Validates event messages by validating the Creator and verifying
// the signature. Returns the unmarshaled Event object
// Validation of the creator identity's validity is done by checking with local MSP to ensure the
// submitter is a member in the same organization as the peer
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:11:28 GMT):<br/>
@divyank so it appears I was wrong with my statement above
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:12:32 GMT):<br/>
in this case though, it does seem more likely that if you wish this to happen, you would issue the other ORG a cert to allow them access, which you could revoke later if you choose to
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:14:25 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt Alright. Thanks for checking
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:14:43 GMT):<br/>

Hello
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 22:34:53 GMT):<br/>
I've been trying to modify the validation code to enable parallel vscc validation of tx within a block
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 22:35:42 GMT):<br/>
But on doing that, I'm facing a strange situation where some rlocks acquired in the ledger are not being released
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 22:36:19 GMT):<br/>
It might be that I'm doing something wrong, but I'm wondering if parallel vscc invocation is safe currently
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 22:38:11 GMT):<br/>
Does anyone know of this?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 22:38:11 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 00:27:23 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 from a pure chaincode pov, system chaincode can be invoked in parallel.  However vscc does use ledger APIs and there maybe restrictions on concurrent invoke there. Suggest checking with fabric-ledger with the details on what locks are being held please
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Tue, 18 Jul 2017 09:15:54 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @muralisr

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 12:35:40 GMT):<br/>
I see the configtxgen has the ability to create an anchor peer transaction, which I assume is used to define say that a specific peer in an org is the anchor peer. I've created a simple network where I have 1 org and 1 peer and I haven't had to explicitly create this transaction and invoke this transaction and it works as expected. So under what circumstances would I need to actually generate and use this transaction ? Would it be if there were multiple organisations or more than 1 peer per organisation ?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 13:49:30 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel this is specifically a high availability concept at the moment I believe.  This would allow you to retrieve blocks from another organization in the case they can not be retrieved from the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 13:52:07 GMT):<br/>
I would assume that at some point in the future they may be relevant to the sideDB concept
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 18:01:52 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins @muralisr not sure who's the best to ask this to, just want to double check that in the following proto "NODE" is meant for javascript chaincode:
```
message ChaincodeSpec {

    enum Type {
        UNDEFINED = 0;
        GOLANG = 1;
        NODE = 2;
        CAR = 3;
        JAVA = 4;
    }

    Type type = 1;
    ChaincodeID chaincode_id = 2;
    ChaincodeInput input = 3;
    int32 timeout = 4;
}

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 18:02:29 GMT):<br/>
i'm pretty sure it should be, but just making sure before I start making use of it for FAB-2331
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 18:09:27 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix yes, it was meant for if we supprrt javascript natively (unlike composer which still uses GOLANG substrate)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 18:10:37 GMT):<br/>
ah that's what FAB-2331 is ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 18:24:05 GMT):<br/>
so one thing @jimthematrix ... the chaincode uses FSM which is totally unneecessary now that we do not have the serialization requirements in 0.6 in 1.0.  have been playing with code that removes the chaincode and shim FSMs (no external changes) hopefully for 1.1  (was just mentioning  this to @mastersingh24). It would make your life a lot simpler to use that model for javascript.... would you like me to push a WIP CR so you can take a look ?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 18:36:23 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr yes please, thanks for doing that! I always go "huh?" when looking at the FSM code ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 19 Jul 2017 18:36:56 GMT):<br/>
can we also make sure that your new approach is committed to 1.1?

Are there any API's in shim layer to create Index for couchDB queries or it has to be done using Curl only?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:02:02 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins @muralisr my plan for the shim part of javascript chaincode support is first exploring calling golang from node.js, instead of re-implementing the whole shim in node.js natively. This first and foremost saves us time for putting this out in v1.1, and in general may prove to be a viable approach to extend to other languages
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:03:10 GMT):<br/>
hmmm... just as composer does ? 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:03:41 GMT):<br/>
no, it's the opposite: Composer is golang calling nodejs via an interpret
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:03:41 GMT):<br/>
no, it's the opposite: Composer is golang calling nodejs via an interpreter
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:04:01 GMT):<br/>
this is node.js calling golang via shared library
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:04:13 GMT):<br/>
oh I see
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:04:22 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix I suppose I should withhold judgement until I see an implementation but this strikes me as less than ideal
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:04:24 GMT):<br/>
native node js but just calling shim
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:04:24 GMT):<br/>
native node js but just calling golang shim
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:06:15 GMT):<br/>
yes Greg the resulting impact remains to be seen but I think this is an incremental step in that if this turns out to be a bad idea (maybe performance is bad), minimal amount of code can just be replaced with native shim impl with javascript
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:06:38 GMT):<br/>
note that grpc support in node.js is accomplished this way
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:06:41 GMT):<br/>
its an implementation detail that can be chaged sure
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:06:41 GMT):<br/>
its an implementation detail that can be changed sure
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:06:59 GMT):<br/>
so I'm quite hopeful
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:07:32 GMT):<br/>
my question is where should I do the build step of the shim to make it a shared object?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:09:23 GMT):<br/>
in the spirit of keep it all internal, would be good to stuff that into the build image step than outside of it (ie, "saved" in the fabric externally)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:09:47 GMT):<br/>
but should wait for @greg.haskins thoughts...
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:11:22 GMT):<br/>
I guess I could start with adding an image based on ccenv and adding a build step to build the shim as shared object?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:11:44 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix still not sold on the approach, but if you were going to do it that way and wanted to know where the build could happen, my inclination would be to suggest during the ccenv build
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:12:23 GMT):<br/>
i see no reason to introduce a new image...in fact, i would probably rather see javaenv collapse back into ccenv
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:14:46 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix orthogonal to this particular aspect of the discussion, but, ill throw this out there that you could consider doing this as a chaintool platform (http://fabric-chaintool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/application-development/#platform)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:14:59 GMT):<br/>
if you are ok doing that in ccenv that's perfect
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:15:15 GMT):<br/>
I designed the .car format to be a universal chaincode container, with provisions for things like declaring compatibility constraints, etc
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:15:16 GMT):<br/>
wasn't sure if ccenv was meant to be reserved for golang only ...
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:15:45 GMT):<br/>
if you _dont_ use .car, then each other type (GOLANG, JAVA, and now NODE) are going to have to replicate this eventually once we move past v1.0
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:16:11 GMT):<br/>
nope, ccenv not meant to be golang specific
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:16:33 GMT):<br/>
i see no reason why basically all platforms cant be represented as a superset at the time we cut that release
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:16:39 GMT):<br/>
(in ccenv, I mean)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:16:45 GMT):<br/>
_are going to have to replicate this eventually once we move past v1.0_ - what's "this"?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:17:09 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix "this" is the basic notion of ABI management
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:17:34 GMT):<br/>
I would describe it as analogous to how the JVM deals with different versions of java
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:17:53 GMT):<br/>
e.g. "JRE-1.9" can emulate 1.9, 1.8, 1.7, 1.6, etc
</p>
<p><strong>niteshsolanki</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:18:10 GMT):<br/>
How can joins be implemented in couchDB in the chaincode ?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:18:14 GMT):<br/>
and .java files explicitly version themselves
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:18:46 GMT):<br/>
so its this coupling of runtime compatibility + emulation plus payload specification that I lump into "abi management"
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:18:47 GMT):<br/>
ah ok, yes I'm in agreement. if that can be consolidated as much as possible it's a good thing
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:19:00 GMT):<br/>
via the .car mechanism
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:19:01 GMT):<br/>
and I tried to capture that in a general way in chaintool/car
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:19:18 GMT):<br/>
let me take another look at that
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:19:36 GMT):<br/>
ok...would be more than happy to help lay the groundwork for a new type in chaintool
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:20:43 GMT):<br/>
like you said it's orthogonal so my current step is to get the shared object built in ccenv and then get js calling golang shim working. when I get to the packaging step I'll revisit this with you
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:20:53 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:22:17 GMT):<br/>
i think longer term, we will need to get away from "peer vX.Y.Z + ccenv vX.Y.Z" coupling and instead having the notion of the platform specifier (chaintool/car or otherwise) drive the right ccenv
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:22:24 GMT):<br/>
but for now...

as for the idea of re-using the golang shim binary for node.js chaincode, so far it's not looking promising. node.js has good integration with c/c++ (using .h files) but support for golang binaries seems to be lacking. I tried 2 different approaches: 1) build golang as shared libs and load dynamically - require("ffi"), 2) load go source with require("node-go-require") and require("gonode"). haven't been successful so far. I think the biggest problem with this approach in general is debugging when there are problems. I'm starting to think it's time to bite the bullet and re-implement the shim in node.js properly

Looking at [the documentation](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4noah.html), and this bit is unclear to me:
> When -s is specified, the -S option must also be specified if other owners are going to need to sign. Otherwise, the process will create a SignedCDS that includes only the instantiation policy in addition to the CDS. The -S option directs the process to sign the package using the MSP identified by the value of the localMspid property in core.yaml.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 20:15:18 GMT):<br/>
Why does `-S` (capital S) must be specified if _other_ owners are going to need to sign? If this option directs the process to sign the package, it seems that it's needed regardless?

But just a couple of paragraphs down we write:

Is the peer's MSP (and which peer by the way?), or is it the MSP administrator of the channel? These two are not necessarily identical.

Q2: Is the peer's MSP (and which peer by the way?), or is it the MSP administrator of the channel? These two are not necessarily identical. (I would note that the phrasing that follows several paragraphs later -- "For example, recall that the default instantiation policy is any channel MSP administrator, so the creator of a chaincode instantiate transaction must be a member of the channel administrators. " -- is much less ambiguous.)

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 20:46:37 GMT):<br/>
Also I think there is an unwritten rule of thumb in fabric - 
1) Signing is with local MSP
2) verification is with channel MSP (unless very specific cases)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 23:06:24 GMT):<br/>
@kostas the `-s` stands for "signed package format" (not used currently by SDKs...and in general not used or advertised much). the `-S` stands for if the package should be signed or not... ie, the format may be "signed package" but one need not sign it. If a policy is not provided (and for the non `-s` format, it is not...) the default policy is `any admin of the channel`.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 02:54:36 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr: I'm confused :slight_smile:  Could you expand a bit more on the `-S` switch?
</p>

@muralisr: Not sure I follow. Perhaps we could give a few examples with the `-S` switch?

Hi,

We have deployed 6 chain-codes on 6 peer across 2 organizations (i.e. each organization has 3 peers). 

We followed both approaches, CLI as well as Node SDK.

In case of CLI, everything works fine on each peer (alll calls worked fine).

In case of Node SDK, we are able to call chain-code APIs from first 3 peers (of Org1) successfully, but when we tried to call any API from Peers of Org2, it gives following error on SDK Terminal : 

error: [client-utils.js]: sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: Error executing chaincode: Could not get deployment transaction from LSCC for mycc:v0 - Get ChaincodeDeploymentSpec for mycc/mychannel from LSCC error: chaincode fingerprint mismatch data mismatch

We appreciate any help.

@SyneBlockChainTeam did you run the peer CLI from the same host, and did you run the node SDK from the same host too?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 11:06:33 GMT):<br/>
I'd assume you ran the node SDK from a different host
</p>
<p><strong>SyneBlockChainTeam</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 12:02:22 GMT):<br/>
Initially we tried with CLI and tested with (ORG1 - Peer0, Peer1, Peer2 and ORG2 - Peer0, Peer1, Peer2) successfully.

Later-on we tried with Sdk Node as per the configurations suggested in the online documentation. We noticed that everything (Invoke, Query) works find with Peer0, Peer1, Peer2 of ORG1 but when we attempted testing on  Peer0, Peer1, Peer2 of ORG2 we started getting above mentioned error.

Thanks.

Is there a way to stop a peer restarting a container if the container dies/crashes ? I have a situation where a chaincode container dies, but because the peer removes that container completely and starts a new one there is no way to attach to the container for indepth diagnostics

@jeffgarratt sure... but let me ask this @davidkel if you just want logs from chaincode, a better approach would be to add `CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_SHIM=debug CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true` to the peer envs. This will get you all the logs from chaincode to debug
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 16:10:31 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr unfortunately the logs don't show anything which is why I want to go into the container and see if there are any other places I could look for why the container just died
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 16:34:59 GMT):<br/>
In that case @davidkel just use this comment in core/chaincode/chaincode_support.go 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 16:35:04 GMT):<br/>
```        sir := container.StopImageReq{CCID: ccintf.CCID{ChaincodeSpec: cds.ChaincodeSpec, NetworkID: chaincodeSupport.peerNetworkID, PeerID: chaincodeSupport.peerID, Version: cccid.Version}, Timeout: 0}
        // The line below is left for debugging. It replaces the line above to keep
        // the chaincode container around to give you a chance to get data
        //sir := container.StopImageReq{CCID: ccintf.CCID{ChaincodeSpec: cds.ChaincodeSpec, NetworkID: chaincodeSupport.peerNetworkID, PeerID: chaincodeSupport.peerID, ChainID: cccid.ChainID, Version: cccid.Version}, Timeout: 0, Dontremove: true}```

What version of couchdb should be running for the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 17:25:16 GMT):<br/>
When starting the peer, it seems like couchDB is unable to create some necessary tables.

Hey all, When trying to start chaincode, I get the following error:
```

```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:36:30 GMT):<br/>
Hmm
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:36:44 GMT):<br/>
@Asara are you running with docker or on plain linux?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:36:52 GMT):<br/>
Yeap
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:36:55 GMT):<br/>
Centos 7
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:37:01 GMT):<br/>
no docker
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:37:02 GMT):<br/>
right?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:37:09 GMT):<br/>
running the binary yeah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:37:17 GMT):<br/>
ok assume the ip of the peer is `IP`
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:37:36 GMT):<br/>
Where would I change that?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:37:56 GMT):<br/>
wait
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:37:59 GMT):<br/>
I'm telling you
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:38:02 GMT):<br/>
denote the ip of your peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:38:04 GMT):<br/>
as IP
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:38:04 GMT):<br/>
as `IP`

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:42:20 GMT):<br/>
and the rest?

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:43:09 GMT):<br/>
and then do:
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:43:32 GMT):<br/>
I'm making all these files via ansible, so what should the values be? I can set them to whatever they need to be
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:43:50 GMT):<br/>
wait wait
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:43:53 GMT):<br/>
one step at atime
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:44:01 GMT):<br/>
where is the TLS folder
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:44:11 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L212
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:44:15 GMT):<br/>
what does it say?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:44:35 GMT):<br/>
do `openssl x509 -in tls/server.crt -text -noout`
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:44:38 GMT):<br/>
Same thing as the sample, but I have the msp/tls stuff in the proper directory
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:44:57 GMT):<br/>
ok, please tell me what is the output of the above command
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:45:07 GMT):<br/>
you may tell me only the DNS names
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:45:09 GMT):<br/>
if you want
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:45:11 GMT):<br/>
```Subject: C=US, ST=California, L=San Francisco, CN=peer0.org1.example.com```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:45:16 GMT):<br/>
aha
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:45:26 GMT):<br/>
ping peer0.org1.example.com
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:45:32 GMT):<br/>
do you get a resolution?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:45:34 GMT):<br/>
I have dns set up
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:45:48 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:45:51 GMT):<br/>
ok great
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:46:01 GMT):<br/>
so let's try something
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:46:11 GMT):<br/>
listenAddress: `peer0.org1.example.com:7051`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:46:11 GMT):<br/>
`listenAddress: peer0.org1.example.com:7051`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:46:24 GMT):<br/>
can you please change to this
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:46:29 GMT):<br/>
and restart the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:46:32 GMT):<br/>
and then try again?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:47:26 GMT):<br/>
will do
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:47:39 GMT):<br/>
for some reason it takes chaincode ~15 minutes to get through packaging
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:47:41 GMT):<br/>
so i'll let you know how ti goes :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:48:06 GMT):<br/>
ouch
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 22:34:24 GMT):<br/>
@Asara you still alive?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 22:34:52 GMT):<br/>
Yeah sorry hitting some silly snags with my scripts (unrelated to fabric)
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 22:35:00 GMT):<br/>
I'll ping ya in a few min :)
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:00:14 GMT):<br/>
Alright @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:00:25 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:37:33 GMT):<br/>
u are startng the the peer from your host correct (not in docker ) ?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:37:41 GMT):<br/>
yeap
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:40:20 GMT):<br/>
try deleting the CC image
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:40:30 GMT):<br/>
and re-running the CC
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:41:19 GMT):<br/>
well... I'd also try starting the peer with its IP Address ... 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:41:38 GMT):<br/>
but yes, try deleteing the CC image first
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:41:39 GMT):<br/>
For which config setting?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:41:55 GMT):<br/>
lets try what yacov suggested first ...
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:42:10 GMT):<br/>
what's your platform ?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:42:13 GMT):<br/>
centos 7
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:42:18 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:47:30 GMT):<br/>
no, @muralisr - starting the peer with the ip address will give him the original problem :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:47:35 GMT):<br/>
he started from that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:47:44 GMT):<br/>
his problem is that his TLS cert doesn't have an IP SAN
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:48:15 GMT):<br/>
and when the CC shim connects, the validation fails because it tries to connect to the ip
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:48:21 GMT):<br/>
well
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:48:39 GMT):<br/>
let me look first then :-)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:48:44 GMT):<br/>
ok.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:48:49 GMT):<br/>
what I am trying to make him do
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:49:14 GMT):<br/>
is to make the shim use the endpoint that of peer's DNS SAN 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:49:18 GMT):<br/>
`Subject: C=US, ST=California, L=San Francisco, CN=peer0.org1.example.com`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:49:18 GMT):<br/>
and this way it'll match
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:49:39 GMT):<br/>
why cant we just add peer0.org1.example.com to /etc/hosts
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:49:45 GMT):<br/>
and map it to the host IP
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:50:00 GMT):<br/>
it's resolvable though
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:50:02 GMT):<br/>
he pinged it
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:50:21 GMT):<br/>
from the container ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:50:26 GMT):<br/>
no from the host
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:50:34 GMT):<br/>
but I assume they share the same DNS
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:50:47 GMT):<br/>
I think its worth a try
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:50:48 GMT):<br/>
anyway I'm going to sleep, back me up ;)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:50:58 GMT):<br/>
you got it
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 00:56:32 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr the DNS is added to the /etc/hosts of the host 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:18:40 GMT):<br/>
what does ifconfig (ip add) say ?

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:22:36 GMT):<br/>
^^ that being the error Asara is running into
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:24:07 GMT):<br/>
Exactly :)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:38:04 GMT):<br/>
@Asara I thought you had `ERRO 002 Error trying to connect to local peer: x509: cannot validate certificate for 0.0.0.0 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs`
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:38:37 GMT):<br/>
Said above, I redeployed the chaincode and it came up
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:38:44 GMT):<br/>
Not sure why, didn't do anything different, but it did
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:39:02 GMT):<br/>
Though this seems like an error with the ca and not peer
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:44:51 GMT):<br/>
I see
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:44:56 GMT):<br/>
so the chaincode came up now
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:45:02 GMT):<br/>
Yeap
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:45:17 GMT):<br/>
did you mod /etc/hosts ?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:46:00 GMT):<br/>
Nope, it was always set
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:46:03 GMT):<br/>
and then you get the above openssl error in the SDK ?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 01:47:04 GMT):<br/>
Yeap

The issue I face is when accessing through an SDK client, I need to set a realistic timeout - currently using 30 seconds, although would like to reduce this.  Occasionally, the event will come 2 or 3 seconds later.  This becomes problematic, since a write has occurred to the chain, but the application sees a timeout.  I guess I could try to read the record to confirm, but that requires duplicating the chain code logic in my application to be able to determine the new asset value.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 03:08:29 GMT):<br/>
Also, any insight as to what could be causing the following error that appears occasionally in the peer logs.  They occur after a transaction has been ordered and transaction is always sees fine, but I can't trace where these events with an empty MSP are originating from.

In SDK Node, has anyone tried with 1 Organization with More then 3 Peers 
OR with 2 Organizations each with 3 Peers.

We are looking forward for a reply.

Quick question, when chaincode is deployed to a peer, does it also install it to the other peers in the channel?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 15:32:36 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 15:33:40 GMT):<br/>
So chaincode needs to be installed on every peer manually? Regardless of if they belong to the same channel?

My deployment uses stateless containers with persistent storage - so the chaincode is always available in the filesystem, but there may be cases where the image is not - such as this case.   How to ensure that in such cases the peer waits for the cc container to launch?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:03:01 GMT):<br/>
the peer builds the image itself

Nick, I can't find the error string in the code... which commit hash are you working on?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:22:07 GMT):<br/>
yes you're right https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/d9c320297bd2a4eff2eb253ce84dc431ef860972/core/chaincode/chaincode_support.go#L411
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:23:00 GMT):<br/>
so can you give more details on your env? 
what happened to the containers of version 28? of 29? etc. 
what you did, what is the flow, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:06:14 GMT):<br/>
@passkit one possibility is instantiate waiting on a timeout for regtration to kick in ... any other invoke you send meanwhile will get the premature error
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:07:08 GMT):<br/>
 if your chaincode never got back (say it crahsed) you are going to waitout the timeout 
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:09:08 GMT):<br/>
So we currently have issues with the go SDK and event broadcasts not being received.  The peers function perfectly and the event is broadcast, but the SDK is not hearing it and timing out.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:09:39 GMT):<br/>
So started debugging on a different channel, but forgot that I had not updated that channel from 28 to 29.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:09:55 GMT):<br/>
So that explains why it launched an older version.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:11:37 GMT):<br/>
Then to Yacov's point, it is possible that it was a second invoke that triggered this error.  So I'm ok with this as it is something that could occur if a peer host is restarted and does not contain an image, and therefore I should deal with this scenario in my code.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:12:25 GMT):<br/>
The initial thing that threw me was why an older version was being launched, but I now understand how that happened.

<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 20:19:01 GMT):<br/>
Hey all/@greg.haskins, my chaincode packaging takes forever, is there a way to prepackage chaincodes so I can just deploy the 'compiled?' chaincode instead of having to wait 15ish minutes each time
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 21:15:53 GMT):<br/>
@Asara `peer chaincode package...` command can be used to package it once
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 21:16:17 GMT):<br/>
and then you install the packaged file simply as `peer chaincode install <package.file>`
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 02:09:34 GMT):<br/>
@Asara in addition to what Murali said, also sounds a bit odd for it to take 15minutes
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 02:40:59 GMT):<br/>
I have question on chaincode upgrade, when you upgrade the chaincode older Docker containers are not terminated. Why ? Thanks in advance
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 02:42:11 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr Is it recommended to use the command line tool to package and install the chaincode or should we use the API to install the chaincode file.  
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 02:43:04 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr For production environment should we use the peer chaincode tool or develop Nodejs program to install. 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:18:02 GMT):<br/>
@gauthampamu note that chaincode can run against multiple ledgers. So CC.v1 is running and is instantiated on channel1 and channel2
</p>

@gauthampamu note that chaincode can run against multiple ledgers. So CC.v1 is running and is instantiated on channel1 and channel2. CC.v2 installed and instantiated on channel2 ... CC.v1 can still serve requests for channel1
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:25:01 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr Thanks for the response. Let say if you just have one channel, how does it work ? Will it create separate docker container or restart the docker container ?
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:33:02 GMT):<br/>
How does the fabric authenticate the requests submitted by the application SDK. Does the endorsing peer check the signing identity ? How does it verify the identity of the request ? 
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 03:50:04 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure I ever got an answer to a previous question of whether or not it is possible to query the result of a transaction by txID.  In my case, I am using the Fabric Go SDK and there are reliability issues that are preventing my clients from receiving the event broadcast.  The peers are functioning perfectly and broadcasting the event as expected, but the SDK intermittently has trouble receiving it.   In these cases, I would like to be able to manually pull this broadcast data by txId to determine if the transaction has actually been committed.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 05:36:29 GMT):<br/>
@passkit use a qscc query
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 05:36:53 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps you can access the validated ledger

@muralisr @greg.haskins Hey thanks! Is there a way to do that via the SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 13:39:21 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins I agree, and I'm not sure why it is taking so long.  But it is always stalled on packaging the chaincode. But again I've only done it via the node-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 13:41:07 GMT):<br/>
@Asara if you are stalled on packaging it in node SDK, I'd try installing from CLI first. If that doesn't stall, then it may be an issue with the SDK and worth looking into
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 13:42:13 GMT):<br/>
Alright cool.  I'll try packaging/deploying it via the `peer` cli first
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:02:33 GMT):<br/>
Are docker instances for the chaincode supposed to start on `peer` servers where the chaincode is installed
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:51:45 GMT):<br/>
@Asara It will not start the peer server when you install the chaincode. You will need peers to be up and running to send the request to install the chaincode. 
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:53:32 GMT):<br/>
@gauthampamu My scenario is as such:
1. peer1 installs and then instantiates chaincode
1.5 peer1's docker instance containing the chaincode comes up
2. peer2 goes to install chaincode
3. peer2 returns a 200, but the docker instance doesn't come up
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:56:28 GMT):<br/>
@Asara Have you tried to install the chaincode on both peers and then instantiate the chaincode on the channel
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:56:40 GMT):<br/>
Also did both peers join the channel
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:56:49 GMT):<br/>
Nope but I can. I am following: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install_instantiate.html
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:56:55 GMT):<br/>
for the most part (doing it via the SDK)
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:57:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes both peers joined the channel
</p>
<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:59:09 GMT):<br/>
@Asara your scenario is working as designed.   Installing chaincode simply places the chaincode binary on the peer's file system.  It is a peer-level operation in that it only needs to be done once per peer.   When you instantiated the chaincode on peer1, that spins up a docker chaincode container on peer1.    Assuming this has all gone well, you will not get a docker chaincode container on peer2 until you target a transactionproposal to peer2.
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 15:59:52 GMT):<br/>
@silliman Alright cool. I'll send a txn to peer2 and see what happens

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 00:01:22 GMT):<br/>
@Eman0 IMO it's worth doing UT to see whenever it's something inherent in fabric or something not related to chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>Eman0</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 00:07:16 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin I just viewed the logs. No errors. I will but it is a bit strange because it works fine for all the other certificates

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 15:22:10 GMT):<br/>
@Glen When you instantiate a chaincode you specify an endorsement policy, that is, how many and which organizations must endorse a transaction.  Endorsement essentially means authorize/execute/sign a proposal request.  It sounds like you would benefit from the the Transaction Flow documentation: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/txflow.html

Scenario: instantiation on channel1 of chaincode named "mycc" takes 9 minutes to create the container. However, we observe that invokes on channel1 fail. We think this is because it takes longer than core.yaml chaincode:startuptimeout value of 300s, and longer than the application waits. BUT notice: if we wait 10 minutes and then instantiate same exact chaincode "mycc" on channel2, it reuses the mycc chaincode container as expected and all invokes are successful immediately on channel2. This proves the "mycc" container was correctly created as a result of the first request, and the request was not cancelled after the alloted 5 minutes when the peer timed out. So... *what is the benefit of the design for using startuptimeout*? All it does is allow the fabric peer to abandon hope. If the peer had waited statelessly and asynchronously for the chaincode container to be established, then channel1 instantiation completion would have been recoreded and invokes would work too. (Alternatively, when it gave up, should it have cancelled the attempt to create the container?)

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:16:40 GMT):<br/>
@scottz @suryalanka on the failure scenario do you see `Timeout expired while starting chaincode` error ? And if in debug mode, `stopping due to error while launching` ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:19:02 GMT):<br/>
I'd expect you see those....in which case, I'd also expect the chaincode to be cleaned up and removed after the timeout. The second successful one likely got created by the second request (as opposed to latching on to a lazy chaincode startup from the first)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:27:34 GMT):<br/>
@rmohta you may want to vendor all dependencies (including shim) within the chaincode .... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mlUaJbFHcM may help....

```error: [client-utils.js]: sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: Error starting container: Failed to generate platform-specific docker build: Failed to pull hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:x86_64-1.0.1-snapshot-0a9951b9: API error (404): {"message":"manifest for hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:x86_64-1.0.1-snapshot-0a9951b9 not found"}```
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 18:09:20 GMT):<br/>
what's strange is that the docker's label gives a different snapshot value:
```"Labels": {
                "com.docker.compose.config-hash": "e54b6f953cca7f9b35763265ff7b3ecbbcfb71c5c8778ad22e38f2edf88ff53b",
                "com.docker.compose.container-number": "1",
                "com.docker.compose.oneoff": "False",
                "com.docker.compose.project": "fixtures",
                "com.docker.compose.service": "peer0.org1.example.com",
                "com.docker.compose.version": "1.15.0",
                "org.hyperledger.fabric.base.version": "0.3.1",
                "org.hyperledger.fabric.version": "1.0.1-snapshot-62fd2682"
            }```
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 18:10:58 GMT):<br/>
and the label is consistent with the ccenv image tag: `x86_64-1.0.1-snapshot-62fd2682`
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 18:11:25 GMT):<br/>
I'm a little puzzled where did the chaincode support code get the `x86_64-1.0.1-snapshot-0a9951b9` tag value
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 18:18:03 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 18:40:46 GMT):<br/>
looks like the files build/docker/bin/peer(orderer) are not being refreshed during `make docker` (even with `make -B docker`), after `make clean` first that deletes them, and rebuild, they are now back in sync: build number inside the binaries are consistent with the docker tag

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:05:17 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix that problem is consistent with having your builds out of sync
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:05:38 GMT):<br/>
as you discovered, simply rebuilding them all should fix it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:06:23 GMT):<br/>
for background, the last number is generated from the commit-sha that was HEAD at the time you did the build
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:06:55 GMT):<br/>
so, if you, for example, pull, build the world, commit something, build just one component...the shas would differ

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:29:30 GMT):<br/>
btw: the last part of the puzzle I should mention: the "0a9951b9" reference was coming from the peer. not the ccenv
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:29:53 GMT):<br/>
basically, by default, the peer will attempt to use a ccenv with an identical tag
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:30:22 GMT):<br/>
so fabric-peer:x86_64-1.0.1-snapshot-0a9951b9 will expect fabric-ccenv:x86_64-1.0.1-snapshot-0a9951b9
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:31:58 GMT):<br/>
this is controlled here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/3abe144d50a6edb367ef978f75387f515b95dc1f/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L329
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:32:36 GMT):<br/>
basically, the peer offers a templating engine...it will translate $(PROJECT_VERSION) to be the same as the peers
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:32:59 GMT):<br/>
you can, of course, override it to be something else, but by default it will try to match it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:33:05 GMT):<br/>
matching it is typically what you want
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:34:09 GMT):<br/>
I see the problem you describe all the time when I rebuild only the peer but not the ccenv _AND_ I happened to have moved to a new gitsha in the interim
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:34:32 GMT):<br/>
lesson to be learned here is be really careful, because its the case where you _havent_ moved the gitsha that is the most dangerous
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 02:34:47 GMT):<br/>
(you may be using mismatched peer/ccenv and not even realize it)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 06 Aug 2017 19:30:03 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the full explanation @greg.haskins , that's exactly what happened. now thinking it a bit more, I had thought that "make docker" would have rebuilt the peer binary in /build/docker/bin so that'll resync the binary running inside docker with the tag on the docker images, but that's apparently not happening. isn't that supposed to be that way: /build/docker/bin gets rebuilt along with docker images themselves?

<p><strong>frbrkoala</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 00:18:40 GMT):<br/>
Hi guys. Just a quick question. Is my understanding correct, that we can't use more then one Kafka-based ordering clusters per channel? In such case in the large scaled Fabric-based blockchain network with one large channel an "ordering service" (a combination of ordering peers with Kafka brokers /zookeepers) is becoming a central part of the architecture. Is this correct?
</p>
<p><strong>Eman0</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 00:35:33 GMT):<br/>
What happens if a peer is the only endorser for a chaincode and it creates a fake transaction proposal, endorses it and broadcasts it. From what I understand, committing peers only verify that the endorsement is valid and that means other peers will commit the transaction. Is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>frbrkoala</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 00:40:55 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=oxYtzQNpitodmDsoW) @Eman0 To me it looks like you are right. That's why the Endorsement policies are important. If we don't trust one single peer in the network, we should better create a policy that will enforce validation with a number of peers to make sure peers will double check each other.
</p>
<p><strong>Eman0</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 00:53:23 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 10:04:46 GMT):<br/>
The client application is authored together with the chaincode.  The client application must have knowledge of the endorsement policies and gather enough endorsements.

<p><strong>Eman0</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 16:59:53 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart Thank you, that makes sense. Incase of multiple endorsers, is it possible to test that through CLI? or is it only able to interact with one endorser at a time? 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 08 Aug 2017 17:01:18 GMT):<br/>
CLI only interacts with a single endorser, it is meant for initial trial/demo only.  You will need to use the client SDK to send to multiple endorsers.

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:48:51 GMT):<br/>
not sure everyone agrees, but this seems logical to me
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:49:38 GMT):<br/>
e.g. a client should only really need knowledge of a) a small set of seed peers it trusts (presumably its own) and b) a set of 1 or more chaincodes it wants to interact with
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:50:01 GMT):<br/>
everything else (endorsement policies, endorsement members, orderer(s), etc, should be in-band discoverable
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:52:03 GMT):<br/>
to address threat vectors against the discoverable data, it should have strong provenance mechanisms back to the channel/chaincode instantiate activity
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 09 Aug 2017 13:52:45 GMT):<br/>
e.g. the signature of the instantiate transaction which includes the endorsement policy/group should be conveyed

 I have modified the first network
• Generated certificates and channel artifacts in the first machine with configtx and crypto-config yaml files (which contains both the org details,the 4 nodes & one Orderer) by running the command ./byfn.sh –m generate
• Updated docker-compose-cli, docker-compose-couch, docker-compose-e2e-template and docker-compose-base yaml files to contain first org, 2 peer nodes and 1 Orderer.
• Started the network (First Org with 2 nodes and Orderer) in the first machine by running the command ./byfn.sh –m up
• Copied the generated certificates and the channel artifacts in to the second machine
• Updated docker-compose-cli, docker-compose-couch, docker-compose-e2e-template and docker-compose-base yaml files to contain second org, 2 peer nodes and without Orderer.
• Did not call CreateChannel function in script.sh file. Commented out.
• Started the network (Second Org with 2 nodes without Orderer) in the second machine by running the command ./byfn.sh –m up
• Got the exception “Error: genesis block file not found open mychannel.block: no such file or directory” during Channel Join Operation. 
Can you please tell me how to resolve this issue?

Does the broadcasted endorsement contain the client signature? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:26:53 GMT):<br/>
It contains the signed proosal
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:26:56 GMT):<br/>
So yes
</p>
<p><strong>Eman0</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:31:45 GMT):<br/>
ermm do committing peers revalidate the client signature? or they just verify the endorsers' signatures?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:48:23 GMT):<br/>
the latter - but in the future they would probably do also the former ( @adc please correct me if that's wrong)

I am developing a chaincode and testing it by modifying script.sh in e2e_cli example with the default network setup (Org1,Org2, 2 members each). If I instantiate chaincode using peer0.Org1, I am able to invoke transactions on it. But when I invoke transactions on peer0.Org2 after instantiating CC on peer0.Org1, I get the following error on peer0.org2. The same behavior other way round as well. 
```
2017-08-14 *12:06:27.826 UTC* [chaincode] processStream -> DEBU 645 [8bb78db8]sending state message TRANSACTION

2017-08-14 12:06:57.829 UTC [chaincode] ExecuteChaincode -> ERRO 64a Error executing chaincode: Failed to execute transaction (Timeout expired while executing transaction)
```
On the orderer, I see the following message corresponding to same timestamp
[orderer/common/broadcast] Handle -> WARN a14 Error reading from stream: rpc error: code = Canceled desc = context canceled

My e2e_cli works fine with the default chaincode examples. What could be going wrong with my chaincode? how do I debug? Thanks

@tallharish you can ignore the orderer error (for now at least) its just that peer or cli has disconnected
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 15 Aug 2017 12:28:49 GMT):<br/>
the timeout could be due to chaincode dying
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 15 Aug 2017 12:28:59 GMT):<br/>
or reporting an error
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 15 Aug 2017 12:30:19 GMT):<br/>
if you add  env vars`CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug and CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true` to peer container's the chaincode logs will be redirected to peer side
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 15 Aug 2017 12:30:40 GMT):<br/>
and you can look at the peer logs to debug 
</p>

What are some sample scenarios where a peer may refuse to endorse a transaction? Is it just to prevent unauthorised nodes from validating transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Tue, 15 Aug 2017 18:19:11 GMT):<br/>
Can you help me understand -
- on starting the peer - how does peer get the orderer host information? I assume the connection is initiated by Peer to Orderer.
- in kafka-consensus orderer service setup - how do we know or control which peer-OSN communicates and I assume there would be switching to the available OSN to support fault tolerance
Thanks.

Hi there, I'm working on enabling TLS on my ca/peer/orderer, and now my chaincode docker container is having problems.  It looks like a cert issue; here is the log from the chaincode docker container:

@vdods if the peer uses TLS - you also use TLS as the shim

<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 17:55:05 GMT):<br/>
It alternates success and failure.  The following log entries are present in the succeeding one and not present in the failing one:
`[ccprovider] GetChaincodeData -> DEBU 479^[[0m Getting chaincode data for <mycc, v0> from cache`
`[ccprovider] NewCCContext -> DEBU 47b^[[0m NewCCCC (chain=mychannel,chaincode=mycc,version=v0,txid=87e84772df25345ea759fe18c2847b59bb6018df595d29db3f70c81596ffc01c,syscc=false,proposal=0xc42140ef00,canname=mycc:v0`
`[chaincode] Launch -> DEBU 47c^[[0m chaincode is running(no need to launch) : mycc:v0`
and a few others, but those are the first that I can see
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 17:56:39 GMT):<br/>
The strange thing is that I'm deleting all state (docker volumes that contain peer/orderer/ca state, docker containers, docker images for chaincode), so the behavior should be identical each time I run it.  Maybe there's some anonymous docker volume being created and used somewhere that I'm not seeing
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 21:09:59 GMT):<br/>
It appears to be directly related to which peer is the leader -- the leader peer works, the non-leader doesn't
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 21:30:57 GMT):<br/>
what's the issue, @vdods  ?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 21:32:27 GMT):<br/>
Upon transaction invocation, my non-leader peer returns with error `[lscc] Invoke -> ERRO 3e0 error getting chaincode mycc on channel: mychannel(err:could not find chaincode with name 'mycc')`, whereas the leader peer functions correctly.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 21:33:08 GMT):<br/>

But -- I'm sending the transaction proposal to both peers (leader and non-leader), and getting success from leader and failure from non-leader.  The failure is `could not find chaincode with name 'mycc' - make sure the chaincode mycc has been successfully instantiated and try again`

All, I have a design question: 1) In most of the use cases, the participants of the network will have data which they would really like to keep confidential (for e.g. how much amount one invested) among select few peers.I understand channel is an option for peers to transact privately. But does that mean for all practical purposes, we will end up with multiple channels irrespective of how big or small a usecase is and then on the application side( front end) we will have to orchestrate to get data from all the channels and present to the user based on access level? 2) is there a mechanism to control access level for a peer on a channel so as it could access only specific data? Please help

@yacovm In reproducing the bug again, I don't think it's necessarily gossip.  I'm getting different failures, with no deterministic reproducibility -- sometimes the node SDK times out on channel creation before the peers do anything at all.  Sometimes it fails during a transaction proposal, and sometimes it totally succeeds.  This is starting with the peers' chaincode docker images already existing.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 01:29:23 GMT):<br/>
This nondeterministic failure happens even when I clear all state and start from scratch
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 01:30:26 GMT):<br/>
It looks like it might be a problem with fabric-sdk-node.. when the SDK call to create channel is made, in the successful case the orderer responds, whereas in the failure case the orderer doesn't make a peep (no indication it received any request)

Hello. Can someone explain what the difference between Org.member and Org.admin in endorsment policy? as i understood for example endorsment policy specifies way of approving transaction by validating peers. in case of Org.member it is clear - it's just endorosing peer. What does Org.admin mean in case of peer? 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 11:08:23 GMT):<br/>
@Stas Sorokin I think I know now: the admin is the identity which is in the msp/admincerts, so if you put certificate of peer 1 into peer 2 msp/admincerts folder, then the endorsements of peer1 will satisfy the policy Org1.admin on peer2

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=dofNZi8aBhhqGxqmR) @yacovm Nevermind about this issue -- I fixed the bug by upgrading docker.  The problem is that the grpc calls were experiencing dns resolution failure, and tracking the bug down was a very misleading process.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 18:23:25 GMT):<br/>
@Stas Sorokin the difference is that Org.member means any signature from someone with a cert signed by the org (or in trust chain).  This in general will be a peer that has been configured by the organization where the localMspConfig/signcerts will contain a cert signed by the org.  Whereas an Org.admin refers to someone who has the admin role for the MSP, which requires the cert actually have been configured within the MSPConfig of the channel (which is seeded from the consortium on genesis of the channel).  This is NOT the same as placing the cert into the localMSPCOnfig/admins folder of a peer, which will make that user an Admin for the Peer, but not for the Org's MSP.

Hi again, let consider two orgs with three endorsing peers in each organisation. if i instantiate a chaincode with endorsment policy AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member') then call invoke it is no matter how many peers will endorse transaction, isn't it?  One peer from Org1 and One peer from Org2 are enough?

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 25 Aug 2017 16:59:12 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim yes... You would have required a peer to be configured such that the signerscert is one of the certs in the MSPConfig's admins field

Hi, can someone explain me what kind of validation will be executed by the committer before updating the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:14:56 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:15:00 GMT):<br/>
it checks:
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:16:01 GMT):<br/>
1) The transactions are signed by the peers according to the endorsement policy
2) The versions of the Read sets are not "old" in comparison to the existing ones (Multi version concurrency control)
</p>
<p><strong>aberfou</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:17:56 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thx, that means only the version of the rw sets will be checked?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:18:15 GMT):<br/>
only, in comparison to.... ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:18:21 GMT):<br/>
to values?
</p>
<p><strong>aberfou</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:19:52 GMT):<br/>
i mean you have to trust the endorsment peers, if i have only one endorsment peer then it is possible that the endorsment peer can cheat...am i right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:20:23 GMT):<br/>
if the endorsement policy is like "only 1 signature from any org" then yeah
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:20:26 GMT):<br/>
but it's up to you
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:20:37 GMT):<br/>
also - that's true for the default validation system chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:20:46 GMT):<br/>
if you implement your own system chaincode 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:21:00 GMT):<br/>
that does chaincode simulation and checks that things "make sense"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:21:20 GMT):<br/>
then you won't be cheated I guess
</p>
<p><strong>aberfou</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:21:21 GMT):<br/>
what is the difference between a nomal chaincode and a system chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:21:33 GMT):<br/>
a normal chaincode is what you know
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:21:56 GMT):<br/>
a system chaincode is just code in the peer that does all kinds of infrastructure specific tasks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:22:02 GMT):<br/>
and it has the signature of a chaincode shim
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:22:30 GMT):<br/>
so it's called a system chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:22:35 GMT):<br/>
i.e when you install a chaincode on a peer
</p>
<p><strong>aberfou</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:22:38 GMT):<br/>
infrastructure specific tasks... e.g.?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:22:45 GMT):<br/>
you actually call a life-cycle system chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 16:23:05 GMT):<br/>
>  infrastructure specific tasks... e.g.? 
Making a peer join a channel, instantiate chaincode, install chaincode, etc. etc.

one more question regarding the anchor peer. the glossary says "A peer node on a channel that all other peers can discover and communicate with.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 08:59:31 GMT):<br/>
@aberfou  - the client can check to make sure that it received enough endorsements back and can check to make sure that the endorsement responses match as well, but this is not required (although it's a nice thing to do if possible).  Even if the client does not check and submits the endorsement responses to the ordering service, each peer which receives the transaction will actually check to make sure that enough correct endorsements were obtained

</p>
<p><strong>aberfou</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:12:04 GMT):<br/>
ok that means still only the endorsment policies will be checked by other peers but not the result of the endorsment...?

lets say i have two endorsment peers and i need a signature from both endorsment peers. my transaction looks like this: send 100 assets from a to b. lets assume endorsment peer0 executes it properly, but endorsment peer1 transfers 10000 for whatever reason. bot peers sign the proposal.

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:18:34 GMT):<br/>
@aberfou as far as I know, the app packs into a transaction one result and n signatures over that result. So in this case you have 2 different results, which means an app must choose. But either way, the endorsement policy will not be satisfied, as only 1 signature can be provided
</p>
<p><strong>aberfou</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:19:30 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim I see
</p>
<p><strong>aberfou</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:20:41 GMT):<br/>
but what do you mean the app must chose?
</p>
<p><strong>aberfou</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:21:11 GMT):<br/>
how does the app distinguish the different results?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:24:56 GMT):<br/>
@aberfou the app receives all proposal responses, so it can iterate over them and make sure that they are all the same
</p>
<p><strong>aberfou</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:25:53 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim ok that means the app cheks all results
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:26:57 GMT):<br/>
it checks it before ordering, the app might not check it, but then the transaction will be in a block and when committed by peers, marked as invalid because of policy violation
</p>
<p><strong>aberfou</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:28:42 GMT):<br/>
ok that means the peers check it, if there are different results the transaction will be marked as invalid?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:30:01 GMT):<br/>
I think you can't send different results, it's only one result and many signatures
</p>
<p><strong>aberfou</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:31:19 GMT):<br/>
then i dont understand how and where invalid results will be detected

<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 21:04:07 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr @kostas @jyellick

[1] Use of config.yaml (4th point - http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msp.html#msp-setup-on-the-peer-orderer-side) in the msp folder indicates, let's say for peer fabric, for every signed request received from either client could be orderer or HFC or (anything else, can you please update - is it for Gossip?) must have a entry in the yaml (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/msp/mspimpl.go#L1118).

Is that correct?

[2] Since the config.yaml is cached in the peer implementation, we would require to reboot the peer process in case there needs to change config.yaml. Is my understanding correct and this should apply to orderer since it is sharing the mspimpl.go code?

[3] I am feeling, by adding config.yaml entry is like mandating every signed request to carry OU field. How do we justify from the security perspective if we loosen this condition - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/msp/mspimpl.go#L1119 and set to true?

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 22:12:39 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde The MSP information in the `orderer.yaml` and `core.yaml` is local to the process.  In the orderer case, this is used only for signing. In the peer, this is used for signing and for local admin actions like installing chaincode.  All other signature validation for channel specific things like `Broadcast` and `Deliver` use the channel MSPs as defined by `configtx.yaml`.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:38:56 GMT):<br/>
it should be 7052
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:39:08 GMT):<br/>
this is how it's launched:
```CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME="mycc:v0" node test/integration/test.js --peer.address grpc://localhost:7051
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:39:16 GMT):<br/>
7052?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:39:16 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:39:18 GMT):<br/>
it's the wrong port
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:39:21 GMT):<br/>
7052 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:39:37 GMT):<br/>
is that related to the auth handler feature?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:39:42 GMT):<br/>
no...
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:39:47 GMT):<br/>
are you using an old chaincode image ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:39:48 GMT):<br/>
it's related to the TLS CC
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:40:33 GMT):<br/>
so the new port is always 7052 regardless if tls is enabled or not?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:40:40 GMT):<br/>
in my case I don't have tls enabled
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:43:14 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr this is from the node.js chaincode test code ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:53:19 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm node.js chaincode e2e test working fine now after mapping the additional 7052 port, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:54:33 GMT):<br/>
the port is now different because the listener is different, because the TLS configuration is different and separate.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=4yK3ZiAiZxMmXSHGd) @jyellick 

Now in that case - to confirm ` config.yaml (4th point - http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msp.html#msp-setup-on-the-peer-orderer-side) ` will also become part of the channel-configuration block. Hence for example during Identity Validation process of the received Endorsement Proposal Request, the peer process will pick the endorsement request sender's MSP from the configuration-block (ledger) and one of the step will be to perform the OU validation on that signing cert.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 15:40:33 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde You keep referring to `config.yaml`, do you mean `conifgtx.yaml`?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 15:40:33 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde ~You keep referring to `config.yaml`, do you mean `conifgtx.yaml`?~ I see this in the doc now
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 15:43:02 GMT):<br/>
I have not personally used the OU functions, but yes, looking at the code, if you include this file in your MSP directory, before running the `configtxgen` tool, then this will get included into the configuration block for the channel.

@greg.haskins  Can we use this patch https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12799/ for enabling mutual TLS for node chaincode . later we can take up the task of building the client tls certs in the chaincode image ?

@greg.haskins @muralisr @cbf hi guys - could you please help me understand the practical purpose of FAB-2122 / CS6059?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:31:34 GMT):<br/>
It seems to me that a consortium should be able to deploy chaincode applications that meet the interface. Of course, a consortium might want to approve the chaincodes that are deployed consortium-wide (e.g., possibly the result of 3rd party code review). As an example, distributed as a whitelist of hashes. However FAB-2122 and stripping binaries doesn't achieve this.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:34:20 GMT):<br/>
More strongly, I think we should be able to deploy artificats that are output from our build system rather than submitting source code that peers then compile.

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:34:48 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda understand that you are interested in that, but note that FAB-2122 is specific to the type=GOLANG type
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:35:25 GMT):<br/>
and type=GOLANG is specific to golang-source payloads
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:35:36 GMT):<br/>
i think you are referring to that other thread where you want a new deployment type
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:36:27 GMT):<br/>
There is another thread on that topic but I was trying to review the prior history to understand the current status.

@greg.haskins if you may allow me to pile on ;-) https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12799/ is also pending your decision whether to let this one go in as-is (so node.js and golang chaincode are processed exactly the same, by passing the client key and cert on the command line), and use a separate CR to address your concerns and fix it for all chaincode types
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 21:32:12 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 21:33:26 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix im still confused by your statement on that
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 21:33:38 GMT):<br/>
afaict, the other platforms inject the tls using docker-api
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 21:34:24 GMT):<br/>
oh i see what you mean
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 21:34:29 GMT):<br/>
hmm, someone mustve changed that

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=SAcmewwQLJMLqvvw7) @Vrai1127 I'd suggest you look into the ongoing work on Private Data (FAB-1151)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 22:45:56 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix ah, i see...that snuck in recently

thats not the right way to go, though, so lets not perpetuate it
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 23:08:14 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins can you recommend an alternative? not sure what you meant by using docker-api
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 23:16:07 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix on mobile so can't get links.  I think it's called the "upload api" in the docker engine spec.  I use it in the container build logic if you search in there
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 23:16:50 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:33:35 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda so, the overall problems with the BINARY proposal, aside from the fact that I am still not convinced that obscure code makes sense, is that it was way too fragile and non deterministic to do it that way
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:34:10 GMT):<br/>
my suggestion is to not try to use a native binary, but rather ride on something like JVM/LLVM
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:34:17 GMT):<br/>
that would take care of at least part of it
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:34:19 GMT):<br/>
JVM/LLVM is not viable
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:34:27 GMT):<br/>
The source code is Go
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:34:58 GMT):<br/>
let me understand the fragile / non-deterministic comment better
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:35:09 GMT):<br/>
this is the install command, so non-deterministic isn't applicable
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:35:35 GMT):<br/>
im just saying what approach I would advise for an obfuscation approach that still allows you to be $arch platform neutral
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:36:00 GMT):<br/>
Go outputs binaries for all the platforms so the easiest way to handle is to include all the binaries
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:36:00 GMT):<br/>
Go outputs binaries for all the platforms so the easiest way to handle is to include all the binaries resulting from x-compile
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:36:07 GMT):<br/>
(the latest patch does this)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:36:57 GMT):<br/>
let me put it this way: is there a variant of running "go build" that you can think of that would produce a sufficiently neutral payload that is independent of $arch/$distro?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:37:10 GMT):<br/>
is that conveyed to the framework?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:37:14 GMT):<br/>
yes - x-compile
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:37:16 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:37:22 GMT):<br/>
can someone else reproduce your binary?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:37:44 GMT):<br/>
your contract isnt very useful unless multiple parties can verify its terms
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:37:47 GMT):<br/>
The build system and code reviewers
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:38:07 GMT):<br/>
Code review should be decoupled from deployment
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:38:09 GMT):<br/>
as a code reviewer, how do I know binary X relates to code base Y?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:38:49 GMT):<br/>
what if code reviewer A has a different version of glibc, or nswitch, etc, etc on their system?

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:39:10 GMT):<br/>
build the code in the same docker container
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:39:18 GMT):<br/>
bottom line, fabric is a FOSS framework...you can always fork if if you want to run your network that way
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:39:41 GMT):<br/>
but the proposal is way too fragile for upstream merging (IMO)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:39:45 GMT):<br/>
Fabric is a platform that a consortium agrees to run and the consortium defines appropriate processes
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:40:08 GMT):<br/>
sure, so your consortium can run a variant that accepts BINARY=4 payloads
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:40:27 GMT):<br/>
but it would need to be much more robust to go upstream (again, IMO)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:40:42 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand your objection - seems philiosophical
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:40:59 GMT):<br/>
not philosophical at all...
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:41:04 GMT):<br/>
the proposal isn't fragile - it handles multi-arch
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:41:27 GMT):<br/>
you are placing a requirement on consortiums that doesn't exist - that chaincode must be sent as source code
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:41:28 GMT):<br/>
you basically are proposing a weak contract on a interface that needs a strong one
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:41:46 GMT):<br/>
I am not placing any requirements on consortiums...
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:42:04 GMT):<br/>
I am saying, as one of the maintainers of the code base, I dont think that patch is a good idea for upstream merging
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:42:08 GMT):<br/>
why
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:42:28 GMT):<br/>
multi-arch is supported
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:42:48 GMT):<br/>
because, saying "type=BINARY" is a pretty weak description for the payload juxtaposed against all the variants of the peer in which it may encounter
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:43:15 GMT):<br/>
any suggestion for a better type description?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:46:35 GMT):<br/>
I would probably start with the way any ABI is negotiated: either versioned or feature tagged
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:47:06 GMT):<br/>
As an example, what about including as source-code a loader of the binary
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:47:16 GMT):<br/>
this source-code is compiled against the shim
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:47:28 GMT):<br/>
and meets the interface
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:47:40 GMT):<br/>
the binary isn't executable in that case
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:47:47 GMT):<br/>
but I would also strongly suggest a more platform neutral approach...there isnt a way today to negotiate the potentially infinite heterogeneous composition of your network apriori
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:48:11 GMT):<br/>
what if we add ARM7 in v1.1
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:48:26 GMT):<br/>
or update the glibc, but only half the nodes update
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:48:32 GMT):<br/>
etc etc
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:48:36 GMT):<br/>
its fragile
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:48:39 GMT):<br/>
these are closed consortiums
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:49:02 GMT):<br/>
if arm7 becomes a platform in a consortium, then support is added
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:49:34 GMT):<br/>
well, again, that consortium can choose to patch the support...i see no problem in that...then the heterogeneity problem doesnt need to be addressed
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:50:02 GMT):<br/>
another alternative is to implement it as system chaincode and embed it in the peer that the consortium runs
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:50:23 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=3EqmZWiYDQ7CPfQqD) 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:51:02 GMT):<br/>
the objection was the interface contract - i think this can be addressed with the source code loader
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:51:12 GMT):<br/>
I don't buy the argument the fragile argument
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:51:12 GMT):<br/>
I don't buy the fragile argument
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:51:23 GMT):<br/>
ok, you dont have to
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:51:38 GMT):<br/>
even CC doesn't necessarily compiled to every platform
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:51:38 GMT):<br/>
even CC doesn't necessarily compile to every platform
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:51:54 GMT):<br/>
agreed, and I raised that ABI issue already
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:52:00 GMT):<br/>
and plan on fixing it
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:52:04 GMT):<br/>
are you saying that only langauages that compile to every target should be included as environments
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:52:04 GMT):<br/>
are you saying that only languages that compile to every target should be included as platforms
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:52:38 GMT):<br/>
compilation of CC can already fail - you can't guarantee this
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:53:07 GMT):<br/>
i am suggesting that golang binaries are a poor/fragile vehicle for heterogeneous execution
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:53:32 GMT):<br/>
Not if multiple archs are included in the package
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:53:50 GMT):<br/>
It's an implementation detail on who produced it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:53:59 GMT):<br/>
I am also suggesting that non-deterministic generation is illogical for chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:54:00 GMT):<br/>
Same compiler
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:54:08 GMT):<br/>
non-deterministic?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:54:42 GMT):<br/>
Install has no deterministic requirements - it is run individually on each peer
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:54:57 GMT):<br/>
there is no endorsement
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:55:05 GMT):<br/>
im saying that if multiple parties need a smart contract, those parties need to be able to evaluate both what the contract guarantees, and that they are actually interacting with it
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:55:22 GMT):<br/>
Up to the consortium to decide how to handle
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:55:42 GMT):<br/>
sure..so, run the consortium however you like
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:55:45 GMT):<br/>
And submitting source code doesn't do anything
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:55:49 GMT):<br/>
patch the code to accept binaries...totally fine
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:55:58 GMT):<br/>
Without real reviews of the source code nothing happens
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:56:05 GMT):<br/>
its not about review
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:56:10 GMT):<br/>
of course it is
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:56:14 GMT):<br/>
(well, it is, but not in this context
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:56:24 GMT):<br/>
no, its about attestation
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:56:37 GMT):<br/>
yes - an expert review needs to examine the code
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:56:43 GMT):<br/>
this has nothing to do with compilation on the peer
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:56:50 GMT):<br/>
you cant have attestation without a deterministic relationship between source and payload
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:57:06 GMT):<br/>
compile the code in the same environment with the same compiler - reviewer does the same
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:57:11 GMT):<br/>
doesn't need to be done on a peer
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:57:36 GMT):<br/>
thats an extra constraint that can't be enforced simply by saying "I accept type=BINARY"
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:58:00 GMT):<br/>
there should be a whitelist feature but this is a general feature not just for binary
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:58:04 GMT):<br/>
saying "I accept type=BINARY" means you are relying on an external process to enforce robustness
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:58:12 GMT):<br/>
same with source code
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:58:14 GMT):<br/>
and that is fragile
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:58:36 GMT):<br/>
no, its not the same
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:58:47 GMT):<br/>
if no one reviews before instantiation on each peer it is
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:58:52 GMT):<br/>
*on each peer*
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:58:55 GMT):<br/>
because each peer can take an identical source payload, hash it, and the compile it
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:59:08 GMT):<br/>
install is sent individually to each peer
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:59:23 GMT):<br/>
what's the protection if different source code is sent to one of them
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:59:25 GMT):<br/>
that doesnt matter though
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:59:33 GMT):<br/>
different source is different hash
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:59:42 GMT):<br/>
different binary is different hash
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:59:54 GMT):<br/>
yes, you are making my point
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:00:12 GMT):<br/>
we both agree that if someone does the review then things are good and if they don't then they aren't
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:00:17 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:00:23 GMT):<br/>
no, we are talking about different things
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:00:30 GMT):<br/>
if no one reviews the source code on the peer it's the same result
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:00:48 GMT):<br/>
review is one part, attestation is a different part, and determinism links them together
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:01:07 GMT):<br/>
but you can deterministically build the binary
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:01:17 GMT):<br/>
only with an external process
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:01:23 GMT):<br/>
if you are careful, sure, maybe
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:01:25 GMT):<br/>
reviewing code is an external process
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:01:37 GMT):<br/>
forget about the review
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:01:38 GMT):<br/>
distribute the same docker image - i don't see the issue
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:01:46 GMT):<br/>
the issue is relating the review to what the peer is executing
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:02:00 GMT):<br/>
yes - whether sent as binary or source code, that must be reviewed
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:02:19 GMT):<br/>
sure, AND you need to be able to relate the review to what is executing
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:02:25 GMT):<br/>
sure - via the hash
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:02:40 GMT):<br/>
yes...and therein lies the relationship to determinism
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:02:47 GMT):<br/>
but source code sent to the peer doesn't change the picture
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:02:59 GMT):<br/>
yes, it does
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:03:23 GMT):<br/>
if i have a reviewer reviews the code, deterministically produces the same binary then no issue
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:03:23 GMT):<br/>
if i have a reviewer review the code, deterministically produces the same binary then no issue
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:03:51 GMT):<br/>
IFF, then thats _one_ issue
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:03:59 GMT):<br/>
but you still have others
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:04:13 GMT):<br/>
I don't have an arch issue
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:04:27 GMT):<br/>
no, you dont _think_ you have an arch issue ;)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:04:32 GMT):<br/>
I know I don't :)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:04:51 GMT):<br/>
The source is Go and I can cross-compile to all the archs
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:04:59 GMT):<br/>
that alone isnt enough
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:05:08 GMT):<br/>
its not just $arch
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:05:31 GMT):<br/>
$distro matters...$version matters, lots of things you havent thought of, matter
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:05:42 GMT):<br/>
its just a bad idea: ive seen this movie
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:06:07 GMT):<br/>
On the interface issue, I can supply the source code that loads the object code - that source code is compiled against the interface
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:06:15 GMT):<br/>
distro doesn't matter - its run in docker
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:06:35 GMT):<br/>
one of the benefits of wrapping the result in docker is that I don't have to worry about this
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:06:36 GMT):<br/>
so tell me, what does "runs in docker" mean to you?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:06:56 GMT):<br/>
I know what environment to expect and what files are available
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:07:10 GMT):<br/>
aka distro
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:07:44 GMT):<br/>
I know that it runs in the host OS and that it uses the host kernel
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:07:51 GMT):<br/>
for all $arch? for all $kernel, for all $dockerd?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:08:27 GMT):<br/>
i'm not saying "it cant work"...im just saying "its fragile" and thus I dont think this is a good general solution
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:08:39 GMT):<br/>
why is it critical to go upstream?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:09:06 GMT):<br/>
I think issues that come up can be resolved by an object loader, as needed
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:09:19 GMT):<br/>
if you want a good model to follow here, I would look at how JVM negotiation takes place
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:09:37 GMT):<br/>
e.g. --target/--source 1.6/1.7/1.8 etc
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:09:52 GMT):<br/>
if you had that kind of facility, maybe
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:09:54 GMT):<br/>
sorry don't follow
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:10:18 GMT):<br/>
like a constraint matcher on which binary to load?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:10:19 GMT):<br/>
you are familiar with jvm environment in general, i assume
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:10:43 GMT):<br/>
yes, like I mentioned before, version/feature negotiation
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:11:02 GMT):<br/>
I can build a .jar for, say, 1.7 and then run it on jvm 1.9
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:11:12 GMT):<br/>
it negotiates down to emulate 1.7 based on the payload
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:11:19 GMT):<br/>
Sure
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:11:59 GMT):<br/>
I had been thinking of a simpler constraint matcher (like go dep), but you are talking at the feature level
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:12:18 GMT):<br/>
i.e., take the highest version that meets the constraints
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:12:22 GMT):<br/>
if you had a robust feature/version negotiation AND a way to deterministically map from source to payload, I would be more open to the idea
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:12:43 GMT):<br/>
without that, I dont think it makes sense to consider in a general framework
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:12:47 GMT):<br/>
am i missing something on the deterministic map?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:12:54 GMT):<br/>
it seems, yes
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:13:29 GMT):<br/>
let me play your argument back to you
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:14:24 GMT):<br/>
you are saying "i have a well controlled group (consortium) and we agree to play nice such that everyone knows that type=BINARY was generated with process XYZ"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:14:47 GMT):<br/>
and therefore my determinism is derived from everyone doing process XYZ
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:15:00 GMT):<br/>
and was process XYZ was appropriately review and the source code in that process was also appropriately reviewed
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:15:00 GMT):<br/>
and was process XYZ was appropriately reviewed and the source code in that process was also appropriately reviewed
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:15:00 GMT):<br/>
and  process XYZ was appropriately reviewed and the source code in that process was also appropriately reviewed
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:15:14 GMT):<br/>
sure, that goes without saying
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:15:23 GMT):<br/>
but heres the problem
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:16:38 GMT):<br/>
as a general purpose platform, we dont have that luxury of assuming everyone will know that is on them to sort out
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:16:48 GMT):<br/>
and if they dont know its on them to sort out, its fragile
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:17:31 GMT):<br/>
id rather it be an intrinsic property of the platform E.g. "I am a jar for jvm 1.7"
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:17:32 GMT):<br/>
And I then I make the argument that this is still true with source-code based approaches
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:17:45 GMT):<br/>
and the platform knows what it is, knows what to do with it, or can reject it if it doesnt
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:17:47 GMT):<br/>
(if each participant doesn't review)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:18:02 GMT):<br/>
it's so easy not to review right now
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:18:06 GMT):<br/>
ok, I will try to explain this one more time
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:18:10 GMT):<br/>
install and insantiate
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:18:21 GMT):<br/>
its not about review, its about attestation between what was reviewed, and what is executing
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:18:32 GMT):<br/>
do this experiment
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:18:43 GMT):<br/>
write "hello world" in golang
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:19:34 GMT):<br/>
now run "go build" and hash it with say, shasum
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:20:23 GMT):<br/>
repeat that process on every system ...even keeping things like "$arch" constant, do you think you will get the exact shasum on every system
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:21:01 GMT):<br/>
say, OSX 10.12 verses ubuntu 16.04, verses alpine, vs OSX 10.11, or OSX 10.12 with todays patch, or .....
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:21:04 GMT):<br/>
get the picture?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:21:21 GMT):<br/>
that binary is almost assuredly not going to generate the same shasum
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:21:31 GMT):<br/>
but its the same code
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:22:12 GMT):<br/>
even tiny things like libc.so are going to completely hose you
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:22:44 GMT):<br/>
i.e. native binaries are poor vehicles for distributed systems that rely on determinism
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:23:48 GMT):<br/>
so, if I review "hello world" and you review "hello world", but you give me a binary that shas differently than the one I produce, how do I know you didnt really send me "bonjour" instead?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:25:45 GMT):<br/>
i've been doing this a long time: im pretty skeptical that would offer even a modicum of determinism
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:26:33 GMT):<br/>
and if its not deterministic, its of little value as a contract vehicle
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:47:30 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins fyi - result of experiment .. only two machines though
</p>

For simplicity, I just used the first one I saw that already installed Go 1.9 (https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/ ; https://github.com/docker-library/golang/blob/94e49ca93c5bbf172e462cea8872c77f9bc08c10/1.9/stretch/Dockerfile)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=XJ6SeFSitSAWnxFtQ) ok - I always assumed I would create the same environment
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:09:30 GMT):<br/>
any thoughts about this line w.r.t. determinism?: https://github.com/docker-library/golang/blob/94e49ca93c5bbf172e462cea8872c77f9bc08c10/1.9/stretch/Dockerfile#L4
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:09:32 GMT):<br/>
(not that I would use this one in particular)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:09:42 GMT):<br/>
how about running "ldd ./src"
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:10:03 GMT):<br/>
the dockerfile that one would actually use would need to lock the apt repo sources for example
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:10:30 GMT):<br/>
ok, so maybe "use docker is process X, and use fixed containers is process Y
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:10:37 GMT):<br/>
what else is in the mix?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:10:45 GMT):<br/>
what is that binary linked against?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:10:45 GMT):<br/>
but my point was just to see if the same docker image across two OSes with Golang resulted in the same

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:13:31 GMT):<br/>
do you see any instances of dlopen in the symbol table?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:15:32 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:15:56 GMT):<br/>
(if this is sufficient: readelf --symbols src | grep -i dlopen)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:16:27 GMT):<br/>
not sure...the real test will be to try to have the image try to gethostbyname()
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:17:08 GMT):<br/>
usually when you link to glibc, even statically, it will embed a call to dlopen the libnss.so stuff
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:17:18 GMT):<br/>
depending on how it was compiled
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:20:05 GMT):<br/>
if the container you used happens to be close enough to the libnss.so available in the baseos container, it may get past that hurdle too
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:20:41 GMT):<br/>
assuming we dont go to FROM scratch/busybox again, which we did in the past

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:28:29 GMT):<br/>
ok, now take "hello2" and put it in a "FROM scratch" container
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:28:56 GMT):<br/>
(actually put both the static link and dyn linked ones in, just for fun)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:32:16 GMT):<br/>
something like this ```FROM scratch

WORKDIR /usr/local/app

COPY hello2 .

CMD ./hello2```
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:35:54 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:36:30 GMT):<br/>
i hadn't bothered with cmd, but did this:
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:36:31 GMT):<br/>
➜  d docker run -it 172603008db3 /hello
hello world
➜  d docker run -it 172603008db3 /hello2
standard_init_linux.go:187: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:36:52 GMT):<br/>
sure, thats fine
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:37:35 GMT):<br/>
its hard to tell from the output, but I think that bottom one is an example of my point
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:38:17 GMT):<br/>
its likely dying because it cant find things like /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:38:45 GMT):<br/>
so, you can partially mitigate that by forcing the link as static
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:39:00 GMT):<br/>
but, I suspect your net.LookupHost will still fail
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:39:23 GMT):<br/>
Those .so would be in the peer-created docker image
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:39:46 GMT):<br/>
anyway, main point is that even with docker normalizing the tool chain, you still have decoupled environments
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:39:57 GMT):<br/>
and theres no negotiation of this as far as I can tell
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:40:13 GMT):<br/>
If I submit the source code for the peer to compile, the same thing happen
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:40:18 GMT):<br/>
those would really be the two main things I would want to see addressed
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:40:34 GMT):<br/>
well, no, because the peer compiles it to its environment
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:41:28 GMT):<br/>
for instance, if one peer has /lib/libc.musl-x86_64.so.1 and another has /lib/libc.glibc-x86_64.so.1, each is linked locally
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:41:28 GMT):<br/>
for instance, if one peer has /lib/libc.musl-x86_64.so.1 and another has /lib/libc.glibc-ppcle64.so.1, each is linked locally
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:41:58 GMT):<br/>
Is that expected?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:42:02 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:42:05 GMT):<br/>
in the docker image
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:42:17 GMT):<br/>
not on the peer because that's not relevant
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:42:27 GMT):<br/>
in the docker image environment that the CC is injected into
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:42:31 GMT):<br/>
yes, its expected
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:42:54 GMT):<br/>
even in just the simple example of heterogeneous $arch
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:43:23 GMT):<br/>
the ppcle team could very well have built their container with a different lineage
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:44:10 GMT):<br/>
in fact, they do today, though they all have debian roots so its "sorta" normalized
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:44:15 GMT):<br/>
but you cant bank on that
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:44:42 GMT):<br/>
does bring up a question about even with source submitted if everything always works then
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:44:51 GMT):<br/>
also consider things like we base on debian/ubuntu today, but I know the redhat folks are busy porting it over to RH ecosystem
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:45:14 GMT):<br/>
so you could easily have a network were some peers are ubuntu and others are rhel based, for example
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:45:26 GMT):<br/>
or, the next drop could be alpine based, whatever
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:45:34 GMT):<br/>
(not scripts like node, but source that is compiled)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:45:43 GMT):<br/>
(like the existing golang platform)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:45:54 GMT):<br/>
yes, so even the source needs better ABI management than we have today
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:45:59 GMT):<br/>
i have been arguing for this
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:46:20 GMT):<br/>
but the problem is greatly exacerbated by the proposition of binary payloads
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:46:23 GMT):<br/>
thus my objections
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:47:50 GMT):<br/>
unless the binary is static linked...
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:48:07 GMT):<br/>
not to shamelessly plug my own project, but I was trying to tackle this problem in chaintool with the notion of "platform specifier"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:48:12 GMT):<br/>
http://fabric-chaintool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platforms/golang/#platform-specifier
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:48:32 GMT):<br/>
something like that is similar to the "jar v1.7 on jvm v1.9"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:48:37 GMT):<br/>
notion
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:48:52 GMT):<br/>
To be honest, when I first heard about that tool - before reading the description, i had thought it would create packaged binaries from me

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:49:06 GMT):<br/>
even static linked isnt a panecea...static linking is really weak in golang/glibc
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:49:31 GMT):<br/>
theres that nasty problem with gethostbyname to contend with
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:49:32 GMT):<br/>
that I would have something to plug into my build system :)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:49:46 GMT):<br/>
and theres still the problem that you cant predict the $arch that might be in the network
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:50:13 GMT):<br/>
<= fabric supported archs :)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:50:41 GMT):<br/>
these problems are less so for binaries derived from go
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:50:43 GMT):<br/>
yes...but to my point...each one of those constraints are one more point of fragility
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:51:03 GMT):<br/>
and trust me, if its there, users will try to shove @##$ into it, and then we get the hard to decipher bug reports
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:53:07 GMT):<br/>
so, I would really rather see a strong story about deterministic payloads, ideally universal $arch/$distro neutrality, and feature/compat negotiation
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:54:58 GMT):<br/>
I'm still wondering about a mechanism to bring in a binary library that is loaded by submitted source (that the peer compiles).
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:55:40 GMT):<br/>
that seems more like an alternate way to do the same concept, with the same concerns
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:56:11 GMT):<br/>
i still think you are barking up the wrong tree with native object code
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:57:01 GMT):<br/>
if you want to deploy obfuscated uberjars on top of a JVM, written in clojure, im all over that
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:57:05 GMT):<br/>
;)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:57:23 GMT):<br/>
yeh ha.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:57:54 GMT):<br/>
if my team and I can ever get some spare cycles, we'll be tackling that
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:58:22 GMT):<br/>
The obfuscated part?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:59:00 GMT):<br/>
well, my interest in is clojure chaincode in general...but I can see how that could be extended to .jar deployment model fairly trivially and without the issues I am raising now
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:59:24 GMT):<br/>
Ah - I was curious if you had an obfuscation use case :)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:59:39 GMT):<br/>
it would at least solve 2 of the 3 concerns cleanly, and the third could be managed I think
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:00:01 GMT):<br/>
its not high on my radar now, but I can understand why it interest you
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:01:13 GMT):<br/>
anyway, that is why I initially suggested the JVM/LLVM route
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:01:15 GMT):<br/>
From the above, it does seem that object code produced specifically from Go has potential though (still pushing)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:01:33 GMT):<br/>
yeah, the problem is that it "feels" like that when you first get into it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:01:49 GMT):<br/>
but it leads to disappointment/despair ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:02:01 GMT):<br/>
I felt good so far ;)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:02:32 GMT):<br/>
look in JIRA for my foray into busybox optimization

doh!
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:03:48 GMT):<br/>
thats why I brought up the dlopen thing...thats the part that screwed me
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:04:49 GMT):<br/>
the other route might be to go in the other direction
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:04:58 GMT):<br/>
docker containers exported
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:05:26 GMT):<br/>
See this is where I think object code that is loaded from a submitted source has an advantage (that object code could be very simple and not have dependencies)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:05:31 GMT):<br/>
but even that I suspect is fragile in this ecosystem
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:06:05 GMT):<br/>
(simple meaning not needing to link to things)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:06:29 GMT):<br/>
yes, and that is why I was steering you to xVM code, because it has those properties AND not the other issues

Codebase is in Go... I didn't see a good path on llvm...
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:06:59 GMT):<br/>
LLVM is actually really cool, though I dont know how golang support is on it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:07:16 GMT):<br/>
I know historically its been strongest in the C++ space
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:07:23 GMT):<br/>
but the model is awesome for this stuff
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:07:25 GMT):<br/>
there is a project but it doesn't look too active
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:07:37 GMT):<br/>
i only know it from swift
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:08:12 GMT):<br/>
yeah...its been awhile but there is the notion of a discrete front-end and back-end
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:08:34 GMT):<br/>
(and I was wondering how well obfuscation actually ends up working if you use something like llvm)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:08:45 GMT):<br/>
so you can have something like clang compile C++ to .llvm and then JIT it on the target platform in the llvm runtime
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:09:15 GMT):<br/>
ive never looked but in theory its no different than x86_64 object code
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:09:32 GMT):<br/>
its just like a different $arch, and one that can be JIT'ed to a host $arch with high performance
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:10:08 GMT):<br/>
im sure you can strip debug symbols, etc, to get a similar surface as standard machine code
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 03:10:23 GMT):<br/>
anyway, I digress

@troyronda ah, CGO_ENABLED=0 is cheating
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:05:32 GMT):<br/>
the shim is not compatible
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:05:57 GMT):<br/>
Shim is not compatible?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:05:58 GMT):<br/>
and if you dont have CGO_ENABLED=0, you are screwed because it becomes coupled to libc version you compiled on
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:06:04 GMT):<br/>
no, unfortunately
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:06:11 GMT):<br/>
its all coming back to me now
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:06:32 GMT):<br/>
CGO is required, CGO requires xlibc, xlibc binds you to unportable binary
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:06:56 GMT):<br/>
confused... shouldn't all the shim need to do is enable protobufs back to the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:07:33 GMT):<br/>
one of the direct/transitive crypto libraries that the shim uses/provides requires CGO, IIRC
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:07:59 GMT):<br/>
My solution with a binary loader is unaffected :)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:08:22 GMT):<br/>
i dont think so
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:08:48 GMT):<br/>
shim would be compiled to the source code that was submitted ... the rest of the code would be object code
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:08:53 GMT):<br/>
anyway, point being, you are dancing with fragility
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:08:57 GMT):<br/>
there are many ways to lose
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:09:14 GMT):<br/>
(remember in that solution, object code is submitted not a binary)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:09:32 GMT):<br/>
the binary is created similar to now, but linked to an additional library (or loads a submitted .so)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:09:49 GMT):<br/>
this seems to be the most elegant mechanism to me
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:09:49 GMT):<br/>
have you tried using .so's with golang?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:10:28 GMT):<br/>
I want to see how golang plugins look in 1.9
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:10:46 GMT):<br/>
yes, that is the most promising for what you are proposing
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:10:55 GMT):<br/>
i can tell you its basically a non-starter pre v1.9
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:11:16 GMT):<br/>
BUT, I also think we need to get away from decoupling the shim from the code
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:11:28 GMT):<br/>
so you are reintroducing a problem I am trying to get rid of
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:12:00 GMT):<br/>
Just an example of how something could work against what exists
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:12:36 GMT):<br/>
If there was a decoupling for the source code version, then a decoupling would exist for this solution too
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:13:05 GMT):<br/>
(since I am basically saying you could use the golang source code version but allow object code linking)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:13:05 GMT):<br/>
no no, what i am saying is: decoupling for source is how we do it today, and its a broken model
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:13:15 GMT):<br/>
I am advocating we _stop_ doing that
</p>

https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5177
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:13:38 GMT):<br/>
the ABI management should be at the GRPC level, not chaincode->shim level
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:14:00 GMT):<br/>
yes I get that - and that would be my gut as well
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:14:21 GMT):<br/>
but i feel that it reinforces the point that CC applications are simply seperate services from the peer
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:14:34 GMT):<br/>
and then you could ask why is there an install command at all
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:14:58 GMT):<br/>
not following your last comment
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:15:10 GMT):<br/>
isnt "install" simply a way to distribute your payload?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:15:21 GMT):<br/>
yes - there are many ways to do that today
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:15:22 GMT):<br/>
what does that have to do with its runtime environment or topology?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:16:43 GMT):<br/>
(sorry it's a digression)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:17:48 GMT):<br/>
so, i agree that the BINARY proposal similarly solves FAB-5177, but the problem is the other issues I pointed out
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:17:49 GMT):<br/>
>  the ABI management should be at the GRPC level, not chaincode->shim level 
What do you mean? (Hi :) )

greetings @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:19:12 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm its coverd ad nauseam in FAB-5177, so I wont repeat it here
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:19:37 GMT):<br/>
btw I was thinking about a similar topic - if we had a more easy to use API between the peer and the shim, we could have simply declared an API that the peer would've used to serve a shim, via protobuf, and then just declared, that you can simply install a *container* into the peer and that *container* would be simply spawned.
What do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:19:43 GMT):<br/>
in particular, read my last comment

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:20:11 GMT):<br/>
of course - this is only in theory and in retrospect, no something we have the manpower / time for IMO
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:21:21 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm as far as that API is concerned, we more or less have that today
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:21:30 GMT):<br/>
no, the API sucks. 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:21:33 GMT):<br/>
theres a GRPC contract between the chaincode and peer
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:21:39 GMT):<br/>
ok, well, thats a different problem
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:21:39 GMT):<br/>
yeah I think it's not good
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:21:55 GMT):<br/>
thats fair...but ignore that for a second
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:21:59 GMT):<br/>
lets say it didnt suck
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:22:01 GMT):<br/>
but that's what you get when you just add more and more features
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:22:01 GMT):<br/>
but that's what you get when you just add more and more features. if we knew the features ahead...
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:22:38 GMT):<br/>
all I was saying is that its easier to do ABI management between two GRPC endpoints than it is to do ABI management between a golang application and a golang library
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:22:50 GMT):<br/>
I totally agree 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:22:51 GMT):<br/>
thats it, really
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:23:13 GMT):<br/>
if the GRPC contract sucks, lets fix that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:23:37 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it's that easy. compatibility, etc. 
I'd like to see a "ng" (next-gen) chaincode or something
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:23:39 GMT):<br/>
that would do just that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:23:44 GMT):<br/>
and we can provide with a toolbox
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:23:47 GMT):<br/>
to make it easy
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:23:50 GMT):<br/>
and examples, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:24:32 GMT):<br/>
but I'm now acting as an armchair economist, etc. 
I don't think it'll actually happen soon
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:25:43 GMT):<br/>
The issue I was having above is how to deal with & distribute Golang CC that isn't being compiled by the peer (without getting into a fork)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:25:54 GMT):<br/>
I agree with the grpc point
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:26:02 GMT):<br/>
if we have a chaincode type: container
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:26:04 GMT):<br/>
that'd be easy ;)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:26:57 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm you are essentially making the same argument as @troyronda 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:26:59 GMT):<br/>
would this type imply that the container was installed out-of-band of the install command
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:27:05 GMT):<br/>
except his "container" is a static golang binary
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:27:17 GMT):<br/>
which is injected into a container by the peer ;)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:27:21 GMT):<br/>
(well, a multi-arch golang binary
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:27:44 GMT):<br/>
but there are a few problems to sort out
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:28:12 GMT):<br/>
yes longer version: multi-arch golang binary, that can have the minimum source code to link against the chaincode shim library, and is then injected into a container 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:28:24 GMT):<br/>
the minimum source code bit is how we got on this GRPC topic :)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:28:40 GMT):<br/>
yeah..and I would drop that part of it honestly
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:28:46 GMT):<br/>
i think its taking it in the wrong direction
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:29:02 GMT):<br/>
I'm only saying that due to the current situation - not because i like it :)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:29:11 GMT):<br/>
I like the notion of "something that just needs a GRPC endpoint" which is closer to your original BINARY propsal
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:29:16 GMT):<br/>
got it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:29:49 GMT):<br/>
but as I said, I am trying to eradicate that problem, not cement it as a requirement to solve a different problem ;)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:31:34 GMT):<br/>
but do you at least see my concern w.r.t. an "auto-vendored" source payload being the most robust way to solve the various problems I highlighted?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:32:16 GMT):<br/>
of course - ideally it would simply be a grpc contract and more like micro-services
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:32:16 GMT):<br/>
of course - ideally it would simply be a grpc contract
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:32:39 GMT):<br/>
right...its just that golang isnt a great way to do this
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:33:18 GMT):<br/>
(IMO)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:33:27 GMT):<br/>
which part?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:33:53 GMT):<br/>
well, just in general, as a universal binary
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:34:29 GMT):<br/>
the golang folks somewhat tried with the --static thing, but its a bit half-arsed
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:35:06 GMT):<br/>
they did a great job with the ubiquitous x-compile out of the can
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:35:09 GMT):<br/>
Golang has much easier x-compile than many other solutions - its not byte code but its nice
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:35:14 GMT):<br/>
thats probably the best x-compile ive ever seen
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:35:24 GMT):<br/>
agree
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:35:24 GMT):<br/>
agreed, I agree its the best
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:35:28 GMT):<br/>
but its not perfect
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:36:27 GMT):<br/>
one of the mistakes I think that was made was they took the integration to 85% and then let things like g++/clang bleed through
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:36:32 GMT):<br/>
that causes some of the problems ive seen
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:36:48 GMT):<br/>
and things like CGO, etc, being another
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:39:43 GMT):<br/>
yeh...
</p>

btw - the reason I'm pushing so much on this topic is that I believe that you should be able to use an off-the-shelf fabric peer and then simply add-on the specific behaviors for a consortium - those specific behaviors having appropriate reviews. I don't think having to have forks of the base system is a good-long steady-state strategy (so I end up believing in a strong base that is extensible). I also think it's important to enable an ecosystem of independent developers of CC/consortium applications...

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:48:15 GMT):<br/>
thats understandable...but I still dont think the review argument applies here
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:48:43 GMT):<br/>
perhaps part of the problem is we changed the instance addressing a while back which weakened the relationship a bit

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:50:12 GMT):<br/>

like I said, I could see how some kind of uberjar-on-jvm scenario could meet all those criteria...i think golang is a little weak in this regard
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:51:16 GMT):<br/>
so its not the concepts per se, just the impl

@greg.haskins @yacovm can we get clarity on what's needed to address Greg's concern over passing the client key/cert to the chaincode container please. I believe Greg is advocating for that to be done during the docker image build, but Yacov said this should be done at the time of launching the container instance (so each launch will result in a different key/cert pair)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:06:04 GMT):<br/>
just want to bring us together to sort this out so we can move this along
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:06:23 GMT):<br/>
to be clear: I also agree it should be done at launch, I am just saying it should be done via upload-api and not parameters
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:06:33 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:06:41 GMT):<br/>
I had originally done this during cotnainer build when I didnt know about the upload-api
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:06:59 GMT):<br/>
which was suboptimal, but I didnt know how else to handle at the time
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:07:31 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm snuck the parameter one into GOLANG ;)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:07:35 GMT):<br/>
but I think we should fix both
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:07:39 GMT):<br/>
Oh yes
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:07:52 GMT):<br/>
right that should be done regardless of the chaincode type
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:08:01 GMT):<br/>
agreed
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:08:24 GMT):<br/>
so i think we now have clarity, let me dive into that (Yacov is pre-occupied with other work at the moment)

hmm, so it's marked as low, are we sure we want this to be addressed at this point in time for v1.1?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:14:26 GMT):<br/>
can we live with what Yacov has for v1.1, and address FAB-4447 for both the server and client TLS materials at a later time?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:15:19 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:15:51 GMT):<br/>
I would say fix it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:16:13 GMT):<br/>
its not like we are in an -rc10 freeze to ship
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:18:08 GMT):<br/>
would you be ok with a partial fix in v1.1, to only use the upload-api approach for the client key/cert, and address FAB-4447 (the server ca cert) later?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:19:16 GMT):<br/>
so leave what we have for the server cert alone, but make sure the new capabilities w.r.t mutual TLS follows best practices?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:33:43 GMT):<br/>
sorry, was OTP
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:35:46 GMT):<br/>
I havent had a chance to review, but im guessing the point of the mutual TLS changes was to recognize that both the client (chaincode) and server (peer) need a common trust root.  The path of least resistance is probably to have the peer inject a key-pair/cert for the client into the client, along with the peer cert
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:35:55 GMT):<br/>
i assume that is more or less what @yacovm already did
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:36:07 GMT):<br/>
now its just a question of vehicle to transfer those assets
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:36:46 GMT):<br/>
I had previously added the server-side injection at container build time, but that is way too early
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:36:47 GMT):<br/>
The idea is to have a strict mapping between the chaincode *name* and its cert
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:37:03 GMT):<br/>
Each shim container gets its own cert
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:37:29 GMT):<br/>
so what I would suggest is any TLS material (server or client) be injected right before launch, via upload API
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:37:47 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good. Into the file system?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:37:57 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm yeah
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:38:22 GMT):<br/>
some well known location, like /etc/hyperledger/fabric/chaincode/tls or something
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:38:59 GMT):<br/>
Ok sounds good to me
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:39:32 GMT):<br/>
Also shoukd remove some code that i wrote that does base64 encoding, always good to remove code
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:42:27 GMT):<br/>
yes, pls
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:44:13 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm not sure you saw this, but I posted an example of what I mean: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/c4c977db678fc9153e1ee37423d5eae828ec87f7/core/chaincode/platforms/util/utils.go#L191
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:45:06 GMT):<br/>
I use that technique to move src/binary payloads into/out of the container during build...similar approach could be used to inject something like [peer.crt, chaincode.key, chaincode.crt]
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:46:08 GMT):<br/>
I did. Thanks though

Hi, while running the End2EndIT.java integration test, whatever endorsement policy is given, the instantiation is getting successful ..eg. with a wrong value for identity mspid, the endorsement is supposed to fail, but in my case, instantiation succeeds..

@greg.haskins Regarding the lack of determinism in golang CC build across environment variations (go/compiler/lib verions); don't we have the same problem with the .so fabric plugin mechanism (based on go plugins) that is being proposed? What is the approach to attestation that "what is executing is what was reviewed" in that case?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:48:14 GMT):<br/>
not really, no
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:49:21 GMT):<br/>
non determinism is just another form of byzantine error...besides, work is already underway to provide deterministic chaincode environments
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:50:10 GMT):<br/>
"determinism" in this case is about relating to "what was written/reviewed" to "what is running"
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:50:33 GMT):<br/>
"work is already underway to provide deterministic chaincode environments" - is there a JIRA ticker?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:50:44 GMT):<br/>
if what is written/reviewed generates non-deterministic outputs, that is a different problem
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:51:05 GMT):<br/>
not sure, its just an R&D project right now
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:52:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:53:44 GMT):<br/>
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5378 assumes that at some point SCCs will be deployable as .so files.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:54:01 GMT):<br/>
... go plugins
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:54:50 GMT):<br/>
i havent had a chance to review that proposal, but overall I would say "no" because thats more of a fabric-admin decision (same to bake SCCs into the peer binary)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:55:45 GMT):<br/>
e.g. not sure what the linkage has to do with determinism in that case
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:56:41 GMT):<br/>
so your objection to per-compiled user CCs is due to the fact they are deployable by someone who is not fabric-admin, right? You don't have a problem with fabric admins deploying binaries.

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:57:34 GMT):<br/>
what I can say is the user deployable scenario you presented before was not adequately robust in a heterogeneous environment
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:58:13 GMT):<br/>
overall, I think FAB-5378 might be missing the point of SCCs, so it needs careful review
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:59:03 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I understand, I am just trying to find where that line is - that we must not cross with the binaries.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:59:34 GMT):<br/>
but again, ignoring that...if someone wants to fork fabric, add/remove SCCs, and recompile it, that is an administrative action for a given consortia 
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:59:54 GMT):<br/>
What I hear is that fabric admins should be OK with deploying fabric binary extensions. Is that what you think?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 16:00:20 GMT):<br/>
I dont know...i havent had a chance to review the proposal
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 16:00:40 GMT):<br/>
like I said, I think it might be missing the point of SCCs to begin with so thats the part I need to study

<p><strong>boliang</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 07:51:00 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc 1) There could be more peers than just Org1 and Org2 in the same channel, for example, Org3. In this case, the policy And(Org1.member, Org2.member) means you just need to get endorsement from these two orgs (excludes Org3).  2) The client SDK checks the endorsement results from multiple endorsers. But if it's malicious client, he can still send responses for ordering even they are not the same. That's why committers have to check the endorsement policy to make sure the signatures from endorsers  are correct and the signatures satisfy the rules.  
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 08:09:49 GMT):<br/>
@boliang so you mean to say endorsement policy is only to avoid malicious attack and in no case of genuine transaction endorsement policy fails except if the all peers of org1 are down 
</p>
<p><strong>boliang</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 08:15:01 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=Yi57PJKyiFHD5skNY) @DarshanBc Yes. In my opinion, consensus consists of endorsement and ordering. That's why you should carefully design the endorsement policy.
</p>

@boliang ok can you clarify my view on endorsement. I have a car selling market, to buy a car literally I need an endorsement of payment class and an endorsement of manufacturer of car saying payment is done and car is manufactured so can I achieve this by endorsement policy of Hyperledger-fabric   
</p>
<p><strong>boliang</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 08:49:52 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc What do you mean by "endorsement of payment class"?
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 08:55:54 GMT):<br/>
@boliang I meant in a literal way in other words confirmation from payment class saying payment is done by buyer 
</p>
<p><strong>boliang</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 09:00:34 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc could you specify the roles of endorsers in your case? For example, manufacturer.
</p>
<p><strong>boliang</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 09:01:03 GMT):<br/>
I don't know what else in your case
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 09:16:53 GMT):<br/>
for successfull sellCar transaction my endorsement policy should be AND('payment.member','seller.member','buyer.member') which means transfer of ownership is being done and signature of buyer.member and seller.member is obtained in parallel if payment is done then only payment.member signs the transaction hence all the endorsers have endorsed and this txn can be sent for ordering thus for commit in DB
</p>
<p><strong>boliang</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 09:35:54 GMT):<br/>
In reality, the scenarios donot work in the way you mentioned. Then endorsement result is automatically generated by peer based on the simulation result of chaincode. It means in current implementation, the result only relies on ledger and chaincode. @DarshanBc 
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:38:21 GMT):<br/>
@boliang http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/txflow.html says for transaction of radish both buyer and seller has to endorse doesn't that mean in the way I mentioned
</p>
<p><strong>boliang</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 11:26:00 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc No, it's not what you describe.

<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 10 Sep 2017 18:36:55 GMT):<br/>
then why is that the endorsement policy setup configuration has roles like "member" and "admin" ?
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 10 Sep 2017 18:38:20 GMT):<br/>
arent these the user level roles? 
We do not start a peer with a role when we start it, rite? Nor we join a channel by specifying a role.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=fQ5of4hhQgc8QxdQt) @yacovm 
I was getting this error while trying to instantiate a chaincode example_cc to 2 Organizations which are members of a channel say "dualchannel"  [ Each Org had 2 peers ]
I was doing it in an iterative manner ( first Org1, then Org2 ). And I was using JAVA SDK
I had sent out a Instantiation proposal to 2 peers of Org1 first. At that time i didnt know that I need to instantiate only once. But it was successful.( i.e, even though I had two peers in the proposal, it was still successfull) 
Then my code picked up Org2 and tried to tried to send an Instantiating proposal to the two peers which are left. This time, i got the above mentioned error that " chaincode exists example_cc" 
I agree to the above error [ But I was confused a bit as it looked similar to the error during the duplicate installation. ]

My question is, why didn't the same error come when I tried to instantiate to both the peers of Org1 ? Is it because I had both the peers clubbed in the same Instantiation proposal ? 

Now what I am planning to do is, to iterate further down, at peer level, and instantiate only till the first successful response.

@Ashish installing is an action specific to the peers, instantiating is specific to the channel. it doesn't matter that there are two peers in the instantiate proposal, when org1 goes to instantiate it is still the first proposal to instantiate the chaincode on that channel. when org2 tried to send a proposal it found that the chaincode was already bound to the channel 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 11:32:09 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=g4c5Y6zbcKcNFtfcp) @divyank The rationale is that we use effectively a multi-stage docker build (e.g. builder container is different from run-time container)...since the runtime container is stripped down, it is not safe to assume that ldd linkages that are available at build-time are also available at run-time.  Thus, we use --static builds to eliminate dynamic linking and create a more self-contained payload that is easier to migrate
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 11:32:46 GMT):<br/>
in the earlier versions of the code, this was actually true as we were using ubuntu for build-time and busybox for runtime
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 11:33:11 GMT):<br/>
however, we had to back away from that because of a snafu with glibc, so now the runtime is also based on a stripped down ubuntu
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 11:33:44 GMT):<br/>
thus, the requirements are more lax than they used to be, at least currently
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 11:34:22 GMT):<br/>
(would like to revisit this again in the future...as a stripped ubuntu build is like 160MB and a busybox build is about 25MB)
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:39:13 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins I see.

I'm working on extending FAB-4207 to use Go plugins and found that plugins are not compatible with static builds. Would you be open to changing the way we manage the ldd linkages?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:40:40 GMT):<br/>
@divyank it would technically work, since we currently do ubuntu-to-ubuntu, but I would be concerned that it would preclude us from ever revisiting the optimization
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:40:57 GMT):<br/>
i guess we should discuss the merits of plugins vs size optimization
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 13:35:34 GMT):<br/>
As a user I'm pretty happy with the current 150 MB image size. It's almost like loading the CNN homepage :)
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 13:36:25 GMT):<br/>
If we did move to something like ubuntu to alpine in the future, wouldn't it be sufficient to ensure the same version of the dependency is available at build and runtime?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 14:59:16 GMT):<br/>
@divyank generally yes, though the details of managing that can sometimes be unattractive
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 14:59:25 GMT):<br/>
but essentially, that is more or less what we are doing today
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 14:59:54 GMT):<br/>
e.g. the builder and runtime environments share a lineage and thus abi compatibility is a natural benefit of that
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:00:09 GMT):<br/>
we could continue to manage it that way
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:00:28 GMT):<br/>
Would something like docker multi-stage builds help manage this? https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/multistage-build/
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:01:31 GMT):<br/>
no, but only because a) we are effectively doing the same thing already, and b) while the built-in docker-multistage support is more attractive that rolling our own multi-stage in many ways, there are a few issues with converting
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:02:05 GMT):<br/>
for one, it requires docker-engine v17.06+ and I am not ready the demand that as a fabric requirement on our users
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:02:05 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:03:01 GMT):<br/>
the second is that the docker multi-stage support is somewhat limiting because stage 1 runs as a docker-build and not a docker-run and it precludes some capabilities that we take advantage of
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:03:15 GMT):<br/>
such as volume-mounting intermediate artifacts
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:03:40 GMT):<br/>
i digress...not really relevant here because it doesnt get us any closer to --static vs plugins
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:05:11 GMT):<br/>
Yes, so it would be okay to install ldd linkages in both baseos and base image?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:42:15 GMT):<br/>
well, they are already there naturally
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:42:54 GMT):<br/>
baseimage derives from baseos, so it shares the necessary lineage in a way that non --static has a shot at working
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:43:06 GMT):<br/>
actually, i just remembered the other problem though
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:43:13 GMT):<br/>
still solvable, but not as clearcut
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:44:03 GMT):<br/>
the reason I stuck with --static even after re-establishing a baseos lineage is you cant really predict in a generic way what libs the app will need
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:44:49 GMT):<br/>
for instance, if peer pulled in libfoo.so that was installed in baseimage, it would require the installation of the same in baseos in order to work
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:44:56 GMT):<br/>
--static solved that nicely
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:45:13 GMT):<br/>
like I said, you could still solve it, but it gets a little messier 
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 17:25:56 GMT):<br/>
I ran into that issue as well. I'm currently trying to see if it's possible to statically link certain libraries while still producing a dynamically linked binary. This way there would be no need for adding the required .so files to the baseos image.

@muralisr do we still need stub.GetBinding()? what is that used for? I suppose a chaincode can use it to get a unique hash for the transaction proposal, and use it for some purpose. but seeing how it's computed, hash(nonce, creator, epoch), it's almost identical to txId

@jimthematrix I was trying to reason out exactly the same way you described. This appears to have come from https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1752. I'm also not sure when this would be used... let;s check with @elli-androulaki @adc ?
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 12:27:32 GMT):<br/>
Hi @jimthematrix , @muralisr , binding is to be used for invocation access control at the chaincode layer when the chaincode authentication is based on alternate authentication mechanisms (other than creator)
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 12:29:36 GMT):<br/>
it fulfils the same purpose for chaincodes/application and fabric platform as tls-unique when used by applications running on tls

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 14:26:03 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki thanks for the detailed explanation (on the whiteboard), as we discussed this is a useful and advanced API and is likely the least understood feature of the chaincode API, we should provide more documentation and also have the SDKs add a "generateBinding()" as part of constructing a proposal.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 14:26:23 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr as a result of a f2f discussion with Elli, I now understood the function it provides and how it's supposed to be used. so I'll add it to node.js chaincode
</p>

Chaincode Type Agnostic Peer - Proposal
Hi all, we need a way to distribute pre-compiled golang chaincode. We had a proposal how to achieve this, and after receiving great feedback (a couple of reviews from the community, namely @greg.haskins :wink: ) We considered @greg.haskins  ’ recommendation from https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6014?focusedCommentId=30526&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-30526 to fully commit to docker as a solution. We took the idea a bit further, as we realized that committing fully to docker provides and opportunity to move chaincode type specific processing out of the peer source code, which we believe has many great positives. We came up with a draft proposal: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6014?focusedCommentId=30526&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-30526. It’s still a bit rough, so we would appreciate feedback and contribution from the community. Particularly, @greg.haskins  ‘ help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

when the peer spawns a chaincode container, it injects it with a TLS certificate and a TLS private key

@greg.haskins has already suggested having a standard peer-chaincode contract for instantiation, so i think TLS is one of the things that should be covered.

I have created 3 fabric peers and generated new keys and certs for those and then mapped each peer to its own couchdb. I have created a channel on peer0 and added peer1 and peer2 to the channel I then deploy my .bna network onto all 3 peers. When I run my composer-rest-server how does it interact with all 3 peers? Is consensus built in or do I need to configure consensus.

In v1.0 we have an MSP instance per channel, and a local MSP that is cross channel. The channel MSPs are updated with cobfiguration blocks

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 12:00:03 GMT):<br/>
this is a question to #fabric-crypto 
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 12:29:33 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain msp only plays a role once you have an identity. It verifies if an identity belongs to an org or has permissions to perform an action. CA on the other hand is for enrolling/unregistering identities  to organizations.

You don't always need a CA for fabric to work - you _can_ work without it if you use the cryptogen tool that will generate identities for you. But that's not a very straightforward way for big networks.
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 12:33:22 GMT):<br/>
https://pastebin.com/ytSvakkp @thakkarparth007 can you explain each folder
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 12:59:07 GMT):<br/>
I'm not very well worsed with that folder structure. Fabric crypto would be a better place to get the details. I can only give a high level overview

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:08:52 GMT):<br/>
So the `ca` folder is to initialize a CA. contains a private key and a CA's cert.
the `msp` folder is actually the data that is persisted in the config block about the organization, used to build the "verifier" MSP per channel.
the `peers` folder contains 2 folders:
- `msp` folder to store the signing MSP of a peer
- `tls` folder to store the TLS stuff (cert, root CA cert, and signing key)
- `tlsca` folder is used to store in the config block, the TLS verification data - it's basically root CA certs. 


 @asaningmaxchain 
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:14:35 GMT):<br/>
so the `ca` is the root
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:17:36 GMT):<br/>
what's the `users` folder
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:17:36 GMT):<br/>
what's the `users` folder @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:27:16 GMT):<br/>
the user's signing key and CA cert
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:28:41 GMT):<br/>
also the user's admin cert (not sure why a user would need the admin cert of the admin user... @jimthematrix @mastersingh24  ideas?) 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:30:09 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm @asaningmaxchain this is the peer admin user cert
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:30:31 GMT):<br/>
it can be used to e.g. install/instantiate chaincodes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:32:03 GMT):<br/>
nope, that is only correct in case the user is an admin itself
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:32:34 GMT):<br/>
but I was referring to: 
```
 └── User1@org2.example.com
                ├── msp
                │   ├── admincerts
                │   │   └── User1@org2.example.com-cert.pem
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:33:37 GMT):<br/>
that user's cert is located in the peer/msp/admincerts, at least for cryptogen 1.0.2
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:33:37 GMT):<br/>
that admin user's cert is located in the peer/msp/admincerts, at least for cryptogen 1.0.2
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:34:06 GMT):<br/>
what is incorrect about that?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:35:50 GMT):<br/>
ok, I meant Admin@peer user [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=5d2BEEYW6hexYRTF3) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:41:57 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:53:06 GMT):<br/>

or at least thinks he is?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:54:17 GMT):<br/>
because the peers msp config dir is set to `org1.example.com/`
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:54:17 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:54:44 GMT):<br/>
which has a different admin cert
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:54:53 GMT):<br/>
I don't think admincerts should even be in that folder since a client SDK doesn't listen for connections and only invokes operations on network nodes, not the other way around so there is no admin operation on an SDK that can be verified
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:56:30 GMT):<br/>
right, that's likely what the "admincerts" under the User1 folder is meant for, that it's validating a response signed by the admin
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:56:30 GMT):<br/>
right, that's likely what the "admincerts" under the User1 folder is meant for, that it's validating a response signed by the admin (presumably you could have a peer be configured with the admin identity, and an endorsement policy containing `org1.ADMIN`)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:56:44 GMT):<br/>
but the problem is the cert has the wrong content
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:58:37 GMT):<br/>
but what response by an admin can an SDK even validate??
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:59:18 GMT):<br/>
> and an endorsement policy containing
This doesn't make sense, a peer cannot be an admin... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:59:44 GMT):<br/>
BTW Jim - the SDK doesn't verify the signature of the endorsements returned from the peer, does it?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 13:59:47 GMT):<br/>
a peer SHOULDN'T be an admin, but it definitely CAN be made one
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:00:53 GMT):<br/>
the node SDK doesn't validate the certs accompanying proposal response, but Java SDK does in fact
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:01:13 GMT):<br/>
(both SDKs do verify the signature, to be clear)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:01:15 GMT):<br/>
so I'm not talking about cert validation, but about signature validation of the endorsements 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:01:25 GMT):<br/>
>  (both SDKs do verify the signature, to be clear) 
oh? really? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:01:37 GMT):<br/>
what if a signature is signed improperly then ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:01:53 GMT):<br/>
lets say you got an endorsements from peer0, peer1, peer2 and the signature from peer2 is wrong
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:02:00 GMT):<br/>
will the endorsement fail?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:02:14 GMT):<br/>
will the client SDK return an error?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:02:24 GMT):<br/>
so that the submission of the transaction to the orderer will not happen?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:05:49 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix ^ 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:09:41 GMT):<br/>
both SDK's expose a utility API to check if all responses have valid signatures, and returns `false` if any failed to verify
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:09:56 GMT):<br/>
then it's up to the app (that uses the SDK) to decide whether to proceed or not
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:18:55 GMT):<br/>
Could you perhaps give me a link to the code (node.SDK preferred) @jimthematrix ?

Go SDK is currently not checking endorsement signatures. How does other SDKs achieve this without discovery service (that the client could use to obtain endorsers' certs)? By sticking the certs in the client configuration?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 19:10:40 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic - simple. When you get the endorsement, the endorser's certs are already in the signed proposal !
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 19:11:18 GMT):<br/>
The SDK is primed with the root CA certs of all orgs and with this, it can validate the endorser's cert, and then afterwards - verify the signature.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 19:12:09 GMT):<br/>
Can you configure the root CA certs of other orgs in the Go-SDK? (I don't remember... used it too long ago)

HI ,Can we access transaction id of the parent invocation of the transaction in chaincode? 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 07:16:06 GMT):<br/>
@rock_martin stub.GetTxID()?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 07:58:44 GMT):<br/>
I think by parent invocation he means a chaincode2chaincode call no?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 07:59:23 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I don't know what he means, trying to get more info from him ;)

Hey, what is the main difference between *endorsers* in fabric and a *notary node* in corda? They look quite similar to me, but i think i am missing something.

<p><strong>rock_martin</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 10:30:00 GMT):<br/>
sorry @Vadim @yacovm  its not parent.its current
</p>
<p><strong>rock_martin</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 10:30:09 GMT):<br/>
sorry for typographical mistake
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 10:35:21 GMT):<br/>
@rock_martin so then `stub.GetTxID()` should work for you
</p>
<p><strong>rock_martin</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 10:35:32 GMT):<br/>
@vadim Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>rock_martin</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 10:36:17 GMT):<br/>
Could you please let me know for implementation of fabric as for production level i.e as running on multiple hosts

hey all...
Where and how to define which peer acts as admin for an org?
</p>
<p><strong>rock_martin</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 10:14:08 GMT):<br/>
if I install chaincode on 3 peers of a channel that has total number of 5 so when I instantiate chaincode does the endorsement policy exclude those 2 peers by itself even if they are involved in the organisation that endorsed the chaincode 
</p>
<p><strong>rock_martin</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 11:18:18 GMT):<br/>
 I had a query, because the node SDK keeps all the certificates and keys in artifacts. So I think we need to have one node app for each and every organization(or pehaps every peer), that only have certificates for their organization's peer??
How would we transport the client and channel objects between these applications??
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 13:11:39 GMT):<br/>
Hi today with endorsement policy I observed a peculiar behavior of txn execution in balance transfer instead of A and B I'm extracting enroll ID from getcreator() and making that as key and value is manipulated in two ways 1.simply adding value to balance 2. Like normal txn i.e., increase receiver balance and decrease sendor's balance. I have Jim from org1 and Barry from org2 I've put AND(org1.member,org2.member) endorsement policy for my chaincode. I observed that txn is successful if I add amount to Jim's balance just like that without any transfer and *execute this txn on peers of org1* block also got added. Txn fails because of endorsement failure only when I do nornal txn any idea why? 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 13:15:06 GMT):<br/>
@rock_martin you're right that each organization, assuming you wanted them on separate servers, to have their own node application. you wouldn't need to transport client/channel objects between them...you can just build them for each application. only the channel network config needs to be shared between orgs
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 13:15:36 GMT):<br/>
in the future questions like that are better for #fabric-sdk-node 
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:48:29 GMT):<br/>
Guys, conceptual questions...

I`m able to create peers instantiate in different networks (IE - My house, Amazon, Digital Ocean) to then talk to each other and be in the same Hyperledger network ? 

Until now I have done this only everything in My Local Machine

</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:52:07 GMT):<br/>
@Menniti As long as they are configured to talk to each other and can communicate on the same channel, then yes they are on the same network.
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:53:57 GMT):<br/>
Sorry Asara, i don`t get it
I will be able to connect My house, Amazon and Digital Ocean in the same network by instanciate the same peer on those 3 machines
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:54:00 GMT):<br/>
?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=qGczp9wgPB2KwX3Sr) @Asara Got it!!! thank you very much!!!
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:57:07 GMT):<br/>
Other question, make sense use smartphones to instantiate this peers ?
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:57:28 GMT):<br/>
in therm of internet, computing capacity, storage etc..
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 20:59:37 GMT):<br/>
@Menniti you don't need the same peer on 3 machines. each machine has its own peer(s), but PeerHouse, PeerAmazon, and PeerDigital need to be connected to the same channel.
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Sat, 07 Oct 2017 02:11:10 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith, totally make sens! tank you very much
</p>
<p><strong>Menniti</strong> (Sat, 07 Oct 2017 02:11:23 GMT):<br/>
@Asara Thank you too

<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 08:57:02 GMT):<br/>
There are 3 orgs org1,org2,org3 there are 2 chaincodes with different endorsement policies such as A->AND(org1.member,org2.member), B->AND(org2.member,org3.member). If chaincode A invokes B only on peers of org2 doesn't the endorsement policy fail? 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 10:27:31 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc chaincode A could only invoke chaincode B for reads, therefore it cannot fail endorsement policy
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 10:28:07 GMT):<br/>
how about for writes?
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 10:28:07 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin how about for writes?
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 10:32:41 GMT):<br/>
currently, chaincode to chaincode is only for reads
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 10:34:24 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK you can do a CC2CC write for the same channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 10:34:34 GMT):<br/>
the endorsement policy is checked for all the RWSets

Hi, I've been running an app server that invokes a chaincode. I'm running fabric and App server on 2 different VMs. Its been running perfectly fine for last 4-5 days. I was doing a batch processing. Somehow it worked for around 10 invoke transactions and all of sudden started failing for next invoke transaction. Its giving me below errror and looks to me that peer is no longer accessible to App server. Is there anyway to find out. I see docker container is still running fine. Can anyone please advise asap. This is little urgent.  ```error: [Peer.js]: sendProposal - timed out after:60000

@nhrishi any logs of the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 17:44:20 GMT):<br/>
also what is the memory consumption of the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 17:44:27 GMT):<br/>
CPU consumption?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 17:59:34 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=QmRieZRgdM9D52Bjo) @yacovm Somehow docker logs is not giving me any output. Its taking forever. Memory usage - 114.4 MiB / 62.75 GiB   0.18% and CPU usage is varying between 15% - 50% 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:01:40 GMT):<br/>
you can do `docker inspect` and see where the logs are outputted to
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:01:43 GMT):<br/>
is the file system full perhaps?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:18:16 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=sSWBup3eogeCnD6bE) @yacovm Thanks. Interestingly, I processed 10 invoke transactions through this peer successfully but dont see anything in the log. I also dont see any transaction received when i invoke from app.  Yes I upgraded the diskspace today, its not full.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:19:07 GMT):<br/>
so you invoke from the node SDK
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:19:09 GMT):<br/>
wait for the event
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:19:16 GMT):<br/>
and you don't get it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:19:17 GMT):<br/>
right?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:19:24 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:19:49 GMT):<br/>
its failing at sendProposal
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:19:50 GMT):<br/>
aha, ok - and if you query for the chaincode - do you see that the state changed?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:19:56 GMT):<br/>
ah I see
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:20:14 GMT):<br/>
and you say you can't look at the peer logs?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:20:45 GMT):<br/>
I cant see using docker logs but I could see it using path in docker inspect.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:21:20 GMT):<br/>
and what does it say?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:21:26 GMT):<br/>
anythinh interesting?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:22:52 GMT):<br/>
Interestingly, I don't see any log updates for today.Rest all looks usual and no errors
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:23:35 GMT):<br/>
I'm looking at "        "LogPath": "/var/lib/docker/containers/2930214f3f1e95016e3b41264372ed26290c74ae121069479d90c1b2168bc303/2930214f3f1e95016e3b41264372ed26290c74ae121069479d90c1b2168bc303-json.log",

no idea
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 18:25:51 GMT):<br/>
its weird

@yacovm I did check ther peer log but i dont see the request is hitting the peer at all. Also when i do a docker stats Net I/O is  as below. Do you think this is something can cause the issue - ``` 965 MB / 1.21 GB

if you don't see the request hitting the peer - can you perhaps use `tcpdump` and see if there is any traffic reaching it?

affiliation? What's that?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 11:34:20 GMT):<br/>
Ok let me try
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:17:26 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm, Can I add new additional anchor peer in the existing network and kill/remove existing one later.
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:21:04 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I'm running a network with multiple organization and peers since last 5 days. Apparently, node app is not connecting to nodes and looks like they are in the deadlock situation and not responding. Is there anyway to resolve this issue without restarting the network or adding additional new nodes and kill existing ones later. Can someone pls advise asap. This is really urgent.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:26:23 GMT):<br/>
Yes you can
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:26:56 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi did you do tcpdump like i suggested?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:28:51 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm yes I did and see traffic on the network. In fact, I'm able to invoke/query one of the peer. The issue is only for some set of peers.
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:29:44 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to do docker stop and start but peer is not stopping
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:30:57 GMT):<br/>
ah it's not stopping?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:31:26 GMT):<br/>
can you please then do `ps exec <peer_id> -it /bin/bash` and then do inside the peer: `kill -SIGABRT 1` ? (the pid is always 1)
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:31:28 GMT):<br/>
yes so i have 2 peers for this organization. Peer0 and Peer1. Peer0 is anchor node. 
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:31:46 GMT):<br/>
I managed to stop peer1 but not peer0
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:31:47 GMT):<br/>
kill with SIGABRT will make a peer crash and dump its stack trace to stdout/stderr
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:31:55 GMT):<br/>
then you can send me the stack trace
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:32:43 GMT):<br/>
Okay, Just want to confirm, but I can replace another peer with this one. I don't want to restart the network and lose data.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:33:09 GMT):<br/>
well I just want to fix a problem in case there is a bug 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:33:16 GMT):<br/>
well the peer writes to a volume
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:33:19 GMT):<br/>
right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:33:29 GMT):<br/>
if the volume is persisted with docker restart
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:33:32 GMT):<br/>
then you're good
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:33:42 GMT):<br/>
is the volume shared between the host and the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:33:42 GMT):<br/>
is the volume shared between the host and the peer? (docker)
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:33:55 GMT):<br/>
yes Its shared. Its just i never did it

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:34:31 GMT):<br/>
lets do an experiment: start a peer the way you start it but instead of a peer make there a sleep command
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:34:40 GMT):<br/>
and then, log into the docker container
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:34:42 GMT):<br/>
of the sleep command
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:34:55 GMT):<br/>
and do `echo "bla bla" > /var/hyperledger/production`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:35:06 GMT):<br/>
and then restart the docker instance and see if it is still there
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:35:13 GMT):<br/>
this way you'll test the docker setup
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:35:16 GMT):<br/>
if it is persisted, or not
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:37:45 GMT):<br/>
Sorry I didnt understand about the sleep command in the docker. You mean shell command?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:38:58 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:47:33 GMT):<br/>
sure let me try that. Btw If I crash the peer, will I be able to bring it back using docker start. 
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:54:32 GMT):<br/>
I tried `kill -SIGABRT 1` in my dev environment and did docker start. I'm able to see existing data and invoke/query.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:59:38 GMT):<br/>
noooooooo
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:59:42 GMT):<br/>
why did you do docker start?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:59:46 GMT):<br/>
I wanted the logs!
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 18:00:18 GMT):<br/>
yes, I did it in my dev environment. This is not the actual environement i'm having a problem
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 18:00:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm having this issue in my UAT environment
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 18:00:29 GMT):<br/>
ah 
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 18:00:35 GMT):<br/>
so I'm trying things in dev first before UAT
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 18:00:41 GMT):<br/>
I see
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 18:19:48 GMT):<br/>
Sorry I missed one point. I tried to stop one of the peer in my UAT environment (in order to start again). But it didnt stop gracefully and now we can't do exec -it into it.
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 18:20:13 GMT):<br/>
This was an hour back
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 10:25:16 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I tried `kill -SIGABRT 1` on the peer exec bash. It doesn't work. the container is still active in docker ps and running. I tried SIGKILL and SIGTERM as well. Same issue.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 10:25:42 GMT):<br/>
it won't die?

</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 10:47:46 GMT):<br/>
and we can also capture stack trace so we can also investigate

@yacovm @Vadim Just want to update on the issue, we discussed for last 2 days. We've managed bring nodes back up. We had to remove the node, then restart docker daemon and start all docker containers in the network. All unresponsive nodes are brought up and synced with the network without losing data. Really appreciate your help. Thanks a lot. :thumbsup: A couple of points/ observations - We couldn't pinpoint the real issue behind peer going into the unresponsive mode. For adding new peer with different name on the live network, we need to really look at cryptogen utility to produce certs based on the root CA. Also we mainly need to look at how we can increase transaction throughput. I've some ideas, will let update you after my investigation. We should have the best practices guide on it.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 07:41:06 GMT):<br/>
what's wrong with Tx throughput?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 07:41:16 GMT):<br/>
are you running v1.0.x or master branch?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 07:41:33 GMT):<br/>
yes I'm running on the 1.0.2 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 07:43:38 GMT):<br/>
and what's the problem with throughput?
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 07:44:31 GMT):<br/>
Just want to clarify, the above issue started when I was processing around 100 transactions and the invoke started failing with REQUEST_TIMEOUT issue after 20-25 transactions. Since then it went into the unresponsive mode. I'm sure something went wrong during this.
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 07:45:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm planning to do more regressive testing in our dev environment to see if I can replicate the issue.

Hi. I had a question regarding events in hyperledger. What happens if the rate of consumption of events is slower than the production? what happens if the events.buffer is full and events.timeout has reached ? are the events from the buffer dropped ?
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 10:20:15 GMT):<br/>
Does anyone know if when proposing or endorsing a transaction if the current version of the channel configuration block is recorded in the transaction, and if would be checked in the orderer or VSCC ?   The question behind the question is, if we start changing the CRL list in the MSP of the channel configuration block will that affect in-flight transactions (assuming that we do not add any of the endorsers or proposers  cert numbers to the CRL list so the  transaction is still valid with both the old and amended configuration block). 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 10:28:57 GMT):<br/>
@rsherwood a configuration transaction (one that has CRLs, or any policy or MSP change) comes in its own block
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 10:29:33 GMT):<br/>
so when a block with transactions is processed, it doesn't have in-flight transactions affected by the config update because the config update has been already either committed, or in flight itself.
</p>

so when a block with transactions is processed, it doesn't have in-flight transactions affected by the config update because the config update has been already either committed, or in flight itself (inside the orderer, or queued for delivery to the peer)
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 10:30:58 GMT):<br/>
So at the time of endorsement the state of the configuration block is not recorded in the normal transaction ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 11:43:33 GMT):<br/>
no, we don't need it because the transactions comes in a block
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 11:43:40 GMT):<br/>
and blocks are processed in a sequenced order @rsherwood

good morning, reading the doc, looking at the chaincode package command, a bit confused by options -s -S and -i, Do not feel that the question was answered, here it is again. using -s without -S, means it will be a signed CDS, but who actually signs the package?

if use -s without -S, the package is still called SignedCDS, but who actually signed it?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 17:55:37 GMT):<br/>
I also said that the doc might have to be improved a bit to make it clear that signing package is out of band as Jeff pointed out. the information is not available from the doc.
</p>

at least I could not find the answer to my question from that doc.
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 17:56:55 GMT):<br/>
`When -s is specified, the -S option must also be specified if other owners are going to need to sign. Otherwise, the process will create a SignedCDS that includes only the instantiation policy in addition to the CDS.`
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 17:57:32 GMT):<br/>
Someone who knows better, correct me if I'm wrong,but that seems to imply that the peer from which you ran the command?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 17:58:02 GMT):<br/>
right, read that part multiple times, otherwise, the process will create a SignedCDS, but whose signature is in the package?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 17:58:17 GMT):<br/>
well it says includes only the instantiation policy in addition to the CDS,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 17:58:30 GMT):<br/>
did not say anything about signature.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 17:59:31 GMT):<br/>
assume CDS is said above raw CDS which has nothing about signatures.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:08:13 GMT):<br/>
looking at the code, without -S, the CDS is signed by the default signing identity of the local MSP of the peer you are running the command against.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:08:13 GMT):<br/>
@tongli looking at the code, without -S, the CDS is signed by the default signing identity of the local MSP of the peer you are running the command against.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:10:16 GMT):<br/>
I'd need to look further to determine exactly how the default signing identity is set. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:10:16 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:10:17 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti cool, cool. thanks for providing the answer. without -S, the peer's signature will be the only signature inside that package since that package can not be further signed.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:11:34 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's how I understand it 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:12:12 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti the peer has a core_peer_id set when it gets started, is it possibly that is how the peer id to be specified?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:13:32 GMT):<br/>
what throws me off is the statement that says "includes only the instantiation policy in addition to the CDS", but it is still called Signed, I think that was the something confused me, it may be clear to others.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:15:13 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti anyway, thanks a lot for helping out. now I understand. so with -S, the package can be passed around to be signed by more parties. Who would be allowed to sign though?
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:15:17 GMT):<br/>
which doc are you looking at? I can follow-up with Murali, the expert in this area, to make sure things are documented correctly and in an accurate, easy to understand way. (Murali's traveling this week, I believe)

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:16:04 GMT):<br/>
the section is creating the package.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:16:33 GMT):<br/>
below the example, there are explanations for options -s -S and -i.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:18:38 GMT):<br/>
now with -S option, I understand multiple parties can sign the package, but who is allowed to sign?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:19:11 GMT):<br/>
can anyone sign that package?
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:20:15 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure on that part. I could imagine it would let anyone sign but if the signatures don't match the (instantiation? endorsement?) policy the action won't succeed 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:21:16 GMT):<br/>
but that's a guess :)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:21:18 GMT):<br/>
so you mean that the instantiation policy may play a roll on whose signatures are needed?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:21:41 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti understood. thanks again for helping out.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:22:33 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's what I'd guess. the instantiation policy may say "Org1 and Org2 must sign this package before it can be instantiated" seems like a likely scenario to me
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:22:33 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's what I'd guess. the instantiation policy may say "Org1 and Org2 must have an Admin sign this package before it can be instantiated" seems like a likely scenario to me
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:24:33 GMT):<br/>
@wlahti I thought that signing party and instantiation party may be different, but that is just me thinking out loud. but if signing parties are all peers, your guess could be very well true. thanks again.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:26:51 GMT):<br/>
glad to add my thoughts. :) I've touched the code in this area a few times but haven't spent much time looking into these kinds of details. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:27:34 GMT):<br/>
when I figure out more, I'll reach out to you in addition to making sure the documentation is updated.

Hopefully not a too obvious question: from the experiments I've run, it is possible to execute parallel endorsement for X transactions against the same chaincode as long as I direct those endorsement requests to X different peers. But it seems to me that endorsement requests (at least for the same chaincode, same channel) sent to a single peer get serialized. Is that true? If yes, is there any obvious technical reason for serializing endorsement requests issues to a single peer for the same chaincode/channel? Thanks!

I think that it is serialized indeed.

@minollo requests to a chaincode on a peer is NOT serialized in the peer side
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:48:06 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr aren't they serialized in the shim side though?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:48:21 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:48:35 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:48:52 GMT):<br/>
(they used to be in 0.5/0.6 ..... but not in 1.0)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:49:42 GMT):<br/>

@muralisr , @yacovm that's what I noticed in a recent test I run; parallel requests to the same peer, same chaincode ended up serialized; the same to two different peers, same chaincode run in parallel. I may well have been human error; I'll try to reproduce it with straight sdk calls and report back.

@muralisr , @yacovm OK, I understood the problem a bit better. Endorsement against the same chaincode from the same peer, is definitely not serialized; you can indeed run multiple endorsement in parallel - which is great.
But there is indeed a worrisome serialization happening though: while a peer is working on an endorsement (it doesn't matter against which chaincode), any commit operation run by the same peer is blocked. Looking at the log file, that behavior seems to be caused by the fact that, as part of the endorsement, just before running the invoked chaincode function a read lock is acquired on a RWMutex:

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 14 Oct 2017 16:23:35 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr @minollo @manish-sethi The locks between simulation and commit are indeed expected behavior.  Say your simulation does multiple queries, you don't want those queries to return inconsistent results due to on-going commits.  There is some research on how to optimize this in the long term, but no 'quick fix' in the short-term.

<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Sun, 15 Oct 2017 02:48:31 GMT):<br/>
@minollo Just to clarify further on the lock aspect. The write lock is acquired for a very short duration - Only for committing the final writes to the db. The actual validation of trans (the most time consuming operation) are performed before holding the write locks. So, this write lock should not become performance issue especially, If your simulation are mostly short running trans.

Yes, we also intend to use the snapshot based approach going forward.
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Sun, 15 Oct 2017 02:51:48 GMT):<br/>
Also, if you want to discuss these aspects further or want to share some empirical observations about this lock, it would be helpful, if you can share that on fabric-ledger channel.
</p>
<p><strong>minollo</strong> (Sun, 15 Oct 2017 10:37:58 GMT):<br/>
@manish-sethi the problem is not that the write lock is acquired for a short or long duration; the problem is that read locks during endorsement can indeed be acquired for long amounts of time (as long as it takes to invoke a chaincode function) - which implies that *any* commit operation on that peer is blocked during that time.
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Sun, 15 Oct 2017 14:01:22 GMT):<br/>
@minollo - I'll move this discussion to fabric-ledger channel for the benefit of others and would post respond there later.

@minollo `read locks during endorsement can indeed be acquired for long amounts of time (as long as it takes to invoke a chaincode function)` not sure what "long amounts of time" means here but application should be layered in such a way - typically - to keep heavy processing business  logic out of chaincode. Keep chaincode lean/mean as a maintainer of consented ledger state (and @manish-sethi we can take up further discussion in fabric-ledger as you suggest)

<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:38:32 GMT):<br/>
@minollo while you are right that we have no control over what users do in a chaincode, at least for the "very short duration" argument, my experiments have shown that it hasn't been a real bottleneck. The major bottleneck are still the crypto operations. The wait time of the writers is less than a millisecond, or an order of magnitude lesser (i don't remember currently). And this lock is for the entire block of transactions.

On the other hand, the overall transaction takes 200-500ms (depending upon the load) on a set of 8 peers all connected with very high speed network.  
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:39:22 GMT):<br/>
The commit duration itself takes 100-200ms for leveldb, more for couchdb. 
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:39:45 GMT):<br/>
So currently the locks aren't causing any harm, and are outnumbered by the latency due to other operations.
</p>
<p><strong>minollo</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:41:16 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 I think the misunderstanding here is that the risk is not how long the write lock is; but how long the read locks (during endorsements) are; if a simulation on peer A lasts, say, 1 second because the user has written a very complex chaincode function, any commit activity on that same peer A (same channel) is locked until the simulation of 1 second completes
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:42:20 GMT):<br/>
By "wait time of a writer" I meant the time between the time a writer calls "rwMutex.Lock()" and the time when the call returns. I should've clarified that more.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:42:43 GMT):<br/>
And yes, if the chaincode is that complex, you'd have such an issue. 
</p>
<p><strong>minollo</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:42:59 GMT):<br/>
Yep; that's all I'm saying
</p>
<p><strong>minollo</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:45:59 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 that said, I'm interested in hearing about other performance bottlenecks you are aware of - and also understanding what kind of work is happening to alleviate them; can you elaborate?
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:54:07 GMT):<br/>
In my experiments we haven't considered network latency, so I can only talk about peer components. Orderer wasn't becoming a bottleneck before the peers, so we haven't focused on the orderer either (a single kafka-based orderer was sufficient). Given this, we found that:

1. Seriality of channels was a bottleneck. Throughput maxes out pretty soon, before the CPU becomes a bottleneck, since the commit is currently serial. So if you can, try to have multiple channels. With more channels, peers can process more transactions, faster.
2. CPU becomes a bottleneck when there are multiple channels. So you should have enough CPUs to handle more channels, and an overall (across channels) high load of transactions.
3. Underlying database - leveldb is much better.
4. Endorsement policy used - this I'm not too clear about yet, because we didn't use the N-out-of syntax, and instead used complex joins of "AND"s and "OR"s for specifying "3 out of 4 orgs" as the endorsement policy. One thing was clear that if the endorsement policy is complex (long), then that does affect the max throughput limit.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:56:06 GMT):<br/>
our experiments consisted of microbenchmarks - though we couldn't really find "long running" smart contracts for benchmarking. Major bottleneck was the commit phase. Endorsement and ordering were scaling well with increasing load.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 19:59:47 GMT):<br/>
Oh, and of course, crypto operations were a major bottleneck. But I think recently a fix for that got merged - the MSP component was optimized to reduce the crypto operations, and that did give a major boost to performance.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 20:03:38 GMT):<br/>
There's also one more thing - latency of transactions matters - not just throughput, in case you have many transactions touching the same keys in the ledger, due to MVCC errors. Currently Fabric creates read-write sets entirely on the endorser, and that happens rather quickly, but there's a considerable delay before the values get committed.
</p>
<p><strong>thakkarparth007</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 20:06:27 GMT):<br/>
So in case there are multiple conflicting transactions, it'd reduce the throughput. For example, if you're having a counter key that simply gets incremented every time a user visits a page (stupid example for a 'blockchain' maybe, but serves the demo) - you don't want to wait for 0.5-1s (for previous increment to have committed). 

I was personally thinking if we could introduce 'lazy

I was personally thinking if we could introduce 'lazy evaluation' for some special cases, then that'd help solve this problem to a good degree, but I don't have enough info on the use cases, and what sort of 'lazy evaluation' operators could be introduced. This is just a personal thought, and as far as I know there isn't anything going on in this space.

``` which references this Jira ticket https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3678 .  However, even though the cert validity options CurrentTime is being set to one second after the NotBefore time for the cert, the time check is still failing.  Is anyone else having this problem?

<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 19:01:21 GMT):<br/>
Quick question: How does the peer CLI work with respect to already-running peer nodes?  E.g. I've got a peer running, then I run the CLI command (in a separate terminal) to create a channel, and now I want to run the command to join that peer to the channel.  Is the `peer channel join` process talking with my already-running node?  It seems to require its own core.yaml configuration file, yet it's not clear that the `peer channel join` process is really a peer.
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 19:17:27 GMT):<br/>
@vdods working with `peer cli` command you do not need `core.yaml` file, everything configured either with command line parameters or environmental variables 
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 19:18:10 GMT):<br/>
does it use core.yaml if present?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 19:20:47 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps a simpler clarifying question: `peer node` is pretty clearly for invoking the peer server.  The other commands, such as `peer chaincode`, `peer channel` seem to be operating as a client which talks to an existing peer node (server).  I'm thinking in terms of the distinction/separation between the fabric-ca tools `fabric-ca-server` and `fabric-ca-client`.
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 19:20:57 GMT):<br/>
`defMaxBlockDistance = 100`
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 00:03:09 GMT):<br/>
Using the same executable for server and client is confusing, especially when it comes to configuration -- which one uses which config vars
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 00:03:32 GMT):<br/>
I'd suggest using peer-server and peer-client, as fabric-ca does
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 00:14:53 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin Is there an example of which env vars are needed to properly call `peer channel join` (among others)?  I'm attempting to do so, but getting
`[main] main -> ERRO 001 Cannot run peer because cannot init crypto, missing /home/vdods/files/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/sampleconfig/generated-artifacts/orgs/org0/fabric-ca-clients/peer0-admin/msp folder` where it's clearly using the default "sampleconfig" path from somewhere, but I'm not sure where.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 00:50:11 GMT):<br/>
This seems to call for setting FABRIC_CFG_PATH, but then it wants to load a config file like core.yaml, which is precisely what I'm trying to avoid
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 00:51:50 GMT):<br/>
I looked in the fabric source code, and unless you set FABRIC_CFG_PATH, it adds the development config hyperledger/fabric/sampleconfig/core.yaml, which is meant only to be used in a test/dev environment.  This is really bad because it's the implicit default behavior, and to do the correct thing in a production environment (i.e. not use the dev config), one must first know about this configuration, and take an explicit step to avoid it.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 01:04:54 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I'm getting it to work with the following hacks:
- setting FABRIC_CFG_PATH to the dir that contains the MSP of peer-admin (i.e. the account whose cert is in the peer's msp/admincerts dir)
- creating an empty core.yaml file in $FABRIC_CFG_PATH
- copying peer-admin's cert into its own admincerts dir
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 01:07:39 GMT):<br/>
I think these hacks are all due to the fact that the peer server and peer client are conflated into a single executable, and therefore the configuration and execution of each is messy and unclear.  It makes sense not to require a config for non-server cli operations such as `peer channel join`, but unless a config file is specified (via setting FABRIC_CFG_PATH), it attempts to load the unsafe dev env config in sampleconfig.  It also doesn't make sense for the peer admin account to be its own admin -- it's the admin of the peer, not itself.  I think this is due to the MSP loading function always expecting to see msp/admincerts/xyz.pem, even if what is using the MSP has no concept of admin.

@wlahti @muralisr  For the new feature https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5481
What is the _context_ that determines the what type blocks that the Peer will notify the client with? Is it the organization the peer belongs to so irregardless of what channel it is wanting block notifications it will only ever  be allowed to receive Filter vs Full blocks ?  Or, does the specific channel  blocks that it wants notification will change what it can receive ?
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:23:57 GMT):<br/>
Since you're talking about blocks/filtered blocks from the new (not yet merged) channel service, the access control policies (which I believe are on a per channel basis) determine which event types a client can receive. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:23:57 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:27:07 GMT):<br/>
So what is the behavor if a Peer  org. on channel A is allowed Full blocks and on channel B its only Filtered blocks and it tries to register for both for Full blocks ?  I assume it will get rejected.  
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:29:27 GMT):<br/>
yes, the registration request is all or nothing. Assuming registration for only block events on both channels, the client would receive a message stating that registration failed due to not have access to block events on channel B.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:30:07 GMT):<br/>
So it does identify which
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:30:09 GMT):<br/>
that is where the BlockOrFilteredBlock registration type that you requested (aka BlockBest) will come in handy
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:31:40 GMT):<br/>
I assume it will get the most restricted block (FilterBlock) if any channel is limited to that type

</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:32:17 GMT):<br/>
the response will have an entry for each registration request and whether any error occurred

<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 15:33:10 GMT):<br/>
yes, correct.

Just to make certain we are on the same page .. back to my example if the registration was for BlockOrFilteredBlock on A and B above.  The client would only see FilteredBlock for *both* channel A and B.

I have a public channel with write permission to Org1 and Read permission to rest all Organizations, hence the channel configuration policy. A different chaincode installed on a channel (say channel-1) performs a channel-2-channel query access on the public channel (within the same peer node).

It is seen during channel-2-channel access, the write policy is evaluated and hence channel-2-channel query access fails. Problem Example - Org2 is authorized for write-operation on channel-1 but not on public channel. This endorsement proposal is marked as failed due to write-access check on public channel.

As far as we rememberer, there was always read-access support enabled by Hyperledger Fabric during c-2-c access operations. Is this a defect?

Note: I tried even performing writes in our public chaincode during c-2-c operation (after giving write permission on public channel to Org2) but this was never see in the public ledger.

Hello all
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 00:11:50 GMT):<br/>
I have a question about when the endorsing peers update their ledger verison number
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 00:12:18 GMT):<br/>
Some documents suggest that version numbers should be updated according to 'block height' 
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 00:13:30 GMT):<br/>
Another document suggests to get high throughput on fabric you should send state deltas rather than a write value, so that multiple transactions can have an impact on the same key's value within a block
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 00:14:22 GMT):<br/>
What I'm confused about is this: once the endorser processes the first state delta would it not update it's version number? If it didn't how are these state delta's all written rather than having each one replace the proceeding
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 01:07:11 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 can you explain how the fabric distinguish the msp is admin/member
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 01:07:11 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 06:45:43 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ the version is the height + the sequence in block
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 06:46:38 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain  - the MSP configuration in the local MSP or in the config block of a channel MSP contains the identities of the admins.
The MSP code simply does a comparison whether the raw identity matches one of the admin identities, that's all.

<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 06:50:29 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm it means in the orderer bootstrap,it load the genesis block to config the msp, in the each msp definition which contains the ```admins``` field,
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 06:50:42 GMT):<br/>
so the admins is the msp admin?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 06:50:42 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 06:52:20 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 06:57:58 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thx,in the fabric,each component(peer,orderer) contains the local msp,in my mind,the peer/orderer own the keystore and signcerts,it's enough,but in the ```e2e_cli```,when the peer contains so many folder

Hi everyone, I was going to start working on the JIRA https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5604. This defect is a low hanging one and is a good candidate for anyone new to hyperledger, thinking about dabbling with peer code. So, I thought give a chance for someone interested in picking it up. Please assign it yourself and start working on it if you are interested. Thank you.

I am not able to instantiate chaincode if TLS is enabled. Below are the chaincode container logs and client logs.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 05 Nov 2017 10:57:45 GMT):<br/>
@snehas the problem is that your configuration of the peer's address if an ip address
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 05 Nov 2017 10:57:47 GMT):<br/>
and not a host name
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 05 Nov 2017 10:58:01 GMT):<br/>
if you make the peer's address in the core.yaml or in the environment variables (in case of docker) to be its hostname
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 05 Nov 2017 10:58:09 GMT):<br/>
and if the hostname would match the certificate's SAN
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 05 Nov 2017 10:58:11 GMT):<br/>
it then would work

So now an identity can beclassified by whether it is a peer, orserer or client
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 11:07:29 GMT):<br/>
it means the identity should meet the peerMSP/ordererMSP?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 11:34:07 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain  - there are basically two parts to this:

1) Policies can now be written which can use Org.CLIENT, Org.PEER, Org.ORDERER in addition to the Org.ADMIN and Org.MEMBER supported in v1.0.x

2) Within your MSP, you need to define how to identity a CLIENT,PEER or ORDERER.  This can be done by using the NodeOUs section in the MSP config:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/msp/config.yaml#L10

would anyone have any thoughts on what might be going wrong here?  I've enabled TLS on my peers, but now I get this when trying to install chaincode: `[shim] userChaincodeStreamGetter -> ERRO 002 Error trying to connect to local peer: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

hmm, what exactly is the underlying issue here?  Is the ca cert from the peer not making it into the chaincode container, or is this a stale chaincode container with some other ca baked in?

hey yacov.  we have some sample-specific FAQs and troubleshooting (e.g. bottom of the BYFN doc).  However, the consensus has been to simply post questions/answers on Stack Overflow

<p><strong>steveruckdashel</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 20:04:54 GMT):<br/>
Is there anything in the works for managing chaincode images? Is running `docker rm...` really the recommendation? It seams like I'm missing something.

Hi All - I have a 4 docker container setup running (ordered, CA, peer and couchDB) on 1 server. Everything works great and I opened up all the ports within my LAN. I am trying to connected a second peer to this network. I'm assuming I need to 2 containers to do this (peer and couchdb). Does anyone have instructions on how to do this? I've tried a million things with no success.

Java grpc by default has no limit on what it can send.   Not usually an issue since its the receiving end that needs to protect itself from a DOS from the sender.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=53aMPXPPwFGXRkNqy) @yoheiueda by skimming quickly over the posted document it seems to me a bit outdated, there are three key components of the gossip presented right now:

1. Push or forwarding - whenever peer receives a new block it pick k peers at random and pushes block to them
2. Pulling - once in a while peer exchanges a digest of the blocks it has with neighbors  peers and in case it misses something it will request it
3. State transfer - covers basically cases of the newly joined peer or peer healed from the network partitioning, it tries to find a peer with most up to date ledger to sync with it. (there is periodically distributed messages with metadata of current progress for each peer in membership)


if you would like to continue the discussion about gossip protocol and more details, #fabric-gossip channel is more appropriate place of doing so and you are welcome to move current thread there

How can I add a new peer(of some Organization) in the channel ?

I have tried this :
1). spin up the 2-orgs setup (./byfn.sh -m up)
2). using cryptogen tool, made peer2.org1.example.com in a separate folder(say, crypto1)
3). Replaced some certs from the MSP of peer2.org1.example.com
                    admincerts, cacerts, tlscacerts folder are replaced with the Org1(of actual one)'s MSP
        In tls folder, I have replaced the ca.crt with the Actual Org1's ca.crt

4). run that peer in the docker container
5). fetched the mychannel.block form the orderer
6). tried to join the channel, but getting error :

<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:39:36 GMT):<br/>
I know, that, keystore-signcerts (pub/pri key-pair) is unique
And, server.crt & server.key are also unique , for each peer

But, couldn't find what's wrong am I doing here
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:45:33 GMT):<br/>
@UtkarshSingh when you use cryptogen, it generates different root certs for each run
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:46:06 GMT):<br/>
so all the crypto artifacts you generated for peer2 is not compatible with the rest of the network
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:47:11 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I know, 
That is why, I am copying MSP of the Org1(actual one) to the MSP of new peer2.org1.example.com
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:47:50 GMT):<br/>
2). using cryptogen tool, made peer2.org1.example.com in a separate folder(say, crypto1) <- and what is this for?
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:48:54 GMT):<br/>
I have two folders:
1). crypto-config ---> Actual Org1 is present
2). crypto1 -> in which I will generate one more Org1(not the actual one used in the channel), this is having peer2.org1.example.com 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:49:34 GMT):<br/>
you realise that Org1 from crypto-config and Org1 from crypto1 is not the same, right?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:49:55 GMT):<br/>
they have different root of trust
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:50:26 GMT):<br/>
so peer's TLS certs will not be trusted from the main network, that what the error you get tells you
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:51:47 GMT):<br/>
Then I am these things with peer2.org1.example.com :
1). copying MSP of ORG1(actual one) to MSP of peer2.org1.example.com(keeping keystore n signcerts)
2). copying tls folder too(not replacing server.crt & server.key)
3). Now, putting peer2.org1.example.com from Org1(not the actual one) to the Org1(actual one)
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:52:13 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=uZa2M2GETGT9PZQXH) @Vadim I am also copying tls certs 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:53:02 GMT):<br/>
@UtkarshSingh  the signcert and server.crt are signed by a different CA
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:53:39 GMT):<br/>
copying ca certs won't change this
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:55:20 GMT):<br/>
inside any peer I have two Folders-> 1. msp ; 2. tls 
What's the use of tls folder ? How, ca.crt , server.crt & server.key are related ?

How "tls" folder is different from "msp->tlscacerts" folder ?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:55:57 GMT):<br/>
TLS is for encrypting connections, ca.crt is the cert of the CA which signed the server.crt
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:56:32 GMT):<br/>
msp is for identifying peers and orderers within the fabric network
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 12:58:03 GMT):<br/>
what I would do to test dynamic peer adding is that I'd generated certs for 3 peers, then used the first two peers to start the network as usual and then used the remaining certs for peer3 to join it to the network when it's already running
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 13:12:34 GMT):<br/>
That won't be dynamic, as there could be much more peers that want to join that channel
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 13:12:45 GMT):<br/>
Does fabric-ca solve this ??

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=vR2zn4vBaXJ6dWsku) @Vadim server.crt will be used for encrypting the msgs, right ? Then, server.key will be the key signed with the ca.crt ?? 
These two will be responsible for the end-to-end encryption ?  Then, what's the role of Keystore-signcerts(I think, it is the pub/priv key-pair of the peer) ?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 13:19:02 GMT):<br/>
@UtkarshSingh server.crt is the certificate (pub key) which is signed by ca.crt, server.key is the private key
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 13:22:32 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=v9kiw2qvGfLgK2uBe) Tell me about keystore-signcerts' role.
server.crt - server.key will be responsible for the end-to-end communication's encryption, right ??
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 13:25:45 GMT):<br/>
this is for identities, read http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msp.html
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 13:47:53 GMT):<br/>
and, server.crt - server.key will be responsible for the end-to-end communication's encryption, right ?? 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 13:48:49 GMT):<br/>
@UtkarshSingh yes
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 14:00:29 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=3SmEEBAJSPj8Z3jhS) @Vadim  Is signcerts(pub key) signed by CA => server.crt
keystore(private key) signed by CA => server.key ?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 14:01:30 GMT):<br/>
private key is not signed, it's a counterpart of a public key (which gets signed)
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 14:01:52 GMT):<br/>
there is no sense to sign the private key as nobody sees it except its owner
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 14:03:28 GMT):<br/>
@UtkarshSingh maybe read about PKI to get a better understanding: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography
</p>
<p><strong>UtkarshSingh</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 14:07:25 GMT):<br/>
 I know that concept. But, I wonder, then what's the use keystore-signcerts(pub/pri key-pair) ? They should be meant for some cryptographic stuffs..not just for the identities
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 14:10:48 GMT):<br/>
it's used for signing the messages that peers/orderers/clients exchange

Hi. I have a question about `core.chaincode.serialSend` in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v1.1.0-preview/core/chaincode/handler.go#L137-L148

Can you help me out with some Endorsement policy issues? Actually I am using hyperledger explorer and I dont see my endorsement signatures in the transaction payload? I see only one (one who invoked the transaction)
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 02:37:39 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 02:37:42 GMT):<br/>
Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 02:38:49 GMT):<br/>
You are probably not looking in the correct place... as the invoker would be in a header rather than in an endorser section
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 02:39:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm not familiar with how explorer presents things however
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 02:52:43 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart thanks. Would I see the transaction endorsers in the header? (FYI I am looking at the transaction json when I query the transaction by Id)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 02:56:25 GMT):<br/>
The endorser will be in the transaction action not in the header
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 02:56:55 GMT):<br/>
Are you looking at node.js SDK json?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 02:57:53 GMT):<br/>
If you are querying a single peer from SDK then there would only be one endorser (the peer)
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 02:59:43 GMT):<br/>
yes. the json returned by node sdk
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 03:02:02 GMT):<br/>
that means I have to query multiple peers to get the transaction by id and each one's payload would contain different endorsers?
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 03:02:20 GMT):<br/>
*btw - I mean the json response by payload
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 03:05:04 GMT):<br/>
I'm not understanding your intent...  endorsers and endorsement policy is important if you are trying to submit a transaction that writes to the ledger.  If you are simply querying for a transaction by id then you are not submitting a transaction that writes to the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 03:07:49 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for that dave. I am trying to invoke a transaction (with 2 orgs having 2 peers each) with an endorsement policy that says that both orgs (member) must sign it. But when the transaction succeeds, I try to get the transaction json using (getTransactionById). When I see the json response, I want to see that both org has endorsed the transaction at the time of invocation. 
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 03:08:55 GMT):<br/>
But I see only one endorsement in the JSON. This endorsement is of the organisation who invoked the transaction (example Org1MSP)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 03:12:33 GMT):<br/>
can you upload the json
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 03:57:06 GMT):<br/>
okay. sure.

are you sure the tx is valid?
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:17:57 GMT):<br/>
Yes. I got back a transaction id from the SDK. Can you let me know why you think this transaction is not valid?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:18:42 GMT):<br/>
did the tx have an effect on the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:23:37 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:23:43 GMT):<br/>
it got committed
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:24:02 GMT):<br/>
I get the transaction json when I get the transaction by ID
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:24:14 GMT):<br/>
Is that you are asking for?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:24:17 GMT):<br/>
invalid tx are also committed
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:24:24 GMT):<br/>
oh
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:24:31 GMT):<br/>
how do I verify that
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:24:37 GMT):<br/>
can you let me know?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:24:44 GMT):<br/>
well if you move some asset, check if it was moved
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:25:12 GMT):<br/>
I did not move any asset. I added some key/values in the db
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:25:26 GMT):<br/>
so the tx had no effect?
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:25:27 GMT):<br/>
should I go and check my couch db via the fauxton?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:26:00 GMT):<br/>
if the tx had no effect, then it is invalid, which is logical because your endorsement policy was not met
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:27:04 GMT):<br/>
No I mean, I got back the transaction id, and when I query it via the sdk using the id, get the json containing my keys and values
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:27:22 GMT):<br/>
is there any other way to verify if its valid or not? 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:27:56 GMT):<br/>
that I don't know, I know that if you listen for committed transactions over event hub, the status is returned over callbacl
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:27:56 GMT):<br/>
that I don't know, I know that if you listen for committed transactions over event hub, the status is returned over callback
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:28:07 GMT):<br/>
yes exactly
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:28:07 GMT):<br/>
also, you can check the peer logs it writes it there
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:28:56 GMT):<br/>
I get VALID in all responses from events
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:29:05 GMT):<br/>
code = 'VALID'
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:29:40 GMT):<br/>
then I don't know
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:29:45 GMT):<br/>
`eh.registerTxEvent(transactionID, (tx, code) => {
						clearTimeout(handle);

</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:29:54 GMT):<br/>
you mean this one. Right?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:29:57 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:31:28 GMT):<br/>
Okay. Thanks @Vadim as always for your support. Can you confirm me one thing? How many peers should I send the transaction to if I want to get all endorsements?
</p>
<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:32:01 GMT):<br/>
should I leave out the targets as empty or should I explicitly mentions all peers in all organizations ?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:32:08 GMT):<br/>
each peer generate one endorsement
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:32:28 GMT):<br/>
if you set targets emtpy, it will use all peers that you initialized the Client with
</p>

<p><strong>ArnabChatterjee</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:33:36 GMT):<br/>
so, for this particular case, if I set my endorsement policy to get response from both orgs members then I need to send it to atleast one peer from each organization

To instantiate a transaction properly. The instantiation request must be sent to one or more endorsing peers in all the organizations of whom endorsement is required.
During the time of invoke, it is the responsibility of the invoking application to send it to all concerned organization's peers for endorsements.

For example, if we have 2 organizations with 2 endorsing peers in each organization (Org1EP0, Org1EP1, Org2EP0 and Org2EP1) and an endorsement policy as follows:
'endorsement-policy': {
				identities: [
					{ role: { name: 'member', mspId: 'Org2MSP' }},
					{ role: { name: 'member', mspId: 'Org1MSP' }}
				],
				policy: {
					'2-of': [{ 'signed-by': 0}, 
							 { 'signed-by': 1}]
				}
			}
			
which requires the signature of both organizations to pass endorsement. 

Then it is the responsibility of the application to instantiate the chaincode in all the endorsing peers (Org1EP0, Org1EP1, Org2EP0 and Org2EP1).

During the time of invocation, it would be the responsibility of the application to send transactionProposal to atleast one peer of both organizations ( Org1EP0/Org1EP1 and Org2EP0/Org2EP1) 
to get an a valid transaction.

After all the proposal responses has been accumulated in the application, it needs to send all the recieved proposal responses and the proposal itself to the orderer for ordering.
The orderer shall verify the proposal and its responses and then send them to the committing peers for committing in the ledger.

Side Note:

1. In case the transaction fails to be valid in terms of endorsement, it still gets committed in the ledger.
2. All endorsing peers sign the transaction after simulation, hence signature of each endorsing peer (TO WHOM TRANSACTION PROPOSAL WAS SENT) will be present in the transaction
3. Judgement whether transaction is valid is determined by the orderer. Orderer will compare the proposal responses and mark it valid as per the endorsement policy. 
This response will be captured by the peers who have subscribed to the events for the given transaction (as event hubs). Only peers belonging to the transaction invoking organization can listen for events.

@ArnabChatterjee 1) YOu need to instantiate only once on any peer, not on each peer. 2) You (or more precisely, an admin of eaach peer) need to install the cc on every peer manually 3) Orderer does not validate the transactions against the policy, each peer does it independently when committing the tx to the ledger 4) peers don't listen to events, an app sdk does.

@Vadim - Thanks for your response. Say if I am using 2 orgs with 2 peers each, then if I dont instantiate it on atleast one peer of org1 and org2, then I get an endorsement policy failure (if custom endorsement policy is set). The initial values that were set for CC on peer of ORG1 and peer of ORG 2 are different and hence endorsement policy failure. But if I do init on both orgs then I get a success.

In the fabric peer build (i.e. `make peer` from the fabric project root dir), how do I go about disabling javaenv?  I have no intention of using it, and it's just slowing the build down and taking up space on my machine.

Hi all, what is the "path" of a ChaincodeID?  I'm looking at fabric/protos/peer/chaincode.proto -- I'm apparently able to install differently-versioned or named chaincode to the same path.  Does it define where the chaincode appears in the ccenv container filesystem?  I.e. $GOPATH/src/chaincode-path ?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 21 Nov 2017 19:43:57 GMT):<br/>
I'm also getting `"<nil>"` (the string `"<nil>"`, not `nil` itself) for the `Input` attribute in ChaincodeInfo (from fabric/protos/peer/query.proto) when I query instantiated chaincodes.  This claims it should be the instantiation function name and its args.  For query installed chaincodes, this string is supposed to be "blank".  So it seems like there's a bug here

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 24 Nov 2017 23:32:09 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde you can use `GetSignedProposal() (*pb.SignedProposal, error)` API to get signed proposal, then you can parse it and extract from there channel name, not sure about the chaincode name

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 25 Nov 2017 07:51:51 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde  , the channel name is from the channelHeader in the header.
While the chaincode name can be obtained from: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/protos/utils/proputils.go#L38-L53

@yacovm - this is regarding https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7137

I have copied you in the JIRA from the above message. I am not sure if Peer CLI uses separate port for non-TLS connectivity with Peer Node. However as per our test carried out, Peer CLI is able to connect to Peer Node w/o specifying those 2 parameters for Join/Install operation where Peer is running in TLS Mode. Does it mean it still use TLS w/o establishing root-of-trust or it does not use TLS yet all?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 16:50:35 GMT):<br/>
you're telling me that the peer runs with TLS, and you can connect to it without TLS?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 16:50:49 GMT):<br/>
that's not possible
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 16:51:05 GMT):<br/>
it does not use separate ports, obviously.

I just looked at the script once again, may be there is confusion in understanding, So https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/examples/e2e_cli/scripts/script.sh#L36 ==> is the TLS root of trust for Peer Node and ` --cafile ` is the root of trust for orderer node.

<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 16:59:59 GMT):<br/>

Hi! I'm new on Hyperledger Fabric. Why Fabric Peer needs **docker.sock**? Is there any security risk in this approach?
</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 20:12:56 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr - here is the CR that I submitted for resource config tx (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/15797). Below is the relevant details about this CR.

1) core/peer/configtx_util.go#26: This is the function that gets called upon receive of a resource-tree update tran and updates the resource bundle that you may want to use for acl stuff now.

2) peer/node/start.go#106: Here I register the new custom tx processor

3) core/peer/configtx_processor.go#90: this code adds entries in the ledger that rscc (system chaincode) puts so that acl stuff can keep working for now.
Once, the acl stuff starts using the resource bundle (in point 1 above), the code pointed out in (3) needs to be removed.

</p>
<p><strong>manish-sethi</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 20:14:23 GMT):<br/>
Please have a look and see if you would want to take up the acl related changes? Including @dave.enyeart so he can track it from release planning point of view

Hi does anyone known which  MSP the command "peer chaincode invoke -C testchainid -n cscc -c '{"Args":["GetChannels"]} " will be authenticated against . I believe this is querying the system channel.   Would if for example be being authenticated against the local MSP of the peer or would it be MSPs in the system channel ? 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 17:41:26 GMT):<br/>
@rsherwood It seems to be checking if Role of member of the local MSP org
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 17:41:41 GMT):<br/>
as I can invoke this using a user with a Cert signed by the MSP Org
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 17:43:48 GMT):<br/>
```	case GetChannels:
		// 2. check local MSP Members policy

So far I know of install chaincode AND join a peer to a channel  (local MSP Admin roles), and now list a peers channels (local MSP member roles). Are there any other commands that I have unaware of. I am trying to work out if we have to update the CRL list on a peer as well a on the channels.  I was hoping to get away without the update on the peer local MSP, however to do that I need to know what the peer local MSP is being used for.

this indicates that it will generally refer to some local MSP role.  This is to be refactored once the ACL work is ready.

For fabric TLS setup, Do we need to add CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE in docker-compose for CLI container?  If I don't add this variable for CLI or set incorrect path of the Key file, it still works. Could you please confirm?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 06:21:56 GMT):<br/>
Of course it works, the CLI is a TLS client

<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 16:14:41 GMT):<br/>
In V1.0 for most fabric operations the peer will act as a TLS server.  One case I can think of where it would be a client would be when gossiping with another peer. In this case I assume the root of trust for the TLS will be in the channel MSP.  Are there any case when a peer acts as TLS client and uses the local MSP as the TLS root of trust ?    For example is the peer to running chaincode communication protected by TLS in any way,  and if its is what certificate is used and which end is the TLS server and which the client ?

@dhirendrausa the fabric forms several P2P networks within a system.  The orderers are working in concert to provide total ordering and crash fault tolerance.  The peers are communicating with the orderers as well as each other (even across organizations if so configured)

you of course do not need to set the gossip level to debug, though the core logging debug is useful
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 15:56:17 GMT):<br/>
@jworthington btw. your CORE_GENERAL.. seems to be a conflation of peer and orderer config prefixes
</p>
<p><strong>jworthington</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 15:58:05 GMT):<br/>
That's probably part of my confusion. Thx
</p>
<p><strong>jworthington</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 16:12:27 GMT):<br/>
So in your example, CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID: peerOrg0 is the same ID as in the channel configtx. It seems to point to the crypto of the peer? But in the channel configtx it points to the crypto of the Org, no? So a peer channel create has to use the Org crypto? I guess that's kind of the difference between a, so to speak, peer server config and a peer client config? I could point  CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH: to the Org crypto when using as a client and then point it back. Or I think I saw a flag I could use for each client command. Does that all sound about right?
</p>
<p><strong>jworthington</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 16:13:17 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jworthington</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 16:49:49 GMT):<br/>
Ah. thx. i had set them to the local Org peers and not foreign peers. Thx!
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 17:05:56 GMT):<br/>
@jworthington you do set them to the local orgs peers.  The other peers from other orgs can then leverage this to gossip with other organizations.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 17:06:31 GMT):<br/>
meaning... only the Owning org can set its own anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 17:06:54 GMT):<br/>
this information goes into the channel which allows other orgs to have their peers connect to them if so desired
</p>
<p><strong>jworthington</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 17:10:48 GMT):<br/>
hmm. then a peer reads foreign org gossip definitions from the genesis/channel configtx and knows to use it? And each peer has to set its endpoint to match in core.yaml?
</p>
<p><strong>jworthington</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 17:24:20 GMT):<br/>
hmm. Well, channel creation succeeded on org1 peers 1 and it got the channel block. All 3 orderers show the new channel. But none of the other 3 peers got the channel block so they could join. Surely that means there's an issue with gossip, no? I assumed the other peers would get the channel block.

Reference https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/chaincode4noah.html#creating-the-package. 
1. Specifying option `-S`, the chaincode will be signed using the localMSP to create a binary format signed CDS. Is there a way to lint or view this signed CDS? Can someone retrieve a chaincode source from this CDS?
2. Will the Peer ensure the CDS is not tampered at the time of installation?

3.  `-i` helps to specify the instantiation policy. However for test i changed to use AND(OrganizationMSP.member). Chaincode upgrade fails if an OrganizationMSP's member user is used however passes if OrganizationMSP's admin user. Am i doing something incorrect?

</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:05:19 GMT):<br/>
@chill37 there was something in core.yaml related to endorsing peer, but some devs said it's not really working and the best approach is not to install chaincode on a peer if you don't want it to be endorsing
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:09:12 GMT):<br/>
@chill37, @Vadim is correct, if do not want peer to be an endorsing peer for specific chaincode, you can just avoid installing chaincode on it
</p>

yes
</p>
<p><strong>chill37</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:19:22 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim Ah I see. Thanks again. just last Q: so this core.yaml that you were talking about, would u happen to know where it's located? I was searching but no clue yet. I appreciate your help a lot!
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:19:46 GMT):<br/>
@chill37 I think that flag for endorser/not endorser no longer exists

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:20:17 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jworthington</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 14:06:27 GMT):<br/>
So, I installed and instantiated a chaincode on 4 peers (2 each for 2 orgs). All is well with the default Endorsement Policy. Invokes write and read data. I installed and instantiated the same chaincode (different name, same channel) on all 4 peers, but with a Policy of 1 Org1.member AND 1 Org2.member. All good and I see the lscc and init record in CouchDB on all 4 peers. However invokes do not write. I get an Error -  VSCC check failed, policy evaluation failed, err Failed to authenticate policy. There is also WARN 1df6 Block [78541] Transaction index [0] marked as invalid by committer. Reason code [10]. The peers logs do say Saved private data for block [78541], but I believe that to be local state and not world state. I think I understand that the client (in this case the CLI) is responsible for collecting endorsements. If that is true, then how do I get the CLI to get the endorsements? If that is not true, then the peers must need the MSP for the other peers? If so, then how do I tell the peers where the MSP is for the other peers? Or is there something else I am not understanding?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 12 Dec 2017 15:23:33 GMT):<br/>
@jworthington cli does not collect endorsements and it only can work with one peer
</p>

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 03:05:18 GMT):<br/>
Are you asking: "Does the peer endorse the proposal it receives to join a channel?"?  If so, the answer is yes, the the endorsement is only produced because it is the standard chaincode path.  There is no requirement that the client do anything with the response, though it could of course retain the endorsement for non-repudication purposes.

<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 15:12:18 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim @jyellick why the peer-chaincodedev option doesn't show in the sampleconfig/core.yaml?

i see the source code,it use just set the chaincode.mode option in the viper,so when i set the chaincode.mode = dev has the same effect

<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 16:04:22 GMT):<br/>
:) Good. So we just have to get your peer to talk to orderer
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 16:05:04 GMT):<br/>
so what's the problem? can you give me a clue ? @Ashish 
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 17:59:04 GMT):<br/>
How are u running Ur instantiation? U are referring to the Orderer in the command rite? 
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 18:23:59 GMT):<br/>
So if the hosts entry is working, then why is your peer still looking for orderer.example.com, I'm confused :(
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 01:08:22 GMT):<br/>
@Ashish i don't understand,can you use simple english?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 01:49:18 GMT):<br/>
@Ashish @Vadim @jyellick i think it's a problem for the peer gossip service
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 02:35:49 GMT):<br/>
@Ashish i use the java sdk to instantiate the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 02:38:08 GMT):<br/>
Ther you are adding Orderer to the channel object rite?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 02:38:18 GMT):<br/>
of course
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 02:39:00 GMT):<br/>
And you are calling channel.initialize() also?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 02:39:17 GMT):<br/>
i paste my java source code

@Ashish @Vadim when the peer join the channel,the gossip should make connection with the orderer node,but it can't build the connection via the orderer node

<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 08:54:30 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim so i should start the go_dns container?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 08:55:18 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain as I understood, you should create /etc/nsswitch.conf with `hosts: files dns` in it
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:02:15 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim i don't understand, can you give me more clue?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:03:12 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain create file: /etc/nsswitch.conf, open it, add there one line: `hosts: files dns`, save it, close it, try running your network again
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:04:37 GMT):<br/>
should i restart the network?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:05:00 GMT):<br/>
which network? just restart your orderer and peer
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:05:09 GMT):<br/>
ok, i try it

<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:07:46 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:08:56 GMT):<br/>
maybe try to restart your computer... if that does not work, use localhost instead of orderer.example.com
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:18:27 GMT):<br/>
i set the orderer.example.com to the localhost but it still has the error
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:18:49 GMT):<br/>
in configtx.yaml too?

<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:19:22 GMT):<br/>
yes

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:19:27 GMT):<br/>
by the way, why don't you use https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release/chaincode-docker-devmode?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:20:41 GMT):<br/>
i use the docker to start the peer/orderer but i want to debug 
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:20:41 GMT):<br/>
it use the docker to start the peer/orderer but i want to debug 
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:21:01 GMT):<br/>
so i start the peer/orderer in the dev tools
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:24:10 GMT):<br/>
i have a simple question why the system chaincode doesn't start  the docker container?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:24:24 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim @Ashish 
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:25:01 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain the simple answer is that it's caused by the fact that the peer cannot connect to the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:28:50 GMT):<br/>
peer can get the block from the orderer,so i don't understand why the peer can't connect to the orderer？
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:29:14 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain how does it get the block if it cannot connect?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:29:42 GMT):<br/>
you mean that when the peer startup,it doesn't need orderer,so when the scc 
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:29:42 GMT):<br/>
you mean that when the peer startup,it doesn't need orderer,so when the scc doesn't start the docker container,and when the peer wants to create the channel,it should be specified the orderer address
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:31:07 GMT):<br/>
as I understand, when you instantiate a chaincode, it needs to receive the tx in a block, but there is no block so it fails to start the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 09:31:39 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand what you say

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=EzmH5fgrctmAoGCnW) @Vadim   Today I tested it with a 1of endorsement policy with only a Role.ADMIN peer in the network. You are rite. It's not able to get the signature from the peer with Admin affiliation. And endorsement failed at the peer while VSCC checked it.
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 17:00:59 GMT):<br/>
Is this a bug? Is this still open in the 1.1.preview version too? Any idea?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 17:47:03 GMT):<br/>
@Ashish you would need to change the signing cert for the peer to also be an ADMIN for the MSP in the channel which seems odd as a requirement
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 19:04:39 GMT):<br/>
Would it be possible to tell me how please?  as in, what to copy ,from where, and where to paste?
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 19:04:39 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @jeffgarratt , but would it be possible to tell me how please?  as in, what to copy ,from where, and where to paste?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 20:18:18 GMT):<br/>
@Ashish this would need to be done in the channel config (via confixtgen config)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 20:18:18 GMT):<br/>
@Ashish the channel admin cert would need to be copied to the peers $LOCAL_MSP_CONFIG_PATH/signcerts folder I believe
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 20:18:18 GMT):<br/>
@Ashish the channel admin cert would need to be copied to the peers $CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH/signcerts folder I believe
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 20:34:37 GMT):<br/>
as well as the private key would need to go to the peers $CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH/keystore folder
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 20:35:09 GMT):<br/>
this would effectively run your peer under the identity of your channel admin (which I would not recommend btw)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 20:36:04 GMT):<br/>
or you could create a new cert for the private key you already have that is then placed into the channel ADMINS per the configtxgen mechanism
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Thu, 14 Dec 2017 20:57:07 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 13:26:35 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain correct. To be able to install you have to change the version and install. So if Ur first code is test.1 next version would be test.2. 
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 13:27:50 GMT):<br/>
Then after installing the new code you would upgrade.rite? While upgrading you have to mention the chaincode name as test and the version as 2 rite? 
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 13:27:59 GMT):<br/>
Have you done that too?

Question regarding waiting for chaincode instantiation to complete: I've been encountering errors when instantiating chaincode and then immediately querying it -- say I upgrade an instantiated chaincode.  If I query instantiated chaincodes immediately, the recently and successfully instantiated chaincode doesn't yet appear in the response.  If I wait 20 seconds to query, it does show up.  Is there an event I can listen for to be notified when the instantiation actually goes through?  This sort of nondeterministic guess-waiting is not acceptable.
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 01:06:05 GMT):<br/>
@vdods it exists the chaincode event
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 01:06:05 GMT):<br/>
@vdods it exists the chaincode event,you can do it,i am doing it,because the chaincode instantiate is too long
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 01:09:25 GMT):<br/>
Which chaincode event?  Do you have to define a custom one that fires at the end of the chaincode Init function?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 05:28:40 GMT):<br/>
the ccenv images disappear without reason @Vadim @Ashish @jeffgarratt

<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 05:50:58 GMT):<br/>
@vdods How are you upgrading/querying? Using an SDK? Or CLI? 
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 05:53:17 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain That's weird. Are u running a make everytime? Fabric Docker images once built, need not be rebuilt everytime. Are you sure you don't have another make command or a docker rmi command getting executed by mistake?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 05:54:29 GMT):<br/>
i am sure,i just want to instantiate chaincode by the java sdk and it tell me the error ```Failed to pull hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:x86_64-1.1.0-alpha-snapshot-2b428bf3: API error (404): {"message":"manifest for hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:x86_64-1.1.0-alpha-snapshot-2b428bf3 not found"}```

<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sat, 16 Dec 2017 10:12:46 GMT):<br/>

@Ashish @Vadim @jyellick i think the ChaincodeInfo which locate at the peer/query.proto should return the  instantiation policy and endorser policy
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 17 Dec 2017 00:17:31 GMT):<br/>
So it looks like might be an event one can listen for to be notified of the instantiation happening -- I'm seeing an event from chaincode "lscc", but it has no event name or payload (it looks like the Extension field of the peer.ChaincodeAction message is empty, which it looks like means there will be no event name or event payload.

<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 17 Dec 2017 00:50:04 GMT):<br/>
Or -- is the payload within the response to be manually unmarshalled by the app?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 17 Dec 2017 00:50:23 GMT):<br/>
There's no clear documentation in the protos stating the format of the payload
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 17 Dec 2017 16:37:58 GMT):<br/>
@vdods the "lscc" RWSet is an internal one (part of the fabric chaincode metadata if you will) as opposed to user chaincode RWSet created as part of the instantiation. You shouldn't have to parse it...
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 17 Dec 2017 19:18:16 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr The payload (in the ChaincodeAction) of the event is the RWSet?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 17 Dec 2017 19:18:50 GMT):<br/>
Regardless, does that event indicate that the instantiation has completed successfully?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 17 Dec 2017 19:22:03 GMT):<br/>
actually its not the RWSet (meant to say the ChaincodeAction contains RWSet among other things). the "response" field contains the response to the instantiate from the LSCC
</p>

@Ashish @Vadim another simple question is how can i get the lastest docker logs,i don't get the previous logs 
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 17:19:55 GMT):<br/>
If a peer has been down and it starts up how will it determine that it is current ? Does it for example provide the order on startup with the last block number  it has for each channel , or does  the order send it the current channel block height, or does it wait for the next block to be delivered to know that it is missing blocks ?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 19:40:33 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr Do you know what the type of the marshaled data in the response field is?  Presumably it's something defined in a protobuf.  I'd like to unmarshal it and examine the data, but there's no indication as to the type.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 19:52:23 GMT):<br/>
Also, are chaincode and rejection events no longer a thing in v1.0.3?  I'm calling stub.SetEvent in my successful invoke transactions, and getting nothing, and that's after registering interest in chaincode events with EventName: ".*" (also tried empty string)
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 19:53:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm also intentionally submitting a bad invoke transaction to test if transaction rejection events are being sent.  I see no indication in the peer debug logs that those events are being sent, and no indication in my sdk logs that they're being received.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 20:03:40 GMT):<br/>
Using EventName equal to the exact event name also doesn't work.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 20:12:03 GMT):<br/>
I've heard that in Fabric 1.1, there will be only Block events... is this somehow already true for Fabric 1.0.x?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 20:12:08 GMT):<br/>
I do receive block events.

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 19 Dec 2017 07:52:16 GMT):<br/>
@vdods technically, there are only block events in fabric v1.0 also, the SDKs parse blocks as they come, extract events and trigger listeners if any
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 19 Dec 2017 07:52:44 GMT):<br/>
for me, the events are working. How do you register your event listeners?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 19 Dec 2017 07:56:03 GMT):<br/>
Ok, that matches what the author of github.com/CognitionFoundry/gohfc has told me.  I'm registering them via code like
```	
	creator, err := proto.Marshal(&msp.SerializedIdentity{
		Mspid:   mspId,
		IdBytes: pem.EncodeToMemory(&pem.Block{Type: "CERTIFICATE", Bytes: identity.Certificate.Raw})})
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
        interest := &peer.Event{
        Event: &peer.Event_Register{
            Register: &peer.Register{
                Events: []*peer.Interest{
                    {
                        EventType: peer.EventType_BLOCK,
                    },                    {
                        EventType: peer.EventType_CHAINCODE,
                        RegInfo: &peer.Interest_ChaincodeRegInfo{
                            ChaincodeRegInfo: &peer.ChaincodeReg{
                                ChaincodeId: "kvs", // TEMP HACK
                                EventName: "put", // TEMP HACK
                            },
                        },
                    },
                    {
                        EventType: peer.EventType_REJECTION,
                    },
        Creator:creator,
    }
	evtBytes, err := proto.Marshal(interest)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	sb, err := crypto.Sign(evtBytes, identity.PrivateKey)
	if err != nil {
		return err

	sigEvent := peer.SignedEvent{EventBytes: evtBytes, Signature: sb}

@vdods ok, I'm not familiar with go sdk
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 19 Dec 2017 07:57:35 GMT):<br/>
the gist is that I'm using the event interest registration API in github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/peer
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 19 Dec 2017 07:59:18 GMT):<br/>
If block events are really the only thing, then I think that's fine for now.  It sounds like the API is just not fully implemented (i.e. registering interest in types of events, possibly including a filter, in order to have minimal network comms regarding events)
</p>

Hi guys, we're experiencing the same issue as in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3563 i.e. "This identity is not an admin" while trying to join the channel from fabric-cli container (it works from peers). Tried to use the admin identity as suggested in the ticket but still getting the same issue. Can someone suggest what else to check/verify?

@mzhk I see your problem, in peer msp the cert User1@dummy.example.com-cert.pem is considered to be an admin cert
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:04:20 GMT):<br/>
this "/etc/hyperledger/fabric/admin/msp/admincerts/" - I don't know what for, peer does not check that folder afaik
</p>
<p><strong>mzhk</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:06:58 GMT):<br/>
Yes, this is our custom, we map a "user certs" to `/etc/hyperledger/fabric/msp` and admin user certs to `/etc/hyperledger/fabric/admin/msp`, and switch the env var `FABRIC_CFG_PATH` if we need some "admin actions" in setup.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:07:40 GMT):<br/>
@mzhk peer treats admin user from msp/admincerts, and there you have User1
</p>
<p><strong>mzhk</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:08:32 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim ok, and msp/admincerts is relative to `FABRIC_CFG_PATH` right ?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:09:21 GMT):<br/>
for peer msp, the CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH is responsible
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:09:40 GMT):<br/>
the local admin cert is in peer msp/admincerts
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:09:54 GMT):<br/>
soo, FABRIC_CFG_PATH does not play a role in this
</p>
<p><strong>mzhk</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:10:19 GMT):<br/>
is it the same for fabric-cli ?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:11:19 GMT):<br/>
peer config has nothing to do with cli config...
</p>
<p><strong>mzhk</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:27:12 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim Hm, it's getting clearer now, i guess. The naming we have made it confusing.. can you please advise me here for a second still?
So if we create 2 users Name1 and Name2, then if we set one of those user's 'msp' dir in `CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH` then this user is only allowed to make actions on a peer?
Is there a way or even a case that we have 2 users configured simultaneously on a peer?
Are the 'actions' on a peer somehow being distinguished? That some can be done by admin and other by "normal" user? Or generally, whichever user's certs are configured in `CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH`, then that particular user is allowed to do all channel/chaincode actions on the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:27:43 GMT):<br/>
you want to have 2 admin users on peer?
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:28:01 GMT):<br/>
admins are needed to join/install chaincodes

CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH specifies path to local peer msp, from there peer will get its identity and identity of users which can do admin tasks
</p>
<p><strong>mzhk</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:30:33 GMT):<br/>
I want to have one admin and one normal user.
</p>
<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:32:05 GMT):<br/>
you just need admin, normal users are checked against the root org certs, they don't need to be added explicitly
</p>
<p><strong>mzhk</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:36:43 GMT):<br/>
So just to confirm, the users additional to admin (i.e. User1) generated with cryptogen, their certs don't need to end up on the peer at all ? Just the admin cert needs to be added so that it's defined who's the admin of that peer?
</p>

@mzhk that's right

Reposting - @muralisr 

Release: Fabric -1.0.4

Reference https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/chaincode4noah.html#creating-the-package. 

1. Specifying option `-S`, the chaincode will be signed using the localMSP to create a binary format signed CDS. Is there a way to lint or view this signed CDS? Can intruder retrieve a chaincode source from this CDS?
2. Will the Peer ensure the CDS is not tampered at the time of installation?
3. `-i` helps to specify the instantiation policy. However for test I changed to use ` "AND ('OrganizationMSP.member') "`. Chaincode instantiation fails if an OrganizationMSP's member user is used however passes if OrganizationMSP's admin user. Am I doing something incorrect? It looks now, it is using the Default Instantiation policy i.e. any authorized Organization's Admin user can perform Instantiation.
4: How do I change the instantiation policy set during chancode instantiation (the default policy)? 

Thanks.

<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 06:12:45 GMT):<br/>
@Vadim @jyellick @Ashish when i use the java sdk to get the instantiated chaincode information,it should return the following data structure,however,i don't get the input args ```message ChaincodeInfo {
  string name = 1;
  string version = 2;
  // the path as specified by the install/instantiate transaction
  string path = 3;
  // the chaincode function upon instantiation and its arguments. This will be
  // blank if the query is returning information about installed chaincodes.
  string input = 4;
  // the name of the ESCC for this chaincode. This will be
  // blank if the query is returning information about installed chaincodes.
  string escc = 5;
  // the name of the VSCC for this chaincode. This will be
  // blank if the query is returning information about installed chaincodes.
  string vscc = 6;
  // the chaincode unique id.
  // computed as: H(
  //                H(name || version) ||
  //                H(CodePackage)
  //              )
  bytes id = 7;
}```

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=ucsMxySTcvH6EqPZu) @Vadim i find the method ```txcc, vscc, policy, err := v.GetInfoForValidate(chdr.TxId, chdr.ChannelId, ns)``` which will get the policy about the application chaincode

Hi
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:47:17 GMT):<br/>
Im trying to establish peer to peer connection from the private network
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:49:29 GMT):<br/>
I have established network in a mac machine and when im trying to establish peer to peer connection with another machine then i could not able to establish it. Handshake is not happening. is there any link or tutorial to fix
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:49:52 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean "the handshake is not happening"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:49:58 GMT):<br/>
give more details
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:50:02 GMT):<br/>
are you using TLS?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:50:13 GMT):<br/>
are you running in docker?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:50:33 GMT):<br/>
so the peers in 1 machine are running in docker, and on another machine are also running in docker?
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:53:00 GMT):<br/>
I mean,
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:54:58 GMT):<br/>
In Docker Container, If I add another peer for extend service, will someone from other machine who has composer-playground in it and valid participant card, Will they become participant in my business network?? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:56:24 GMT):<br/>
hold on, before the peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:56:29 GMT):<br/>
who runs the ordering service? Both machines?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:56:31 GMT):<br/>
or just 1?
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:56:43 GMT):<br/>
1 machine
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:58:21 GMT):<br/>
we are not using TLS and docker is running on both machine
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:58:57 GMT):<br/>
orderer service is available in business network admin machine
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:59:23 GMT):<br/>
so you have 1 machine with an orderer and some peers
and another machine with only peers?
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:59:58 GMT):<br/>
yes... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:00:24 GMT):<br/>
oh... hm, so you basically need 2 ordering endpoints then
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:00:36 GMT):<br/>
1 the internal endpoint (docker ip address)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:00:46 GMT):<br/>
1 the external ip of the machine, with port forwarding to the docker instance
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:00:57 GMT):<br/>
these 2 endpoints - you put in the channel creation
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:01:10 GMT):<br/>
and then when peers will try to connect to the orderer, they will try both and 1 of them would succeed ;)
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:02:09 GMT):<br/>
2 endpoints how to configure
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:02:16 GMT):<br/>
??
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:02:40 GMT):<br/>
in the configtx.yaml

I'm not in the call
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:07:54 GMT):<br/>
post here or in stack overflow
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:07:59 GMT):<br/>
this way others can learn too
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:08:21 GMT):<br/>
Before to that, If I want to introduce one another machine in to the network I have to reconfigure this again??
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:08:29 GMT):<br/>
yea sure... Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:08:31 GMT):<br/>
yes, every time 
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:08:37 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:12:53 GMT):<br/>
In my machine, on docker-compose.yml I have only one peer, and I name that peer1. Is that enough or I need to configure one another peer to respond when connect from other device with participant card 
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:13:39 GMT):<br/>
vp1:

discovery root node?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:13:57 GMT):<br/>
you're using... v0.6?
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:14:19 GMT):<br/>
just declaring another peer name as vp1
</p>
<p><strong>prasadguru.r</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:14:23 GMT):<br/>
it can be anything
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:14:31 GMT):<br/>

Hi

We have established business network using hyperledger composer and created participant card by creating peers.

When we try to connect the peer in different machine in the local after importing participant card then I'm getting the following error

Error: Error trying login and get user Context. Error: Error trying to enroll user or load channel configuration. Error: Enrollment failed with errors [[{"code":400,"message":"Authorization failure"}]]

Business network is created in the mac machine and both machine are connected in the same wi-fi. Please help us to establish connection.

Hello

<p><strong>gen_el</strong> (Wed, 03 Jan 2018 16:34:01 GMT):<br/>
How do i specify an endorsement policy such that only 1 peer of 1 org endorses a trxn. Currently all 4 peers (2 peers per org) in my network seem to endorsing transactions. That is not what i want.

@gen_el : http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endorsement-policies.html -- the last example shows the endorsement policy you are most likely looking for.

Hi all, I'm getting an error while trying to enable TLS for peer-to-orderer communication for channel creation:
```+ peer channel create --orderer localhost:7050 --tls true --logging-level debug --channelID simple-channel --file channel-creation.tx
2018-01-04 23:56:11.382 PST [msp] GetLocalMSP -> DEBU 001 Returning existing local MSP

```
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:05:13 GMT):<br/>
I've tried a number of things, including explicitly exporting CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE to the file in tlscacerts obtained via enrollment with enrollment.profile tls
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:05:56 GMT):<br/>
I'm setting FABRIC_CFG_PATH and some other relevant env vars, and the channel creation works fine without the `--tls true` option.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:21:38 GMT):<br/>
Is it necessary to have a core.yaml file when running the peer as a "client" for e.g. channel creation (i.e. not as a peer in a network)

I've been getting away with no core.yaml file and only setting a few env vars.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:24:40 GMT):<br/>
@vdods you forgot 1 flag...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:24:51 GMT):<br/>
--ca or something like that
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:25:03 GMT):<br/>
do `peer channel --help` it will show
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:25:05 GMT):<br/>
`--work-perfectly true` ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:25:16 GMT):<br/>
there is no such flag in fabric
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:25:26 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:25:28 GMT):<br/>
that I know of
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:25:49 GMT):<br/>
ah --cafile
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:25:57 GMT):<br/>
Wow, I'm not sure how it worked without that before
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:26:23 GMT):<br/>
Is that supposed to specify the TLS CA cert?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:26:27 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:26:33 GMT):<br/>
and now we have mutual TLS too in v1.1
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:26:39 GMT):<br/>
Ah ok, that was super unclear in the --help message
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:26:41 GMT):<br/>
so we have more flags that you can forget and be confused
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:26:45 GMT):<br/>
haha
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:27:16 GMT):<br/>
I'm hoping the proposed split of the peer binary into peer-client and peer-server (or whatever they'll be called) will fix this all up
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:27:25 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:44:47 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I'm now getting `transport: authentication handshake failed: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` -- I think it may have to do with the fact that I have an intermediate CA below the root CA.  Is it possible to specify a cert chain as the argument to --cafile, or otherwise specify intermediate CAs?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:45:18 GMT):<br/>
I guess the help message does say "certificate(s)"
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:50:35 GMT):<br/>
Though that should only be trusted root CA certs, not intermediates.  The connecting client shouldn't have to provide the cert chain to verify the server's cert.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:54:00 GMT):<br/>
Try to put a concatenated PEM
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:54:39 GMT):<br/>
Or just the intermediate cert
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:56:22 GMT):<br/>
Is that right though?  The connecting peer shouldn't need to know the intermediate CA details?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:56:22 GMT):<br/>
Is that right though?  The connecting peer shouldn't need to know the intermediate CA details.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:57:14 GMT):<br/>
Like say the orderer org restructures their intermediate CAs, but keeps the same root CA.  The peer would then need to have updated intermediate CA certs
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 09:03:39 GMT):<br/>
Oh, perhaps the orderer itself should use a cert chain for its cert?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 09:47:18 GMT):<br/>
You are validatong the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 09:47:24 GMT):<br/>
*validating
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 09:47:38 GMT):<br/>
It sends the entire chain i think
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 09:48:01 GMT):<br/>
Thouh not sure
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 00:33:47 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Hmm.. I think it probably doesn't.  I added another --cafile flag with the intermediate CA cert, and that worked.  But, I noticed that in my orderer.yaml, there's no specification of the cert chain like there is in fabric-ca-server-config.yaml (via ca.chainfile)
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 00:34:04 GMT):<br/>
Is there actually an option in orderer.yaml (perhaps not having a default value) for specifying the chain?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 02:02:49 GMT):<br/>
Setting the orderer cert to the chain (in orderer cert, intermediate CA cert, root CA cert order) works for the channel creation.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 02:04:33 GMT):<br/>
However, I'm having trouble with `peer channel join` in an odd way where neither the orderer nor the peer seem to be connected to (again, the TLS-disabled versions of these commands have been working fine)
```+ peer channel join --blockpath generated-artifacts/channel-creation/simple-channel/simple-channel.block --logging-level debug --orderer localhost:7050 --tls true --cafile generated-artifacts/orgs/org0/fabric-ca-clients/peer0-admin/tls/tlscacerts/localhost-7054.pem

<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 05:57:31 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I did some log analysis and code diving, and `peer channel join` doesn't even attempt to use TLS in its GRPC connection, even though the --tls and --cafile options are ostensibly applicable to all commands under `peer channel`.  This is clearly wrong, as a TLS-enabled peer will only accept TLS-enabled connections.  I think this may be an issue of no one actually ever testing the CLI `peer channel join` with TLS enabled.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 06:14:51 GMT):<br/>
My guess is that everyone running with TLS enabled uses an SDK to make peers join or list channels.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 06:48:05 GMT):<br/>
Ok -- using `CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true` and `CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=path/to/cert` works
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 06:48:22 GMT):<br/>
I've filed a bug https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7630 -- @yacovm Who would be appropriate to assign this to?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:19:46 GMT):<br/>
@vo
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:20:49 GMT):<br/>
@vdods if peer channel join doesn't use TLS then our integration tests won't pass as the peers use TLS there...
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:23:02 GMT):<br/>
Right, they must be using the env vars CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED and CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE to make that happen, and not the --tls and --cafile commandline options
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:23:42 GMT):<br/>
oh.. hehehe I see the confusion
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:23:53 GMT):<br/>
so the CLI flags --tls, --cafile
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:24:00 GMT):<br/>
they control the orderer's TLS config
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:24:11 GMT):<br/>
the CORE_PEER_* environment variables control the peer
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:24:16 GMT):<br/>
Yep
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:24:25 GMT):<br/>
so... that's not a bug
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:24:43 GMT):<br/>
Well, if it's not a bug, then the --help message is super misleading
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:25:11 GMT):<br/>
I guess it does mention orderer in the help message
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:25:12 GMT):<br/>
it could be. what does it say?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:26:11 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps what's misleading is that the --tls and --cafile options are available for all `peer channel` subcommands, and not just `peer channel create` and `peer channel update`
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:26:39 GMT):<br/>
If an option has no effect on a particular subcommand, it shouldn't be available to that subcommand.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:28:56 GMT):<br/>
oh I see
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:28:58 GMT):<br/>
you're right
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:29:41 GMT):<br/>
I think this confusion also stems from the overall confusion over the peer binary acting as a server and a client, and the configuration thereof being correspondingly confusing and entangled.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:30:34 GMT):<br/>
I don't know where it stems from
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:31:15 GMT):<br/>
I guess you can file an `improvement` (not a bug) JIRA to have these commands now shown in the help of all but `channel create / update`
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:53:26 GMT):<br/>
Hmm.. ok
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 20:57:26 GMT):<br/>
I've managed to set everything up, and in one of my orgs I've got 2 peers -- the non-anchor peer has the anchor peer's address as its peer.gossip.bootstrap address.  Both peers max out their CPU usage, with the logs repeating messages like the following:

Note that zero transactions have been made on the channel -- this is just after having the peers join the channel
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:00:09 GMT):<br/>
If I change the peer.gossip.bootstrap address for each peer to point to itself, then the CPU usage is more reasonable (2-4%, though this still seems excessive for a process that is ostensibly doing nothing), but presumably the peers will not gossip blocks back and forth.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:21:53 GMT):<br/>
@vdods turn of the gossip logging too
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:22:01 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:22:12 GMT):<br/>
How many CPUs do you have?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:22:13 GMT):<br/>
I tried that, but the CPU usage is still really high
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:22:18 GMT):<br/>
8 logical cores
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:22:34 GMT):<br/>
What, how ia that possible that they are maxed
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:22:51 GMT):<br/>
Not pinned exactly at 100%, but it varies from 60% - 90%+

<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:23:15 GMT):<br/>
considering that the peers are handling no transactions or new blocks to gossip, that seems rather high

Something like aliveInterval

</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:36:14 GMT):<br/>
There are a few others, but they seemed less relevant to the gossip process than this problem suggests
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:38:18 GMT):<br/>
Try to raise requestStateInfoInterval to 10s . Are you using docker?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:39:19 GMT):<br/>
No, I'm running each service as a daemon process with a monitoring service

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:39:36 GMT):<br/>
Oh ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:39:44 GMT):<br/>
So change just in core.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:39:49 GMT):<br/>
And resfart
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:39:49 GMT):<br/>
And restart
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:39:50 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:39:53 GMT):<br/>
Restart
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:43:35 GMT):<br/>
That didn't seem to appreciably change the CPU usage
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:43:54 GMT):<br/>
Thats great
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:44:20 GMT):<br/>
What was the expected result?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:44:28 GMT):<br/>
Now try for the aliveMessageInterval - turn it twice as big
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:44:33 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:46:05 GMT):<br/>
Wait, is one of the peers perhaps behind?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:46:09 GMT):<br/>
In ledger height
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:46:20 GMT):<br/>
Do they have the same height?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:47:48 GMT):<br/>
Hmm.. is there an easy way, say with a peer CLI command, to check that?  Or does it show up in the logs
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:48:12 GMT):<br/>
Btw -- changing aliveTimeInterval from 5s to 10s slightly reduced the CPU usage.. to about a range of 40-80%
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 21:48:41 GMT):<br/>

The peer creates a pid file peer.pid in the peer's fileSystemPath, but doesn't delete it when the peer goes down.  This seems like a bug -- say you're trying to control the peer with some monitoring service, and you go to stop the peer by issuing a SIGTERM to that pid, only to discover that the peer had already quit, and you just terminated some innocent bystander process that happened to get that address.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 22:22:14 GMT):<br/>
Can anyone comment on that?  Is there some other means to clean up the pid file when the peer goes down?  It seems like it may need to be an OS-level thing, since the peer program itself may not be able to catch a signal that kills it in order to clean up its pid file, such as SIGQUIT
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 22:22:38 GMT):<br/>
Or, say the machine hard-reboots, and even the OS has no chance to clean it up.

<p><strong>mogamboizer</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 01:46:41 GMT):<br/>
What are the setup/configuration differences between endorsers and committers? My understanding is endorsers have chaincode and are passed a endorsement policy by the client on a particular channel. A peer that is an endorser for channel X can be a committer only for channel Y. Would it be correct to say that the peer role (committer or endorser) depends if the chaincode is present and the endorsement policy is applicable.

<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 14:08:20 GMT):<br/>
@mogamboizer The role of endorser as well as committer are both within the context of a channel, and requires not just the presence (i.e. installation) but the instantiation of the chaincode on a particular channel.  All peers are committers for the channels they have joined.  Peers that have the chaincode installed and instantiated can also act as endorsers.
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 14:33:33 GMT):<br/>
so the client should send the request to the all peer for endorser?

Yeah.. i'm not in the office anymore so a bit hard :smirk: . So, if the peer receives blocks that are to far in the future for its ledger, it doesnt keep that in memory so its memory will not blow up, so it juat drops them instead

When we send a proposal for a peer to join a channel is it on return ready to instantiate new chaincode/ invoke existing  ?    Let say there were millions of blocks already on the ledger for this channel.  Can we send those endorsements ?    If not,  is there something that should be waited on to know it ready ? 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 21:23:29 GMT):<br/>
@rickr you could possibly do a quick deliver from the peer and the orderer and verify equivalence

Hi, i would like to have a deeper understanding of transaction.proto. My aim is to extract a json formatted data from the input field.
The channel.queryBlock(block_num) from the fabric-sdk-node returns a unencoded block apart from input section of the "chaincode_proposal_payload.input".
Temporary solution for this is to use "chaincode_proposal_payload.input.toString('utf8')" to covert input into a more readable string, but this string contains some additional characters which restricts it from being converted to a json object. 
Is there any other way to parse chaincode_proposal_payload.input into a json?

Hi All,
I have following setup on 2 VMS
Setup on VM1:
orderers,kafkas,zookeepers, 2 peers,their couchdbs and cli(fabric-tools) on VM1 in a single docker-compose file --> docker-compose-vm1.yaml.
Setup on VM2:
one peer,couchdb and cli in another docker-compose file --> docker-compose-vm2.yaml

Peer on VM2 connects with orderer on VM1 via entry in /etc/hosts of Peer on VM2.

Getting following error while firing invoke command on channel from Peer on VM2.

`[dockercontroller] stopInternal -> DEBU 3493 Kill container dev-peer01.org.example.com-channel-${chaincode-version} `
		`(API error (500): {"message":"Cannot kill container dev-peer01.org.example.com-channel-${chaincode-version}: Container ${ContainerID} is not running"}`
`[dockercontroller] Start -> ERRO 3498 start-could not start container: API error (500): {"message":"invalid cluster node while attaching to network"}`
`[chaincode] Launch -> ERRO 349b launchAndWaitForRegister failed Error starting container: API error (500): {"message":"invalid cluster node while attaching to network"}`
`[chaincode] ExecuteChaincode -> ERRO 349c Error executing chaincode: Error starting container: API error (500): {"message":"invalid cluster node while attaching to network"}`

		`error: Error executing chaincode: Error starting container: API error (500): {"message":"invalid cluster node while attaching to network"}`

The container dev-peer01.org.example.com-channel-${chaincode-version} gets created, but stays in created state in `docker ps -a`.		
PS-Same command when fired over same channel from Peer on VM1 gets successfully executed and reflects in the couchdb of Peer on VM2.

so `CORE_PEER_CHAINCODEADDRESS=<<peer_host_name>>:7052` ... I'd get into the container and see if you can `ping <<peer_host_name>>`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:06:30 GMT):<br/>
this is right at the beginning of chaincode launch... we have to do some basic network level debugging
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:06:49 GMT):<br/>
first make sure peer is listening on  7052 correctly
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:07:10 GMT):<br/>
and next ping from container and check... 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:07:40 GMT):<br/>
Id also try turning TLS off to keep it simple and go frtom ther
</p>
<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:08:02 GMT):<br/>
ok .. I am still figuring out installing ping on peer :)

I think
</p>
<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:09:50 GMT):<br/>
yes , I could ping that IP from peer container
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:17:03 GMT):<br/>
What does core peer address say @Ratnakar ?
</p>
<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:18:04 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  
`CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=<<peer_host_name>>:7051`

for example peer1 of org1
`CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1.org2.example.com:7051`
</p>
<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:18:48 GMT):<br/>
My bad I didn;t noticed, but looks like the port  7052 is not exposed for any of the peers
</p>
<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:18:59 GMT):<br/>
I would need to change in the tool and need to retry 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:24:39 GMT):<br/>
Can you telnet to port 7052 from the cc container?
</p>
<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:33:13 GMT):<br/>
cc container exits with the error I pasted on my first message 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:49:54 GMT):<br/>
But you checked ping no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:50:04 GMT):<br/>
So can you also check telnet?
</p>
<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 20:07:36 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I pinged from peer itself , sorry that sounds silly :(

</p>
<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 20:07:54 GMT):<br/>
container doesn't comeup it exits immediately 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 20:08:05 GMT):<br/>
put a sleep in the container
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 20:08:22 GMT):<br/>
I mean, run it again with a sleep
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 20:08:26 GMT):<br/>
I think you can do it somehow
</p>
<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 20:10:59 GMT):<br/>
Are you suggesting  to make changes in fabric code to introduce the sleep ? 
or is there a way to introduce that sleep from docker-compose ? 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 20:59:50 GMT):<br/>
`command: /bin/bash -c './scripts/script.sh ${CHANNEL_NAME}; sleep $TIMEOUT'`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 21:00:52 GMT):<br/>
thats a sample from your cli @Ratnakar  :-)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 21:08:25 GMT):<br/>
no, I am suggesting you do `docker exec`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 21:08:29 GMT):<br/>
and lift the container
</p>
<p><strong>Ratnakar</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 21:24:59 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr @yacovm the chaincode container dies immediately. and the container status *Exited* 
So I can't do `docker exec` or introduce the delay with any of such commands as I don't have control on the cc container 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 21:25:26 GMT):<br/>
try docker run?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 21:25:43 GMT):<br/>
docker run with sleep

@NiketYende suggest follow the `CreateSignedTx` method in fabric/protos/utils/txutils.go and fabric/peer/chaincode/instantiate.go .. the payload comes from the chaincode (in ProposalResponse) so once you unmarshall all the fabric/protos specific specifc stuff, the bytes you'll be left with is output from chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 14:37:26 GMT):<br/>
@Ratnakar another approach - start peer in --peer-chaincodedev mode and manually start the chaincode container as "bash" ... then issue the same chainciode command from command line
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 14:37:26 GMT):<br/>

Hi,

I raised an issue on hlf peer restart which is not able to load the correct config block from the ledger (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7801). I'm looking for some advice to see how I can restore this configuration (if possible). Can somebody help ?

Thank you !

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=WYs6Peu5ZoKbWiiPj) @muralisr Hi, thank you for the reply. The payload data is already unmarshalled by the node-sdk. Also the fabric-sdk-node internally uses the same technique to unmarshall this block payload . We are facing problem only with the input field (chaincode_proposal_payload.input). The input comes as a bytecode. Any way to convert this input into json ?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:06:15 GMT):<br/>
@NiketYende if I understand you correctly, you are asking about ```message ChaincodeProposalPayload {

        // Input contains the arguments for this invocation. If this invocation
        // deploys a new chaincode, ESCC/VSCC are part of this field.
        // This is usually a marshaled ChaincodeInvocationSpec
        bytes input  = 1;

        // TransientMap contains data (e.g. cryptographic material) that might be used
        // to implement some form of application-level confidentiality. The contents
        // of this field are supposed to always be omitted from the transaction and
        // excluded from the ledger.
        map<string, bytes> TransientMap = 2;
}```
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:07:36 GMT):<br/>
if that;s correct, `input` is either ChaincodeInvocationSpec or ChaincodeDeploymentSpec
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:07:36 GMT):<br/>
if that;s correct, `input` is either marshalled ChaincodeInvocationSpec or ChaincodeDeploymentSpec
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:08:19 GMT):<br/>
the SDK should have code that goes thru this marshalling at the time of sending the proposal

</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:17:43 GMT):<br/>
currently I saw that the block was in fact a msg block type not a configuration type.

```peer channel fetch --help

<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:14:20 GMT):<br/>
I'm having trouble instantiating chaincode on a TLS-enabled peer.  When the chaincode container attempts to connect to the peer on port 7051, it (the chaincode container) fails with "Error trying to connect to local peer: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority".  However, I've verified that the CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE env var is set to the correct path in the docker image (it points to the root CA cert), and I've verified that the peer's cert is correctly set up by successfully connecting to the peer via `openssl s_client -connect <host>:7051 -CAfile path/to/root/cert.pem` (an amazingly useful debugging tool, btw).  Am I missing something?  Like is mutual TLS implicitly required by a chaincode-to-peer connection?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:16:27 GMT):<br/>
All the certs shown by `openssl s_client ...` are as expected, and the connection is established successfully.  One other thing I should mention is that I've made my peer cert a cert chain starting with the peer's cert, then the intermediate CA cert, then the root CA cert.  Otherwise I found that other TLS connections (e.g. having the peer join the channel) doesn't work because the connecting client doesn't have enough information to verify that the peer's cert is trusted.

it's 7052

One more note -- the `openssl s_client ...` connection indicates that the server communicates "acceptable client certificate CA names", which are the root CA, and the intermediate CAs for org0 and org1 (the two orgs in my network)

my guess
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:18:54 GMT):<br/>
if you would delete the chaincode image
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:18:56 GMT):<br/>
that would solve it
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:19:05 GMT):<br/>

docker is keeping up the tradition
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:25:28 GMT):<br/>
no, it's not docker
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:25:49 GMT):<br/>
it's because in v1.0.x, when the chaincode is built in the first time
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:26:04 GMT):<br/>
it copies some stuff from the peer's file system to the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:26:13 GMT):<br/>
and if TLS isn't used I think it doesn't copy some stuff
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:26:16 GMT):<br/>
so when you turn on TLS
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:26:23 GMT):<br/>
you sometimes need to delete the chaincode image
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:26:51 GMT):<br/>
but, worry not - in v1.1 everything works smooth as butter, regardless of what you do ;)

If we have five members in the network. Lets say all five members joined the single channel and we have an endorsement policy where member 2 and member 3 needs to endorse the transactions. So lets say the client of member 1, submits the transaction, does this client need to send the transaction directly to peer of member 2 and 3 or does it need to send the transaction to member 1 peer and it will get forwarded to member 2 peer and 3 peer by gossip protocol ? 
</p>
<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:44:23 GMT):<br/>
@gauthampamu My understanding is that the client will need to send the transaction proposals to a peer of member 2 and to a peer of member 3 in your scenario.  Gossip is used for peers to send already committed blocks to each other, e.g. those peers connected directly to an orderer via Deliver() use gossip to communicate to those peers that aren't connected directly to an orderer.
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:45:39 GMT):<br/>
Even thought you have to sent the transaction to member 2 and 3. I had heard recently from someone that you will send to your peer and it will get forwarded to other peers. So I wanted to confirm it. 
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:45:48 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I think the idea is that if one relied on a transaction being gossipped to the other endorsing peers via a single peer, then that peer could probably alter the transaction proposal in some way to its advantage.  So it's in the interest of the transacting client to communicate the transaction proposal directly to all peers
</p>
<p><strong>gauthampamu</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:46:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @vdods 
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:46:19 GMT):<br/>
@gauthampamu That's true once the transactions have been ordered and committed to blocks.

Hi all, is there a means to query a peer to discover all peers connected to a particular channel?  In particular, because a fabric network can change over time, with peers being added or leaving a channel, it doesn't seem practical to have to discover the network architecture via side channel.

@toddinpal might because I cannot predict the future. This is a significant issue, correct.

I have instantiated a chaincode with -P "AND ('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSp.member')". I am trying to add a key, value to the ledger using the chaincode. Now even when the transaction is endorsed by just one MSP, it still writes to the ledger...am I missing something?
</p>
<p><strong>vijay5378</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 16:18:06 GMT):<br/>
Guess I found the mistake. I had upgraded the chaincode. However, the upgrade transaction did not have any policy defined. Will the endorsement policy need to be specified during the upgrade also?
</p>
<p><strong>vijay5378</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 16:25:25 GMT):<br/>
In a related question.... When I submit a transaction for endorsement...can I put a rule at the peer level for endorsement? In another scenario.....if I have orgA and orgB....an application connects to peer0 of orgA and proposes a write transaction. The second org should wait for user to look into this transaction to endorse it. Is it possible to design it this way?

krisava : I had the same issue, because once we deploy a chain code , fabric will create image and copy the certificate from the peer. again If I deploy the chain code with different certificate the image will not recreate and refer the same image .... So I have remove the image and deploy it again and it worked for me.

</p>
<p><strong>NiketYende</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 11:58:26 GMT):<br/>
'channel.queryBlock(block_num)' calls the 'BlockDecoder.decode(response.response.payload)' method.

</p>
<p><strong>NiketYende</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 12:07:35 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Vadim</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 12:12:29 GMT):<br/>
@NiketYende because it's encded as a sequence of bytes: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/d9c320297bd2a4eff2eb253ce84dc431ef860972/protos/peer/transaction.proto#L86

sorry for the repeating questions, but anybody know when the anchor peer's authority is executed? Invoke/Query doesn't need anchor peer to update their block. why do we need anchor peer? (i read the doc but doesn't really come up with scenarios)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:21:18 GMT):<br/>
@chill37  - anchor peers are only relevant if you want to use cross organization gossip
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:23:32 GMT):<br/>
In Fabric, there is no "central" registry of the peers on the network.  So rather than requiring orgs to send their peer addresses to other orgs out of band, you can use the anchor peer setting in the channel config to allow other orgs to know about your peers
</p>
<p><strong>chill37</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:23:47 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 could you give me an example of the case? I've been testing, and even if I kill the anchor peer of both org and then update the ledger from one peer, the other peer ledger gets updated from the orderer (naturally). so I'm not really sure what cases need anchor peers to work. thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>chill37</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:27:11 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 I see. but what msgs do they send each other? when I check the logs(from docker logs), it's always the orderer broadcasting and delivering the blocks
</p>
<p><strong>chill37</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:27:56 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:32:07 GMT):<br/>
Currently, we don't archive / prune the ledger on the orderer so it has the entire history of all blocks.  And if the orderer is up and running, peers will simply get blocks from the orderer.  In the future, we will start pruning / archiving the orderer ledger and in that case if a peer was behind or joins a channel late, it might not be able to get the missing blocks from the orderer and will need to get them from another peer in the network - possibly from another org's peer.  In that case, gossip would be used to get the missing blocks.

Today, inter org gossip is mostly a discovery mechanism
</p>
<p><strong>chill37</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:41:39 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 ooooooh I see. since orderer is just an ORDER-er, you guys plan to make it so that it will only broadcast the recent blocks. Therefore the rest of the ledger will be on peers only and that's when anchor peer comes up-- when by any chance there's not enough peer or ledger within their org, they will hook up with other org anchor peer and get the data. 
</p>
<p><strong>chill37</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:42:41 GMT):<br/>
And Currently, Gossip is used to find out if peer is dead or alive, get channel list and etc., but in the future it will be used to get the missing blocks from other org as well
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:42:46 GMT):<br/>
correct.  it's possible today that  peer *might* try get missing blocks from a peer in another org, but not very likely and there is really no way to force this
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:43:05 GMT):<br/>
Gossip can get missing blocks from other peers in your org today
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:43:34 GMT):<br/>
And gossip can be used to only connect one peer in your org to the orderer and then gossip will send to the other peers in the org as well
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:44:05 GMT):<br/>
But as you said, using cross org gossip for blocks is really a future thing
</p>
<p><strong>chill37</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:45:09 GMT):<br/>
yes. I saw the code from anchor_test.go and was trying to somehow try it in actual code but not possible through chaincode (maybe stop orderer during the process but ....)
</p>
<p><strong>chill37</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:45:23 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=gz3xeF8aris4ZPh3P) @chill37 so to makenit a bit clear, each organization has it’s own “leader” peer which responsible to get connected to the ordering service and pull out the blocks to distribute across peers in org network
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:55:11 GMT):<br/>
The anchor peers as @mastersingh24 already explained used to advertise membership across different orgs and then used to facilitate state transfer and sync of the peers which are lagging behind due to network misbehavior or simply because joined late
</p>
<p><strong>chill37</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:58:55 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin I did see the "leader" peer mechanism (via election and IsLeader) but when I see log from orderer, it seems as though they are delivering blocks to all peers. 
</p>
<p><strong>chill37</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:59:51 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 11:12:19 GMT):<br/>
That's because the tuna app docker-compose.yaml doesn't use leader election

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 11:12:24 GMT):<br/>
and by default in v1.0 it's false https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L123

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 11:13:16 GMT):<br/>
So, there is another configuration that bypasses leader election and manually defines a peer to be a leader or not

hey, trying to learn more about how a private, permissioned chain works, and was directed here from #general. I've looked at the documentation but want to make sure i've understood the various type of nodes. How i currently see it, clients would be what users interact with, e.g. on a webpage or a mobile app; peers are the ones who maintain the ledger and there should be at least two, owned by different parties in the network; orderers are more of a service node, that is part of ensuring everything runs as it should, and there could just be one of those in a really small network. Is this a correct understanding? 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 21:52:46 GMT):<br/>
@DennisNewel Orderer(s) are the only required component in the system, and serve as the bootstrap mechanism for the network.
</p>
<p><strong>DennisNewel</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 21:57:20 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt  hmm...don't you need the peers to actually store the transaction on the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 21:58:01 GMT):<br/>
the creation of a chain does NOT require a peer
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 21:59:15 GMT):<br/>
the orderer also stores the transaction
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 21:59:33 GMT):<br/>
the peer adds the additional context of TX result wrt to Validation
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:00:22 GMT):<br/>
I was trying to convey that the orderer actually represents the single most important component
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:00:31 GMT):<br/>
vs the language of a service node :)
</p>
<p><strong>DennisNewel</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:00:53 GMT):<br/>
ah, ok :) not the right phrasing i see
</p>
<p><strong>DennisNewel</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:01:49 GMT):<br/>
my main question right now is, how do i practically add a 3rd party to my (theoretical) network? will they need to setup their own orderer and peers, or just one of them?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:01:57 GMT):<br/>
peers can come and go, but the chain is completely dependent on orderer(s)
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:02:10 GMT):<br/>
wrt to perpetuation/growth
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:03:13 GMT):<br/>
the concept of adding an org must first be contextualized, i.e. do you mean to an existing channel?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:03:27 GMT):<br/>
or.. to the consortium from which a channel is to be created?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:03:56 GMT):<br/>
This is where the term network may be ambiguous
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:04:33 GMT):<br/>
I will presume you mean channel (which is synonymous with chain)
</p>
<p><strong>DennisNewel</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:04:40 GMT):<br/>
ok, i'm probably thinking channel
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:05:17 GMT):<br/>
then orderer(s) are externalized, and the org would generally setup their own peers
</p>
<p><strong>DennisNewel</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:05:40 GMT):<br/>
i'm envisioning a system where X vendors can hand out tokens as proof of a person having completed a task; only vendors can hand out the tokens, but the end users can claim a benefit with the tokens later on
</p>
<p><strong>DennisNewel</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:07:14 GMT):<br/>
by "externalized" you mean reachable by other parties? or that the orderer(s) are managed by different parties?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:07:20 GMT):<br/>
the latter
</p>
<p><strong>DennisNewel</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:08:09 GMT):<br/>
so in my example, each vendor would setup their own orderer, and perhaps a couple of peers, while the end users would use clients to connect to one of the orderers in order to view their tokens?
</p>
<p><strong>DennisNewel</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:10:20 GMT):<br/>
...and the peers would mainly be endorsing peers?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:10:23 GMT):<br/>
@DennisNewel you may find #composer and its asset/participant model applicable to your problem
</p>
<p><strong>DennisNewel</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:11:23 GMT):<br/>
yeah, i played with an online sandbox version of that - seemed to be exactly what i was looking for. I'm assuming that still "runs on top of" fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>DennisNewel</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 22:14:01 GMT):<br/>
i can see i have a lot more to read up on with composer - i'll start with that but might return with more questions :)

Hi guys, can someone give me an idea what the following arguments do w.r.t to a peer. 

- CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT=peer1.org2.example.com:7051
- CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP=peer1.org2.example.com:7051
- CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION=true
- CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=false
- CORE_PEER_PROFILE_ENABLED=true

1. For the gossip external endpoint, will be always the identity of that peer itself? If that's the case why do we need an argument at all. 
2. What identity to use in the gossipbootstrap ? For eg. I 've a multi-org, multipeer setup. Will it be same across all the peers in the same org?
3. CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION - What's the implication of setting it true or false? and when should I set it to false. Should it be same on all the peers in an Org. 
4. CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=false and CORE_PEER_PROFILE_ENABLED=true. No idea what they are. 

I feel there is a lack of documentation for such arguments.

Hi team, 
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 15:22:58 GMT):<br/>
Can I have a endorsement policy specific for peers? Say I have a 1 org only n/w and  it has 4-5 peers, out of which I want 2 peers to endorse always out of the total 5. Where my peer-id 1 needs to mandatory endorse the transaction. The examples and doc says org.member, so can I be specific here like org.member1 ? Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 15:53:19 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=SRcd8fiszgwsbq6NW) @AshishMishra 1 you can require 2 signatures from the same ORG, in which they must be different
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 15:54:03 GMT):<br/>
if you wish to require specific peers, then you could add their specific cert to the endorsement policy
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 16:03:55 GMT):<br/>
@jeffgarratt and If I want to mandate a particular peer to endorse it, can I do it?
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 16:04:11 GMT):<br/>
yes, you need to use a Identity principal vs a Role
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 16:04:27 GMT):<br/>
and choose the peer's identity cert
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 16:04:33 GMT):<br/>
in signcerts I believe
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 16:05:12 GMT):<br/>

Only the peer admin can install cc on  peer peers in their own organization.  Can they do an instantiate proposal on a peer that's from another org ?  Not sure, the need to do that given instantiate needs to be only done once and I assume they could do it on their own peer.  But I think I'm seeing it work on a peer (in the channel) but from another organization

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 19:26:02 GMT):<br/>
while this is being true, you cannot expect peer which was not joined the channel to deliver blocks or event on behalf of something he is not part of... once we will have service discovery users life will be easier 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 19:28:20 GMT):<br/>

We have 2 types of access control in fabric - per channel and "per node".
The former is what you use authenticate access to business logic data, and the latter is what you use to authorize administrative operations, like joining a peer to a channel, etc.

It only makes sense that a user that wants to get data in a channel context, would need to be authenticated by the channel, which means - it needs to be a channel member

Wait, @rickr  are you saying you were not able to register for events for a channel until the peer itself had joined the channel ?

Hi, This is regarding the "Blockchain Instance on Bluemix", in the "Blockchain-GUI".

What is the purpose of the "Certificates tab under Members"?

As I could able to post a transaction or read a transaction from the client connecting to the "Peer" without even uploading the "Client side certificate" on to the "Certificates tab under Members".

So, I am not sure what is the purpose of "Certificates tab under Members". And how is it secure to control the client to Post or Read transactions from Blockchain? Thanks.

To expand on what @yacovm wrote, the new peer event services use the BLOCKEVENT and FILTEREDBLOCKEVENT resource policies, which both default to the Channel Readers policy. Those policies can be updated for the channel to allow access for any desired users. I believe the documentation for the new mechanism of setting / updating resource policies is still a work in progress, so I haven't been able to try it out in a real network.

Hi team, today I noticed.. few errors in my peer logs.. 

2018-02-12 12:18:54.009 UTC [gossip/state] queueNewMessage -> WARN 2b3 Failed adding payload: Ledger height is at 492, cannot enqueue block with sequence of 600

AND

2018-02-12 12:19:02.509 UTC [gossip/state] handleStateResponse -> WARN 2c8 Payload with sequence number 621 wasn't added to payload buffer: Payload with sequence number = 621 has been already processed

What do they imply and should I be worried ? as it's just warning. 
I have set the log level to error, then also why I 'm seeing this. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 19:09:49 GMT):<br/>
@AshishMishra 1  I can't speak to what the messages imply but in regards to your question about why you see this warning-level error message in the logs, it's due to the override level for CORE_LOGGING_GOSSIP in core.yaml, which defaults to `warning`. 
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 06:01:23 GMT):<br/>
each of my transaction is taking around 3 sec any idea why is it?
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 07:04:56 GMT):<br/>
@DarshanBc because of the block time of 2 sec by default. The orderer service will wait for 2 secs or 10 transactions to commit into the peers. 
</p>
<p><strong>DarshanBc</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 07:07:19 GMT):<br/>
blocktime is fine trasaction should be commited ryt block formation is a different process
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 07:57:16 GMT):<br/>
until a block is commited, how can you form a block?

<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 16:28:44 GMT):<br/>
@novusopt Here is my guess-   if you do a rich query in your chaincode a hash of the query's results is put in the R/W set placed in the endorsement response.  As the transaction goes through the flow, at validation time the rich query is run again.  If the hash of the result at this time doesn't match the hash in the R/W set, you'll get that error.

<p><strong>minollo</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 16:34:19 GMT):<br/>
Not quite; rich queries are not re-executed at validation time (in the current Fabric code); the error is about validation of *range* queries:
// validateRangeQuery performs a phatom read check i.e., it
// checks whether the results of the range query are still the same when executed on the
// statedb (latest state as of last committed block) + updates (prepared by the writes of preceding valid transactions
// in the current block and yet to be committed as part of group commit at the end of the validation of the block)

My apologies- you are correct-  I used the wrong term-  I should have said *range* queries and not *rich* queries.    I misquoted from section 4.4 of the recently released paper available from https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10228v1

<p><strong>novusopt</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 16:47:33 GMT):<br/>
@minollo @silliman thx, correct me if I am wrong, as far as I understand it, that means every time I have range query the hash of the query result will be added to the r/w set. In case of a tx which is changing the "range" and immedialtey afterwards a new tx with the same hash will face this issue. Because the hash of the range has changed. is this right?

question, after a block gets ordered it gets blasted to all of the committing peers to be appended to the ledger, yes? the peers then alert an sdk about the successful commitment. does this alert happen after being appended to the ledger or after it has been updated in the stateDB?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=mi5tTAj9RWuofsmZk) @Brucepark this is technically feasible, but seems counter to the standard usage of endorsements (i.e. a client should be able to collect the proper endorsements).  However, it may be technically feasible to create a SignedProposal and have the other org get an endorsement and return the ProposalResponse back to you which you could package into a Tx if you so choose.  But this would cumbersome comparatively even if technically doable.
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 13:59:37 GMT):<br/>
@Brucepark not having access to an endorsing peer would represent one way in which a party could reasonably halt activity in a channel.  If you don't have access, I assume either a misconfigured system or the other party does not want you to

Thank you for your reply. 
I asked the question because I need to configure the ACL on the network.
There are internal server zone and external server zone.
I thought the client should be inside and peer should be in both zone.
If the client must be connected to another org's peer, it must be in external server zone.
You said that it is technically feasible, but I wonder if it is supported by v1.1.[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=zaXcHwYaCzeRcw3wc) @jeffgarratt

<p><strong>Brucepark</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 02:15:52 GMT):<br/>
If the client is in external zone, I need to be concerned about security.
Because it would be a kind of server.
So I want to have a client inside but I wonder if it is possible in current version.

@novusopt From CLI, you can use the `peer node status` command (setting CORE_PEER_ADDRESS to point to the peer you're interested in) to check if a peer is still running. Not sure if there's a mechanism to do this from SDKs.

This shows up when the network is left idle for a bit, and then invokes are sent via SDK. The peer tries to kill the chaincode containers and once they come up again, the invokes start going through again.

Hi Guys, how can I migrate a blockchain/channel from one n/w to another n/w? Eg. I 've 3 peers in network A and 3 peers in network B. In network A, I 've 3 channels 1,2 and 3 and on network B I 've channels 4 and 5. Now I want my channel 3 to be in my network B. Is it possible at all?

so lets say i have a situation where a peer has gone down and come back up, is there a way for me to force the peer to start up a chaincode container without sending a transaction through it? maybe an lscc command?

you want to know which chaincode containers are running in the peer? why?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 28 Feb 2018 15:31:34 GMT):<br/>
so im trying to implement a health check for the peer to know if it is ready to serve requests. 

while testing i've found that if the peer has come back up and transactions are running against it, the first transaction will start the launching of the chaincode but other transactions will fail with a premature execution error. 

i want the health check to only report the peer as healthy if both the peer is up and the chaincode container is running, and if the chaincode container is not running i can launch it.

really i'm trying to find a way to avoid the premature execution error so that i can direct traffic to a healthy peer that already has the chaincode running

not really understanding the endorsement process 
Is the endorsement done automatically? I created an endorsement policy whereby 2 endorser peer need to endorse the transaction to be consider valid  
But whenever I execute a transaction on 1 peer, a block is added to the ledger 
Am i doing something wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:03:50 GMT):<br/>
@TsuiSauChi if you specify an endorsement policy of `orgA and orgB need to sign` but if you send the proposal to only 1 peer (say of OrgA) and submit the response as a TX, then I'd expect the TX to fail

Composer will send the transaction for endorsement to each peer defined in the connection profile that your business network card uses.  So you've probably got both peers defined and so Composer is getting the necessary endorsements for you

Hi.  Is there any (practical or theoretical) limit to the number of events that can be registered in EventHub at the same time?

<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 13:02:24 GMT):<br/>
@yoheiueda As you're referring to the Node SDK documentation, the #fabric-sdk-node channel may be the better source of information given registering for the event for a single transaction ID is implemented by the SDK and not the peer. I definitely wouldn't expect any practical limits

I definitely wouldn't expect any practical limits. Also, which version of Fabric/SDK are you using? In v1.1 (including alpha), there is a new channel event service which uses a different underlying implementation which is much more reliable than the old event hub. If you're using/planning to use v1.1, I'd highly recommend switching to: https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/ChannelEventHub.html

`signconfigtx` was added in v1.1. I'd recommend updating your code to v1.1.0-rc1

Hi everyone!
I am new to Hyperledger Fabric and struggle to understand how multiple transactions happening in the same channel can be valid inside a block given that the first transaction in the block woud change the current state of the ledger which means that the second transaction in the block would have a READ value which is not equivalent to the 'new' current state of the ledger.

@wlahti thanks for the reply. That is also how I understood it, but in the documentation is says:


   1. T1 passes validation because it does not perform any read. Further, the tuple of keys k1 and k2 in the world state are updated to (k1,2,v1'), (k2,2,v2')
   2. T2 fails validation because it reads a key, k1, which was modified by a preceding transaction - T1
   3. T3 passes the validation because it does not perform a read. Further the tuple of the key, k2, in the world state is updated to (k2,3,v2'')
   4. T4 fails the validation because it reads a key, k2, which was modified by a preceding transaction T1
   5. T5 passes validation because it reads a key, k5, which was not modified by any of the preceding transactions

I reached out to someone more familiar with the ledger. It turns out this situation is referred to as a "blind write". Often, a chaincode's logic will call `GetState` (aka a read) and then perform a `PutState` (aka a write). However, in a "blind write", the chaincode simply performs a `PutState` to write a new value without reading the current value. In this case, no consistency validation is performed and the last transaction "wins" and has the final say in the value.  Obviously, not all applications will/should use blind writing but for certain situations I guess this is a desired behavior.

@wlahti Thank you for the detailed answer! 
So in other words, I cannot have two transactions that modify the same key/value-pair in the same block tagged as VALID. The first one would get tagged as INVALID and included in the peer ledger but not in the validated ledger.
This is somehow against my understading of the validation porcess. I thought that committing peers would always check the readset of a transaction before calling `PutState` and updating the state with the writeset and thereby updating the version of the key (since, how I understood it, transactions within a block are still committed even if not all transactions of the block are committed yet). 
The documentation says:

_In the validation phase, a transaction is considered valid if the version of each key present in the read set of the transaction matches the version for the same key in the world state - assuming all the preceding valid transactions (including the preceding transactions in the same block) are committed (committed-state). _

And another question: What are read-transactions good for? Can't I just use the Hyperledger Explorer if I want to query the ledger?

@DarshanBc you can only invoke the other chaincode if it is installed locally, which requires the executing peer be a member of both channels I believe.

Given  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5288 can you roll over the orderers intermediate endorsement certificates and still successfully join a new peer to an existing channel using Fabric 1.0? 
 I know you can’t roll over TLS intermediate certificates, but given that the peer is given the channel genesis block and the blocks are then are replayed in order I would assume that this would be OK?
Am I correct?

Hi experts, can someone tell me what does PHANTOM_READ_CONFLICT means? I 'm getting this while using the SDK on a Fabric network to query the chaincode. I deleted few tx records intentionally from the couchdb. But no error is seen on the peer logs also from fabric CLI container I can invoke the same query and I 'm getting results, which is different on different peers (as I said I intentionally deleted tx data). What is different with SDK here that it knew about some conflict.

peer0 and peer1 are belong to Org0MSP

When I stop Peer1 then do the transactions from  NodeJS App, transaction was failed with exception was "Connection failed to Peer1".
Since the Endorsement policy requires any member of Org0MSP endorsing transaction. and peers was configured into NodeJS, 
I want Application has high availability when peer stopped. How I can do in this case, could you guys help?

Hi 
If we have 2 peers A and B, in endorsement policy, we can say either one or both should endorse. But where in code, the criteria for the peer to decide whether to endorse or not is specified?

</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:24:43 GMT):<br/>
@pb you can request any peer to endorse a proposal.  If it has the chaincode installed and instantiated in the channel, it will respond if you have the appropriate role as the requestor.  The validation phase is where each peer determines whether to accept the Tx per the endorsement policy and other criteria.

Dummy question, lets say that for transaction1, I need endorsement by OrgA & Org B, but for transaction2 (using the same chain code), I need endorsement by OrgA & Org C.  For both cases, I need at least two peers from each org sending endorsement.  Would the client simply use some sort of mechanism to send the request to the appropriate Org/Peers for each request, or is there another best practice which is used to change the endorsing peers for each transaction instance for the same chain code?  Thanks!

When the Fabric endorsement policy is "OR (org1.member org2.member org3.member ... org9.member)"
and org1 is hacked and the chain code is changed by hacker, it will create an invalid Tx.
This incorrect Tx is likely to be made into blocks and propagated to other org and reflected in other org’s ledger.
So it seems very dangerous to use OR Policy solely,
Am I right?

You can. But that would require you to make changes in the peer code and recompile.

In fact, in 1.1 you should be able to register a system chaincode via go-plugin. You can give this a try http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/systemchaincode.html

Reg the Chaincode instantiation, in my understanding/experience with JavaSDK, it would allow us to instantiate only once in a channel and only in one of the peers. Is this understanding correct ?  At the end of instantiation, I am able to see one chaincode container up, and the rest do not come up till I actually do a query or invoke..

Hi All, Reg the Chaincode instantiation, in my understanding/experience with JavaSDK, it would allow us to instantiate only once in a channel and only in one of the peers.   At the end of instantiation, I am able to see one chaincode container up, and the any other container associated to the same chaincode - but on another Org in the same channel, do not come up till I actually do a query or invoke on that Org's Node. Is this understanding correct ?
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 16:01:37 GMT):<br/>
As per my understanding, the only endorsement which i can specify during the instantiation is the endorsement policy for the Chaincode Invoke & Query
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 16:03:35 GMT):<br/>
Is there a way to say on which all node, the Chaincode should be instantiated simultaneously in a channel at the time of instantiation ?

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 31 Mar 2018 10:09:22 GMT):<br/>
@Ashish pinged me directly, but pasting the response here as well:

When you instantiate chaincode, it will only be launched on the peer on which you run the instantiate transaction.

It is then launched on other peers in the channel only when you invoke and/or query as you stated above.

The only way to launch on multiple peers is to send the instantiate request to multiple peers initially.  I believe that the sendInstantiationProposal API in the Java SDK allows you to send the request to a collection of peers
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 12:35:00 GMT):<br/>
@Ashish you can instantiate the same chaincode on multiple channels. However only one container will be created per peer (as you saw, multiple containers come up, one for each peer).  The channel context is part of the request (proposal/proposal response) and not part of the running chaincode.  
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:01:08 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr Okay. I understand. And I had that concept clear. The question was only in the context of a single channel. 
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:01:13 GMT):<br/>
And when I tried out the java SDK first time in November, I had got the chaincode installed in all the peers of all the organisations in a channel. And I had sent the instantiation request to all of them, simultaneously using the sendInstantiationRequest API. But I remember that always only one of them used to come back as successful. Then I went through the documentation and it clearly stated it would be instantiated only once in a channel. And it made sense. And the chaincode containers would come up linked to other  peers if I connected to them and tried to query or invoke.
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:02:39 GMT):<br/>
So it would take that 10 sec time for that container to come up but it would and it would have the updated data.
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:04:11 GMT):<br/>
But recently someone mentioned that it's possible to instantiate simultaneously on multiple peers. So I thought it's good to cut down on time. Because I have all the time when I'm installing and instantiating. So why to wait for the first invoke. So I thought of approaching you folks to check. 
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:04:27 GMT):<br/>
All the while staying in one single channel
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:04:58 GMT):<br/>
so first of all, I didn't see @mastersingh24 response (for some reason my RC had not refreshed...) and missed some of that context
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:05:36 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for your response anyway Srini. Much appreciated. 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:06:09 GMT):<br/>
`But recently someone mentioned that it's possible to instantiate simultaneously on multiple peers.` - you can send a instantiate proposal to multiple peers just like you can an invoke proposal but in the end the instantiation woukld be done only once per channel
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:06:27 GMT):<br/>
Agreed
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:06:43 GMT):<br/>
the delay in the container coming up - is it a one time thing due to the image getting created ?
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:06:52 GMT):<br/>
Yes. 
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:06:59 GMT):<br/>
Only that
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:07:26 GMT):<br/>
that may not be too bad is it ? hopefully you are not going to be doing that all the time ?
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:09:24 GMT):<br/>
It's not, so I didn't give it much of a thought. But someone just asked me , if we can get them up and running not waiting for the first invoke, the business API won't have to.. 
</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:09:40 GMT):<br/>
Hence the whole thing..  
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:12:12 GMT):<br/>
right. its just that "bring it up transparently on demand" makes it a tad transparent and lessens user involvement. A trade off that shouldn't cause inconvenience most of the time

Is fabric ever planning to give a feature of logs as extractable files in a mapped volume ever ? Like the application volume of a java application? Here instead of the whole application, just that of the chaincode I'm interested in?

</p>
<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:15:53 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Ashish</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:16:39 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 01 Apr 2018 13:18:33 GMT):<br/>
agree. there was some mention of providing more options to users for logging. I don't recall what the context was...let me check something.

@Ryan2 the key is this `marked as invalid by committer.`. The block contains many transactions. Those that failed are marked as invalid. Users can retrieve blocks and see if their TX succeeded or not

Hi @muralisr , as the log show, Block7 marked as invaid by committer but Block7 was Created (the log I got from 2 peers separately,) What is Reason code [10] mean?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 21:17:02 GMT):<br/>
couple of things @Ryan2 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 21:17:21 GMT):<br/>
1) see very similar error below `Block [7] Transaction index [0] TxId [39796987a0b64fa6511e1f39a4afa0c3d70e7d617372454b024c288cc983f72c] marked as invalid by committer. Reason code [ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE]`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 21:17:37 GMT):<br/>
so guessing 10 means ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 21:18:14 GMT):<br/>
2) `Block7 marked as invaid by committer` - not quite.  ` Block [7] Transaction index [0] marked as invalid by committer`

Hi guys, I have two questions regarding to the endorsing process:

1. If an endorsing peer tries the endorse a transaction T, which updates <k1, v4> in the Worldstate to <k1, k5>. However, the endorsing peer's current Worldstate only has <k1, v2>, what will this endorsing peer do with this transaction?

2. For a client to ensure a transaction has been successfully endorsed, the following two requirements need to be satisfied (1) enough number of endorsements are received (2) the simulation results in the endorsements match with each other. Say, a malicious peer receives enough number of endorsements, which are NOT matched. However, this peer still packed these endorsements into a proposal and sent it to the order, will the order be able to detect this transaction is not valid? If not, where and how such invalid transaction will be detected?

However, the endorsing peer's current Worldstate only has <k1, v2>, what will this endorsing peer do with this transaction?

Hello!

I am curious is there any solution for this problem right now:

I've a working network with 1 org, 1 orderer , and 2 peer. I've installed and instantinated succesfully a chaincode on the peers (CC was working perfectly). I decided to add a new peer to the network. Started a new peer image and joined it to the channel. After i installed the same chaincode without any problem i could not instantinate it (CC is already exist). So i removed the cc's containers and deleted the cc's images and the CCs from the peers (/var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/<ccname>:<ccversion>). There was no problem installing them again on all peer on the other hand they've still existed in the channel. I was able to list them on the channel besides the system CCs.
Is there any way to instantinate this cc again without a network restart? Must i restart the network if i would like to add this cc to a new peer?

Thanks for answers!

@Levilk `After i installed the same chaincode without any problem i could not instantinate it (CC is already exist)` --> no need to instantiate chaincode twice, once you get it instantiated on first peer the instantiation transaction recorded to the ledger, hence once second peer will get in sync it will catch up with update

Hi,
I am working on fabric and found the endorsement policy is mentioned in the starting script as "-P "OR ('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" and understood that either of the members of ORG1 or ORG2must endorse the transaction. But I couldn't locate exactly 
1) Where and how in code, the members of Org1 or Org2 decide whether it should endorse or not?
2) How can we customize endorsement criteria differently for different endorsers? ( Not who all to endorse, but how it decides whether  the proposal could be successfully endorsed or not)
Can anyone please help me out? @muralisr  @C0rWin @asaningmaxchain123

Dummy question, lets say I have an asset (say a health record) which is associated with two orgs (OrgA and Org B), I need endorsement by OrgA & Org B for a transaction associated with this record, but for transaction2 (using the same chain code), I  have a health record which is tied to two different Orgs where I need endorsement by Org C & Org D.  For both cases, I need at least two peers from each org sending endorsement.  Would the client simply choose and send the request to the appropriate Org/Peers for each request (where the specific Orgs are not part of the endorsement policy) (OrgA & OrgB for tran1 and Org C & Org D for tran2), or is there any way to dynamically specify the endorsing peer signatures required for each transaction instance for the same chain code ?   Either way, the client would need to know which endorsing peers they need to send the request to, but I don't think you could specify which peers have to sign it, only the number of peers.

figured it out the peer logs gave me the following: `Error starting mycc chaincode: Error trying to connect to local peer: remote error: tls: bad certificate`

which stems from https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8091

<p><strong>asaningmaxchain123</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 15:30:41 GMT):<br/>
in the `Best Practices` section
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 15:50:29 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain123 This section is referring to organization more conceptually.  Let me replace the word 'organization' with company where it makes sense:

> One organization employing various MSPs
This would become "One company employing various Organizations/MSPs"

> Multiple organizations using a single MSP
This would become "One company using a single Organization/MSP"

</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 15:51:55 GMT):<br/>
In Fabric, the definition of "Organization" is 1-1 with MSP.  If you need multiple MSPs for the same entity/organization/company you will need to create multiple Fabric MSPs.

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 17:42:06 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain123 You would need to create multiple orgs.

Like... Org1Sales, Org1Research, etc.

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 17:42:28 GMT):<br/>
They would look like multiple organizations to Fabric, but they would all represent a single organization

We are getting https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v1.0.6/core/chaincode/chaincode_support.go#L598 -  is the reason that the HFC client is set a timeout (endorsing request) which is not enough for peer to compile-launch the chaincode image?

Hello @jyellick @dave.enyeart  - can you help on below query
We sometime get following error @ https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v1.0.6/core/chaincode/chaincode_support.go#L598 -  is the reason that the HFC client is setting a timeout for an endorsing request that is not enough for peer to compile & launch the chaincode container? Any other reasons.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 19 Apr 2018 17:09:47 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde The first time a chaincode is queried/invoked, if it is not running already, it will be launched.  This acquires a lock which causes all further queries/invokes of that chaincode to be rejected until the launch sequence finishes.  I expect what has happened is that your chaincode container has stopped (maybe you restarted the peer? upgraded the chaincoded?), and you have multiple clients which are trying to get endorsements or query it at the same time.  I'd love to see this limitation removed in the future, but that is the behavior today.
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Thu, 19 Apr 2018 17:13:47 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick the first part is correct - this is specifically in case of new chaincode instantiate/upgrade, never got for the case where peer was restarted and chaincode was in process to launch (may be timing related). I will check the 2nd part - if multiple clients is related to our case.
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Thu, 19 Apr 2018 18:05:37 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick  -  I have confirmed the 2nd part too which occurred in our case. Do you know if there is a hyperledger jira for it - if no, i will open.

<p><strong>CodeReaper</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 10:11:21 GMT):<br/>
 Did query close down the eventhub of the invoke??
If so, will loads of invoke a thing to worry about then, one closing the eventhub of another?
Point to note is that 15 second is timeout for any request, invoke timeout much faster than the query itself. Query timed out after 15 seconds only

I am working on a fabric based design that can potentially have 1000's of private transactions (as many chaincodes). From data privacy perspective, I am looking to have the optimum design. I can have individual channels for each private communication thus ensuring that only relevant transactions are stored physically on any node. However it means creating 1000s of individual channels. It creates operations/maintenance challenges and network stability. Any feedback would be appreciated.

This issue is not consistent, but what is consistent is if I see both chaincode processes from the single instantiation, everything works as expected.
</p>
<p><strong>latitiah</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 22:29:29 GMT):<br/>
That is, if I see: ```root     29888  0.3  0.3 151312 14616 ?        Ssl  20:24   0:00 chaincode -peer.address=10.0.2.15:8052

Anyone now ow is it possible to modify the READ/WRITE access to a peer ? I saw that there are two possibility one on the Chaincode, the other one on the config file. can anyone help me to find the right file?
Is there a link with this ? :
`You can also see that the endorsement policy has been modified to -P "OR ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer','Org3MSP.peer')".  `

hi - question being redirected from the node-sdk-forum 

Hi! Question on the sendProposal for NODE-SDK (still on Fabric 1.0.5)
My users are doing the following transactions fairly quickly
Transaction 1 - Do an entry in the LEDGER (uisng the chaincodeInvoke at node_js)
Transaction 2 - Do another entry in the LEDGER (using the same chaincodeInvoke at node_js)
The transaction 2 - gets a timeout (of 120 Secs - that is what I set) - then retries again to move forward and succeeds. the end user have to wait for 2 to 3 minutes to get a successful transactions. 

My network is TLS Enabled and has 4 Orgs with 2 peers each.

```error: [E2E testing]: transaction proposal was bad
error: [E2E testing]: transaction proposal was bad
error: [E2E testing]: transaction proposal was bad
error: [E2E testing]: transaction proposal was bad
error: [E2E testing]: Failed to send Proposal or receive valid response. Response null or status is not 200. exiting...
error: [E2E testing]: Error: Failed to send Proposal or receive valid response. Response null or status is not 200. exiting...
    at promise.then.then.then.then.then (/tts/blockchain/fabric-sdk-node/test/integration/e2e/e2eUtils.js:1212:19)
    at <anonymous>```
 
can anyone help?
My thinking process points out to the CONCENSUS mechanism to wait till all the endorsers on 4 ORGS have done the work and provide me a transaction confirmation before moving on any new transaction - Is this understanding correct?
And if so how can we ensure that we have a fire and forget - and in the the node-js listeners - I would do the reversal part if something indeed fails.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=vy5m7Moku9EdcxM2x) - On the same note - I'm using the couch DB as my state db and I guess that is one part of the slowness. Unfortunately could not see any logs on the couch db side to know any issues.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:32:54 GMT):<br/>
Another question - my chaincode has multiple PUTSTATEs - can I defer them and commit them together or the changes are gone the momemt put state is called?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:33:31 GMT):<br/>
I have a feeling that the multiple putstates (actual 5 for transaction records and 5 for index) - is causing the delay in endorsing the transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:34:18 GMT):<br/>
no, you can't
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:34:27 GMT):<br/>
and it's a shame because the ledger has an API for multiple putStates
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:34:30 GMT):<br/>
but the chaincode doesn't
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:36:58 GMT):<br/>
Hi yacovm -  So I should not use the multiple putstates and instruct the app to call each transaction seperately. The issue I merged them that each transaction was taking time and clubbing them improved the initial testing. But now at load testing level - we are observing that the endorsers are very slow in cofirming blocks back.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:37:26 GMT):<br/>
confirming blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:37:31 GMT):<br/>
what does that mean
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:37:34 GMT):<br/>
confirming transactions
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:37:41 GMT):<br/>
you mean endorsing?
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:37:52 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:38:05 GMT):<br/>
well if you have many GetStates or PutStates
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:38:19 GMT):<br/>
then the chaincode shim plays ping-pong with the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:38:32 GMT):<br/>
instead of batching everything together :(
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:38:34 GMT):<br/>
and it is very slow
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:39:35 GMT):<br/>
I c
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:43:30 GMT):<br/>
Phew - atleast something new I learnt - thanks mate. 
Probably - that explains that out of 3 transactions ( 2 were single put-states and 1 was multiple putstates)
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:43:40 GMT):<br/>
the last one was taking way too much time
</p>
<p><strong>pd93</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:05:32 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I have a bulk import function in one of my chaincodes. This takes 1000 records at a time, encoded as a string, decodes them and puts each of them into CouchDB with a PutState. This takes around 5 seconds for each bulk. It was my impression that this would be quicker than sending 1000 individual invocations.
However, from what you've just said, this sounds like a bad idea? Could you clarify for me what exactly is bad about multiple PutStates()? 
Or is it only bad when used in conjunction with multiple GetStates() as per your ping-pong analogy?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:06:06 GMT):<br/>
I feel like i'm hosting an "Ask-Me-Anything" :rolling_eyes: 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:06:30 GMT):<br/>
Can you use a rich query or a range query @pd93  ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:06:52 GMT):<br/>
oh, you *put* data in?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:06:56 GMT):<br/>
not *extract* data?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:09:01 GMT):<br/>
it's always faster to send 1 invocation with multiple PutStates than many chaincode invocations... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:09:21 GMT):<br/>
in each chaincode invocation there are signature checks, etc. for security
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:10:38 GMT):<br/>
So yeah - 1000 put-states would mean that the shim sends 1000 messages and wait for responses to/from the peer. It's not that slow since they run in the same computer, but it's still much slower than just passing these 1000 messages in the end of the chaincode invocation...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:10:44 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr we should fix this 
</p>
<p><strong>pd93</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:12:38 GMT):<br/>
Okay, that's really helpful, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>pd93</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:44:43 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm If you end up discussing the above as a feature for a future version, would you be so kind as to post a JIRA link? I'd be really interested in tracking that CR as I think it could greatly increase the speed of our imports.
Happy to help create the CR if one does not already exist
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:50:41 GMT):<br/>
please create a CR anyway

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=tQDctYjaJ5nqTdERJ) @yacovm - I was making combined call with multiple PutStates. On a more complex call - this was taking 2 mins to respond. Other calls were getting response within 300 ms to 500 ms. 
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 19:50:38 GMT):<br/>
once we broke those multiple putstates to single transactions - the process ran fine and we have near identical calls rates.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 19:50:44 GMT):<br/>
and you're saying, that once you broke that call that has `n` put-states, to `n` calls of ` `putState` it is fast?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=aNGYE4C6cxo3LJ48k) @yacovm - But strangely it is fine with the SINGLE transactions at a time. I also got some issues at the couch-db level - but logs here may not be right to discuss
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 20:09:23 GMT):<br/>
it's fine because probably it gets split into many blocks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 20:09:33 GMT):<br/>

Just to put in right perspective - this is the call logs I had put in another rocket chat (for node-sdk) thinking it is a node sdk specific item.

`Call 1: Sending proposal time is taking as almost 500 milli seconds (ACCPETABLE)`
```info: [11:46:00.230 - E2E testing]: ****** AT CHAIN CODE : Sending Transaction Proposal
info: [11:46:00.781 - E2E testing]: ***** AT CHain code: Recieving results

`Call 2: Sending proposal time is taking as almost 450 milli seconds (ACCPETABLE)`

`Call 3: Sending proposal time is taking as almost 40 seconds (This is taking way too long)`

<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 15:30:15 GMT):<br/>
A question with respect to Endorsement policy. If the endorsement policy has a single admin line - what is the impact on the transactions it is submitted or endorsed by the admin node?
Would it be accepted by the orderer? 
In my case it is mentioning `validation of endorsement policy failed` and the transaction is not written to the ledger.

Another question is if a transaction proposal is submitted - none of the queries chaincodes are working and gives me a timeout and then after a while (like 60 seconds) retries and gives me the result (may be it is waiting for 140 seconds) - my timeout is 20 secs.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=ZtibRfdwwpiPMc93m) - this issue is now resolved. It was the issue with my configuration and COUCHDB. Once the STATE DB was changed to DEFAULT store (LEVELDB) - all the performance issues went away. Concurrent items and rest all were fine. The requests now are taking less than 500 ms - that was the number we were looking at consistently.

@Ryan2 are you saying the chaincode container was up and running, you were running transactions against it, and then in the middle of those continuous transactions you got this error?

or had you just instantiated the chaincode and started sending invokes to the peer?

@Ryan2 it sounds like the container went down in the middle of transaction processing and then attempted to come back up when the next transaction went through. are there any errors from the peer just before you got the premature execution errors? 

alternatively start the process over again and follow the chaincode logs, see what the condition is that causes it to exit

Hi All,Has anyone successfully upgraded a node chaincode? When running the peer chaincode upgrade the command hangs for over 10 mins the gives a timeout error. When running again it returns an error stating that the chaincode is waiting “registration”.

<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 18:05:30 GMT):<br/>
```
The performance drop rather quickly when you add the second endorser and
the effects of the gossip protocol kicks in. As more endorsers are added to the network, each
endorser has to exchange messages between every other endorsers across the channel which
is why we see a continuous decrease in throughput.
```
</p>
<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 18:06:05 GMT):<br/>
I read this from a report, but why the endorsers need to exchange messages between each other?

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 06:30:42 GMT):<br/>
so let's say you want to send information to another org, but you don't want the ordering service and other orgs to be able to see the information you send
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 06:31:06 GMT):<br/>
but they can see the information because it is all plain-text on the public blockchain that everyone sees
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 06:31:19 GMT):<br/>
and the orderer, for example - always sees all the blocks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 06:31:41 GMT):<br/>
so instead of putting the data in the simulation results that are sent back to the client
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 06:31:49 GMT):<br/>
you put the hash of the data
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 06:32:09 GMT):<br/>
and so - the hash of the data, not the data itself is present in the blockchain, and the other organizations can't see what is inside
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 06:32:43 GMT):<br/>
now - the peers you endorse on, they send the data itself (the hash's pre-image) to other peers according to some access control policy defined at chaincode instantiation
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 06:32:55 GMT):<br/>
this way - only the organizations you want to see the data - see the data

a reverse proxy - it can work as long as you don't activate client authentication in the TLS (AKA mutual TLS)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 12:48:17 GMT):<br/>
also - make sure the peer and chaincode are running on the same host
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 12:48:31 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, the mutual TLS between the peer and chaincode container would break because of the reverse proxy
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 12:49:13 GMT):<br/>
you need a reverse proxy that works well with gRPC and TLS - I recommend nghttpx

@yacovm thanks. So I didn't enter an alien territory. :) I was trying to use envoy, so far it's been bad, do you know about it? I did try with haproxy it worked but i 've some concerns with it. Will give nghttpx a try.

Hello, when the nodeSDK try to instantiate the chaincode i have this following error on the peer `2018-05-17 12:49:05.271 UTC [deliveryClient] RequestBlocks -> DEBU 4b1 Starting deliver with block [1] for channel mychannel

I thought envoy uses nghttpx ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 13:03:03 GMT):<br/>
i mean they use the same base code in the end, no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 13:04:37 GMT):<br/>
nghttp2 ?
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 13:04:55 GMT):<br/>
Maybe same set of libraries, possible. I liked isitio which is based on envoy but it has dependency on k8, which I don't plan to use.  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 13:05:30 GMT):<br/>
just don't use these stuff for load balancing
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 13:05:35 GMT):<br/>
fabric has load balancing on its own

<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 13:06:54 GMT):<br/>

Hyperledgr Fabric - 1.0.6 

Hello @jyellick 

We see following error in fabric peer log `https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.0/core/chaincode/chaincode_support.go#L745`. I don't see any error in the chaincode container log for the same time. Now, any endorsement transaction sent by HFC fails with the same error.

Is the connection between chaincode and peer broken, as I don't see any endorsement reaching to the chaincode (from its log). What is the retry mechanism for chaicode container, if the connection gets dropped? 

Any other possible cause/reason.

we have the following set `https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.0/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L372`.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 17:41:24 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde Is the chaincode container running? Do you see it establish a connection in the logs?
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 17:43:37 GMT):<br/>
We restarted the peer container as we had to patch the system soon. the container logs are available and peer was also running at ERROR level.

Peer and its corresponding chaincode containers were running. There is no Error/Warning of kind during that period except for the above error whenever a endorsement request is sent.  Also there were other peers running on the same host however there is nothing like such thing happened to them.

 We restarted the peer container as we had to patch the system soon. The chaincode container logs is available at DEBUG level and peer was running at ERROR level. I should have done a `netstat` inside the peer (but did not).

At the moment I don't have gossip worknig   but I don't think that would be the issue here.  I have two peers I'm sending the endorsements to and both go to the orderer 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 11:59:43 GMT):<br/>
The init seems to work.  The set of both values don't seem to cause a problem.  But when I try to retrieve the value from one I get this error 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:00:04 GMT):<br/>

is there particular reason to have these values to zero?

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:04:53 GMT):<br/>
he used for test case there he wanted to ensure gossip respect this value and doesn't push pvt data to other peers once pvt tx endorsed

I would assume both those collections have been set up ok as the `set` operation is not having an issue

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:21:26 GMT):<br/>
@C0rWin There are two peers in Rick's scenario, and he sends endorsement to both.  Therefore it doesn't require any other gossip dissemination, and he sets the dissemination to 0.  I do similar things in my tests and it is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:21:51 GMT):<br/>
It appears his peers don't commit the private data, I assume because they think they are not eligible.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:22:27 GMT):<br/>
I can re-create the same thing and unfortunately there is no debug message stating the peer is ineligible, it just silently ignores the private data.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:22:27 GMT):<br/>
I can re-create the same thing when i mis-configure the collection policy, and unfortunately there is no debug message stating the peer is ineligible, it just silently ignores the private data.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:23:02 GMT):<br/>
That is why I asked for a clear debug message when peer is ineligible, and probably even a Warning the first time it happens, so that people doing trials without debug can see it
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:23:49 GMT):<br/>
by not being eligible .. is it the signature policy in the collection that determings that ?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:23:58 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:24:11 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:25:06 GMT):<br/>
yes, you can probably see the hashes getting written to public state but nothing getting written to private state
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:25:28 GMT):<br/>
if you have peer debug on
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:25:44 GMT):<br/>
that's what I see when I mis-configure the collection dissemination signature policy
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:26:33 GMT):<br/>
A very clear debug message indicating the  collection dissemination signature policy and the peer's identity would be valuable
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:31:32 GMT):<br/>
Are there any tools you can use to look at statedb  see what's been created ?

<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:34:04 GMT):<br/>
in case of couchdb you can connect to it's interface and run queries

<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:35:31 GMT):<br/>
ok good to know 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:37:14 GMT):<br/>
More than likely I'll admit this is an issue with my setup but it's blocking me from finishing up the private data feature in JSDK 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 12:52:31 GMT):<br/>
I tried with all four role types .. same result 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 13:16:24 GMT):<br/>
Is it expected that if the endorsement fails that  the response will not be signed ? 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 13:17:17 GMT):<br/>
I think the client should still see it signed so it knows it can trust it -- I'm not seeing it signed in this case 
</p>
<p><strong>C0rWin</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 13:32:44 GMT):<br/>

@rahulhegde If the chaincode container is running, then I would expect for it to have connected successfully.  Would it be possible to reproduce with peer logs at debug?

@C0rWin  @dave.enyeart  here is a more complete log of the peer .. should include install/init/set/query operations

I'm trying to help someone who is getting the following error:

`[chaincode] ExecuteChaincode -> ERRO 000 premature execution - chaincode (xxxxxx:vv) is being launched`

• When is this error expected? For example, if I restart a peer and invoke a chaincode that needs to have its container relauched, I don't get this error.
• At the *info* log level, is it possible to decipher when the various steps in a chaincode lifecycle have been executed? Currently, it seems difficult to determine that indeed an chaincode was invoked before it was launched.

@jrosmith  I have changed the endorsement policy..But it is not getting reflected in the code.Could you please elaborate on your response?Exactly in which file i have to change the endorsement policy?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:21:31 GMT):<br/>
@hyperlearner did you upgrade the chaincode and instantiate it with the new endorsement policy? or upgrade the channel with the new policy? its not as simple as changing a file, all members of the network need to know of and agree to the new policy. see here for more info: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/endorsement-policies.html

hey all, im running into an issue upgrading a channel using fabric 1.1. and following the directions (here) [http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/channel_update_tutorial.html]. my peer is v1.1.0 with go 1.9.2 running on a centOS machine.

i'm fine following the directions all the way until it comes to signing and submitting the update. when i go to sign i get (these)[https://hastebin.com/emarehewoy.pas] logs. i'm not using intermediate certs so i think the warning statement is fine? but i also don't see any "successfully signed" or "failed to sign" log, just "Exiting.....". does this mean i successfully signed the transaction or should i be expecting some other log output?

hi everyone, hope someone is able to provide a solution for this:
I'm trying to instantiate chaincode with endorsement policy to force peers to endorse chaincode calls.
I'm instantiating it like this:
docker exec -e "CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP" -e "CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp" cli peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C mychannel -n tokenWallet -l node -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":[""]}' -P "OR ('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')"

However, peers are not endorsing it and chaincode invocations are failing because endorsement policies are not being applied.
I see I need to enable OUs, and I put the flag EnableNodeOUs: true in my crypto-config.yaml file, but still no use.

Any tip someone?

@yacovm  How can we define that only a particular peer should endorse the transaction.like if i have 4 peers
1.`peer0.debutinfotech.com`
2.`peer1.debutinfotech.com`
3.`peer2.debutinfotech.com`
4.`peer3.debutinfotech.com`
Now i  want that only  `peer0.debutinfotech.com` should endorse the transaction.
Thanks in advance

@pankajcheema if you only want to get an endorsement from a certain peer, only send the transaction proposal to that peer.
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 09:03:04 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith not clear
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 09:06:27 GMT):<br/>
@pankajcheema in order to get a transaction endorsement, you have to send a transaction proposal to a peer. assuming youre using an sdk you can choose which peers you send endorsement proposals to. 
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 09:06:45 GMT):<br/>
unless youre asking how to specify an endorsement policy in which on a specific peer should be endorsing transactions

@pankajcheema to my knowledge, and someone else please correct me if i'm wrong, endorsement policies are at the organization level, not peer level. if i'm reading [this](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/endorsement-policies.html#endorsement-policy-syntax-in-the-cli) properly it seems you can only specify that any peer of a specific organization should sign off on a transaction, not a specific peer within a specific organization. you  may need to rework your approach

Hi, regarding `validatorPoolSize`,
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L382.
I have concerns, please help:
1. by default this value equal to number of cores of server, on which file (I mean on the fabric code files) I can convince myself about this one?
2. to take advantage of parallel validation, it should run peer on multiple core server?

it's better
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 10:18:17 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm for the deliver service service says it sends a stream of blocks to the client after commitment. does commit mean being appended to the ledger file or after appending to the ledger file _and_ insertion into the state db
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 10:18:36 GMT):<br/>
you can subscribe to events via the deliver API on the peer...

Hey folks, having some issues getting my chaincode instantiated on a production installation.  During instantiation of my chaincode "wagoncc", seeing a timeout of the "lscc" chaincode:

[endorser] simulateProposal -> ERRO 932 [global][e8c3cb15] failed to invoke chaincode name:"lscc" , error: timeout expired while executing transaction

Full log here: https://pastebin.com/UqTg2J7H

A docker container for the custom chaincode is created.  Transaction logs here: https://pastebin.com/9sQnJn3Z

I'm instantiating from the command line using this incantation:

$ peer chaincode instantiate -C global -n wagoncc -v "ghwc.dae6ea59f82662452ba5a79898f8b6c725f6f43b" -c '{"Args":[]}' -P "AND ('BandwagonClientMSP.member')" -o $ORDERER:7050

My current assumption is that I don't have some networking aspect correctly configured and the peer isn't getting the message that the chaincode completed successfully, but I'm uncertain how best to debug such an issue.

Have CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMEOUT set to 60s.  During chaincode instantiation, log gets to this:

```
2018-06-01 16:13:15.280 UTC [chaincode] handleMessage -> DEBU 614 [15c0d343d4680220d39e2a6b5ee0920d10ed3ca44627c79ff2b4fd04f138b8d8]HandleMessage- COMPLETED. Notify

```

Then it hangs for the remaining 60 seconds before giving me:

`2018-06-01 16:14:15.279 UTC [endorser] simulateProposal -> ERRO 618 [global][15c0d343] failed to invoke chaincode name:"lscc" , error: timeout expired while executing transaction`

Any thoughts on how the notification that chaincode has completed is getting dropped or how I can get a little more debug info?

Hello @jyellick

There is log getting printed from `gossip/discovery` and `gossip/gossip` module.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 13:25:23 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde Sure, even without anchor peers defined, gossip may be configured to work by setting the `peer.gossip.bootstrap`variable to point to an initial set of peers in your org.  So, you may simply be seeing the log messages to do with this.  The gossip service is in charge of block dissemination, deciding whether to retrieve blocks from ordering or peer to peer.  In a 'disabled' state, gossip is actually simply not establishing any links peer-to-peer, and each peer is considered a 'leader', which means it will connect directly to the orderer.
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 15:42:43 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=ESLWLZZ73QFgShxob) @jyellick 
Thanks for the response. We haven't set any gossip related override and peer uses the default value present in the peer application yaml. So for `gossip.bootstrap`, the value set is `127.0.0.1` which means the peer gossip logs are with orderer node to retrieve block.

It depends on your application, and what you are attempting to protect against.  If you have a channel with a single chaincode, then two peers, joined to that channel, each of which is running the chaincode, would likely be adequate to ensure that you do not experience a service outage.  Of course if the chaincode request volume is sufficiently high, you may need additional peers.

Does cpu usage and memory on the system matters here.

@pankajcheema maybe chaicode in `peer0` wasn't built so at first peer built chaincode and then launched?
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:20:49 GMT):<br/>
@dimaxgl 
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:20:49 GMT):<br/>
@dimaxgl chaincode was already built
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:21:09 GMT):<br/>
Every time I was getting response in 5 seconds
</p>
<p><strong>dimaxgl</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:22:04 GMT):<br/>
not every time, now you can't replicate you say :woo: 
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:23:42 GMT):<br/>
@dimaxgl  yes I can not replicate it now. Don't know why. I think fabric is not stable enough
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:23:59 GMT):<br/>
My whole project is built on fabric blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>dimaxgl</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:27:48 GMT):<br/>
when you build distributed network you should expect some differences between peer responses time , it's normal situation

Hi Expert,we are facing issue with slow response from peer for query result.We have a deep look on the logs and found that couchdb is taking 5 sec to handover query result to peer.
Any idea whats going here.
Thanka in Advance

I am having issues joining my peers to the channel.. I have 4 separate servers(1 is orderer and 3 other peers). The three other peers have DNS created when they spin up.. BYFN script runs on the 3 peers, then a byfn runs on the orderer last.. The error I get on the orderer is: Error: Error getting endorser client channel: endorser client failed to connect to peer0.****.com:7051: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded

Fabric v1.0.x
hello - we have set of keys created on the world-state-ledger and need to migrate to a different pattern/structure. The channel has 2 out 3 endorsement policy and the chaincode can be upgraded only by a specific organization admin user (which is a specific organization from the 2 out of 3 endorsement policy).

what is the best way to do this key migration? My understanding - we cannot use the init method in this case as upgrade  resulting in RWSet will not meet the Endorsement Policy. The only way is to write a client to perform this key migration process. Any thoughts?

Hello,  I am trying to setup a local Fabric V1.1.0 network instance running on K8S network with a tutorial example deployed - in addition to composer. Details of this work at the following URL:
https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/ibm-container-service

This setup works for me correctly when I deploy v1.0.3 release. 

This fails to deploy at joinchannel step. Looks like  - endorsement policy failures? I need help with how to recover from this issue and some pointers - details are in yaml files or config files or both - per my initial understanding.

My debug traces are here:

</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:10:07 GMT):<br/>
@bur Yes. Installing using the CLI is operational. I tried analyzing why the files aren't found. I can't find them on the path where the peer tries to locate them `/var/hyperledger/production` even-tough the `installChaincode` call via the NodeSDK is succesful.
</p>
<p><strong>RobertDiebels</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:11:04 GMT):<br/>
My assumption there would be that if I use the `installChaincode` method the package is sent to the peer on which it is installed and unpacked in the right directory.

<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 20:41:51 GMT):<br/>
@JayPandya If an MVCC conflict occurs, usually you may simply re-simulate and submit the failing transaction and it will succeed.

Is there anything like `admin peer`? I was reading endorsement policies ```'Org0.admin' (any administrator of the Org0 MSP) or 'Org1.member' (any member of the Org1 MSP), 'Org1.client' (any client of the Org1 MSP), and 'Org1.peer' (any peer of the Org1 MSP).```. 

Who is client peer?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 19:37:57 GMT):<br/>
Peers are generally not clients, nor admins.  Clients and admins are principals which are used in the construction of other, non-endorsement policies.

Hey all, just wondering what version of golang is supported by Fabric 1.1 and 1.2?  At some point there was an issue (with 1.0.5 I think?) where go 1.9 was not supported, so go 1.8 had to be used, and I just want to know if that limitation has been resolved.  Thanks!

in general - use 1.2 over v1.1, it has all the bug fixes v1.1.x has and the new features in it are very stable 
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sat, 07 Jul 2018 21:04:14 GMT):<br/>
Between go 1.8 and 1.9 there was a minor feature added to encoding/base64  that I used in some code, and it made me really sad to have to give it up to use go 1.8 ;)

Apologies for cross-post from #fabric-chaincode-dev , but I'm not certain if this is a chaincode issue or an endorser issue:

I added a history query to my chaincode.  Unit tests pass locally.  Attempting to instantiate the code, I see:

```
chaincode/input/src/wagoncc/cc.go:993:38: cannot use entry (type *"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult".KeyModification) as type *"wagoncc/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult".KeyModification in argument to marshalHistoryEntry
```

Problem is, there's nothing vendored in my code:

```
$ find $GOPATH -name *vendor*
/* this space blank */
$
```

Nor do there appear to be any hidden cache directories:

```
$ find $GOPATH -name '.*'
/* this space blank */
$
```

My current assumption is that some previously-vendored version of this code is hanging around in a cache somewhere in the network itself, but I've totally torn down the network (while keeping the servers in place--they are very much pets and not cattle at this point), done my best to obliterate all state, ensured that `docker containers ls -a`, `docker image ls -a`, and `docker volume ls` all return nothing, then brought everything up _de novo_, but I still see the issue.  I've run out of ideas.  Any thoughts on sneaky places I can check or better ways to debug this issue?
</p>
<p><strong>hamptonsmith</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 14:47:47 GMT):<br/>
Note that I _have_ "in-line vendored" the library in question:

```
$ find $GOPATH -path */queryresult
/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult
```

But without this, I see errors during chaincode installation:

```
$ peer chaincode install ...snip...
can't load package: package github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult: cannot find package "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult" in any of:
	/opt/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult (from $GOROOT)
	/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/ledger/queryresult (from $GOPATH)
```

hello @dave.enyeart  - On Fabric v1.0.6
We are facing a issue where the Endorsement Request gives a Execute Timeout to the HFC. We see from the chaincode logs - the endorsement gets processed within 7secs against the default execute timeout (30sec). The peer basically holds the response. The couch database logs are also scrolling indicating the communication between chaincode - peer - couch database is good.
This has happened to two peers. I have restarted 1 peer to increase the logging level to DEBUG however the issue related to Execute Timeout got fixed for it. I have avoided the restart of the other PEER to check if I can get any troubleshooting steps here.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 16:55:00 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde as a rule of thumb... whenever you restart stuff
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 16:55:07 GMT):<br/>
if it's possible
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 16:55:11 GMT):<br/>
use `kill -SIGABRT`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 16:55:22 GMT):<br/>
it will make the process crash and dump the stack trace to the logs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 16:55:35 GMT):<br/>
that will help for post-mortem analysis 
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 16:58:10 GMT):<br/>
I can do it for the current peer which does not send the response to HFC. Anything else we can do to gather more information?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:00:27 GMT):<br/>
There was someone in the past that proposed to add an RPC to the admin API to dump the goroutines into the logs but he was told it's a worthless idea ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:00:39 GMT):<br/>
so I guess there is no other way than to kill the peer
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:04:25 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=LWNo4XC82WZLWr8zj) @yacovm okay.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:08:29 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde you can enable certain debugs without restarting peer.  we'll have to confirm with @wlahti that this was possible in v1.0.x
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:08:36 GMT):<br/>
for example this would be helpful:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:08:40 GMT):<br/>
```peer logging setlevel chaincode DEBUG
peer logging setlevel endorser DEBUG
peer logging setlevel ledger DEBUG
peer logging setlevel state DEBUG
peer logging setlevel couchdb DEBUG
peer logging setlevel txmgr DEBUG```
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:09:43 GMT):<br/>
it uses regular expression matching against the loggers... what I don't recall is whether that was setup in v1.0.x  @wlahti ?
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:17:47 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart Yes, the ability to dynamically set logging levels has been available since v1.0.0. A few minor things have changed since then but the functionality was in place.
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:18:20 GMT):<br/>
Cool - I will enable following log level.
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 18:51:30 GMT):<br/>
hello @dave.enyeart  - we increased the log level but looks like there is information that can help out

Hello guys. I am getting issue while invoking the chaincode. For example_chaincode02, value of "a" is not changing even after multiple invokes. I set the OR policy while doing the instantiation. Instantiation happened without any error. However after multiple invoke, when i checked the peer logs, I am able to see some error message related to VSCC endorsemet failure.

Hello guys. I am getting issue while invoking the chaincode. For example_chaincode02, value of "a" is not changing even after multiple invokes. I set the OR policy while doing the instantiation. Instantiation happened without any error. However after multiple invoke, when i checked the peer logs, I am able to see some error message related to VSCC endorsemet failure.

Hi,  we have a channel where only one org is allowed to update , but many orgs can query , but we only need to have that performed as cross chanincode calls.           In R 1.0 you used to have all organization in the channel write policy to allow the cross chain code calls.  In R1.2 I see there is a  peer/Propose policy AND a peer/ChaincodeToChaincode. Can achieve what I want in 1.2 by adding all orgs to the policy reference in peer/ChaincodeToChaincode and only the one org I want to have write access to the peer/Propose  ?

Another question, when a transaction is committed into the ledger, who will notify the client that the transaction has been successfully committed？Since multiple peers will commit the same block (i.e. transactions), I am wondering which peer will send out such notification to the client?

@jyellick the `peer` cmd should provider the sub cmd to get the block from the peer
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain123</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 00:49:51 GMT):<br/>
like the `peer channel fetch` it retrieves the block from the orderer, but for the client,get block from peer node seems more important

<p><strong>qizhang</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 01:13:21 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain123 Thanks! But still, even though the client can listen to the event hub, who should create the event indicating that a tx has been committed?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain123</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 02:51:17 GMT):<br/>
@qizhang you can see the `	//Events

	Event_FilteredBlock = "event/FilteredBlock"`

if a peer doesn't hold private data in its own private temp db, during validation phrase, it needs to fetch private data from others, does it need to store private data after validation or after committing? @dave.enyeart  @yacovm @jyellick  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 08:22:29 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't do it during validation
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 08:22:39 GMT):<br/>
it first validates and then pulls data before the commit
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 08:22:48 GMT):<br/>
so we have:
1) validation
2) pull data
3) commit
</p>
<p><strong>richzhao</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 09:06:19 GMT):<br/>
only pull data, but doesn't save to its owner  private team db?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 10:40:59 GMT):<br/>
of course it saves

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 11:18:20 GMT):<br/>
@richzhao Collection non-members do not retrieve the private data, they validate the public hash of private data only, e.g. to ensure the version of the hashed key hasn't changed since simulation time.  Collection members retrieve the actual private data and store it in their temp db (if it wasn't pushed to them at endorsement time) and validate the hash version and that the private data matches the public hash.  If everything validates, the private data is removed from temp db and is committed to the private data storage and state db.

<p><strong>yoheiueda</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 09:51:09 GMT):<br/>
I have a question about CHAINCODE_VERSION_CONFLICT. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v1.2.0/core/committer/txvalidator/validator.go#L490

If I correctly understand the source code, the validation process invalidates all transactions of a chaincode in a block that contains an upgrade transaction for it.  I think invalidating transactions AFTER the upgrade transaction is enough. Is there any reason to invalidate transactions BEFORE the upgrade transaction?

Is there any way to prevent commands like `peer channel create`, `peer channel join`, `peer chaincode install` and instantiate and so on using ACL?

Hi guys , I'm not sure that I should ask question in this channel , but I do.
What I tried to implement 'client signing ' proposal functionality , I  generated key pair and certificates at browser side  , successfully enrolled user directly via ca and build the proposal , then signed this proposal in browser and sent back to the server.
Then I tried to send signed proposal via Node SDK to peer. but gor error '2Unknown access denied ;channel[mychannel] creator[org1]'
Does anyone face with this error before? ( Early I faced by it wrong mspID , but now I'm sure that it's correct)

@pankajcheema trying to understand the question...can you elaborate/clarify ? Which "ACL" are you referring to ? How do you mean `prevent commands..`
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 04 Aug 2018 18:08:12 GMT):<br/>
@vladyslavmunin `... build the proposal , then signed this proposal in browser and sent back to the server...` - so the browser is seing a signed protobuf proposal to the SDK which just sends it of as-is to the peer ?
</p>

@vladyslavmunin `... build the proposal , then signed this proposal in browser and sent back to the server...` - so the browser is sending a signed protobuf proposal to the SDK which just sends it of as-is to the peer ? if that is correct, I'd make sure your signing identity is correct (right MSPID and crypto)
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sat, 04 Aug 2018 18:10:56 GMT):<br/>
also would make sure the node SDK is not doing additional proposal construction on top of what you are sending

<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Sat, 04 Aug 2018 19:13:26 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr I was saying I want an organization to prevent from installing chaincode. Is it possible usinh ACL? 
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Sat, 04 Aug 2018 19:13:57 GMT):<br/>
The org1 should not be able to use 'peer Chaincode install'

Command
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 04 Aug 2018 21:08:31 GMT):<br/>
@pankajcheema Each peer's admin must install chaincode to the peer.  Only the peer's admin (as defined by the peer's local MSP) has privilege to install chaincode on the peer.  Then somebody meeting the chaincode instantiation policy (as specified within the chaincode package) may instantiate the chaincode on a channel to enable it on the channel.  Neither of these privileges are defined in the channel's ACL.   I'll point you to http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4noah.html for more details on the chaincode lifecycle and permissions.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 04 Aug 2018 21:09:55 GMT):<br/>
I've created a Jira https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11461 to make this more clear in the docs.
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Sun, 05 Aug 2018 07:13:03 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Sun, 05 Aug 2018 15:52:37 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr Is there any way to specify such rule that a particular org can only install and instantiate the chaincode on network?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 05 Aug 2018 15:57:00 GMT):<br/>
install is outside the scope of these resource based policies as they are not channel specific  (as mentioned earlier)
</p>
<p><strong>pankajcheema</strong> (Sun, 05 Aug 2018 15:59:57 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Sun, 05 Aug 2018 16:01:59 GMT):<br/>
as for instantiate, it is channel specific, and can be controlled via "peer/Propose" resource. However it'll affect all proposals to the channel (not just the instantiate Proposal)

<p><strong>DivyaAgrawal</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 08:26:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi All, Can anyone shed some light on how do we change the endorsing peers in a network. I am using caliper and the endorsing peers seems to be fix. What i have understood from surfing the net so far is we need to change the profile in the configtx.yaml so that the chaincode is instantiated accordingly. But am not finding any documentation on that. If anyone has already done that or knows how to do it . It will be a great help. Thanks in advance.

hello @dave.enyeart. what is the right way to verify if chaincode in instantiated on the channel (for v1.0.x and v1.2.x)
1. using peer CLI approach to verify if the chaincode is instantiated on the channel
2. using couch database information - is it by checking if lscc<chaincode> document exist in the channel database

Can i get the chaincode version from either?

Hi all, I've got a question regarding private collections -- say there are 3 orgs: org1, org2, and org3, and there's a private collection defined that includes all of them.  Now say a transaction proposal which contains private data meant to end up in the private collection is sent only to org1 and org2, is endorsed, ordered, and is committed.  Does org3 automatically receive the private data from org1 and/or org2's peers?  Or does org3 never end up with the private data because it didn't have a peer that endorsed that transaction proposal?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 12 Aug 2018 22:35:35 GMT):<br/>

Hi , I started learning hyperledger-fabric for creating my own business application but, I still have a question 

In practice, there is only one machine with docker and whole bna, or every member must have his own docker with bna?

If only one, then it turns out to be a centralized application. Am I right?

@dave.enyeart in the peer it use the `leveldb` to store the data, so the index can work with it?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 14:27:33 GMT):<br/>
leveldb is key/value store.  the value is bytes only.  the database doesn't know about the value bytes content therefore index is not applicable for leveldb content.  leveldb has implicit internal index for the key, which enables efficient key and key range queries out of the box.  if you want to query value content, you'll need to use couchdb with json content.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 18:42:41 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain123  there are different types of indexes.  fabric has some implicit indexes implemented in leveldb in the source code for keeping track of block data.  do not confuse these indexes with the chaincode indexes for couchdb that enable chaincode couchdb rich queries.   both public state data and private state database can be stored in couchdb, for query from chaincode.

@asaningmaxchain123  there are different types of indexes.  fabric has some internal indexes implemented in leveldb in the source code for keeping track of block data.  do not confuse these indexes with the chaincode indexes for couchdb that enable chaincode couchdb rich queries.   both public state data and private state database can be stored in couchdb, for query from chaincode.

Hi all, I've read a bit about how when a key/value pair is stored in the private ledger, Fabric automatically (?) also computes and stores the hash of the private value so that it can be verified later.  Is there documentation somewhere that elaborates on this?  I'm asking because I need to know how to 1) determine if the existing hash scheme is sufficient for what I want to do, and if so 2) access those hash values

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Aug 2018 02:49:45 GMT):<br/>
The hashes will be in the public writeset, which can be obtained by querying for the transaction by id
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Aug 2018 02:51:45 GMT):<br/>
You'll find in there a SHA-256 hash of the private key and the private value

A further question on the implementation -- is it the plain hash of the document data, or is there a nonce prepended to the document data before computing the hash?  While not an easy vulnerability to exploit, if there is no nonce used in computing the hash, then someone could [spend a lot of resources] pre-computing a hash collision (e.g. two legal contracts -- one that the two contract-negotiators agree to, and one modified to the attacker's advantage), and then submit the forged document to private storage (that in the legal contract example would be unsealed for review by a judge in a legal dispute).
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 19 Aug 2018 21:23:14 GMT):<br/>
@vdods it's the hash of the key, and the hash of the value.
you're right about the weakness - if the key and value come from a low entropy distribution, you can do an exhaustive search over the space of the keys/values and guess.
however - nothing prevents you from adding your own custom salt (random padding) to the key and value.

that's not a hash collision, that's a "pre-image attack". Specifically "second preimage attack". A collision, is to find *any* 2 values that map to the same hash. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 19 Aug 2018 21:29:18 GMT):<br/>
If the hash function is secure then doing a pre-image attack is not feasible

Later i added peer1 as well to the channel and then the query works fine...
Does that mean i have to add all the peers to the channel or just the anchor peers? did i miss something? the gossip protocol was enabled to be dynamic when i faced this issue

at what rate are you submitting transactions and how large are they? based on the settings you have posted either one transaction is committed every 50s or the transaction payload is so large that it exceeds the absolute max bytes of 120

Question from #fabric-chaincode-dev ... Can anyone shed some light on the platform chaincode build process design methodology? The concept of performing a build in a container in a production environment then using the results to tag an image for chaincode invocation by peers seems far more complex and error prone, not to mention less secure than using a seperate dedicated build environment to create strongly versioned container releases for chaincode...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:11:40 GMT):<br/>
I can see why it's error prone
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:11:44 GMT):<br/>
but why is it less secure?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:12:06 GMT):<br/>
if the docker daemon is secure... and the build is secure because you only build code you sanitized
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:12:13 GMT):<br/>
what is the concern?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:12:21 GMT):<br/>
Using Docker.sock at all requires a privledged container... while this isn’t the only use it is one of them...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:12:47 GMT):<br/>
so run your peer in a VM
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:12:51 GMT):<br/>
Also running npm install pulls lots of code in
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:12:59 GMT):<br/>
ah, you use node.js chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:13:15 GMT):<br/>
there you go 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:13:56 GMT):<br/>
But we could have a scanned container that is audited and verified independently before using in production...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:14:12 GMT):<br/>
so if you use golang chaincode then you only package stuff that you pre-scanned
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:14:29 GMT):<br/>
That applies to go as well.. and running all out integration tests and shipping the exact same resulting binaries...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:14:30 GMT):<br/>
and it's compiled in a container which you have control over its image
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:14:41 GMT):<br/>
no... golang doesn't download stuff from the internet at its build time
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:15:04 GMT):<br/>
So you are saying the go build will be completely deterministic
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:15:13 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:15:21 GMT):<br/>
i am saying the go build doesn't download anything from the internet
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:15:30 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if the golang compiler doesn't toss coins
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:16:02 GMT):<br/>
Ok... so backing up... why would we not want to specify a specific container image perhaps with hash when instantiating the chain code ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:16:11 GMT):<br/>
you can do that can't you?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:16:20 GMT):<br/>

What about the specific chaincode itself?

I’m aware of the runtime and build images
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:18:50 GMT):<br/>
ie instead of a chaincode version number perhaps it would be a container version that is prebuilt?

If that is not present then I would think it is a design choice and I would like to understand further before I continue patching that out as part of our work so we can run natively in kubernetes

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:20:43 GMT):<br/>
most things aren't design choices as they are "lack of time"

getHistoryForKey() function when called from InvokeChaincode() works fine if both chaincodes are on same channel but returns empty result iterator if chaincode is on different channels .Can someone help?

Also not the issue of cross channel calling as query function works fine in all scenarios

Hi all

I'm trying to perform to `PutState` in a single call:

```
func ccFunc() {
	putState_1()
	putState_2()
}

func putState_1() {
	...
	stub.PutState(key, value)
}

func putState_2() {
	...
	stub.PutState(key, value)
}
```

in this case, putState_1 will not change the ledger state (assume all endorsements and validations are fine)
Is there anything I should take into account? Because such a behavior look weird

Hi team , in fabric 1.0.6 we are seeing transaction that create many key value pairs use more CPU in the CouchDB than we would like. Am I right in thinking that the work already done in Fabric 1.1  ( FAB-2725, FAB-6421, FAB-6422, FAB-6330)  is likely to improve this ?  I think my reading of the CR is Fabric now does a bulk write operation.  Most of the FAB talk in terms of throughput time rather than resource usage.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 10:50:24 GMT):<br/>
yes, the bulk updates for creates/updates and index support for queries in couchdb 1.1 will greatly improve performance and reduce cpu.

Hi, can some help me with below concern:
in fabric v1.1.1, if peer is running on multiple cores server, do we need to enable parallel validation by setting `CORE_PEER_validatorPoolSize=XXX` (XXX will be no. of cores of peer server) or peer will default take number of cores of server as the go routines to parallel running validation? 
Thanks!

@dave.enyeart hi, rickr tell me to ask here, i found that i could get a peer event with a "filtered block" in java sdk, but i could not tell the differences, what exactly does the peer event filtered? should all the channel member could retrieve the whole blocks? then why filtered
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 08:09:52 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm saw you around here:grin: in case you know the answer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 08:11:25 GMT):<br/>
it's filtered because the client might not be authorized to see the entire block
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 08:11:28 GMT):<br/>
only its own transactions
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 08:12:57 GMT):<br/>
how come...
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 08:13:17 GMT):<br/>
all members should have the right to get the whole ledger
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 08:14:57 GMT):<br/>
because of the private data involve? 
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 08:17:40 GMT):<br/>
but if a client can not retrieve the whole block, how can the client verify the block is not been malevolent tampering
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 10:00:48 GMT):<br/>
@kelvinzhong The filtered block has the same structure as a normal block, however the transaction payload including read-write set is filtered out.  A primary use case is that a client may simply want to know the validation/invalidation status of all transactions in the blocks, rather than wanting to know the data of each transaction. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 10:01:05 GMT):<br/>
See doc here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/peer_event_services.html#available-services

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 10:01:19 GMT):<br/>
See the content of the filtered blocks here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/protos/peer/events.proto#L20-L47
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 10:05:39 GMT):<br/>
As yacovm mentions, you can also use it for access control... you can specify a different ACL for clients that can receive full block events vs filtered block events, see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/configtx.yaml#L184-L188
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 05:03:42 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 06:23:03 GMT):<br/>
well, i got confuse at the configtx.yaml, seems it's a channel level ACL, either you can retrieve the whole block of the ledger or can only retrieve the filtered block of the ledger. it seems not like what yacovm said block level ACL, client can get the transactions with authorized in the filtered block...

Using the java SDK to create chaincode passing in an archive. Code works fine - been stable for months.

Hello 
after upgrade to fabric v1.2.0, some of peers getting stuck during transaction commit.
for example, if a channel has 3 peers, one out of three is stuckduring transaction. no errors in logs on peer or orderer.
if I restart a container for this peer, a transaction that stuck previously will proceed, but other peers tell this message in logs:
```

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:18:15 GMT):<br/>
@gravity - are you using the deliver service for events?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:19:00 GMT):<br/>
`Remote endpoint claims to be a different peer` means the peer you re-connected to, changed its certificate. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:19:05 GMT):<br/>
and is unrelated to v1.2
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:19:09 GMT):<br/>
it is that way since v1.0

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:19:40 GMT):<br/>
check if your application uses port 7051 for events, or 7053
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:19:47 GMT):<br/>
if 7051 then yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:19:52 GMT):<br/>
else, no.

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:25:35 GMT):<br/>
i know that they run on 7051
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:25:44 GMT):<br/>
i am asking whether you connect also to 7053 or not
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:28:03 GMT):<br/>
no, my client(sdk) application does not use 7053 port
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:32:15 GMT):<br/>
ah so you use the deliver service
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:32:23 GMT):<br/>
there is a bug that is going to be fixed in v1.2.1
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:32:37 GMT):<br/>
this bug makes the commit sometimes stuck, if you connect to the event deliver service
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:32:46 GMT):<br/>
so you need to upgrade to v1.2.1
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:33:09 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart any idea when v1.2.1 is cut?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:35:25 GMT):<br/>
you need to wait 30 minutes
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:37:15 GMT):<br/>
regardless of peer number?
could you explain please what this is implemented in this way?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:38:43 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, in v1.2.1 there is a fix where it happens only if the peer's organization has changed
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:38:43 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, in v1.2.1 or in v1.3 there is a fix where it happens only if the peer's organization has changed
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:39:43 GMT):<br/>
the idea in general was that if you change the peer's certificate - this is suspicious because it might mean your network is hijacked , but we didn't take into account if the peer was in the same organization :/

Hi, can someone help to answer my concern:
I running fabric network with setting `Channel Capability ` V1_1; `Orderer Capability ` V1_1 and `Application Capability ` V1_1; my orderer, peer running on binary v1.1.1 and works fine.
however when I joined one peer, say org0-peer1, which build one `v1.2.0`) into channel successfully, 
Does that correct that org0-peer1 could join the channel?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:19:52 GMT):<br/>
generally speaking... the peer opens all the ledgers for all the channels it participates in
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:20:00 GMT):<br/>
and then establishes communication to orderers and peerrs

Thanks for your reply.I find a picture in https://github.com/yeasy/hyperledger_code_fabric/blob/2e89749e16e9a5b35d02736aa44f7791df4fac22/peer/node/start_go.md

<p><strong>Ryan2</strong> (Sat, 29 Sep 2018 10:46:51 GMT):<br/>
I tested below scenario:
1. recording variableA with value of 200 marbles, and this variable is committed into ledger inserted into couchdb
2. might someone logged into couchdb and modified variableA = 500 marbles (at this time, in couchdb version of document already change and not match with rest of peer's couchdb)
2.1 make a transfer transaction from 500 marble variableA to variableB , and this transaction was successfully.

this mean that fabric does not maintain the consistency of version of documents of peers' statedb.
And protection (or security) of statedb from modification any value of the key become critical important.
is my understand is correct?

I've got a question regarding writing to a private collection.  Say I have 2 orgs, each with their own private collection.  Say I issue a transaction to peers in both orgs, and each org's peer stores something to its own private collection (this clearly depends on the peer knowing that it's a member of the org whose private collection it owns).  Is that expected to work?  Or is this prohibited?

hmmm you can have the peer have a decorator that passes the identity
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:41:45 GMT):<br/>
decorators are plugins local to the peer, that annotate the input of the chaincode

<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:43:12 GMT):<br/>
just want to understand one point fully: when writing to a private collection, are hashes of the key and value written to the ledger?  or perhaps somewhere else?  if they're written to the ledger, are they part of the transaction's read-write set?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:45:11 GMT):<br/>
yes they are
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:45:23 GMT):<br/>
that's exactly how it works actually
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:45:31 GMT):<br/>
once a peer gets the block it has the hashes in it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:45:44 GMT):<br/>
and then it can ensure that the private data itself, the hash pre-image is correct
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:45:49 GMT):<br/>
by hashing itself and comparing
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:46:45 GMT):<br/>
but if different peers produce different read-write sets because they're writing to different private collections, how can the different transaction proposals be accepted by the orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:50:42 GMT):<br/>
on a side note, the automatic storage of the hash of the private collection value is worrying; https://benlog.com/2008/06/19/dont-hash-secrets/
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:52:36 GMT):<br/>
presumably the hash of the private value is accessible by all committing peers.  if the secret is something that occupies a relatively small space (such as passwords or similar) and an attacker knows that, then a dictionary attack or related could be used to infer the private value from the public hash
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 05:07:09 GMT):<br/>
So? @vdods just add random salt to the key and value
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 05:10:22 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I suppose, though that's rather annoying to have to do, rather than have the privacy abstraction take care of it.  Realistically, no one will know to do that, so many Fabric apps will have this vulnerability
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 05:12:41 GMT):<br/>
But for now that's a side concern.  I would like to know the answer to the question about a single transaction running on different peers being able to write to different private collections -- don't they produce different read-write sets?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 05:12:51 GMT):<br/>
and therefore the transaction won't be accepted by the orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 05:13:22 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm BTW, I appreciate your always-insightful advice!

That's why I suggest everyone takes a crypto course if he/she uses Fabric :) 
Jokes aside... you have a point, but - note that the peers themselves cannot generate the randomness, right? It has to come from the client. 
So - if we ever do such a change we'd need to probably implement a wrapper stub that uses the existing stub API as a black box, and uses something like ASN1 or protobuf marshaling and includes salts.
>  I would like to know the answer to the question about a single transaction running on different peers being able to write to different private collections -- don't they produce different read-write sets? 
they do... you're supposed to do that in different transactions, if the RWSets are different. 
A way to do that in the same RWSet is simply to pass the randomness of the salt via the transient map.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 05:30:56 GMT):<br/>
> BTW, I appreciate your always-insightful advice! 
Why don't you implement a wrapper shim that uses salts and push that as a contribution to the project?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 05:42:13 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Hehe, fair enough ;)  Thanks for your answers.  Could potentially allow random number generation on the peers by passing a seed to the transaction and then using a fixed PRNG.  As for the separate transactions, I think I'm still coming to grips psychologically with not having atomic operations in certain cases :)

Hello!
When I changed the endorsement policy of my chaincode from `-P "OR ('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')"` to `-P "OR ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer')"`, I got an error from peer during block committing: ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE.
I've set EnableNodeOUs to true in crypto-config.yaml, peer certificate contains `Subject: C=US, ST=California, L=San Francisco, OU=peer, CN=peer0.org1.example.com`. What is the problem?

Hi there, I've already instantiated a chaincode on my 2 org network, and along with it is a private collection owned by a single org.  This was sort of a mistake, and there was supposed to be a private collection owned by each org, but I issued the original instantiate transaction with only one of the private collections defined.  Now i've issued another instantiate (upgrade) transaction, with both private collections defined, but there is no difference; only the single, already-existing private collection is present.  Note that I'm issuing the instantiate transaction to one peer on one org only.  Why isn't the definition of the private collections being updated to include the second one?

When instantiating chaincode what policy is a new chaincode instantiate checked against.  Is it just any policy specified in the -i of the command , in which case any writer to a channel could install a new chaincode by specifying itself, or would it be checked against a default channel policy .   The upgrade documentation makes it clear that any upgrade is checked against the previous upgrade or install  policy,   but I'm not 100% clear on the initial install.

<p><strong>DeepakMP</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 16:12:38 GMT):<br/>
1. I figured out that we can launch our custom configured network by modifying the crypto-config.yaml file and going through the launch network steps. (I'm using the documentation default resources- the /fabcar directory). The generate command works and creates 4 or more peers as per my entries in yaml, but thereafter, I get stuck, they dont get endorser nodes created for them, and then hence they're not part of my channel and so on. (This happens whenever, I create new Orgs, beyond the default Org1 and Org2). I think this is so because the .tx files that come with the documentation are placed for only Org1 and Org2. So I'm still trying to figure out if there's a way to dynamically create the .tx files or is there a healthier way to process new organisations and new peers for them.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=XGtPEma4fWqoozr8A) @yacovm you give me two answer, i am confused,can you give me more simply answer?
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain123</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 16:36:54 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart @jyellick @mastersingh24  when the chaincode upgrading the invoke transaction should stop until all the peer has upgrade the chaincode successfully?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 21:25:28 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain123 once the chaincode upgrade transaction is committed on the channel, any already inflight transactions from the prior chaincode version will get invalidated upon their commit.  any new invoke will utilize the new chaincode version.  if some peers do not yet have the new version installed, invoke on those peers will return an error.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 21:25:36 GMT):<br/>
takeaways: 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 21:25:44 GMT):<br/>
1) peers should install the next chaincode version before it is instantiated on the channel (having multiple chaincode versions installed is not a problem, the latest instantiated chaincode will always be used) 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 21:25:47 GMT):<br/>
2) clients need to handle potential transaction invalidations with retries.
</p>
<p><strong>asaningmaxchain123</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 23:31:47 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart which validate code indicate the transaction is invalid due to chaincode upgrade?

Hi! I am testing a simple network, 1 peer, solo orderer and sending 30 parallel transactions. (I know that this network has no real meaning, but I have to do this trial). Varing batch timeout and batch size I have always this problem: the transactions have all the same commit time (circa 5s) except two/three transactions which commit time is circa 5/10s higher. Those transactions are the first one  to send the proposal  transaction to the endorsment peer. Logging the timestamp, I notice that is due to the endorsment peer who responds slow for this transactions (the first one), as if it needs a  time to wake up from a sleep. Anyone knows why? thank you

@ArianStef several things contribute to latency (couple of things you have pointed out - batch timeout and batch size). The initial tx delay could be due to bringing up chaincode (this may include creating the image if not present). My suggestion would be to go through the usual "warm up" with some TXs and then begin measurement
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 06:08:18 GMT):<br/>
Here's a question: I realize the following feature could be abused easily, but is there a way to obtain a lock on a set of specified ledger keys on a specified set of peers, such that others who try to obtain the lock and execute a transaction will have their transaction simulation delayed until the lock is released?  Basically as a bit of preventative care to avoid the situation of the orderer rejecting transactions because their RW sets conflict.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:06:10 GMT):<br/>
you can use state based endorsement @vdods 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:06:21 GMT):<br/>
if you set an endorsement policy of a key 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:06:31 GMT):<br/>
no one can change it but the orgs in the policy....
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:41:46 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Hmm.. that's a pretty heavy-handed thing, right?  It would require a configuration update to change?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:44:44 GMT):<br/>
not a config update
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:44:56 GMT):<br/>
state based endorsement is all chaincode methods
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:45:02 GMT):<br/>
you use chaincode to change the key policy
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:56:14 GMT):<br/>
where is the interface defined?  This can be called from chaincode?

Hi @yacovm  ..I am stuck in one of the issue. It is I have to get endorsement from two peers. These 2 peers are in different org. In java sdk i add two peer in one channel and invoke a code. But in "consistencyGroups" it is more then 1 and hence I am getting exception. How should i get endorsement form two peers.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 11:22:10 GMT):<br/>
consistency groups...?
</p>

i only know of this term from storage domain

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 11:22:26 GMT):<br/>
in RAID groups :/ 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 11:22:43 GMT):<br/>
also - java sdk is this way: #fabric-sdk-java  ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>ShobhitSrivastava</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 11:25:01 GMT):<br/>
in fabric-java sdk..there is something in code
</p>
<p><strong>ShobhitSrivastava</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 11:25:01 GMT):<br/>
but it would be good if you can tell me, how can  I get endorsement form two peers?

hello
trying to setup kafka for an orderer but getting this error:
`2018-10-11 10:31:08.346 UTC [orderer/consensus/kafka] try -> DEBU 0f3 [channel: testchainid] Need to retry because process failed = kafka server: Replication-factor is invalid.`

overall behavior is weird. sometime orderer with kafka cluster starts OK, sometime fails with the error above.
have I missed something?
thanks in advance

@jyellick If a peer has installed multiple same named multiple chaincodes for multiple channels(which the peer have joined.) then is it necessary that their versions should be different?

Hello
is there any recommendations on how many peers should be serving a channel for a better throughput? 
</p>
<p><strong>yousaf</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 19:22:34 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick Are the anchor peers specified for an organization, per channel separately? Or they are fixed while developing the network, independent of the channel?

<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 12:54:45 GMT):<br/>
hey all, i have a question regarding batch timeouts and block validation. i successfully updated my channel configuration to have a BatchTimeout of 100ms, but am still getting MVCC errors. specifically in the following scenario:

txnA updates key1 => val1. ~300 ms later txnB updates key1 => val2. txnB fails with an MVCC error.

i'm assuming that since they occur 300ms apart they would be in separate blocks based on the configured BatchTimeout. is it the vscc that is rejecting with the MVCC error? if so why would the transaction be rejected if my assumption is correct and they are in separate blocks?

@atirekg all of your errors seem to be related to cert issues. the error logs explicitly state `transport: authentication handshake failed: tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake`
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:17:11 GMT):<br/>
check your certs and make sure your applications are looking for them in the right place
</p>
<p><strong>atirekg</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:17:35 GMT):<br/>
yes tried all mentioned ways but always getting this error
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:18:15 GMT):<br/>
do you have secure ssl set up on both ends?
</p>
<p><strong>atirekg</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:18:35 GMT):<br/>

but when I am trying to add new org then getting the problem
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:19:30 GMT):<br/>
right when i say both ends i mean services. even if you are running things locally you cant designate only one service to use secure ssl
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:20:04 GMT):<br/>
have you properly set up the new orgs crypto material and added it to the channel configuration?
</p>
<p><strong>atirekg</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:21:15 GMT):<br/>
yes, generated by same method `cryptogen generate --config=./crypto-config-org2.yaml`
</p>
<p><strong>atirekg</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:21:48 GMT):<br/>
then I am fetching the channel config block from orderer on org2 cli

and getting this error
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:22:32 GMT):<br/>
have you updated your network configuration to allow org2 to be a member?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:23:08 GMT):<br/>
just generating the crypto material then attempting to fetch the block isnt enough, all of that crypto material needs to be added to the network config

i think the reason you are struggling to get help is because you are posting multiple error logs from different examples without any context.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 08:15:14 GMT):<br/>
you can't have a dynamic EP

you can only upgrade the EP via chaincode upgrade

hey @yacovm  ```
I have a ques in hyperledger fabric. I am using Couch DB as state DB and using two peers in channel. However I am able to delete the keys and update value in Json. How is this replicated? If I am able to change value in Json key and value.
```

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 09:25:16 GMT):<br/>
You change keys manually via the database?

<p><strong>ShobhitSrivastava</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 09:53:03 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>ShobhitSrivastava</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 09:53:48 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=d453b341-97e3-4af8-8e98-5653cbcb9bc4) @yacovm correct. I wanted to check if  further transaction will get affected due to it.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 09:57:39 GMT):<br/>
If you 'tamper' with state db data directly, then the peer will not match other peers and cause proposal responses to not match other peers, this will result in clients throwing away the 'bad' proposals sent to that peer or if submitted to ordering regardless, will cause transaction to get invalidated.  In short, don't tamper with state database, as it will be found out and that peer will be not trusted and isolated
</p>
<p><strong>ShobhitSrivastava</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 10:02:29 GMT):<br/>
hey @dave.enyeart . I need to give business guys as how this peer will be isolated. But in fabric, It does not happen automatically. Also once I delete one key from statedb I am still able to create new transactions. Ideally block of chain should get corrupted and block should not get created.
</p>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 10:08:58 GMT):<br/>
Clients send proposals to multiple peers and check consistency of results.  If one peer doesn't match, clients won't trust that peer anymore and will not go to it anymore. Doing a verification of entire chain for each transaction is prohibitively expensive. You can do a verification of peer's blockchain using external tools instead.  Think of statedb as a cache.  If it's data is in doubt you can drop statedb and it will be rebuilt from the blockchain automatically upon peer restart.  But I'd recommend lock down couchdb by not exposing couchdb port beyond the peer's docker network and have peer use username/password to ensure it cannot be tampered by external users in the first place.
</p>
<p><strong>ShobhitSrivastava</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 10:16:33 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=fz6chQmjWMTZy4jXY) @dave.enyeart Sounds logical. I thought of locking couchdb in some manner. Thanks for giving confirmation on my thoughts.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=fz6chQmjWMTZy4jXY) @dave.enyeart Sorry for posting again. I stopped my peer and couch db instance and started them both. But I still got same old ledger having fews keys deleted by me. Any thought on that?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 11:04:16 GMT):<br/>
You have to drop statedb (delete) if you want peer to rebuild it
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=r2W4ZFu69y4Cfh3FL) @dave.enyeart can you suggest any reading to delete statedb. I deleted from CouchDb frontend. But after restart it does not work
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 11:13:03 GMT):<br/>
If you are using couchdb, deleting the /opt/couchdb/data directory would do the trick

> Question . Since chaincode only simulate by endorsing peers , so how does committer who is not an endorser validate read write set as writeset is generated after executing chaincode . What exactly does committer check except signature validations ?

the mostly validator checks 2 things:
1) compliance of the transaction with the endorsement policy: that basically entails signature checks and policy checks
2) concurrency control checks: the writes in the read-write set are applied only if all variables that were read at simulation time haven't changed since - this is a check over versions. (this description is a simplification but it should give you the big picture).
Mostly: there is no semantic check on the correctness of any value - that's implied in the trust assusmptions over the endorsement policy

I *think* this is the right venue for this question. If not pls point me elsewhere - this pertains to performing chaincode instantiation. 
Is it (now) normal to get different length proposal responses from different peers? Running 1.3.0 - have never seen this problem until an inadvertent upgrade from 1.2.0. 
1.0 and 1.1 never exhibited this behavior either.

Question: since the transaction proposals on a peer are simulated in parallel (each in a different goroutine), is there any limitation on how many such goroutines can exist in parallel?

hi, install chaincode succeeded but instantiate chaincode failed. i could not find any message on chaincode instantiate from peer logs. and there was a message about chaincode install:

the last line shows an error. is this the reason for instantiation failure?

<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 09:40:07 GMT):<br/>
Hi I've a question about how much data can be deduced by non-members of private data collections. 
If I take and example if there are peers P1, P2 and P3 , where there is a private collection C1 between P1 and P2 but not P3, and a single channel between all three.    If a transactions is submitted by C1 and endorsed by P1 and P2, creating date private data in C1.
How much can P3 see ? 
I assume P3 will see the submitter certs, the endorsers certs. 
Will P3 also see that C1 has been used.  I assume yes but would like confirmation.
So given a trading network with a single channel but private collection between pairs or participants  any participant  could deduce  who is trading (or at least have a very good guess)  with who and when, but no details of the trades assuming all details of the trade is in the private data collection.  Is this correct ? I'm assuming fixing the above would need some aspect of the identify mixing that the Fabric team are exploring.

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 10:34:41 GMT):<br/>
@rsherwood right, currently P3 will know that there is some private data in C1 that P1 and P2 are members of.  there is work ongoing to make that information secret as well, using identity mixer, zero knowledge proof, and 'local collections' rather than static collections (where clients choose who should see the data, rather than it being defined in static collections).

<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:08:07 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  Question: Let suppose we have four peers out of which only one is endorsing peer . So I installed and instantiated chaincode and invoke query using that peer terminal and successfully able to change state of asset . But when I  query about value of that asset sing other peer terminal , I get an error `Error: endorsement failure during query. response: status:500 message:"cannot retrieve package for chaincode mycc/v0, error open /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/mycc.v0: no such file or directory" ` . My question is do I need to install chaincode in each peer including non endorsing peers ? I have read in documentation that only endorsing peer need chaincode !
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:15:41 GMT):<br/>
@MohammadObaid  you need to install chaincode on each peer where you want to invoke chaincode.  A peer that executes chaincode is an endorser, regardless of what that chaincode call does reads or writes.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:15:41 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:17:05 GMT):<br/>
From peer perspective, there is no difference between invokes and queries... they are all chaincode calls that get endorsed
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:19:50 GMT):<br/>
so if comitting peers want to find out value of asset for example value of `a` they cant do it ? 
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:20:23 GMT):<br/>
Does block deliver to comitting peers only contain hashes and signatures ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:21:19 GMT):<br/>
of course it contains more than hashes and signatures... it also contains the key and value pairs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:21:38 GMT):<br/>
otherwise you couldn't have extracted them from the block
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:21:45 GMT):<br/>
but - to read a key you need a chaincode

a chaincode, for that key.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 11:39:53 GMT):<br/>
@bh4rtp the root cause error message is not printed in peer logs for security reasons.  you'll need to get the root error message from client side.

@bh4rtp to mention it here as well... looks like the app client code is not printing the "message" that is returned by the chaincode.  That should provide the root cause of the error.  We will also look into improving the samples to demonstrate this.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=2yfYvwWiro9As5xB8) @yacovm @yacovm Thanks for clarification . That means peer can't access world ledger if it doesnt install chaincode because query process involves calling getState function from chaincode which lookup in world ledger and return value right ?
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 19:05:59 GMT):<br/>
Just one more thing is this mechanism is due to some security reasons   like why cant comitting peers just simply fetch key value pair from world ledger without chaincode since world ledger stores all key value pair with its latest state/version if all of the peers storing the same thing? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 19:13:08 GMT):<br/>
I agree that it would make sense to have an API that just reads the ledger's key-value store 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 19:13:19 GMT):<br/>
maybe a system chaincode that does that
</p>
<p><strong>MohammadObaid</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 08:37:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes that will be better solution . If any client-sdk/node sdk integrate with comitting peer ledger then it wont be able to fetch keyvalue pairs so in current scenario every peer have to be endorsing !
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 11:54:38 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart i found the reason. the `chaincodeType` argument was passed as `init`, i.e. fcn. however the error message is not returned to client. that is the problem.
i added a logging line in the source file `core/endorser/endorser.go`, and finally got the error message. so i just did a negative test to endorser.go :grinning:.
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 11:59:00 GMT):<br/>
the message from fabric after added the logging line:

i have changed timeout to be 300000. it still doesn't work.

```let event_timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      let message = 'REQUEST_TIMEOUT:' + eh.getPeerAddr();
      logger.error(message);
      eh.disconnect();
  }, 300000);```

Hey . I have a question . If a peer is non admin why can't they join channels despite fetching all blocks ? When I try to join block from non admin peer terminal I got 500 status code with error `peer is not admin identity `

<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:04:21 GMT):<br/>
Has any thought been given to including the block height of the peer endorsing a transaction in the endorsement reply?  My thinking is that with that information, a client could reasonably infer if a node is corrupt or not.  If the client receives endorsements from multiple peers at the same block height and their RWsets differ, then either the chaincode is non-deterministic (which is already a disaster) or one or more of the peers has been corrupted.

I'm running a network v1.3.0 and right after network start, I'm getting this warning:

Hi all
I'm getting messages on peers when the network is running with TLS enabled:
`2018/11/09 09:44:42 [DEBUG] Client TLS certificate and/or key file not provided`
but I've provided TLS client certificates:
```
      - CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTCERT_FILE=/data/tls/peer3.org1.com-client.crt
      - CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTKEY_FILE=/data/tls/peer3.org1.com-client.key
```

am I missing something?

Repeat of the question I asked on october 29. I'm unable to move to 1.3.0 because of this issue.
```
I *think* this is the right venue for this question. If not pls point me elsewhere - this pertains to performing chaincode instantiation. 
Is it (now) normal to get different length proposal responses from different peers? Running 1.3.0 - have never seen this problem until an inadvertent upgrade from 1.2.0. 
1.0 and 1.1 never exhibited this behavior either.```

</p>

@yacom - the length of the response differs between peers. one is 4 bytes longer than the other.

what field is different
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Sun, 11 Nov 2018 23:33:20 GMT):<br/>
The instantiate proposal response differs between peer0 and peer1. 
The one from peer1 is a different length to the one from peer0.

The java SDK does a consistency check - it expects them to be identical. When they differ it fails.
This difference is new to 1.3 - or at least if it isn't I never saw it before.
Hence my question. Is this a known or previously unseen thing? It happened to me

@aatkddny I beg your pardon... instantiate proposal differs?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 11 Nov 2018 23:37:20 GMT):<br/>
instantiate is always on a single node.... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 11 Nov 2018 23:38:34 GMT):<br/>
@aatkddny it seems to me perhaps 1 peer is in a different version than another?
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Sun, 11 Nov 2018 23:56:05 GMT):<br/>
no they are both 1.3 - deployed in same kubernetes cluster at same time both using :latest, which resolved to 1.3

@anjalinaik chaincode is unable to connect to the peer. You would need to look at various connection specific properties such as https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L26 and make sure the address chaincode is trying to connect to is reachable
</p>
<p><strong>tballast</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:24:14 GMT):<br/>
@anjalinaik make sure that all of your docker networks are also configured properly. For instance, make sure your network name (ie mynetworkname): 

```
networks:
  mynetworkname:
```
matches the network mode for your peers: `      - CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_mynetworkname`

Hi, I have a question about concurrent requests being sent to an endorser. If two requests (for indepenent data sets) are being sent to the same endorser, how does the endorser handle them?

Hi, I read over the document https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/membership/membership.html
`KeyStore for Private Key: This folder is defined for the local MSP of a peer or orderer node (or in an client’s local MSP), and contains the node’s signing key. This key matches cryptographically the node’s identity included in Node Identity folder and is used to sign data — for example to sign a transaction proposal response, as part of the endorsement phase.

This folder is mandatory for local MSPs, and must contain exactly one private key. Obviously, access to this folder must be limited only to the identities of users who have administrative responsibility on the peer.`
I tested by delete msp folder (crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org0/msp/) on local peer, then submit transaction, it succeeded. 
However, it seem transaction is not signed by local peer private key, but signed by peer certificate?
Can someone explain?

hi all
are there any recommendations on how many peers(of each role: discovery, endorser, commiter) should be assigned to a channel? (if we speak about performance)
or maybe these peers should be separated like, peer0, peer1, peer2 are assigned to a channel1, peer3, peer4, peer5 - to a channel2?
is it a good practice for peers to be members of several channels with the same/different chaincodes installed?

thanks in advance

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:18:44 GMT):<br/>
@asaningmaxchain123 I'm guessing
1. the original request timed out
2. the chaincode execution got aborted after the time out when it tried to do a PUT (the ledger context was taken away after the timeout)
3. bumping up CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL from info to debug  in the docker-compose file might give you more info.
4. u might also want to consider bumping up the startup time out (given we see `lscc` in the stack this faiuklure might be during instantiation... possible longer time due to image creation or something)

Hello. I have a strange issue with peers. Sometimes one of channels on one of the peers just like "freeze" and do not respond. The behavior that I noticed:

1. When I send new transaction to orderer, a new block is not committed to the "frozen" channel on the "problem" peer.

2. On "good" peers I see that new blocks are committed.

3. I can't get channel info from "problem" peer container (`peer channel getinfo -c fronzen_channel`). I see just:
```

Does the nodesdk request the first layout automatically when cc instantiation happens? That seems to be true. We do not see a need to send additional service discovery requests for new layouts if the nodes in our test network do not change. Just restarting the nodes would simply use the service discovery to use whatever peers are available.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 16:05:26 GMT):<br/>
> Does the nodesdk request the first layout automatically when cc instantiation happens?
I don't know... 
> We do not see a need to send additional service discovery requests for new layouts if the nodes in our test network do not change. 
It depends on what you want to test, but - if you change the endorsement policy then you might need to do a re-query.
> Just restarting the nodes would simply use the service discovery to use whatever peers are available. 
This is a decision that is yours to make

@rickr +lifecycle will be enabled/disabled via core.yaml using `chaincode.system.+lifecycle: enable`. FYI, just noticed that the configuration parameter was left around from when development started even though the server code was pulled from v1.3 and v1.4. 
</p>

@wlahti  Thx seems I already had that there as you indicated.  I would have thought this enablement would be in the configtx.yaml    Should this work if I've not regenerated the channel config block and peer join transaction since v1.3 release ?

Hi Experts,
I have been using hyperledger fabric with nodejs SDK from past many months now and i haven't faced any big issues but from last week some containers of my network infrastructure kept shutting down which some how i recovered but but i am not able to start the chaincode containers which were automatically generated after installing and instantiating the chaincode. it keep on shuttiing down. and now it says 

"x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "x509: ECDSA verification failure" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "serial:71333524560576167915191865139975345404"

in every containers log
can some body please explain why when ever i run

docker restart dev-peer1.org2.example.com-bel_adhaar-v1

command
containers exites immediately after trying to restart with the above error
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 13 Dec 2018 15:55:48 GMT):<br/>
Correct, +lifecycle is the current name of the new lifecycle. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 13 Dec 2018 15:55:48 GMT):<br/>
Correct, +lifecycle is how we'll continue to refer to the new lifecycle. However, the setting name isn't set in stone.

<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 13 Dec 2018 16:41:27 GMT):<br/>
hey guys, grown a little rusty on my Fabric knowledge so here's an elementary question.  If I instantiate a cc with an `AND` endorsement policy, wouldn't the proposal need to target all of the relevant peers specified in the policy.  And wouldn't this result in a container starting for each of the targeted peers?  Or is `invoke` the only time when the call needs to go to all of the peers in the EP? 
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 13 Dec 2018 16:45:06 GMT):<br/>
The origin of the question is from when I ran through BYFN for the first time in six months or so yesterday.  I did all the manual steps and everything worked until invoke, because the endorsement policy is `"AND ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer')"` and the documentation doesn't explicitly tell you to install the cc on the second org's peer.  Makes sense that invoke doesn't work until the cc is installed, but it appears that instantiate still works without the cc installed.  
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Thu, 13 Dec 2018 16:46:02 GMT):<br/>
I was under the impression that instantiate operated like a normal transaction and that the enumerated endorsement policy would still need to be fulfilled on that operation
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Thu, 13 Dec 2018 17:06:07 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski I haven't looked into it much lately so my knowledge may be outdated on this but I'd guess it's because in Fabric there's an instantiation policy in addition to an endorsement policy. So the instantiation policy could be set to something different from the endorsement policy (or likely not set at all, and I can't remember what the default is), which would allow instantiation to complete successful while invokes would fail.
</p>

was it really by design that files were to have no permision at all it the package ?

why the need for language type in the file name for the package ? It's in the `Chaincode-Package-Metadata.json  ?

<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 16:15:36 GMT):<br/>
I'll have to look into the permissions aspect. As for the naming of the chaincode package, I believe we just did that for easy human readability. 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 16:18:12 GMT):<br/>
Means we'll need to do that for each different language .. just having it as some package name for all languages would be easier for tooling find the actually code package .. the language is in the meta data already. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 16:19:20 GMT):<br/>
I see. We'll take that into consideration as we rebase/refactor.

The pattern `<chaincode-language>-Code-Package.tar.gz` is simply how the peer CLI names the code package file within the chaincode package. There is no name requirement on the server side when installing a chaincode package. We can certainly update the CLI to remove the language from the package name.

Correct, and if it is not a code package payload, the server will return an error.

Regarding the path, on the server side, it needs to be there for each language other than CAR.

In fabric on using couch database as state ledger, how does PEER ensure the complete operation at a ledger transaction is atomic?

Couch database does provide atomic operation at document level however a single endorsement response could have multiple write operation. How does peer recover in case if not all documents are  written to couch database?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 20 Dec 2018 13:42:18 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde updates are committed to couchdb and then a savepoint is written to couchdb. in crash scenario, peer restart will look for the savepoint, and if not there, re-write the last block (writes are idempotent). for full details see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb.go#L568-L574

Hi, I am getting an connection error to peer0 of org when i am trying to invoke even if the proposal is correct. Can anyone help why it is unable to connect?

@akshay.lawange are you 100% sure that the machine you're running the SDK on can access port 7051 on that IP address? you can test this using `ping 10.10.6.16` and `nc 10.10.6.16 7051`. if you're using some kind of cloud hosting, then you may need to open up the ports.

<p><strong>MikeEmery</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 21:49:06 GMT):<br/>
Could someone please verify that the peer chaincode config `deploytimeout` is now defunct (1.4)? Is it fully replaced by `requesttimeout` or is there a different approach I should be taking?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 21:57:13 GMT):<br/>
Addendum to @MikeEmery's question above ... the config files in the cluster example folder and the sampleconfig folder of the 1.4 release branch are not in sync.  Would be nice if the peer config file had a little more structure like the `orderer.yaml` file does.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:14:06 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean? they are both yaml files
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:21:06 GMT):<br/>
 @yacovm  ... I am referring to minor stuff like 
```
    # timeout in millisecs for starting up a container and waiting for Register
    # to come through. 1sec should be plenty for chaincode unit tests
    startuptimeout: 300000

    # timeout in millisecs for invokes and initialize commands
    # this timeout is used by all chaincodes in all the channels including
    # system chaincodes. Default is 30000ms (30 seconds)
    executetimeout: 30000

    #timeout in millisecs for deploying chaincode from a remote repository.
    deploytimeout: 30000
```
in the cluster config core.yaml file which is quite out of date.  The sampleconfig/core.yaml seems to be the most current.
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:21:55 GMT):<br/>
deploytimeout was removed sometime in early 2017 based on this commit : https://github.com/FigureTechnologies/fabric/commit/dff87f934df4e67b20fbe61b038c2b24b218380c
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:22:32 GMT):<br/>
I understand, but what do you mean by structure?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:22:35 GMT):<br/>
These files would probably stay cleaner and more current if they were validated like the orderer.yaml file is... but I certainly understand that there is no shortage of clean up work to do
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:22:47 GMT):<br/>
you mean having defaults, etc. ? 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:22:49 GMT):<br/>
(that validation comment is what I mean about structure)
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:23:15 GMT):<br/>
If I add sections to orderer.yaml file that are not supported it faults
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:23:19 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:23:25 GMT):<br/>
oh... i see now
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:23:35 GMT):<br/>
you want the peer parsing to be fail-fast like the orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:23:55 GMT):<br/>
That is what I was getting at
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:23:59 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't work the other direction though
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:24:03 GMT):<br/>
(and a pony too since I am so needy)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:24:07 GMT):<br/>
if we *add* a value it doesn't fail
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:24:31 GMT):<br/>
what size do you want the pony?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:24:44 GMT):<br/>
I encountered the orderer.yaml validation in the middle of the testing of the new metrics stuff
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:25:02 GMT):<br/>
I had an old config with the new code base ... was bad ... 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:25:19 GMT):<br/>
very helpful at the time once I figured out what was up
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:25:29 GMT):<br/>
you can open a JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:25:42 GMT):<br/>
to ignite a discussion about it
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:25:43 GMT):<br/>
I could ...
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:25:50 GMT):<br/>
if you think it is worth while
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:26:06 GMT):<br/>
I think anything that makes the user's life easier or more productive or safe is worthwhile
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:26:22 GMT):<br/>
you are a user, are you not?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:26:27 GMT):<br/>
so yes :) 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:26:52 GMT):<br/>
eh ... my solution to much of this is to have my fork open and review the code base when I have questions ...
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:26:59 GMT):<br/>
I wouldn't expect that to be normal
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:27:13 GMT):<br/>
even if effective
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:27:28 GMT):<br/>
wouldn't expect what to be normal? reviewing the code?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:28:08 GMT):<br/>
yes ... tracing out usage of config file parameters in the code base when there are differences between the examples and the sample config file to determine which is the current correct approach
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:28:24 GMT):<br/>
that is probably a step farther than most users go
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:28:32 GMT):<br/>
why did you use the cluster file in the 1st place?
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:28:33 GMT):<br/>
given the many questions that appear here
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:29:03 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart what are we going to do about the cluster sample? it's outdated.... 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:29:10 GMT):<br/>
I didn't use it ... I saw a reference to a config parameter in our old stuff that wasn't in the current sample ... searched and found it only occurred in a unit test and the example cluster
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:30:39 GMT):<br/>
anyway I am sorry for your inconvenience and loss of time debugging fabric :) 
you are right that it shouldn't be that way... are you using though v1.4 or master branch? 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:31:33 GMT):<br/>
minor points overall ... I am working on a 1.4 release branch based update to our environments
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:32:45 GMT):<br/>
looking forward to statsd and updated logging improvements ... I'm expecting a much nicer experience in production with those updates.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:36:02 GMT):<br/>
all right. anyway - you can always (apart from debugging the code yourself, which is actually not a bad solution)- ask in rocket chat , open a JIRA, or send an email to the mailing list 
</p>
<p><strong>iramiller</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:36:29 GMT):<br/>
:thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:37:34 GMT):<br/>
and, just as an "action item" - @dave.enyeart I think we should either remove or update the cluster examples as people use it and get burned... 
</p>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 22:51:32 GMT):<br/>

hey all, looking for some help reconfiguring the peer docker contain in the byfn example. i'm using a custom chaincode which i have successfully deployed on fabric 1.1 and 1.2. i've skipped 1.3 and am now integrating 1.4. when i go to install the chaincode, i receive the following error in my client: `Error: 8 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: grpc: received message larger than max (133963831 vs. 104857600)`

i've looked through the docs and i've seen i can update env vars for the peer in `peer-base.yml` and I'm assuming I can just set a var of `GRPC_MAX_RECEIVE_SIZE=-1`?

@toddinpal : state-based endorsement is just a way to express an endorsement policy at the level of an individual ledger key. Without this feature, it is far more complicated to handle a ledger namespace with a more diverse security model that can't be expressed by a single, global policy

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=X9zvoo5JErDgo2JCG) so i've found where the limit of 104857600 comes from. fabric/core/comm/config.go line 23 has a default config var set: `MaxRecvMsgSize = 100 * 1024 * 1024`. still trying to figure out how to override the config for both the binary and docker container.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 15:19:32 GMT):<br/>
@aso I understand the change in granularity.  What I don't understand is when might this be useful and how it relates to security?  I've always viewed endorsement policies as a matter of trust and not security.  As well, now chaincode has to have specific knowledge about these trust arrangements whereas with the normal endorsement policy mechanism the chaincode is (or at least can be) completely ignorant of the trust issues as they are handled outside the chaincode in a declarative manner.
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 15:26:17 GMT):<br/>
this (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.4/interest_rate_swaps) is an example in which state-based endorsement is useful. In general, state-based endorsement is applicable whenever a chaincode-wide endorsement policy cannot assure the integrity and correctness of the entirety of the chaincode state.
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 15:26:57 GMT):<br/>

The fabric network is running correctly, but when I try to restart to peer, the chaincode doesn't work anymore. I know that the dev containers gets put down and then restarted together with the peer container. But it doesn't work anymore. When I try to invoke a function. That function is not found anymore, so I'm getting a time-out every time. Can someone help me with this problem?

Hey Gurus! I understand that the Kafka mechanism ensures transactions are stored in logical order. However is there a way to reference the transactions in chronological order, since transactions may not arrive in order due to network latency?

@dave.enyeart @yacovm hi, i'm confusing that seems fabric try to implement a raft-based ordering service then move on to BFT-based ordering service, but as i know, the consensus of fabric is based on a transaction flow and the ordering service can't altered any transaction on it's own, why fabric care the consensus between the orderer nodes?
even the BFT-based ordering service is delivered, i can't tell what's the different between Kaffka-based ordering service, even worse the BFT-based ordering service might slower in ordering.

hey! have been installing chaincode happily for a while now,. but have just setup a new network...

When i try to instantiate a chaincode from the cli container, with the command:
peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer0.company:7050 -C messagebus -n nodecode -l "golang" -v 4.0 -c '{"Args":[""]}' -P "OR ('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')"

i get this error: 
API error (500): Could not attach to network company-new_net: rpc error: code = NotFound desc = network company-new_net not found

My question is where is company-new_net coming from? The peer is connected to a network called node_node.
I have run a network called company_new_net previously; but have since changed all instances within the configuration files. So i am wondering how the chaincode script is picking that name up. Hope you can help!
</p>
<p><strong>adamhardie</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 09:34:49 GMT):<br/>
i have tried removing all volumes, images, networks and services and starting from scratch, but no luck
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 10:12:57 GMT):<br/>
@kelvinzhong The benefit of going to Raft is that it removes the Kafka dependency. The benefit of eventual BFT is that ordering can be run by a group of non-trusting organizations. See some discussion of this at https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric/message/5295. If you want to drill deep I'll refer you to #fabric-orderer where the ordering service experts hang out.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 10:19:58 GMT):<br/>
Right, and to add to what Dave said - Raft work actually entails 2 independent parts: 
- The Raft consensus core itself, which uses the etcd/raft library and translates its input/output to Fabric language
- Communication and replication support for orderers that have leader based consensus, that is independent of consensus type and can be re-used for BFT as well 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 10:20:41 GMT):<br/>
So in a way - a considerable of work put into Raft orderer is going to be reused 
</p>
<p><strong>adamhardie</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 16:28:21 GMT):<br/>
i have also restarted docker completely and i still get this strange network name! only when instantiating the chaincode do i see that name!

<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 04:49:17 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm @dave.enyeart thx for the reply, i can see the benefit of raft / BFT, but somehow the idea of consensus between the orderers might have misleading many people that make them believed the consensus of orderer is equal to the consensus of the fabric, even worse they believe the Crash Fault Tolerence(CFT) offered by kaffa is the consensus of fabric. I think it's better to point out kaffka/raft/BFT have nothing to do with the consensus of fabric in the introduction of fabric :joy:
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 04:57:43 GMT):<br/>
my point is, as I know fabric v0.6 is using orderer to achieve the consensus, and indeed using BFT as the consensus method, but v1.X or v2.X is not, which is using a transaction flow the achieve the consensus, but still many people(as I know in china) believe the consensus of v1.X or v2.X is also based on orderer to achieve the consensus, even the first time when i found the raft/bft orderer service is going to provide in 2.X, I was quite confused about the definition of the consensus of fabric.

and all the peer which are given in endrosment policy get exited
and strange is that when I use curl this invoke transaction successful , I am getting this only when I use any web UI to invoke the same transact

hi all
what is the recommended expiration time for the certificates for peers and orderers? is it a good practice to leave expiry time 1 year and re-enroll them before they expire?

hey all, when I try to instantiate chaincode, i see this printed: 

Error: could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg timeout expired while starting chaincode ccode:1.0 for transaction
 
seems some error when creating the peer container . in peer logs i can see the chaincode container being created, then.. 
"stopping due to error while launching: timeout expired while starting chaincode ccode:1.0 for transaction" logged here too, with a stack trace 
</p>
<p><strong>adamhardie</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 14:13:03 GMT):<br/>
the stacktrace shows 
2019-01-25 16:49:06.180 UTC [endorser] SimulateProposal -> ERRO 7a4 [messagebus][b5e77bba] failed to invoke chaincode name:"lscc" , error: timeout expired while starting chaincode ccode:1.0 for transaction

@knagware9 it seems you are trying to access null pointer in your chaincode

This is not related to Hyperledger this is totally related to your chaincode

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=7MCihwzOaXSbHlPCfG) @pankajcheema Hey @pankajcheema thanks for the reply. 
On my first question, i solved the problem (about the unknown network name) . It was a mistake on my part that was in one of the docker files. 

my current issue however seems to be peer-container related. - when instantiating chaincode..
2019-01-25 16:49:06.180 UTC [endorser] SimulateProposal -> ERRO 7a4 [messagebus][b5e77bba] failed to invoke chaincode name:"lscc" , error: timeout expired while starting chaincode ccode:1.0 for transaction

i am not based on fabric-samples anymore 
</p>
<p><strong>adamhardie</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 11:21:10 GMT):<br/>
i have the whole network running on docker swarm with kafka, chaincode deployment is the final piece to complete!

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=FRaWg3LpxijrmYXdZ) My fault ,Issue is resolved now. Invoke function was missing one chaincode variable And that is the reason chaincode container were failing but there should be proper error message instead of exit the container.

<p><strong>adamhardie</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 10:45:53 GMT):<br/>
what is the purpose of CORE_PEER_NETWORKID on the peer environment? 
</p>
<p><strong>jeffgarratt</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 14:12:15 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=PkJvBig2TnyDiovwf) @adamhardie It is used to create a naming context (scope) for the peer for its subsequent container control (i.e. naming the containers for chaincode isolation).
</p>

awesome, thanks for the info!

Hi @yacovm 
There is a case: I have a running network with one channel, three peers joined this channel. No one of them is an anchor peer. Is it possible to turn one of them into an anchor peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 03 Feb 2019 08:27:15 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Sun, 03 Feb 2019 21:33:38 GMT):<br/>
To do so, an update channel configuration transaction should be issued, shouldn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 03 Feb 2019 23:38:39 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>

Hello, I have a Fabric Org with *3 Peer* connected to *mychannel*. Each peer is connected to it's own Couchdb instance. Peer0 has the chaincode installed, and when I execute a query, the state is updated in *CouchDB0*. I can see a gossip message to the other peer like so `2019-02-06 08:53:57.457 UTC [blocksProvider] DeliverBlocks -> DEBU 4f2b4 [mychannel] Gossiping block [3], peers number [2]`, but *CouchDB1 and CouchDB2* do *not* have any information about the state. Is this normal behaviour or have I configured something wrong ?

@gaijinviki peer ensures commit in couchdb before moving on to next block, the committed data will be visible in UI. Capture peer debug and look at the `couchdb` debug statements to see exactly what is going on.

@gaijinviki The debug says document 1_1_1 got committed to CouchDB. It will be there. Maybe the UI is not pointing to the db that you think it is. Or perhaps there is some glitch in the CouchDB UI...try using curl.

@knagware9 there isn't one. Not in `couchdb1` atleast. That is what I am trying to figure out why. `couchdb0` has the database and the records.

@dave.enyeart I have 6 orgs and 12 peers and the endorsement policy is to get the signature of each member of each orgs. I'm sending 12 proposal thru all peers and receiving  the signature of each and then Ithe sending the transaction and it happen successfully but once I'm checking the state db ( couchdb  for all 12 peers there is the db name like my chaincode name but there is not data in any collection but once the endorsmnet policy is for only one org I can see the stat on the specific state db )

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 19:08:25 GMT):<br/>
@plato First check if peer log has any errors or warnings.  If not, then you must enable debug to see what is going on during block commit timeframe:

At present, there is a need to design an Org, and specify the Org peer to implement a special endorsement function, such as the deduction in the billing function in the process of endorsement, and the deduction information need to be on the chain.  I know that the fabric supports the plugin way to modify the endorsement smart contract. Can fabric support and  achieve such a function?

I am trying to build a fabric-peer that uses Golang1.11.1, by the following two approaches:
1. replace the Go in `hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:s390x-0.4.14` with Go 1.11.1, commit such change to a new fabric-baseimage, then build the fabric-peer using the updated fabric-baseimage
2. change the command in fabric-baseimage/scripts/common/setup.sh to use Go 1.11.1, rebuild the fabric-baseimage, and then build the fabric-peer using the updated fabric-baseimage.

However, when running the experiments, both approaches ended up with the same same error:

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=paGAsmiXphSBsQ359) @jyellick , I read an answer from you on a similar problem:
"This error indicates that the certificate you are signing with was not appropriately issued by any of the CAs that the orderer is aware of.  Did you set the CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH to point to an orderer certificate before executing the fetch command?  For example, in the first-network example, you can see it is set to:

CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/users/Admin@.../msp"

What exactly do you mean with an orderer certificate? The signcert of an orderer node, or one of the admincerts of the orderer's msp, or one of the admincerts from the organization's MSPs in the system channel genesis block?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=GzrSEhC8hM6xqsahY) Could it be because in the profile for the system channel genesis block, we included an application section? Should we remove this?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Thu, 07 Mar 2019 20:06:21 GMT):<br/>
@braduf We discourage including an application section in the orderer system channel.  It sounds like your config update is attempting to modify that section without the appropriate signatures.

Are we using the wrong msp on the CLI? We are using the msp of an identity that is included in the admincerts of our org and so that is known in the genesisblock...

Are we using the wrong msp on the CLI? We are using the msp of an identity that is included in the admincerts of our org and so that is known in the genesisblock...
In the byfn sample they use one and the same Admin identity for all admincerts and also as the CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH on the CLI. We have different identities as admincerts on the localMSPs of the orderer and peer, is that a problem? (so we have 3 identities in the admincerts for our MSP of the system channel, and then we have another peeradmin and ordereradmin in the admincerts of the localMSPs of the peer and orderer respectively).
Another possible reason I am thinking about is if it has something to do with MAJORITY Admins policies, while we are just trying to create the channel with one admin...could it be that?
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Thu, 07 Mar 2019 20:49:23 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=ACJaQfqQpARLEf54r) We changed MAJORITY Admins to ANY Admins in all the policies just to check if the problem was there, but still gives the same error about sub-policies that were not satisfied. So removing application section and changing MAJORITY for ANY didn't work

Hello all, I am running a hyperledger network with 3 peer nodes and 2 kafka based orderers. All components are running on separate VMs, connected by a docker swarm network.
I am doing a test to put data into the hyperledger network via `Hyperledger Java SDK`. The test is putting about `10 million records` at `500TPS`, so it is a long running test (about 5-6 hours).

After a few hours of the test running, my `anchor peer` panics and crashes.

Hi all
I have a question regarding endorsement policies

<p><strong>adamhardie</strong> (Wed, 20 Mar 2019 10:33:03 GMT):<br/>

So we are having an issue with chaincode and peer endorsement. Lets keep it simple - 2 orgs, 2 peers each. Or endorsement policy Org1 or Org 2. Channel between orgs.
It goes something like this:
We try to install and instantiate new chaincode at a specific version - say 1.0 not he mutual channel. 
It fails due to the timeout issue i listed about 7 posts up. 

We restart the peer that it fails on and reinstall same chaincode at a different version - say 1.01 or something. No changes, just a restart. All storage is outside of the containers in NFS.
This reports that it went in just fine.
But there's a problem.

Now the proposal responses from the two peers are coming back inconsistent. They both come back with an OK return code, but the payload differs slightly. Which means the Tx won't commit.
1. Why?
2. Nothing - and I mean nothing, from installing chaincode again to bouncing the whole network to deleting the ledger and couched storage for this peer fixes it. Is there something we can do that we missed?

We've hit this twice now. Twice we had to reconstitute the entire network.

1.2.0

so about the chaincode not instantiating

https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L420
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:17:47 GMT):<br/>
put this to true and try again
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:20:08 GMT):<br/>
I guess that'll resolve to `CORE_PEER_VM_ATTACHSTDOUT`? 
I just spent two hours reconstituting this thing so I'm not doing it now. I'll do it if it fails again - right now we have someone replaying Tx through it to reconstitute.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:20:16 GMT):<br/>
yes. and - and you can't install a chaincode with different version
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:20:19 GMT):<br/>
it should not work
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:20:32 GMT):<br/>
the chaincode version has to match the one instantiated

<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:20:40 GMT):<br/>

ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:21:54 GMT):<br/>
so after the upgrade do both peers have the 1.0.1 version?
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:22:09 GMT):<br/>
Yes.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:22:23 GMT):<br/>
hmm and they are inconsistent... weird, but you can look what is different no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:22:26 GMT):<br/>
compare the results
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:23:00 GMT):<br/>
4 extra bytes of 0x0 on the end 
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:23:08 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise identical.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:23:16 GMT):<br/>
oh... hmmm... interesting. do you know in what field?
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:23:32 GMT):<br/>
No it's a byte array at that point.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:23:52 GMT):<br/>
it's a proposal response protobuf message no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:24:02 GMT):<br/>
so you can unmarshal it recursively
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:26:23 GMT):<br/>
By time I get to it it's where it fails in the SDK. I could intercept when I get the proposal response, but I don't have a sample right now. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:26:46 GMT):<br/>
yeah you can also do that too
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:28:27 GMT):<br/>

My best intercept point gives me something like this when I get the responses back, before I submit them to the SDK to go to the orderer:
```

```

Is that sufficient to tell what's messing it up or is there a way - which I can't readily see in the SDK code - to further break down the payload? 
This one is on my local instance and it worked, I'm asking to make sure if this happens again I capture enough detail to figure out what's going wrong.

@aatkddny no it's not enough... if you want you can just capture both outputs to files and send them to me and i can look whenever i have time

Hi all. I have a question regarding the `validatorPoolSize` property for peers: should I override this property? if yes, what is a recommended value for it?
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 09:18:26 GMT):<br/>
hello @yacovm 
is there any guide on how to enable parallel `vscc` for a single channel? does parallel `vscc` depend on the value of `validatorPoolSize`?
in my case, every peer has single vCPU and according to the documentation, `validatorPoolSize` will be `1`, right?
thanks in advance 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 09:40:01 GMT):<br/>
it's always parallel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 09:40:29 GMT):<br/>
why do you only have a single CPU in a peer?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 09:40:33 GMT):<br/>
that's very low
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 10:03:55 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm we have low resources on a dev environment and currently I'm updating the environment for peers and adding more resources for them
and there is one more question: according to this report https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11390.pdf peers serve requests for several channels. is it recommended to have shared peers (for example 6 peers that are joined to 4 channels and serve requests for 4 channels) or have isolated peers (for example we have 8 peers, two peers per channel)?

Hi, I have tried to run ./byfn.sh of first-network, it went well, however, right after it finished the right, I go to the cli (Fabric-tools) container, and like to execute "peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{"Args":["query","a"]}'" again with CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID, CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE, CORE_PEER_ADDRESS, CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH have been set. 
The result has error:
Error: endorsement failure during query. response: status:500 message:"cannot retrieve package for chaincode mycc/1.0, error open /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/mycc.1.0: no such file or directory"
Could anyone help? thanks!

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=8nwYccKpdhDxJLygW) @stephenman looks like the "install" needs to be performed and verified, or you need to verify you are supplying the correct name and version for chaincode.

Hi team, when I am using node SDK to updateChannel, I have got error like this : ` result: { status: 'BAD_REQUEST',
info: 'error authorizing update: unexpected EOF' } `
is there anything I can refer to? I have followed the test in `fabric-samples/fabric-sdk-node/test/integration/configtxlator.js` , nearlly the same, but it won't work at the last step 'client.updateChannel(request)', I have got the data used to update, and the signatures of OrdererAdmin, Org1Admin. I am using the `fabric-samples/basic-network` to test and no TLS

Hi all
what resources should be allocated for kafka and orderer nodes for not being a bottleneck if we speak about performance?
Because in our app we've run 4 peers (every node has 16 GB RAM, 8 vCPU). commit time and validateTx time take from 5 to 20 ms in average so that means that peers are doing well, but performance is poor
if I set (in JMeter) constant throughput timer to 300 TPS and 100 threads, the actual TPS is ~50-60. and after 3-5 minutes,  transactions start failing
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 10:41:26 GMT):<br/>
Block timeout in this case is 1s and max-message-count had different values (5, 10, 30, 50, 100). the best performance was when the max-message-count was 5

hi @yacovm 
could you please explain how to set kafka version for orderer correctly?
because it is not very clear from the documentation.
in our case fabric version is 1.4.0. is this `ORDERER_KAFKA_VERSION: 1.0.0` property correct?
thanks in advance
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 12:54:39 GMT):<br/>
you can put any kafka version you want.... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 12:54:43 GMT):<br/>
doesn't depend on the fabric version
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 12:55:11 GMT):<br/>
what the kafka version in the `orderer.yaml` does is simply pass it to the kafka client library
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 12:57:02 GMT):<br/>
I see
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 12:58:24 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm 
initially I thought that this version might be somehow connected to these warning that orderers spam after the network restart

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 13:10:53 GMT):<br/>
it is only related because you probably can't connect to kafka
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 13:10:57 GMT):<br/>
because of a wrong version
</p>
<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 13:18:32 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm wrong version of kafka passed to the client library? how to know which version should be passed?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 13:20:18 GMT):<br/>
you check the kafka version....
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 13:20:28 GMT):<br/>
you do know the version of kafka you use, right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 13:20:39 GMT):<br/>
but honestly Raft is out... why not use it instead of Kafka? :)

@gravity eventually yes, but it will take downtime
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:58:29 GMT):<br/>
i really suggest to you to just start use Raft
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:58:36 GMT):<br/>
and not Kafka
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:58:52 GMT):<br/>
i think it's very stable :)

<p><strong>gravity</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 08:05:33 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm does raft have better performance compared to kafka?
also, as I see in the documentation, it works only when TLS is enabled, doesn't it?

My peer is a container running a fabric-peer image on an AWS EC2 machine with TLS enabled. The CouchDB for the world state is running on the same EC2 machine and there seems to be no problems between the peer and the CouchDB. But it seems between the chaincode containers and the peer there is a connection problem, but I can't figure out what it is...

hello, Q:  During a single endorsement request processing by chaincode, if there is sequence of  Shim GetState  -> PutState -> GetState, will the 3rd GetState call have the data as 1st GetState (original) or 2nd PutState (modified)?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=pq7QXHti9uut3BQrr) @yacovm Thanks - so it is the 1st GetState (original) value stored in the ledger irrespective of PutState or DeleteState called on the same key in the same endorsement request.

When a transaction's r/w set is sent to committing peers, how do peers perform MVCC verification? Do they check if the values from read set and current values in state db are equal or not or do they verify by any unique id? If they check from the read set, what happens when a transaction's read set is very large?

Hi all, I'm trying to use node SDK to query chaincode, however, it throws the error: *[Remote.js]: Error: Failed to connect before the deadline URL:grpcs://localhost:7051*

I'm trying to instantiate chaincode by SDK

<p><strong>KartikChauhan</strong> (Thu, 25 Apr 2019 12:52:53 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to get status of a transaction by using node.js sdk. I know about `queryTransaction` method which returns the transaction data and in it, I can find transaction response. But its limitation is that it only returns response `200` if the transaction gets succeeded or _Failed to get transaction_ message if the transaction is invalid or hasn't mined yet.

`queryTransaction` method queries ledger data present on the peers and then gives a binary response. But what if I want to know a transaction is in process or not? How can I get the response _pending_ if a transaction id is valid but hasn't mined yet? 

I found this stackoverflow question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51163023/hyperledger-transaction-mempool which is somewhat related to my question. Is it even possible to do that in Hyperledger Fabric or not?

Hi experts, I have setup a fabric cluster on kubernetes using helm charts. I could join the peers to a channel and install chaincode on it. However when I 'm instantiating the chaincode, I am not getting any error the chaincode container also starts successfully on the peer node but it's not registering himself with the peer container somehow. So when I do peer chaincode list --instantiated -C mychannel... I don't see anything. Am I missing some env here?

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 16:06:28 GMT):<br/>
not sure how you set things up, but you have to make sure that peer and chaincode containers can reach each other,
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 16:07:09 GMT):<br/>
check your dns entries and see if you can ping from one to another.

<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 09:39:42 GMT):<br/>
@tongli thanks. The DNS and networking was fine between the containers. It was a configtx issue with incorrect orderer endpoint.

Hi experts, we have two identical peers mounted on a Kubernets env. The only thing that differ between both peers are certificates. When we try to invoke a transaction on peer1 we get the following errror: Error: endorsement failure during invoke. chaincode result: <nil> while on the peer2 we get a success transaction. Query transaction work on both peer

Guys l have a little issue with CC endorsement. Every time that we add a new organisation to the network we need to reinstall and reinstantiate the CC, in order to accept new transactions .
We are instantiating with NO endorsement policy . As far as documentation says it should by Any Org can endorse. But looks that it just is true for Orgs already in the network and not new ones. So anyone knows what policy should we use? Can use meta policy’s? Such a Any Members?
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 07:38:12 GMT):<br/>
you can try service discovery , it will help to find endorsment policy of the network and send the transanctions to the endorser

Hi Kartik, per my knowledge there is no concept of mining in fabric. Create transaction is based on proposal response from the endorsing peers. If all the the response are same then it gets to ordering state and eventually to committer state. For query you can query from your your respective peer. If you want to check response from all peers then you have to query from all peers.

Hi, so I have 1 orderer 3 peers (`peer0.org1.com`, `peer1.org1.com`, and `peer0.org2.com`) and I have problem with the endorsement policy. In the `crypto-config.yaml` I enable `EnableNodeOUs: true` for all of the `OrdererOrgs` and `PeerOrgs` member
My chaincode structure is similar with https://github.com/IBM/car-auction-network-fabric-node-sdk/blob/master/chaincode/carauction.js with seperate `Init(stub)` and `initLedger(stub, args)`. After I install the chaincode to all peers, I instantiate my chaincode on `peer0.org1.com` with:
```
peer chaincode instantiate -C $CC_CHANNEL_ID -n $CC_NAME -v $CC_VERSION -c '{"Args":[""]}' -l node -P "AND ('Org1.peer','Org2.peer')"
sleep 5s
peer chaincode invoke -C $CC_CHANNEL_ID -n $CC_NAME -c '{"Args":["initLedger","a","100","b","200"]}'
```
The command run without error:
```
2019-06-27 07:08:22.466 UTC [chaincodeCmd] InitCmdFactory -> INFO 003 Retrieved channel (airline-channel) orderer endpoint: SO.ME.I.P:7050

```

But when I run `peer chaincode query -C $CC_CHANNEL_ID -n $CC_NAME -c '{"Args":["query","a"]}'` on `peer0.org1.com`, it returns:
```
Error: endorsement failure during query. response: status:500 message:"transaction returned with failure: Error: Failed to get state for a"
```

what cause the endorsement failure?

I'm running a Fabric 1.4.1 network with one peer and one orderer. I'm using Prometheus to monitor them. The targets are up and Prometheus is able to scrape the metrics. But I think I'm not getting all the metrics that are listed on https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metrics_reference.html
Plus many of the metrics names look different than the ones mentioned in the list. This probably could be because the documentation is of version 1.4 and I'm running a network of 1.4.1. Just want to confirm if this is the sole reason or if there could be any other reason as well.

@KartikChauhan if the new organization is added into the ordering service configuration (not just the configuration of an existing channel), then that new organization can also create channels
</p>
<p><strong>KartikChauhan</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 16:32:29 GMT):<br/>
Can we do that without stopping and restarting our orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 16:33:29 GMT):<br/>
yes - you need to edit the config of the orderer system channel (badly named testchainid in v1.4)

</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:34:03 GMT):<br/>
There are two things you need to do.
I'm going to answer the second one because I think that's the question you are asking here.

The first is to add the new org into the system channel. There's instructions on how to do that all over the place, but the trick is to use the crypto from an orderer to sign the channel update.

The second is the same as creating a channel when you initialize the network - you need to create a profile insane ide a configtx.yaml file and then run configtxgen to create a channel genesis block (and possibly anchor peer updates). 

configtxgen doesn't seem to mind too much if you append channel profiles to configtx.yaml and rerun it - we do it all the time. 

If the org is new iirc you need to also add the org definition into the `Organizations` piece of configtx.yaml too. I'm being vague because I automated it all and I don't feel like tracing through the code.

Hello. Sometimes peers just freeze and doesn't react on any interaction  (send proposal, subscribe  to channel blocks). Only restart on container helps. Here you can find logs output of one of the peer: https://pastebin.com/e4uC5cB2. Other peers work fine. Grps error message continue to  emerge infinitely until I restart  container:
```

You have a network misconfiguration, or the peer changed its certificate.

Thanks for reply but how can i change this PKI ID to exact peer
</p>
<p><strong>Utsav_Solanki</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 11:40:58 GMT):<br/>
because as i compared [ expected key and PKI ID key with my peers ca, tls, msp in located directory but no mach found ]

just don't change the certificate

Hi all! I faced surprising bug, maybe will be useful for somebody. Peers reject signatures of identities with type  of `client` and with affiliation also `client`. In certificate it looks like this:  `OU=client+OU=client`. I have no idea what is the resason of the bug, but everything starts working as expected when I change affiliation.
Error messages from peers don't contain any unusual comments:

In CouchDB the order is going lexically , is it the default behavior or we can have any sorting order like numerical order - ascending based on key?

Getting a lot of these. Network allows me to create channels and install and instantiate chaincode, so it can't be too badly messed up.
Are they expected or a symptom that something - I'd guess gossip between peers - isn't working correctly.

CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE  -- docker supports multiple types of networking. This var is used for the type of networking that you intend to use -- host, bridge, ipvlan, none. 
You can check this link for this value - https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.con.doc/q131010_.htm

Thank you @soumyanayak but, as I am not using docker swarm, and have cli and peer on different hosts, I just want to iuse their IPs to communicate. I get connection refused, error while dialing on CLI and, context deadline exceeded error on peer2 while joining a channel. I think the error is not due to any networking problem. Could you shed some more light on this? 
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Fri, 16 Aug 2019 21:26:24 GMT):<br/>
Indrajit , i am also not using the docker swarm, instead i am using something as  "network_mode" = host in docker compose file. so from your CLI host machine just run the command nc -vz <peer host IP>  7051 --- see if its connecting? If not then the ports are not exposed. If connecting then try running the same above command again from the cli docker container

2019-08-20 10:23:30.894 UTC [core.comm] ServerHandshake -> ERRO 5d7 TLS handshake failed with error tls: failed to verify client's certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority server=Orderer remoteaddress=10.0.0.4:32788

Easy enough to understand, however I have followed the examples.. Its hard to know where I went wrong. My channel creation is as follows: 

docker exec $PEER_NAME peer channel create -o orderer0.company:7050 --tls --cafile /etc/hyperledger/fabric/ordererCerts/tlsca.company-cert.pem -c messagebus -f /etc/hyperledger/configtx/channel.tx --keyfile /etc/hyperledger/msp/users/Admin\@company/tls/client.key --certfile /etc/hyperledger/msp/users/Admin\@company/tls/client.crt --clientauth

Thank you Soumya! it makes sense to me now. But I have one more doubt. For CLI containers when peers of an organisation are on different networks, which port do we need to expose? I still quite don't get the environement variable we provide in CLI docker-compose file. we provide CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1-org2:7051 fin CLI. Can you please explain me a bit more on this? 
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 11:29:01 GMT):<br/>
in my case the CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=<IP-ADDR>:7051 and 7051 is what you expose in ports.
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 11:32:38 GMT):<br/>
Okay, but the same port was also used by a peer on the same host and I have a second peer running on another host.  Now the peer and the cli on the same host wouldn't it create any port conflict?  Sorry for the repeated questions.
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 11:35:20 GMT):<br/>
you should give a different one like 8051 

under ports section 
peer 1 --> 7050
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 11:35:23 GMT):<br/>
HOST:CONTAINER
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 11:35:33 GMT):<br/>
7050:7050 -- peer1
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 11:35:53 GMT):<br/>
8050:7050 -- peer2
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 11:36:18 GMT):<br/>
in the same machine you have to change the ports
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 11:37:42 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, my doubt was as we use the same peer address for both cli and peer  I am confused whether to use same port for both peer and cli on the same host or not. 
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 21:53:13 GMT):<br/>
Soumyanayak, I have found the solution. Thank you!

Hi all, I am using fabric 1.3.0, it works fine. However, sometime when a bigger transaction comes in (transaction json contains 2000-3000 json) it disconnects from peer and say `no ledger context`. Below is the error capture in peer0 of a node, which says invalid transaction but in fact it is not. Can someone help with this? its urgent. Thanks.

<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 12:50:19 GMT):<br/>
`no ledger context` means that the chaincode is still running and trying to interact with the world state/ledger, but the peer has given up on the transaction. this can happen if the chaincode takes too long to run and the peer times the transaction out, or if the chaincode launches processing in other threads that it doesn't wait for.
</p>
<p><strong>akshay.lawange</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 16:04:10 GMT):<br/>
ok..thanks @sstone1 . So do we have to increase the transaction time in core.yaml? 
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 13:34:09 GMT):<br/>
So we just started a new channel. First Tx update didn't go so well. 

We can read it what we added. 
So that triggers the code to try an update (rather than an add).

When we do that we get a "Not enough endorsers" error where one (of multiple) returns with "Item not found".
Looking at the peer you can see this - `response status 500 for txid: 2d4f4a2c82b4785917b9822295296d3778b1072847ab9d81b687dd8b7daaffb1`

I'm guessing this means the CC failed to instantiate in time, but the logs aren't showing a failure message.
*So my question is how do I fix this?* Reinstall the CC? Restart the peers?

Also I'm seeing a lot of these:
```

```

I have multiple orgs inside this cluster. The SAN for all of them is set to be the node names, which allows me to bring them up and instantiate chaincode. 
Not sure why it's failing here - is there some easy way to tell what it doesn't like in the cert?

Back to the tls filed to dial problem. 
This is the peer trying to talk start communications across multiple orgs. 
Is there anything that describes the correct way to do this? I'm guessing I need to provide it a cert from the server it's trying to talk to somehow? 
But I'm really really guessing here...

Or is this expected and I just ignore it. It still seems to all work.

[this method](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/d9b0ac2c38fc6ce9384a29dc35d6724cc65e0f51/core/common/validation/statebased/validator_keylevel.go#L184-L194) is not entirely clear to me. IIUC, it ultimately builds the `depsByLedgerKeyIDMap` within `validationContext` for a specific block, which can be done *in parallel*. And this method *proactively* builds dependencies for transactions *preceding*(incl.) current `tIdx`. However, the `mutex` there kills the concurrency in _worst case_ (`PreValidate` is called with ascending `txNum`), and profiling shows that this consumes a significant amount of time when a block contains a large number of txs. I wonder why couldn't we build dependencies map in parallel once for all? thx @aso @yacovm 
```
func (klv *KeyLevelValidator) invokeOnce(block *common.Block, txnum uint64) *sync.Once {
	klv.blockDep.mutex.Lock()
	defer klv.blockDep.mutex.Unlock()

	if klv.blockDep.blockNum != block.Header.Number {
		klv.blockDep.blockNum = block.Header.Number
		klv.blockDep.txDepOnce = make([]sync.Once, len(block.Data.Data))
	}

	return &klv.blockDep.txDepOnce[txnum]
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 08:37:37 GMT):<br/>
also, why couldn't we create a new validator per block to avoid state tracking and locks? excessive gc? just trying to understand the rationale here
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 09:51:41 GMT):<br/>
essentially i'm proposing this https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric/+/33366, which is fairly small, doesn't introduce extra locks, but reduces validation time by more than 50%. Of course it's very likely that i'm overlooking something which breaks actually invariants in that area...
</p>

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 08 Sep 2019 20:10:16 GMT):<br/>
There is currently no API call that will allow you to do this ... the only option is to manually edit and remove the ledger files associated with the channel on the peer filesystem.  There is a JIRA open to add a proper API for this
</p>
<p><strong>phantom.assasin</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 11:09:48 GMT):<br/>
Meanwhile one can also remove an org from channel by updating channel configurations
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 11:12:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes ... you can remove an organization from a channel via a config update and at that point peers from that org will no longer get blocks for that channel.

But if you just want one peer from an org to "unjoin" a channel, there's no API for that.
</p>
<p><strong>phantom.assasin</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 11:31:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes. I am removing org as a workaround until the real API is available

1) Installed npm packages in local environment.
2) Compiled my typescript project to js.

Chaincode installed successfully but during instantiation I got the error `Error: could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg chaincode registration failed: container exited with 0`.

I then removed all my ts files and kept only js files and package.json in the folder. Again, the chaincode installed successfully but got the above-mentioned error again during instantiation.

The installation and instantiation of the chaincode is happening on the peer. But when from the tools container i am running the command 
*peer chaincode list –instantiated -C legaldescriptionchannel*

*the chaincode containers are exiting. *
i had installed thrice with different versions and using upgraded using upgrade command but still the above issue lies.

How can I know the role of a peer? I mean how can I know which peer is endorsing and which which one is committing/validating peer in a hyperledger fabric network?

anybody any idea about this issue

This issue is resolved . Actually there was an issue in the configtx.yaml where the allignment of the key - Organization under Application section was not proper it was under the ACLs.

Configtxgen tool generated the genesis file successfully, but that was the issue. So its a advice to everybody . Check the proper spacing and allignment in configtx.yaml before generating the artifacts

Hi, I'm trying to understand endorsements. In the PaperNet trading example, say A sells a stock to B. Both A and B have to agree on the price and accept the trade, and this can be set through endorsements. However it seems like endorsements is done automatically on the back end, instead of, say something pops up on the B user interface and alerts them to press the agree button or something?

actually resolved this issue -- it comes when a config update is done adding anew org .. so Org1 was initially there and later orgA was added .. this issue was gone as per yacovm we can ignore this . it came for once twice and fater sync up with orderer everything ran fine

Hi all, anyone has encountered the following error when instantiating chaincode?  
" Error: could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg chaincode registration failed: container exited with 2 ". I already have the following line for peers, orderers and cli in docker-compose file: GODEBUG=netdns=go .
</p>
<p><strong>indirajith</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 13:17:46 GMT):<br/>
Fixed this. the problem was with docker networking and its mode. Made sure the chaincode container and their peers are on the same docker network, it fixed the error.
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 07:13:08 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Thu, 03 Oct 2019 07:14:26 GMT):<br/>
But one more doubt i had was -  lets say OrgA and OrgB peers have to endorse a transaction --- and OrgA initiates a transaction , so how orgA would be aware of the root certificate file for OrgB?

So when i am installing the chaincode for private data communication and instantiating from one of the orgs - the chaincode shows as instantiated from both the orgs but i could see the docker container of chaincode created only in one org but when checked in another machine for the other org the chaincode container is not getting created.

</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Tue, 15 Oct 2019 11:04:13 GMT):<br/>
Resolved the issue . The chaincode folder structure should be exactly same in both the peers to get the same hash fingerprintID which will create chaincode conatiners for both the org peers
</p>
<p><strong>soumyanayak</strong> (Tue, 15 Oct 2019 13:10:48 GMT):<br/>
When i am installing the private chaincode - i checked in both the peer org machines the IDs of the installed chaincode is same but still the container was only created in the machine from where the instantiate command was run for only one org.
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 16:22:49 GMT):<br/>
so the couchedb instances on two of our peers have got themselves out of synch somehow. 
an asset is missing so one thinks it's an upsert and the other thinks it isn't there. this is causing "issues" as you can imagine.
if i take down the offending peer, delete the ledger and the couchdb storage and bring it back up it's supposed to catch itself back up and self-sync. 
other than reinstalling chaincode is there anything else that needs to be done to get this to work?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 18:17:31 GMT):<br/>
@aatkddny can you somehow help us investigate why it happened?

do you have logs of the peers, perhaps?

they were overwritten when we restarted the peer.
the problem started in event processing we think.
 
there's a bunch of workflow that's non germane to do with the order things can be added, but in essence we add an asset and throw an event that then goes and looks for orphan children and adds references to them to the original asset. i don't work on this part of the application, so this is second hand. 

what we saw was a tx for peer1 passing the proposal and the same for peer0 failing for one org. 
it passed the policy so went to the orderer. there it hung until it timed out. which isn't really a great way to handle things imo, but i digress.

looking inside the logs for peer0 we saw this:

A little google-is-your-friend let to a stackoverflow post about reads on empty strings in couchdb throwing this error - which let to the supposition above. 

As an aside we got round it by taking down peer0, running the same transaction in the channel and starting peer0 after it completed. 
Next time I'll try the rollback though.

Having questions about gossip between peer nodes apperciate for answer.
Following 1.4 code, it seems that gossip leader comparing a fixed id base on peer node's msp. (github.com/hyperledger/fabric@v1.4.3/gossip/election/election.go, NewLeaderElectionService)
So, if we have 5 peer, with msp, the leader will be the one having smallest or biggest ID from msp?
Here is how I tracing the source code.
peer node start  (	peer.Initialize(func(cid string) -> peer.go 	service.GetGossipService().InitializeChannel... )

@RyanMathison you can try to use the discovery CLI https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/discovery-cli.html
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 21:26:48 GMT):<br/>
and query the peer, imitating the SDK 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 21:26:58 GMT):<br/>
and then you can tell me what is the result you get back from the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 21:27:55 GMT):<br/>
in any case what you say is weird, because Noutof(2, '0', '1') is basically an AND 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 21:28:02 GMT):<br/>
which is super basic... it should work
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 21:29:32 GMT):<br/>
make an endorsers query to the peer to ask it and then tell what you get

<p><strong>RyanMathison</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 22:15:46 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Thank you for your help.  It turns out the issue was with the chaincode.  The chaincode we are using has been around a while and apparently had never been had an "AND" policy set on it.  Internally the chaincode was generating an event time and adding it to the write set.  So once we required more than 1 endorsement each peer generated a different write set, there was just no good way to see that it was the issue in the logs. I was able to confirm it was a read/write mismatch in the node app by using channel.compareProposalResponseResults(proposalResponses).  I was also able to find a JIRA issue, https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14145, that pointed me in the write direction and talks about the poor log messages. Thanks again for the help.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 06:23:55 GMT):<br/>
@RyanMathison are you saying the node SDK doesn't compare it automatically ? 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:04:12 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm No the node sdk (and I assume the other sdks as well) don't compare automatically as some consider it a performance impact so not something to be mandatory
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:04:32 GMT):<br/>
how can it impact performance?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:04:37 GMT):<br/>
it's byte by byte comparison!!
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:06:55 GMT):<br/>
It's always been separate, but we used to use it in composer by default but performance analysis showed it having an impact on the client so it got made optional.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:07:25 GMT):<br/>
but it's comparing bytes in memory, it should be at the worst - micro-seconds
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:08:41 GMT):<br/>
I guess the performance tests were putting a lot of load on the client code with many txns and I guess the RW sets where not small
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:09:13 GMT):<br/>
Also node.js is effectively single threaded
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:10:06 GMT):<br/>
if you don't compare the results it means you are sending stuff with the wrong signatures
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:10:21 GMT):<br/>
and there is no way the client will understand that this is the reason
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:11:25 GMT):<br/>
also, most payloads are not large... you should aim to work well in the average case, not in the extreme case ;)

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:11:56 GMT):<br/>
not blaming you, btw
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:12:49 GMT):<br/>
Personally I like the idea of doing checks like this in the client code (plus some other checks such as determining peer disagreements at validation time) but to also make them optional in case of performance issues

@mastersingh24 your opinion ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 09:13:46 GMT):<br/>
The "average" case is the green path not the "bad path" - meaning there is generally  no reason why as long as you collect enough endorsements with a proper setup your transaction(s) will not be valid.

The SDKs have always had the `verifyProposalResponse` method which is heavyweight as it checks signatures, etc.  They also have the `compareProposalResponseResults` which just does the comparison on the results - which is what you are looking for here.

For the lower-level APIs, there's not reason to do this by default; it should be up to the developer to properly compose the API calls they want to use.   I do agree that our samples should include these calls such that users are aware they exist and why/why not they might use them.

When it comes to the higher level programming model, I think we should automatically do the `compareProposalResponseResults`  since we are already wrapping the lower level API
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 09:15:00 GMT):<br/>
why not `compareProposalResponseResults` automatically? 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 09:15:17 GMT):<br/>
As an aside, there is a reason why I intentionally removed the balance transfer sample  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 09:17:28 GMT):<br/>
I am not a fan of all of the hidden stuff we do in the low level API ... the reason for the higher level programming model was to hide all of the complexities ... so this is where we should do things like automatically call `compareProposalResponseResults`
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:01:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone, just wondering how the key-level-endorsement is supposed to be used. Since that the discovery service cannot lookup the required orgs (and their peers) it  seems to be up to the user to call the peers manually. Is that assumption correct?  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:01:56 GMT):<br/>
you can query the chaincode for the organizations of a specific key
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:02:09 GMT):<br/>
and then you can query discovery for  a mapping of org -> peer list
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:02:14 GMT):<br/>
and then deduce who you should contact
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:41:53 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thanks for the fast answer. That means the standard way of chaincode / endorsement lookup via the discovery service cannot be used for key-level-endorsements.
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:43:47 GMT):<br/>
Basically all calls would require a query call first to check if a particular key that would be modified has a key level endorsement policy or not, if not the standard way to parameterize the SDK via the discovery service can be used. Otherwise, the peer endpoints need to be passed into the SDK manually. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 18:27:12 GMT):<br/>
@david_dornseifer are you stating something or asking me something?
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 19:23:15 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  that was just a conclusion how you would handle endorsements for chaincodes that have  a combination of both, key- and chaincode-level endorsement :) . Was that conclusion correct? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 19:24:38 GMT):<br/>
yeah

@yacovm , @davidkel , @mastersingh24 Ok, so after resolving the chaincode issues, with a 4 org network I am now able to use OR and OutOf 1, 2 and 3 policies.  However I am still unable to use OutOf 4 or AND policies as I get the following error, "No endorsement plan available for {"chaincodes":[{"name":"mycc".  Now this makes it sound like anchor peers are not setup, https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/blockchain/howto?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-troubleshooting&locale=zh-TW#ibp-v2-troubleshooting-anchor-peer, however we have setup anchor peers in each organization.  Any idea what the issue may be
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:31:19 GMT):<br/>
perform a peer query and see if it sees peers from other orgs
</p>
<p><strong>RyanMathison</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:52:20 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Well I am logging the configuration returned from service discovery and it shows all 8 peers in the network, 2 per each org
</p>

<p><strong>RyanMathison</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:55:54 GMT):<br/>
All anchor peers show that the chaincode is installed and instantiated

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:56:25 GMT):<br/>
huh? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:56:33 GMT):<br/>
what does that even mean "all anchor peers show it"?
</p>
<p><strong>RyanMathison</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:57:00 GMT):<br/>
In the CLI I ran peer chaincode list --instantiated
</p>
<p><strong>RyanMathison</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:57:14 GMT):<br/>
For each anchor peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:57:25 GMT):<br/>
please do a discovery peer query
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:57:32 GMT):<br/>
it also tells you if the chiancode is installed :( 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:57:36 GMT):<br/>
and on what peers 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:57:49 GMT):<br/>
instead of doing the lousy `peer chaincode list` on several peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:57:54 GMT):<br/>
you can do it on 1 peer only
</p>
<p><strong>RyanMathison</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 23:11:16 GMT):<br/>
I will have to look at it tomorrow, I keep getting failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded
</p>
<p><strong>RyanMathison</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 14:00:57 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm So the results from discovery show that there are 8 peers in the network, 2 from each org, and they all have the mycc chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 14:10:24 GMT):<br/>
@RyanMathison - so it should work.... can you try an endorsement query and tell me what is logged in the peers?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 14:11:12 GMT):<br/>
use the discover CLI, not the SDK
</p>
<p><strong>RyanMathison</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 14:40:03 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I get server returned: failed constructing descriptor for chaincodes:<name:"mycc" >
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 14:42:02 GMT):<br/>
What is the chaincore version installed on all peers? Is it thr same?
</p>
<p><strong>RyanMathison</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 14:43:51 GMT):<br/>
All are version 1.0 and we have chaincode installs scripted so that every peer gets the exact same chaincode and version installed
</p>
<p><strong>RyanMathison</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 16:11:53 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I finally got the right debugging level turned on in the peers and found that it was caused by an issue in one of our configuration files.  Thank you for your help and for introducing me to the discover CLI.  I do have a question about discover CLI. Do you have any idea why the peer commands and discover commands can't use the same configuration?  It seems to me that it is repetitive to define ENV variables for the peer command and a cofig file for the discover command when both are just looking for the certificates to contact a peer.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 17:14:33 GMT):<br/>
@RyanMathison i wrote the discover CLI myself 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 17:14:49 GMT):<br/>
Because the peer CLI is unusable :joy: 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 17:20:44 GMT):<br/>
It has zero code intersection with the peer CLI

Hi all. iit seems like shim packages, peer proto packages and others are moved/ re structured. Is there any plac where I can find these changes? I am trying to run a very very basic chaincode with just two key values(a,b, 20, 100) and stuck with it instantiation failure for a long time. I am using binaries version 1.4.4 and is it necessary to package chaincode?

Hello - need clarification  - @dave.enyeart 
I am trying to understand, the commit to the ledger by peer &  endorsement of proposal are two distinct activities and can execute during the same time period. This is also true if the commit & endorsement are working on the same keys.
 
Say current state of the ledger K1-V1, K2-V1
Commit will move the K1-V2, K2-V2 (fact: world state transaction scope is at the key update level)
Endorsement is received during the same time of commit that uses K1, K2.

Would the peer ensure 
[1]  endorsement happens in a deterministic  way such that endorsement proposal will be executed either on (K1-V1, K2-V1) such that the commit is put on-hold OR (K1-V2, K2-V2) i.e. commit is executed successfully and endorsement is put on-hold OR 
[2] endorsement proposal happens in a non-determinsitic way endorsement & commit can execute in parallel i.e. endorsement RW set could have (K1-V2, K2-V1). 
Thanks.

@rahulhegde [2] is not possible, you are guaranteed that endorsements will be based on a stable snapshot of the data. if the endorsement arrives before the commit starts, you'll get (K1-V1,K2-V1), if the endorsement arrives after commit starts, it will wait until commit is done and will return (K1-V2,K2-V2)
</p>

Hello all. I'm trying to build the peer docker image with HSM support, but I'm getting an error. Here are the steps:
- git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric.git 
- edited `Makefile` to include `GO_TAGS ?= pkcs11`
- edited `images/peer/Dockerfile.in` to add my HSM lib install instructions and ENV vars in peer image
- edited `sampleconfig/core.yaml` to add BCCSP/PKCS11 configs and changed BCCSP/Default to `PKCS11`
- built peer with `make peer-docker`
- tested with `docker run hyperledger/fabric-peer:latest` but get the following error:

- git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric.git
- edited `Makefile` to add `GO_TAGS ?= pkcs11`

- edited images/peer/Dockerfile.in to add my HSM lib install instructions and ENV vars
- generated peer docker image with `make -B peer-docker`

Hello - I am using Fabric v1.4 Peer CLI that allows to collate the endorsement proposal response from multiple peers. Peer CLI has protection which checks for proposal response bytes. Is creating the proposal response bytes deterministic from chaincode  that uses maps as world state (write set), as some properties like iterate over map is not deterministic. Does peer ensure deterministic behavior always?

map iteration in Go isn't deterministic 
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:36:39 GMT):<br/>
Iteration is true and it would be chaincode' responsibility to ensure deterministic processing. However the question here is any chaincode write operation involving a map (PutState) that becomes part of the RW set, would Peer be constructing the endorsement proposal response in a deterministic way?
Chaincode uses json.marshal to create a byte stream that becomes the input and as per https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshal 
```
Map values encode as JSON objects. The map's key type must either be a string, an integer type, or implement encoding.TextMarshaler. The map keys are sorted and used as JSON object keys by applying the following rules,

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 16:03:49 GMT):<br/>
Chaincode must ensure deterministic value in PutState(). If the value in PutState() is deterministic, peer will package the chaincode results deterministically (obviously things like the peer signature will be different from each peer in the proposal response)

1. Map that is serialized using Json Marshal API and then passed to PutState by chaincode, would this be a deterministic endorsement proposal response?

Or if I have to rephrase the same question 

Consider the PutState value as 

map[string] int = {
   "abc" : 1, 
   "123" : 2
}

However 
 - Peer 1 serializes the map 
	map[string] int = {
	   "abc" : 1, 
	   "123" : 2
	}
	
- Peer 2 serializes the map 

	map[string] int = {
	   "123" : 1,
	   "abc" : 2	
	}

Would this be handled to create a deterministic endorsement proposal response across peer?

Note:  Please ignore the syntax error.


2. Does the order of PutState matter in constructing the Endorsement Proposal Response across peer 
Peer1 -> 
   call 1 - PutState(K1, V1)
   call 2 - PutState(K2, V2)

Peer2 -> 
   call 1 - PutState(K2, V2)

	   "abc" : 1	
	}

Would this be handled to create a deterministic endorsement proposal response across peer?

Note:  Please ignore the syntax error.


2. Does the order of PutState matter in constructing the Endorsement Proposal Response across peer 
Peer1 -> 
   call 1 at t1  - PutState(K1, V1)
   call 2 at t2 - PutState(K2, V2)

Peer2 -> 
   call 1 at t1 - PutState(K2, V2)
   call 2 at t2 - PutState(K1, V1)

Thanks for response. 
1. Map that is serialized using Json Marshal API and then passed to PutState by chaincode, would this action across peers resulting in a deterministic endorsement proposal response?

Or if I have to rephrase the same question - Consider the PutState value as 

map[string] int = {
   "abc" : 1, 
   "123" : 2
}

However 
 - Peer 1 serializes the map 
	map[string] int = {
	   "abc" : 1, 
	   "123" : 2
	}
	
- Peer 2 serializes the map 

	map[string] int = {
	   "123" : 2,
	   "abc" : 1	
	}

Would this be handled to create a deterministic endorsement proposal response across peers?

@rahulhegde 1. per the doc you provided, although maps are not ordered in Go, and although JSON spec does not guarantee an order of elements, the Go Marshal() function does sort them lexicographically. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 18 Jan 2020 03:07:49 GMT):<br/>
2. order of PutState() does not matter... peer orders the keys lexicographically when building the final read-write set.

<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Sun, 19 Jan 2020 01:44:03 GMT):<br/>
In Fabric v1.4.x, on Chaincode GetState API call, does Fabric Peer respond from its own cache or perform massaging/modification to the response before sending it to chaincode or it is just pass through?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 20 Jan 2020 01:07:08 GMT):<br/>
Pass through... chaincode GetState() will request the value from peer, peer will retrieve the value from state database and pass it back to chaincode

Hi all, is there a way to start a peer without having it's msp folder yet?
We are looking on how to automate infrastructure deployment and provisioning and we think it would be easier if we can first deploy the peer container and then provision the machine with the msp.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 15:12:14 GMT):<br/>
@braduf do you have access to the peer's file system?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 15:12:48 GMT):<br/>
if yes, then it should be straight forward to add a `time.Sleep` to the `main` of the peer and compile your own Fabric version
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 15:32:44 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thank you, we will try some things, maybe we can add a goroutine that checks for the msp when a configuration is set that says that the peer is started without msp. And when the goroutine returns a `wait` is interrupted and the peer continues booting normally...

> I am testing a disaster recovery scenario where I am restoring snapshots of a network that was live and not shut down first so there were transactions in flight and the orderers or peers are ahead. In the case where the orderers are ahead, they come up fine, but the peers are missing private data so encounter errors as they catch up from the missing blocks. I was hoping I could truncate the orderer data to bring them in line with the latest peer data to avoid issues with missing private data.

it's not currently possible to revert blocks on orderers and i don't think we should attempt to that. In case of missing private data, don't we mark those transactions invalid? cc @yacovm

Of course not @guoger otherwise it'd be non-deterministic
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 07:40:37 GMT):<br/>
if peer A has private data but peer B doesn't...
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 08:06:11 GMT):<br/>
does B keep polling A for missing data?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 08:07:10 GMT):<br/>
it will eventually give up
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 08:08:22 GMT):<br/>
also, is there a way to re-inject private data into its store? since B would find out its own signature on that tx, private data must be missing for some reason
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 08:09:06 GMT):<br/>
the peer go back and try to pull the private data for prior committed blocks
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 08:21:48 GMT):<br/>
how does private data for prior committed blocks help here?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 08:44:59 GMT):<br/>
well if you committed a block but you couldn't collect the required private data then you can collect it later in the future
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 10:32:00 GMT):<br/>
by "later in the future", do you mean after committing subsequent blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 10:36:29 GMT):<br/>
yes

I didn't change anything in the VM section of the core.yaml file. Could that be the reason and what should I verify there?

Thanks a lot in advance!

Hello, I had a question about NodeOUs, if you use them they confer roles on identities with certs matching the OU int he Node's MSP. So if you don't use them how do you confer these roles?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 11:52:15 GMT):<br/>
If you don't use them there are no such roles to distinguish peer from client from admin from orderer - each identity would simply be a 'member' of their org, and you'd have to define all roles using *.member, and identify admins using the adminscerts msp directory.

<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 16 Mar 2020 20:26:45 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart - I should have updated this before - we did find the issue in our chaincode. But this is specifically the way json.unmarshal for GO Map is implemented. GO JSON unmarshal preserves the  previous elements in the map. Chaincode having Iteration over the map with Unmarshal call resulted endorsement proposal mismatch.

For the case where there is a desire to index current world state in Lucene, is exporting CouchDb as described in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11639534/couchdb-dump-to-file-and-load-from-file reasonable, or is there some other approach suggested? This would *not* be a nightly process, and presumably normal transaction/event handling processing will keep the Lucene index current under normal conditions, but ultimately the source data is on the network, so looking for an approach. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 01:23:14 GMT):<br/>
No, I wouldn't recommend such workarounds, when there is a supported Fabric API for listening for block events as they occur, see the doc and sample:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 01:23:31 GMT):<br/>
Doc: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/peer_event_services.html
Sample: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/off_chain_data
</p>
<p><strong>dan13</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 01:30:14 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the links Dave. We have a chaincode event listener, so taking your suggestion to logical conclusion, if we did need to rebuild index from scratch to match current world state, we could replay all the blocks. That should work, but seems like it would be much less efficient than dumping just the current state. I'll read through the off chain link in detail to pick up tips there -- thanks again.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 01:34:29 GMT):<br/>
If you want to continuously index from CouchDB, the changes feed would likely be a better option than a full dump: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/changes.html
</p>
<p><strong>dan13</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 01:44:31 GMT):<br/>
Thank you, I will look into that as well!

Hello @dave.enyeart -  In our production environment, we saw unusual case. 

There was configuration block update that included CRL information only. This block was event'ed out across all the client. The problem part, It was noticed, another block that was 2 days old was also event'ed out soon after the configuration block across all the client. This (receiving old block) continued multiple times until a new block was added to the channel. We saw the same behavior across multiple channel.
Release Information: using Fabric v1.4.2 with Kafka Consensus, Java Client running on Fabric Java SDK 1.4.4

have we seen this issue or is there a way to understand why it happened

```
this happens whether mutual auth is enabled or not. what i understand by this is that during tls handshake, the orderer sends it's server cert and the peer is unable to verify that the cert is signed by a ca that it trusts. what do i need to do

Hi 
Regardless of whatever consensus mechanism we choose, the endorsement policy ( yaml based) is always going to be there in fabric??
I mean we can't have PBFT at transaction endorsement level??

hey there, why's it important to mount my /var/run/docker.sock into the peer container? my peer is unable to bring up the chaincode docker container
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Sat, 09 May 2020 14:10:07 GMT):<br/>
Peer container uses the Docker API to launch the chaincode as a docker container. 
</p>
<p><strong>tommyjay</strong> (Mon, 11 May 2020 13:04:10 GMT):<br/>
is this a security risk? for a container to have access to the host's docker.sock? the folder `/var/run` contains more than just docker configs i.e. other apps on the host's machine use this folder. if a container is compromised and it has access to `var/run` then the host is also compromised

There are metrics for commit time that you can monitor and persist. See https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/operations_service.html#metrics and https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/metrics_reference.html

Hi I've a question about endorsement certificate expiry.  I know the peers can't check certificate expiry on ledger transaction for timing reasons , however does the fabric check the expiry time in other  places. For example are the Local  MSP certificates checked when a peer or orderer starts, and does the ordererer  check the submitters cert when a transaction is received ?
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 13:40:04 GMT):<br/>
I'm not an expert in this area, but I've looked into some of this code recently (while working on the new configtx library). The MSP code (used by the peer and the orderer) does not  check the expiration of CA certificates. As far as the orderers go, based on this [doc](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/raft_configuration.html?highlight=expiration#certificate-expiration-related-authentication), it sounds like we do check for expiration of submitting certs for transactions unless you've enabled `NoExpirationChecks` as noted.

</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 14:11:34 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for that. I don't suppose you know if a peer connecting to an orderer to receive block distribution counts as a "transaction" and respects the expiry ( assume that a peer as to sends some signed message to prove its eligibility for blocks). 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 14:15:18 GMT):<br/>
I'm fairly sure the expiration is checked for peers connecting to the deliver service but let me double check...
</p>
<p><strong>rsherwood</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 14:16:42 GMT):<br/>
We are still on 1.4 so could do with a response based on that version.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 14:17:23 GMT):<br/>
Yep, it does. I see the same check for the new `NoExpirationChecks` flag in the deliver service code.
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Tue, 19 May 2020 14:17:23 GMT):<br/>
Yep, it does. I see the same check for the new `NoExpirationChecks` flag in the deliver service code so by default it ensures the cert has not yet expired before sending blocks.

Will Peer0 re-run the tx (as fetch data from state db) when validate tx on Peer0
or
There some cache to ensure the tx won't be re-run?

hello @dave.enyeart - can you confirm if there is any locking done by Peer during chaincode-2-chaincode call on another channel (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v1.4.2/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L62-L76)?

<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 15:42:55 GMT):<br/>
hello @dave.enyeart - we see chaincode-2-chaincode operation takes few 100-300 ms and Get/Put State  are between 10-20ms ms. Can you please confirm if there is any locking done by Peer during chaincode-2-chaincode call on another channel (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v1.4.2/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L62-L76) or it will be based on the endorsement processing requirement?

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 19:23:42 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde chaincode-2-chaincode across channels needs to wait for a lock on the target channel as well. if the target channel is often busy with commits, yes this could be the cause of additional delay.
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 20:04:07 GMT):<br/>
Our target channel does not have commits during that period. This is a public data channel which updates once at the start. Is there a way, i could find the delay using metrics?
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 20:04:55 GMT):<br/>
Other thing - c2c calls are not endorsement call, would they be also categorized for lock on the channel?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 12:55:48 GMT):<br/>
yes, there will still be a lock.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 12:56:35 GMT):<br/>
The best way to see where the time is spent is to turn on some peer debug. I like this debug string since it removes the most chatty messages that won't add value here:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 12:56:39 GMT):<br/>
`FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=debug:cauthdsl,policies,msp,grpc,peer.gossip.mcs,gossip,leveldbhelper=info`
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 12:57:17 GMT):<br/>
You can just send one c2c call in isolation of all other traffic, and then see in the debug log where time is spent.
</p>

Couch database rich query uses index but rich query uses $in clause. I haven't find a way to improve further execution time and this would involve record scan.

Document structure in couch database - Key = date, value = array of string = [value1, value2, ....]. 

And the Rich Query is lte = data and value $in value1 

Index is put on date. Is there a way, this can be further improved, I could not find any?

hello @dave.enyeart 

I am looking at slowness on the endorsement processing time. The client receives the response in 500-1000ms where the chainocde takes around 50ms. Looking at the peer log, i found a print 

```

GRPC duration is approximately the time taken for the endorsement by the client. Is Peer holding up the response or we need to tweak some value?

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 15 Jul 2020 14:01:45 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde you can enable debug to better understand where time is spent, e.g. this debug will show the transaction flow but suppress other chatty components: `FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=debug:cauthdsl,policies,msp,grpc,peer.gossip.mcs,gossip=info`

@rahulhegde Sorry I missed this one... definitely related to HSM since the delay is after every "Reusing existing pkcs11 session" message (you can ignore those KEEPALIVE messages since they are not in the transaction execution path).  I know that in v1.4.7 there are some HSM fixes, one of them handled bad sessions instead of leaving them in the cache.

<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 00:57:06 GMT):<br/>
No problem @dave.enyeart, thanks for the response.  This log is from Fabric v1.4.2. Are you referring to https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-17728?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 02:51:30 GMT):<br/>
@rahulhegde That was one of the HSM fixes, but I was talking about https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-17722 . Not sure if a bad session would cause such a delay though.
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 18:32:53 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart - I feel we should expect error message in the logs by use of stale session during sign operation. I was not able to find anything that confirms in Jira or commit. Do you know?
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 20:46:50 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  another topic:  Fabric v1.4.2, I see the chaincode rich query limit is been overwritten by a compulsory 1000 by the Peer. Is it done for a reason or can it be changed to retain the original value used in chaincode, because we explicitly try to set to a limit: 1.   In case of $in clause in rich query it takes time in scanning all records rather exiting after receiving the first record.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 21:46:47 GMT):<br/>
Sorry I don't know, could you follow up in a ticket?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 21:47:20 GMT):<br/>
The limit can be configured at: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v1.4.2/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L616
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 21:48:21 GMT):<br/>
This is the size of each result set returned to the chaincode. As you iterate through the results in chaincode, the next batches of 1000 will automatically be requested from CouchDB.
</p>
<p><strong>rahulhegde</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 23:58:44 GMT):<br/>
But this would overwrite all the rich queries limit to a new value.  we have queries w/o any limit set.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 02:14:09 GMT):<br/>
there should be no functional change in the chaincode, you can iterate through all the results in the chaincode, they will just be batched in sets of 1000 between the chaincode and CouchDB.

Hi everybody! I have one question about the TX flow. *At with point exactly is a block event or chaincode event received? Before the peer finishes to write into the ledger an updates the Global state otr in some point btw?* I am asking that because I have some transactions that after being confirmed, I cannot query the data immediately, needing some more time until the date is available.

Hi, I've had a number of certs expire - I've been able to work around the orderer tls certs with the time offset, but I'm unable to use the peer cli to send the transaction to the orderers because the peer signing cert has expired (the peer cli won't start and send the transaction). The peer cli will start if I update the signing certs but the transaction won't go through.

Does anyone have any pointers on how to start the peer cli with expired certs?

In addition to my question about starting the peer - I've found this https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-18175 and the comments suggest it's trivial to build a peer that doesn't check signing cert expiry. Are there any pointers available to building the peer with this setting?
</p>
<p><strong>adanacs</strong> (Fri, 08 Jan 2021 23:47:29 GMT):<br/>
ideally I want to be able to do `peer channel signconfigtx .....` with the expired admin cert, so that I can add the new current certs

<p><strong>adanacs</strong> (Fri, 08 Jan 2021 23:48:19 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>adanacs</strong> (Sat, 09 Jan 2021 01:20:29 GMT):<br/>
^^ ok -looks like I need to run the peer locally with my system time set so the original certs are valid to sign the transaction (since my network is on kubernetes), then the tlsHandshakeTimeShift flag works for submitting it with the peers with updated certs

Hi all, to enable mTLS, I was wondering if all certificate chains of all orgs should be configured again in  CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTROOTCAS or if the peer automatically enables client connections from certificates issued by the tlscacerts and/or tlsintermediatecerts of the channel MSPs? Following the explanation in core.yaml it should be dynamically, but from experience, I think I encountered problems in the past with not having certificate chains of other orgs set in the parameter... so i would like to be sure. Thanks in advance!

Hey guys
My peers are throwing the following error

```
2021-08-30 08:25:41.727 UTC [vscc] Validate -> ERRO 243 VSCC error: stateBasedValidator.Validate failed, err unexpected EOF

```
and no transaction is getting committed after that. Even chaincode is not being upgraded. This happened after block 84 and orderer shows new blocks being created (logs below) but peers are not getting new blocks now.

```
2021-08-30 07:56:43.587 UTC [orderer.consensus.etcdraft] writeBlock -> INFO 047 Writing block [98] (Raft index: 130) to ledger channel=assetschannel node=2

```

This happened after adding key-based endorsement policy in the chaincode
