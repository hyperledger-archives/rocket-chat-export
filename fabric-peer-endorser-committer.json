{"msg":"@troyronda  - Not really.  Currently all access is basically channel-scoped  by organization (and each organization has their own MSP credentials).  We don't differentiate peer organizations from client-only organizations and organizations have read and/or write access to channels (we also don't differentiate peer identities from client identities).  While we can add the concept of \"roles\" (e.g. add an attribute to certificates), without having a central authority who issues these there is really no way to ensure that a peer is really a peer and a client is really a client (i.e. if an org has it's own CA it can issue peer and client certificates as it sees fit).  Even with a central issuing authority it would have to be trusted as well but at least there would be one place that is accountable  (I guess you could still hold individual CAs accountable as well but it makes it harder to enforce proper issuance).\n\nI'll save discussion on options for locking this down more, but suffice it to say we can do things such as create separate endpoints for endorsement, gossip and possible even chaincode, leverage a combination of mutual TLS and/or roles to lock down communication on the gossip channel, etc","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-04-13T14:42:14.104Z"}

{"msg":" Hi, Can someone pls help clarify endorsement policy and how end users can approve/reject the transaction. Let's say there 2 peers for 2 different bank (Bank A and B ). Bank A initiate a transaction on chaincode X using Bank A client app. It has endorsement policy that says Bank B.Member should sign. The transaction hits endorsement peer of B, it creates R/W, validates transaction and sign of peer A. It then forwards a endorsement to client app which waits for a Bank B member to sign the transaction. Once Bank B users signs the transaction (by approve/reject on UI), its forward back to Bank B Peer which in turn sends endorsment to Bank A client app. Client A app collects endorsment and submits to orderer. Orderer orders and creates a block and sends it to commiting peer to update the state and ledger. Can someone pls confirm this is correct flow. ","username":"nhrishi","ts":"2017-04-26T19:18:19.083Z"}

I am not sure if you are really concerned with consistency vs correctness.  You get consistency guarantees wrt to the aforementioned process, but this does not of course guarantee correctness.  And yes your system could be effectively halted by a required endorsement returning variant responses, depending on your policy.  It is for this reason the N of support exist, to allow for progress in the face of inconsistent results.  Selection of the endorsements to choose is up to the requestor.

{"msg":"okay, I'm essentially trying to do a multi-party approval (M of N or N of N) process on the transaction. I can see another way is - to write user defined chaincode and manage multi-party approval process. But i thought endorsement policies are designed for the same purpose. In Multi-party approvals scenario, when users are doing \"manual\" endorsements (in financial market use cases specifically), its very likely that all transactions may not get endorsed completely in the same order as creation. I'm not really sure if we should do it as SDK level because we may have to go through endorsement process all over again. I think if we address this in the fabric itself, somehow reprocess the transaction considering endorsements are already done, that would be ideal (may be incorrect).

We think this is because it takes longer than core.yaml chaincode:startuptimeout value of 300s, and longer than the application waits. BUT notice: if we wait 10 minutes and then instantiate same exact chaincode \"mycc\" on channel2, it reuses the mycc chaincode container as expected and all invokes are successful immediately on channel2. This proves the \"mycc\" container was correctly created as a result of the first request, and the request was not cancelled after the alloted 5 minutes when the peer timed out. So... *what is the benefit of the design for using startuptimeout*? All it does is allow the fabric peer to abandon hope.

Orderer wasn't becoming a bottleneck before the peers, so we haven't focused on the orderer either (a single kafka-based orderer was sufficient). Given this, we found that:\n\n1. Seriality of channels was a bottleneck. Throughput maxes out pretty soon, before the CPU becomes a bottleneck, since the commit is currently serial. So if you can, try to have multiple channels. With more channels, peers can process more transactions, faster.\n2. CPU becomes a bottleneck when there are multiple channels. So you should have enough CPUs to handle more channels, and an overall (across channels) high load of transactions.\n3. Underlying database - leveldb is much better.\n4. Endorsement policy used - this I'm not too clear about yet, because we didn't use the N-out-of syntax, and instead used complex joins of \"AND\"s and \"OR\"s for specifying \"3 out of 4 orgs\" as the endorsement policy. One thing was clear that if the endorsement policy is complex (long), then that does affect the max throughput limit.","username":"thakkarparth007","ts":"2017-10-16T19:54:07.263Z"}

It also doesn't make sense for the peer admin account to be its own admin -- it's the admin of the peer, not itself.

Pulling - once in a while peer exchanges a digest of the blocks it has with neighbors  peers and in case it misses something it will request it\n3. State transfer - covers basically cases of the newly joined peer or peer healed from the network partitioning, it tries to find a peer with most up to date ledger to sync with it.

Am i doing something incorrect?\n\nThanks.","username":"rahulhegde","ts":"2017-12-07T21:59:52.886Z"}

{"msg":"So, I installed and instantiated a chaincode on 4 peers (2 each for 2 orgs). All is well with the default Endorsement Policy. Invokes write and read data. I installed and instantiated the same chaincode (different name, same channel) on all 4 peers, but with a Policy of 1 Org1.member AND 1 Org2.member. All good and I see the lscc and init record in CouchDB on all 4 peers. However invokes do not write. I get an Error -  VSCC check failed, policy evaluation failed, err Failed to authenticate policy.

After i installed the same chaincode without any problem i could not instantinate it (CC is already exist). So i removed the cc's containers and deleted the cc's images and the CCs from the peers (/var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/<ccname>:<ccversion>). There was no problem installing them again on all peer on the other hand they've still existed in the channel.

What exactly does committer check except signature validations ?\n\nthe mostly validator checks 2 things:\n1) compliance of the transaction with the endorsement policy: that basically entails signature checks and policy checks\n2) concurrency control checks: the writes in the read-write set are applied only if all variables that were read at simulation time haven't changed since - this is a check over versions.

{"msg":"hey guys, grown a little rusty on my Fabric knowledge so here's an elementary question.  If I instantiate a cc with an `AND` endorsement policy, wouldn't the proposal need to target all of the relevant peers specified in the policy.  And wouldn't this result in a container starting for each of the targeted peers?  Or is `invoke` the only time when the call needs to go to all of the peers in the EP?

{"msg":"The origin of the question is from when I ran through BYFN for the first time in six months or so yesterday.  I did all the manual steps and everything worked until invoke, because the endorsement policy is `\"AND ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer')\"` and the documentation doesn't explicitly tell you to install the cc on the second org's peer.

{"msg":"@nickgaski I haven't looked into it much lately so my knowledge may be outdated on this but I'd guess it's because in Fabric there's an instantiation policy in addition to an endorsement policy.

The chaincode we are using has been around a while and apparently had never been had an \"AND\" policy set on it.  Internally the chaincode was generating an event time and adding it to the write set.  So once we required more than 1 endorsement each peer generated a different write set, there was just no good way to see that it was the issue in the logs. I was able to confirm it was a read/write mismatch in the node app by using channel.compareProposalResponseResults(proposalResponses).  I was also able to find a JIRA issue, https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14145, that pointed me in the write direction and talks about the poor log messages.

I do agree that our samples should include these calls such that users are aware they exist and why/why not they might use them.\n\nWhen it comes to the higher level programming model, I think we should automatically do the `compareProposalResponseResults`  since we are already wrapping the lower level API","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2019-11-27T09:13:46.250Z"}

Following the explanation in core.yaml it should be dynamically, but from experience, I think I encountered problems in the past with not having certificate chains of other orgs set in the parameter... so i would like to be sure.
