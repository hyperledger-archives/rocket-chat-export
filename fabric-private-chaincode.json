{"msg":"However, there are some twists when you run it inside the dev container: The easy hurdles are that you will have to manually apt install the packages `psmisc` (some scripts use `killall`) and `docker-compose` (not by default installed but obviously needed).  The more tricky one is that there are some scripts (build of fpc cc via cc-builder, run of frontend) which do call docker with volume mounts.  However, as the docker daemon runs _outside_ of the dev components, the daemon looks for the paths at the wrong place, on the outside and not in the dev container!!! Iff you have the same outside paths like inside, i.e., fpc in `/project/src/github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-private-chaincode`) then it might work (but in a hacky way).  Given that this code was done by Shweta and afaik she did use the dev container i wonder how exactly she had setup the container.

The team came to the conclusion that, Fabric Private Chaincode currently does not yet support the chaincode upgrade operation. The issue you are posting here, though, is not related to FPC but certainly related to some lifecycle policy. Note that for FPC, upgrading private chaincode is challenging as it requires to create a new enclave and provision it with the correspnding cryptographic material to continue working with existing world state for that chaincode. Please feel free to create a feature request on our github for FPC chaincode upgrade. This way we can better plan and put this feature on our roadmap.
